Processed_A_Radar-Based_Hail_Climatology_of_Australia.txt,"ABSTRACT: In Australia, hailstorms present considerable public safety and economic risks, where they are considered the most damaging natural hazard in terms of annual insured losses. Despite these impacts, the current climatological distribution of hailfall across the continent is still comparatively poorly understood. This study aims to supplement previous national hail climatologies, such as those based on environmental proxies or satellite radiometer data, with more direct radar-based hail observations. The heterogeneous and incomplete nature of the Australian radar network complicates this task and prompts the introduction of some novel methodological elements. We introduce an empirical correction technique to account for hail reflectivity biases at C-band, derived by comparing overlapping C- and S-band observations. Furthermore, we demonstrate how object-based hail swath analysis may be used to produce resolution-invariant hail frequencies, and describe an interpolation method used to create a spatially continuous hail climatology. The Maximum Estimated Size of Hail (MESH) parameter is then applied to a mixture of over fifty operational radars in the Australian radar archive, resulting in the first nationwide, radar-based hail climatology. The spatiotemporal distribution of hailstorms is examined, including their physical characteristics, seasonal and diurnal frequency, and regional variations of such properties across the continent."
Processed_A_Radar-Based_Hail_Climatology_of_Australia.txt,"Hailstorms account for a substantial portion of financial impacts caused by natural hazards globally, resulting in greater than 10 billion USD in insured losses annually in the United States alone (Gunturi and Tippett 2017). In Aus- tralia, hail is typically considered the most costly natural hazard in terms of insured losses, exceeding the combined losses of both bushfires and floods (Schuster et al. 2006; McAneney et al. 2019). Several of the country’s most populous cities have experienced hailstorms that resulted in over 1 billion AUD in losses, including Melbourne in the south (Buckley et al. 2010; Allen 2012), Perth on the west coast (Buckley et al. 2010), and most frequently Bris- bane and Sydney on the east coast (Soderholm et al. 2019; Schuster et al. 2006). Financial losses also appear to be increasing alongside an expansion of the built environment (Changnon et al. 2009), and as of 2019 in Australia, seven of the ten most damaging events occurred in the past decade (adjusted for inflation, Eichner 2019). The significance of these financial impacts underscores the need to quantify the current level of hail hazard in the region."

(2023) addresses these concerns in an Australian context by train- ing their proxy on Australian hail reports, and allowing their formulation to vary latitudinally, which more accu- rately characterized hail environments across the country. However, the accuracy of this approach is limited by the representativeness of the underlying hail report data set, which is affected by the aforementioned biases involving population density and reporting practices. Moreover, hail proxies are known to suffer from the “initiation problem”, whereby only a small fraction of hail-prone environments (often less than 10%, Taszarek et al. 2020) actually un- dergo convective initiation (Tippett et al. 2015). This issue ultimately leads to large uncertainties regarding the true cli- matological frequency of hailfall. In an Australian context, this problem spuriously highlights a spatial hail frequency maximum over the ocean on the east coast (e.g., Prein and Holland 2018). These oceanic overestimations likely stem from an absence of known convection trigger mechanisms for the region, such as sea-breeze or topographic inter- actions (Soderholm et al. 2017b). Raupach et al. (2023) demonstrated that incorporating a series of additional en- vironmental constraints could successfully reduce the false alarm rate for Australian hailstorms, improving the Crit- ical Success Index (CSI) to ∼0.3 when compared to hail reports."
Processed_Australia_Telescope_Search_for_Cosmic_Microwave_Ba.txt,"ABSTRACT In an attempt to detect cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy on arcmin scales, we have made an 8.7-GHz image of a sky region with a resolution of two arcmin and high surface brightness sensitivity using the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) in an ultra-compact conﬁguration. The foreground discrete-source confusion was estimated from observations with higher resolution at the same frequency and in a scaled array at a lower frequency. Following the subtraction of the foreground confusion, the ﬁeld shows no features in excess of the instrument noise. This limits the CMB anisotropy ﬂat-band power to Qf lat < 23.6 µK with 95 per cent conﬁdence; the ATCA ﬁlter function∗ Fl in multipole l-space peaks at lef f = 4700 and has half maximum values at l = 3350 and 6050."
Processed_Australia_Telescope_Search_for_Cosmic_Microwave_Ba.txt,"Primary CMB anisotropies at small angular scales (l > ∼ 500) are expected to be relatively damped in most struc- ture formation models owing to the the thickness of the last scattering surface and the diﬀusion damping of sub-horizon scale baryon ﬂuctuations in the pre-recombination epoch. However, ﬂat-band powers comparable to the Qf lat detected by COBE DMR (Bennett et al. 1996) may be predicted at multipoles l > 500 in certain cosmological-constant (Λ) and ∼ open-universe manifestations of baryon isocurvature mod- els (Hu & Sugiyama 1994; Hu, Bunn & Sugiyama 1995). The anisotropy power at large l may be critically dependent on the reionization history: small-scale anisotropies may be suppressed by early reionization."

The observing scheme and data analysis procedures determine the window function Fl for any experiment. The implications of any observed CMB temperature variance (∆T )2 may be quoted in fairly model independent terms by the inferred Qf lat. This Qf lat may be viewed as being a measure of the CMB anisotropy power spectral density within the l-space window deﬁned by Fl.
Processed_Australia_Telescope_Search_for_Cosmic_Microwave_Ba.txt,"Secondary anisotropies may be generated at the later last-scattering-surface in a reionized universe predominantly owing to second-order mode coupling between density per- turbations and bulk velocities (the ‘Vishniac eﬀect’); this could signiﬁcantly contribute to arcmin-scale (l > 103) ∼ anisotropies particularly if the ionization fraction is high at late times (Hu, Scott & Silk 1994). Persi et al. (1995) esti- mate that this second-order Doppler eﬀect may contribute a 103 in CDM and CDM+Λ band power Qf lat universes and that the anisotropy power may be an order of magnitude higher in certain baryon isocurvature models."

The S-Z anisotropies are generically non-Gaussian and are expected to have phase-correlations between dif- ferent l modes; their statistical description requires higher- order correlations apart from the Cl power spectra. Hot gas in groups and clusters in scale-invariant CDM universes nor- malized to give σ8 = 1 (the magnitude of dynamical cluster- ing at the present time is quantiﬁed by σ8 which is the rms mass ﬂuctuations in 8h−1-Mpc spheres) is expected to con- 103 (Bond & tribute band powers Qf lat Myers 1996). In COBE-normalized tilted CDM, MDM and models in which the shape factor Γ = Ω◦h is approximately 0.2, the predicted σ8 agrees better with galaxy clustering and in these models the band powers at large l are 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller. The dominant contribution at high l may come from quasar-ionized hot gas bubbles (Aghanim et al. 1996), whose existence is based on plausible theoretical inferences."

If the 4.7-GHz images are made with the same sensi- tivity to point-source ﬂux density as the 8.7-GHz images, the lower-frequency images that are made with the same angular resolution would be less sensitive to CMB temper- ature ﬂuctuations by a factor (4.7/8.7)α, where α = 2 is the spectral index of the CMB anisotropy at these frequen- cies. However, the 4.7-GHz images would have a relatively greater sensitivity to extended synchrotron emission by a factor (4.7/8.7)α, where α < 0.7 is now the steep spectral ∼ − index of extended synchrotron sources.

The number of sources (3) detected with ﬂux density exceeding 100 µJy – that constitute the model for confusion in the ﬁeld – and their combined ﬂux density, are also a factor of two larger than expected.

Processed_ATLBS:_the_Australia_Telescope_Low-brightness_Surv.txt,"ABSTRACT We present a radio survey carried out with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. A motivation for the survey was to make a complete inventory of the diﬀuse emission components as a step towards a study of the cosmic evolution in radio source structure and the contribution from radio-mode feedback on galaxy evolution. The Australia Telescope low-brightness survey (ATLBS) at 1388 MHz covers 8.42 deg2 of the sky in an observing mode designed to yield images with exceptional surface brightness sensitivity and low confusion. The survey was carried out in two adjacent regions on the sky centred at RA: 00h 35m 00s, DEC: −67◦ 00′ 00′′ and RA: 00h 59m 17s, DEC: −67◦ 00′ 00′′ (J2000.0). The ATLBS radio images, made with 0.08 mJy beam−1 rms noise and 50′′ beam, detect a total of 1094 sources with peak ﬂux exceeding 0.4 mJy beam−1. The ATLBS source counts were corrected for blending, noise bias, resolution, and primary beam attenuation; the normalized diﬀerential source counts are consistent with no upturn down to 0.6 mJy. The percentage integrated polarization Π0 was computed after corrections for the polarization bias in integrated polarized intensity; Π0 shows an increasing trend with decreasing ﬂux density. Simultaneous visibility measurements made with longer baselines yielded images, with 5′′ beam, of compact components in sources detected in the survey. The observations provide a measurement of the complexity and diﬀuse emission associated with mJy and sub-mJy radio sources. 10% of the ATLBS sources have more than half of their ﬂux density in extended emission and the fractional ﬂux in diﬀuse components does not appear to vary with ﬂux density, although the percentage of sources that have complex structure increases with ﬂux density. The observations are consistent with a transition in the nature of extended radio sources from FR-ii radio source morphology, which dominates the mJy population, to FR-i structure at sub-mJy ﬂux density."

Processed_ATLBS:_the_Australia_Telescope_Low-brightness_Surv.txt,"The normalized diﬀerential radio source counts are ob- served to show an upturn below ﬂux density of about 1 mJy (Windhorst et al. 2005) indicating a rapid increase in the number of faint sources at these ﬂux density levels, which might constitute a new population. The bulk of these faint radio sources in the 0.1–1 mJy range in ﬂux density are iden- tiﬁed with early type galaxies (Mainieri et al. 2008), with radio structure believed to be of the FR-i (Fanaroﬀ & Riley 1974) type (Padovani et al. 2007), which often have associ- ated extended emission components. Therefore a complete census of the radio emission associated with faint galaxies, at these ﬂux density levels and at intermediate redshifts of z = 1–2, requires imaging with good surface brightness sen- sitivity. Additionally, the radio morphology of the relatively lower surface brightness extended emission is a clue to the nature of the radio source and is a means of distinguishing between active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of diﬀerent classes."

In this context, it is important to quantify the expec- tations for radio source confusion from both compact and extended radio source components at faint ﬂux density lev- els as this is a potential limitation to imaging with sub-µJy sensitivity.

At frequencies below about 1 GHz, elements form- ing interferometer telesopes often have poorly deﬁned ﬁelds of view (primary beams), relatively larger sidelobe levels, and confusion arising from radio sources limits the attain- able dynamic range. Additionally, the ionosphere introduces time-varying phase errors that are diﬃcult to calibrate and correct. The available bandwidth is also limited at low fre- quencies. For these reasons, the optimum frequency for deep surveys with high surface brightness over moderate sky areas is perhaps around 1 GHz today, and might move to lower fre- quencies as technology and calibration algorithms relevant for wide-ﬁeld imaging at low radio frequencies improve."

Most 2D Fourier synthesis imaging arrays like, for example, the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Giant Me- trewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) have array conﬁgurations optimized for imaging performance in snap-shot mode and in cases where most of the sky region imaged is empty. The deconvolution algorithms implemented in software packages used in processing the data from such arrays also implicitly assume that most of the sky is empty.

Together, they provide 4 × 10 = 40 baselines and because the ATCA antennas are 22 m in diameter, the 40 spacings provide a nearly complete coverage over the 0– 750 m range. At the 750-m baseline, Earth rotation would move the visibility measurement point through a spatial wavelength corresponding to the antenna diameter in about 7 min. Therefore, the observing strategy was to mosaic im- age 19 distinct antenna pointing positions during a single observing session of 12 hr, cycling through all the pointing positions and observing each for 20 sec so that all the 19 po- sitions would be re-visited once every 7 min.

To avoid shadowing at the shortest 30-m baseline, the ◦ ﬁeld centres had to be south of −50 declination. On the other hand, since follow-up optical observing with existing southern telescopes are important for the science goals, low declinations were preferred so that optical observing could be through low airmass. Since the ATCA is located at a latitude of −30◦, regions at very high southern declinations were avoided so that the survey might be made at reason- ably high telescope elevations, avoiding problems that might arise from ground spillover in the antenna radiation pattern.

Simula- tions using the visibility coverage used to construct the high resolution images and taking into consideration the chan- nel bandwidth corresponding to the observations suggest a worst case attenuation of source peaks to 0.8 of their true value in the high resolution images.

Successive peaks—including positive and negative peaks—were located, ﬁtted with Gaussian compo- nents and subtracted until the absolute value of the peak residual was below a threshold of 0.5 mJy beam−1. Thus, the listed values of integrated ﬂux densities in the high res- olution images is an estimate of the total ﬂux density in compact components exceeding 0.5 mJy; in case the peak within the source ’footprint’ is less than 0.5 mJy then the listed integrated ﬂux density is simply the peak ﬂux density.

This economic incentive, which extends from fuel savings into the opportunity for concurrent operations without additional crew costs, and longer operation times, has driven the development of increasingly sophisticated autonomous vessels.

Trust is also supported by history of successful use – i.e., if a technology has been in use for one hundred years, there is a good understanding of the risks of failure and the results. Familiarity is another component of trust- if a technology has widespread usage and is visible in the media, trust will be engendered.

In these circumstances industry-led projects to develop codes of practice or other regulatory content are vital, as they provide a baseline level of requirement to ensure safety among early- adopters, provide the Government or applicable regulator with a starting point for learning about the technology and then developing an appropriate regulatory approach, and they provide a level of confidence for members of the public."

The total cost to the Australian economy runs into billions of dollars annually. In 2016, 85% of transplants involved a kidney coming from a deceased person, whilst only 15% of transplants came from a living donor. Whilst there has been considerable focus in the literature of late on increasing the supply of organs by developing mechanisms for paired exachange, only 2.5% of these living donations came from paired exchange.

Unlike traditional resource allocation problems [3], one of the fundamental fea- tures of the deceased organ matching problem is that it is online. We do not know when organs will arrive to be match. And we must match and transplant them shortly after they arrive, before we know what organs or patients will arrive in the future. At the end of the year, we could ﬁnd an optimal allocation. However, we do not have the luxury of waiting till the end of the year as organs must be transplanted immediately. There are many other domains where resources are allocated in a similar online manner. A food bank might start allocating and distributing food to charities soon after it is do- nated [4]. An airport must start allocating landing slots before all demands are known. A particle accelerator might start allocating beam time before all requests have come in. An university might allocate rooms to students for the current term, not knowing what rooms might be wanted in future terms. This work offers a case study in how we can efﬁciently and fairly solve such online allocation problems. We study axiomatic prop- erties of such online fair division problems, as well as run experiments on real world organ data [5].

Processed_An_Australia_telescope_survey_for_CMB_anisotropies.txt,"ABSTRACT We have surveyed six distinct ‘empty ﬁelds’ using the Australia Telescope Compact Ar- ray in an ultra-compact conﬁguration with the aim of imaging, with a high brightness sensitivity, any arcmin-scale brightness-temperature anisotropies in the background radio sky. The six well-separated regions were observed at a frequency of 8.7 GHz and the survey regions were limited by the ATCA primary beams which have a full width at half maximum of 6 arcmin at this frequency; all ﬁelds were observed with a resolution of 2 arcmin and an rms thermal noise of 24 µJy beam−1. After subtracting foreground confusion detected in higher resolution images of the ﬁelds, residual ﬂuctu- ations in Stokes I images are consistent with the expectations from thermal noise and weaker (unidentiﬁed) foreground sources; the Stokes Q and U images are consistent with expectations from thermal noise."

Processed_An_Australia_telescope_survey_for_CMB_anisotropies.txt,"Today, we are fairly conﬁdent that the large scale struc- ture grew out of primordial seed perturbations by gravita- tional instabilites in a dark matter dominated universe. The physics that dominates the coupling between matter inho- mogeneities and the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation anisotropies is diﬀerent on diﬀerent angular scales and the multifarious coupling mechanisms are believed to result in a complicated spectrum of radiation anisotropies (see, for example, Hu, Sugiyama & Silk 1996 for a recent review)."
Processed_An_Australia_telescope_survey_for_CMB_anisotropies.txt,"The power in the CMB anisotropy spectrum towards small angular scales is expected to be strongly damped: the spectral cutoﬀ may constrain the ionization history of the primordial gas and mechanisms for reionization (Dodelson & Jubas 1995). Reionization may erase primary anisotropies on small angular scale; however, via the ‘Vishniac eﬀect’, reion- ization may generate secondary ﬂuctuations of signiﬁcant magnitude (Hu, Scott & Silk 1994). Gravitational lensing by large-scale structure may also transfer anisotropy power from larger to smaller scales enhancing the amplitude of pri- mary anisotropies at small scales (Metcalf & Silk 1997). The time dependence of the gravitational potential during late non-linear structure formation may imprint anisotopies on the CMB via the ‘Rees-Sciama eﬀect’ and this may be the dominant anisotropy on sub-arcminute scales (Seljak 1996). Another plausible source for small-angular-scale anisotropy is the Sunyaev-Zeldovich eﬀect in the relativistic plasma co- coons of radio galaxies (Yamada, Sugiyama & Silk 1999). Anisotropies in the CMB on arcmin scales could also pro- vide a powerful constraint on any cosmological magnetic ﬁeld (Subramanian & Barrow 1998)."

Processed_An_Australia_telescope_survey_for_CMB_anisotropies.txt,"The secondary anisotropies result from interactions in the post-recombination era and during non-linear struc- ture formation. An important eﬀect here is the Sunyaev- Zeldovich (S-Z) scattering of the CMB as it encounters hot gas in the deep potential wells of clusters of galaxies (see Birkinshaw 1998 for a recent review). The expectations for the CMB anisotropy arising from this eﬀect are diﬃcult to compute, and depend on the abundances of dark matter halos with cluster masses that are formed at diﬀerent cos- mic epochs, and the processes by which the gas accumu- lates in these potential wells and is heated. Nevertheless, using models for the evolution of the intracluster medium and estimates of the abundances of cluster potentials from the Press-Schechter formalism or self-similar evolutionary models, distribution functions have been derived for the S- Z sources and these have been used to estimate the CMB anisotropies in diﬀerent cosmological models and scenarios for the evolution of the gas (Bartlett & Silk 1994; Marke- vitch et al. 1994). Blind surveys for S-Z clusters are expected to provide valuable inputs to our understanding of the late stages of structure formation."
Processed_An_Australia_telescope_survey_for_CMB_anisotropies.txt,"A deep radio survey with the VLA in an HST medium deep survey ﬁeld does appear to have detected a radio decre- ment (Richards et al. 1997); independently, a Ryle-telescope observation towards a pair of quasars has also shown a ‘hole’ in the radio sky (Jones et al. 1997). In both cases, follow-up in the optical and X-ray bands have not revealed any cluster in these directions. Because the Compton y parameter which determines the magnitude of any S-Z decrement towards a hot-gas cluster is distance independent, the S-Z ﬂux den- sity (the integrated decrement) may be observable to higher redshifts as compared to the optical/X-ray luminosities. The absence of luminous counterparts in other bands indicates that any clusters that may be responsible for the decrements via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich eﬀect should be at moderately high redshifts: the existence of collapsed massive structures at early epochs deﬁes conventional wisdom (Bartlett, Blan- chard & Barbosa 1998) and has led to alternate hypotheses for microwave decrements (Natarajan & Sigurdsson 1999). In 1990, we commenced a programme to search for arcmin-scale anisotropies with the Australia Telescope Com- pact Array (referred to as the ATCA experiment). The ﬁrst results based on a deep survey of a single ﬁeld were reported in Subrahmanyan et al. (1993); the sensitivity was improved with further observations using improved receivers and the derived upper limits were reported in Subrahmanyan et al. (1998). We have now used the Australia Telescope to im- prove the sky area covered and imaged six independent sky regions with high brightness temperature sensitivity. Our goal was to make a blind search for any ‘holes’ in the mi- crowave sky apart from deriving estimates of the arcmin scale CMB anisotropy in total intensity and polarization. In this paper, we present these observations."

In this conﬁguration, observations at declinations lower than −50◦ would be shadowed in some hour angles and shadowing results in spurious correlations in the baseline pairs involv- ing antennae whose projected areas overlap. The brightness sensitivity in the observations would progressively decrease for ﬁelds at higher declinations because of the increase in projected baselines at large hour angles. The 22-m antennae cannot be placed on stations closer than 30.6 m; therefore, we have made all observations in ﬁelds located about −50◦ in declination so that the projected spacings between adja- cent antennae would be close to the shadowing limit of 22 m over a large range of hour angles.

The anisotropy variance, which is ex- pected in any diﬀerential measurement of the sky brightness temperature, and is made with an l-space window function of octave width, will be about l(l +1)Cl; therefore, the CMB anisotropy spectrum is usually a plot of l(l + 1)Cl versus l. As discussed earlier, the anisotropy power due to primary anisotropies is expected to cut oﬀ at small angles and con- sequently on arcmin scales, the expected variance in most experimental eﬀorts may be expected to be lower if the eﬀec- tive beam is smaller. There have been estimates of the CMB anisotropy spectrum arising from the decrements due to the thermal S-Z eﬀect in a cosmological distribution of clusters containing hot gas; the resulting l(l + 1)Cl is fairly ﬂat in the l-space regime corresponding to arcmin scales (Molnar 1998)."

The position of the negative peak, which was seen in the residual B1 image, should now be 1.8 arcmin from the new ﬁeld centre.

All AT20G sources have total intensity and polarisation mea- sured at 20 GHz, and most sources south of declination −15◦ also have near-simultaneous ﬂux-density measurements at 5 and 8 GHz.

Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"Abstract. The traditional cultures of Aboriginal Australians include a signiﬁcant astronomical component, which is usually reported in terms of songs or stories associated with stars and constellations. Here we argue that the astronomical components extend further, and include a search for meaning in the sky, beyond simply mirroring the earth-bound understanding. In particular, we have found that traditional Aboriginal cultures include a deep understanding of the motion of objects in the sky, and that this knowledge was used for practical purposes such as constructing calendars. We also present evidence that traditional Aboriginal Australians made careful records and measurements of cyclical phenomena, and paid careful attention to unexpected phenomena such as eclipses and meteorite impacts."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"Before the British occupation of Australia, there were an estimated 400 diﬀerent Abo- riginal cultures. Each had its own language, stories, and beliefs, although most were centred on the idea that the world was created in the “Dreaming” by ancestral spirits, whose presence can still be seen both on the land and in the sky. These ancestral spirits taught humans how to live, and left a user guide to life in their songs and stories. Many of these stories are reﬂected in the patterns in the sky. This is reﬂected in existing lit- erature on Australian Aboriginal Astronomy, which tends to focus on stories associated with constellations, but with little emphasis on the deep intellectual context in which meaning is sought for astronomical phenomena."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"The 50,000 year-old Aboriginal cultures are believed to be the oldest continuous cul- tures in the world, and since the night sky seems to play an important role in them, it is sometimes suggested (e.g. Haynes 1992) that Aboriginal Australians were the world’s ﬁrst astronomers. But the word “astronomy” implies more than just stories – it means a quest to understand the patterns in the sky, and the motion and eclipses of the Sun, Moon, and planets. The goal of our research project is to understand the importance of Astronomy in Aboriginal Cultures, and explore the depth of traditional Aboriginal astronomical knowledge."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"The project has two key components. In some parts of Australia, such as Arnhem Land in the north of Australia, Aboriginal cultures are ﬂourishing. For example, Yolngu people still maintain traditional aspects of their lifestyle, and continue to conduct initiation ceremonies, in which traditional knowledge is passed from generation to generation. The ﬁrst thread of the project aims to record their stories and ceremonies, and as much of the astronomical lore as might be told to an uninitiated white person."

For example, the Aboriginal people around Sydney were decimated by introduced disease, exclusion from food and water, and deliberate genocide. In these regions, little is known of the original culture of the Aboriginal people, but we can study it by examining their art and artefacts. Thus the second thread of the project focuses on surveying and recording the rock engravings of the Sydney basin region and the stone arrangements of Victoria."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"Aboriginal astronomy was ﬁrst described by Stanbridge (1857), and subsequent im- portant works include those by Mountford (1976), Haynes (1992), Johnson (1998), and Cairns & Harney (2003). Most of these works focus on how objects in the night sky represent events or characters in Dreaming stories, and only touch brieﬂy on practical applications or on interpretation of the motion of the sky."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"For example, the European constellation of Orion is called Djulpan in the Yolngu language. The three stars in Orion’s belt are three brothers who were blown into the sky by the Sun after one of them broke a taboo by eating a king-ﬁsh, which was his totem animal Wells (1973). They are seated in a canoe, with Betelgeuse marking the front of the canoe, and Rigel the back of the canoe. The Orion nebula is the ﬁsh, and the stars of Orion’s sword are the line still attached to the ﬁsh (Fig. 2 - Left). Diﬀerent stories about Orion are found in other Aboriginal cultures, but are often associated with young men, particularly those who are hunting or ﬁshing (e.g. Massola 1968)."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"Similarly, many groups across Australia (e.g. Massola 1968, Harney 1959) tell how the Pleiades are a group of sisters chased by the young men in Orion, which is very similar to the traditional European myth about these constellations. Although this similarity between Aboriginal and European stories suggests early cultural contact between Abo- riginal and European people, it is unlikely that such contact took place. It is more likely that the Aboriginal people independently devised the stories in a sort of cultural conver- gent evolution, perhaps reﬂecting the fact that the massive bright stars of Orion follow the beautiful little cluster of the Pleiades as the sky rotates."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"An impediment to this study is the misinformation permeating the literature, dat- ing from an era when racial stereotypes were widespread even amongst academics. For example, Blake (1981) states categorically “No Australian Aboriginal language has a word for a number higher than four” and this belief is still widely encountered. However, complex Aboriginal number systems have been well-documented in the literature (e.g. McRoberts 1990, Tully 1997), and Blake’s statement appears to reﬂect a widely-held post-colonial attitude to Aboriginal people which was widespread ﬁfty years ago but is now fortunately waning. However, such ingrained attitudes state equally misleadingly that Aboriginal people “don’t measure things”, and so would not be interested in or capable of careful astronomical measurements. Rather than relying on such assertions, this project concentrates on exploring the available evidence."

Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"This raises the question of whether traditional Aboriginal people regarded the Earth as being ﬂat, in which case the Moon would need to tunnel under the Earth, or whether they regarded the Earth as being a ﬁnite body which the Sun might pass underneath. Warner (1937) was told by a traditional Yolngu man that “the Sun goes clear around the world”, and who illustrated this “by putting his hand over a box and under it and around again”."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"The Yolngu people call the Moon Ngalindi and he too travels across the sky. Originally, he was a fat lazy man (corresponding to the full Moon) for which he was punished by his wives, who chopped bits oﬀ him with their axes, producing the waning Moon (Wells 1964, Hulley 1996). He managed to escape by climbing a tall tree to follow the Sun, but was mortally wounded, and died (the new Moon). After remaining dead for three days, he rose again, growing round and fat (the waxing Moon), until, after two weeks his wives attacked him again. The cycle continues to repeat every month. Until Ngalindi ﬁrst died, everyone on Earth was immortal, but he cursed humans and animals so that only he could return to life. For everyone else, death would thereafter be ﬁnal."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"But the Arnhem Land stories go much further, even explaining why the Moon is associated with tides, and in particular why Spring tides are associated with the Full Moon and the New Moon. When the tides are high, water ﬁlls the Moon as it rises. As the water runs out of the Moon, the tides fall, leaving the Moon empty for three days. Then the tide rises once more, reﬁlling the Moon. So, although the mechanics are a little unclear, the Yolngu people clearly had an excellent understanding of the motions of the Moon, and its relationship to the tides."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"The Warlpiri people explain a solar eclipse as being the Sun-woman being hidden by the Moon-man as he makes love to her. On the other hand, a lunar eclipse is caused when the Moon-man is chased by the Sun-woman who is pursuing him, and eventually catches-up. These two stories demonstrate an understanding that eclipses were caused by the paths of the Sun and Moon across the sky, occasionally intersecting (Johnson 1998, Warner 1937). This realisation is found in several other language groups. For example, Bates (1944) recounted how, during the solar eclipse of 1922, the Wirangu people told her that the eclipse was caused by the Sun and Moon “becoming husband and wife together”. These stories of eclipses are remarkable for two reasons. First, solar eclipses are rare, and a total solar eclipse is seen in any one location only once every three or four gen- erations. So for any group to have an explanation of solar eclipses implies a remarkable continuity of learning. For this myth to have been created, someone must have seen an eclipse, related it to a story passed to them from several generations previously, and then strengthened and retold it for someone a few generations later."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"Secondly, to relate a lunar eclipse to the paths of the Sun and Moon implies a re- markable intellectual feat of visualisation of their motion. At a lunar eclipse, the Sun, Earth, and Moon are in a line, with the Earth between the Sun and the Moon. It is an impressive intellectual feat, given that the Sun and Moon are diametrically opposed, to reason that it is precisely this alignment which has caused the eclipse."

Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"Aboriginal calendars tend to be more complex than European calendars, and those in the north of Australia are often based on six seasons. Some Aboriginal groups mark them in terms of the stars which appear during these seasons. For example, the Pitjantjatjara people say that the rising of the Pleiades in the dawn sky in May heralds the start of winter (Clarke 2003). Perhaps even more importantly, the heliacal rising of a star or con- stellation can tell people when it’s time to move to a new food source. For example, when the Mallee-fowl constellation (Lyra) appears in March, the Boorong people of Victoria know that the Mallee-fowl are about to build their nests, and when Lyra disappears in October, the eggs are laid and are ready to be collected (Stanbridge 1857). Similarly, the appearance of Scorpius told Yolngu people that the Macassan (Indonesian) ﬁsherman would soon arrive to ﬁsh for Trepang."

Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"In an important “Morning Star Ceremony”, earthly Yolngu people communicate with their ancestors living on Baralku, the island of the dead, with the help of Banumbirr together with a “Morning Star Pole”. The ceremony starts at dusk and continues through the night, reaching a climax when Banumbirr rises a few hours before dawn. She is said to trail a faint rope behind her along which messages are sent, and which prevents her from ever moving away from the Sun. This faint line in the sky is probably zodiacal light, which is caused by extraterrestrial dust in the plane of the solar system."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"The Morning Star ceremony tells us two important things. One is that Yolngu people observed that Venus never strays far from the Sun, which they explain in terms of the rope binding Venus to the island. The other is that the Morning-Star ceremony has to be planned well in advance, since Venus rises before dawn only at certain times of the year, which vary from year to year. So the Yolngu people also track the complex motion of Venus well enough to predict when to hold the Morning Star Ceremony."

However, from an astronomical perspective this story must be faulty, since the appearance of Venus as an evening star does not occur at a particular time of year, but varies across the seasons, rendering it useless for this purpose. This puzzle was solved when one of us (Norris 2008) was told the story by the traditional custodian of this story, Mathulu Munyarryun. The Evening Star in this context is not Venus, but the star Spica, which does indeed set just after the Sun at the time of year when rakai nuts are ready for harvesting."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"Amongst the Dreaming stories of various Aboriginal groups, there are many diﬀerent views of comets and meteors. In a universe that seems ordered and predictable, transient events such as comets and meteors were often seen with fear and apprehension. As a result, comets and meteors are frequently associated with omens, death, and evil. The Tiwi of Bathurst and Melville Islands (Mountford 1958) and the Kuninjku of Arnhem Land (Taylor 1996) saw meteors as the ﬁery eyes of evil spirit beings who raced across the sky, hunting for the souls of the sick and dying. When children from the Ooldea Region of South Australia saw a meteor (which they called a “devil-devil”), they would chant “Kandanga daruarungu manangga gilbanga” which means “star falling at night time go back! ” (Harney & Elkin 1949). The Ngarrindjeri of South Australia told of a being named Kulda who would manifest as a meteor emerging from the Southern Cross, warning the people of a disease epidemic. This led the people to shout, “peika baki”, meaning “death is coming” (Tindale 1933/34). The arrival of the Great Comet of 1843 caused fear among the Ngarrindjeri and was seen as a harbinger of calamity (Eyre 1845). These views are shared by peoples throughout the world (e.g. Frazer 1930, Hamacher & Norris 2009)."
Processed_The_Astronomy_of_Aboriginal_Australia.txt,"Occasionally, one of these falling stars actually crashes to earth. There are many Abo- riginal stories that describe such an event, including the Arrernte story about the creation of Tnorala, or Gosse’s Bluﬀ, an impact crater created nearly 150 million years ago. In the Dreaming, a group of sky-women took the form of stars and danced in the Milky Way. One of the women grew tired and placed her baby in a wooden basket, called a turna. As the women continued dancing, the turna fell over the edge and plunged to earth. The baby fell and was covered by the turna. The impact forced the rocks upward, forming the walls of the circular structure. The baby’s mother, the evening star, and father, the morning star, continue to search for their baby to this day (Cauchi 2003, Williams 2004). A Yolngu story from Arnhem Land tells of Goorda, a lonely ﬁre spirit that lived in the Southern Cross, who came to earth as a meteor to bring ﬁre to the people. Upon touching the ground near the Gainmaui River, he accidentally caused massive ﬁres that brought death and destruction to the people (Allen 1975). Various Dreaming stories from across Australia tell about falling stars that bring ﬁre to the earth (e.g. Peck 1933, Berndt & Berndt 1988, Jones 1989). Perhaps some of these stories record meteorite falls and cosmic impacts that remain unknown to Western science? Hopefully, further research will tell."

Second, although the stones of the circle are large and immovable, the outliers are small and could have been moved. Third, besides the outliers indicating the solstices and equinox, there is an additional outlier whose signiﬁcance is unclear. The best way to address these doubts would be to ﬁnd another site with astronomical alignments. Other stone arrangements in Victoria also indicate the cardinal points, from which we may conclude that the local Aboriginal people knew these directions with some precision, presumably by observing celestial bodies.

Wong, mm inter- ferometry is much more challenging than cm interferom- etry, as a result of more stringent technical requirements (e.g. surface accuracy, pointing, and baseline determina- tion) and the strongly variable eﬀects of the atmosphere. In particular, ﬂuctuations in the H2O vapour layer lead to ﬂuctuations in atmospheric opacity and observed inter- ferometric phase that must be monitored with frequent calibrations. These ﬂuctuations tend to be more severe in the daytime and in summer, so winter nights are expected to oﬀer the best observing conditions. As the ﬂuctuations occur on a range of size scales, longer baselines will suﬀer from greater atmospheric phase noise under the same ob- serving conditions. Long-baseline experiments also suﬀer from a lack of absolute ﬂux calibrators, since the planets, which are the best primary ﬂux calibrators, are likely to be resolved out."

Processed_Millimetre_Science_with_the_Upgraded_Australia_Tel.txt,"While almost all of the gas in molecular clouds consists of H2 and He, these species do not emit radiation under conditions typically found in molecular clouds. Except in rare cases where H2 absorption against a UV source can be measured, the amount of molecular gas must be inferred indirectly. A common technique is to observe emission lines from tracer molecules like CO that have millimetre or submillimetre rotational transitions. Not only can these lines provide information on the distribution and velocity of the molecular gas, but diﬀerent molecular tracers can be used to probe diﬀerent density regimes within a cloud. The ATCA’s ability to study nearby molecular clouds is limited by its small ﬁeld of view, lack of sensitivity to extended structure, and inability to observe the bright CO(1–0) line at 115 GHz (this last constraint may be overcome in a future upgrade). Thus, studies of the frag- mentation of molecular clouds into clumps and cores (cf. Williams et al. 2000) are best undertaken with other in- struments. Better suited to the ATCA will be studies of more distant clouds, such as in the Galactic Centre and Magellanic Clouds, and studies of dense molecular cores where star formation is occurring or likely to occur."

Processed_Millimetre_Science_with_the_Upgraded_Australia_Tel.txt,"Single-dish mapping of molecular gas in the vicinity of the Galactic Centre Radio Arc has revealed that it is phys- ically related to the ionised gas in this region as well as to the radio non-thermal ﬁlaments (NTFs). Recently, in- terferometric studies made with OVRO reveal a complex geometrical arrangement and kinematic structure in the molecular gas (Lang, Goss & Morris 2002, submitted). The associations between the ionised and molecular gas suggest that the action of energetic winds from young stel- lar clusters (such as the Arches cluster) plays an impor- tant role in this region. The NTFs are thought to trace a large-scale, poloidal ﬁeld normal to the Galactic plane in the inner 250 pc of the Galaxy. The interfaces between the NTFs and molecular clouds may be sites where twist- ing and reversal of magnetic ﬁeld lines occurs, followed by magnetic reconnection which accelerates the electrons to relativistic speeds (e.g., Serabyn & Morris 1994).

Processed_Millimetre_Science_with_the_Upgraded_Australia_Tel.txt,"An important consequence of C-shocks discussed by M. Wardle at the meeting is the eﬃcient production of H2O from atomic oxygen (O → OH → H2O). This can give rise to intense water maser emission at 22 GHz and at submil- limetre wavelengths (Kaufman & Neufeld 1996). Within supernova remnants (SNRs), a strong X-ray ﬂux releases high-energy electrons which can excite the Lyman and Werner bands of H2.

An important obser- vational input is the mass surface density of the disk, which can be crudely estimated from the mass and radius. In the early stages of accretion, when the disk is massive, gravi- tational instabilities dominate and can lead to spiral arm formation or disk fragmentation—which can in turn lead to binary or giant planet formation. In later stages, most of the mass has accreted to the centre, the disk rotation is nearly Keplerian, and accretion is driven by turbulent viscosity."

In addition, the presence of a cold, static envelope outside the collapse region leads to a self-absorption feature near the systemic velocity. Examples of line proﬁles that match these pre- dictions are given in studies by Gregersen et al. (1997) of embedded YSO’s and Lee et al. (1999) of starless cores.

The commonly em- ployed molecular tracer CO, for instance, may be depleted even when H2 remains in the gas phase. Such “freeze-out” is especially likely near the disk midplane, where densi- ties are highest. Where CO is detectable, it is likely to be optically thick and trace only the disk’s outer layers; observing rarer CO isotopes, such as 13CO (110.2 GHz) and C18O (109.8 GHz), will be crucial for probing the vertical structure of disks.

The reason for this depletion could be a combination of photodissociation and freeze- out onto grains. In addition, at temperatures above 20 K, the J = 2 and higher levels of CO are preferentially pop- ulated compared to J = 1, and the CO(1–0) line is thus relatively weak (Liseau & Artymowicz 1998). Indeed, the disk around the nearby T Tauri star TW Hya has been de- tected more strongly in the higher J transitions (Kastner et al. 1997), with no CO(1–0) detected at Mopra (upper limit ∼0.3 K in a 30′′ beam).

Although the formation of inverted populations (“pumping”) that can lead to masing remains an area of ongoing investiga- tion, Class II transitions are thought to be pumped radia- tively by infrared photons from the warm dust surrounding young massive stars. While the IR photons produce the population inversion, bright masers are the result of high methanol abundance, together with beaming and/or am- pliﬁcation of the UCHII background continuum. Sobolev & Deguchi (1994) and Sobolev et al. (1997b) have mod- eled these processes in detail to reproduce the high ob- served brightness temperatures of the 6.7 and 12.2 GHz masers. Strong masing is found to occur for dust temper- atures Td > 150 K, gas densities 106 < nH [cm−3] < 108, and methanol abundances relative to H2 of > 10−7.

The H2O maser ﬂux also appears to lag behind the optical ﬂux, by about 0.05–0.35P in RS Virginis (Lekht et al. 2001). Such a large phase lag appears to rule out ra- diative pumping; instead, it is proposed that the arrival of a periodic shock into the masing region leads to enhanced collisional pumping of the maser (Rudnitskij & Chuprikov 1990). Consistent with this hypothesis is the presence of a peak in the cross-correlation function at a lag of 3–5P (where P ≈ 1 yr), roughly the time for a shock to travel from the stellar surface to the region where masers can form (R ≈ 1014 cm). Shock pumping is also suggested for the H2O maser ﬂare in R Leo that was observed ∼18 months after an Hα ﬂare (Esipov et al. 1999). Although the H2O and SiO maser spots are expected to be unre- solved by the ATCA, it was noted that if they are suﬃ- ciently bright and appear at distinct velocities, then their relative positions can be determined to a fraction of a beam (Plambeck et al. 1990; see §3.6)."

In light of BIMA maps of the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068 which show that most of the HCN is concen- trated towards the centre, whereas CO and star formation are located in a ring ∼1 kpc in radius (Helfer & Blitz 1995), this suggests that much of the HCN emission in NGC 4945 comes from more diﬀuse gas associated with the dusty torus in the inner ∼10 pc, whereas in Circinus it is associated with star-forming cores in the ∼500-pc-radius molecular ring.

Yet another problem is choosing the observing frequency in the absence of a reli- able optical redshift (for either the background source or the absorber). Lacking redshift information, it should still be possible to scan across the 3mm band in a reasonable amount of time (e.g., Wiklind & Combes 1996), particu- larly once the ATCA’s bandwidth has been upgraded."

By pro- viding accurate redshifts for submillimetre sources, they would signiﬁcantly improve our knowledge of the evolu- tion of massive galaxies and of the star formation rate. In addition, by observing multiple transitions of the same molecule and deriving the excitation temperature, one can place upper limits on the CMB temperature as a function of redshift."
