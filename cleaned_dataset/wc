        "text": "THE DIVERSITY ENIGMA by Tim Flannery photo photo photo One aspect of Australias diversity has puzzled me how do infertile places, like Western Australias heathlands and the Great Barrier Reef, support such an abundance of life I have long been fascinatted by the diversity of life on Earth, and the reasons why some environments support a greater number of species than others. An important factor in determining the number of species an environment can support is its productivity. Every environment has a characteristic rate of formation through photosynthesis of new plant material, which fuels the web of life within that environment. If the rate is high, the environment is said to be productive, and there is a widespread belief that such environments are home to a greater number of species than those resourcepoor environments where productivity is low. Although this hypothesis makes intuitive sense, ecologists are now questioning it. Indeed, some have pinpointed reasons suggesting that the reverse is or should be the norm. This article examines the relationship between productivity and diversity in three very different Australasian environments the heathlands of southwestern Western Australia, the Great Barrier Reef, and the rainforests of New Guinea. photo caption The heathlands of southwestern Western Australia support some of the most diverse and spectacular plant communities on Earth. The entire southwestern corner of Western Australia supports 10,00012,000 species of plants, with the number of species per square kilometre rivalling those found in the richest rainforests. Most of the worlds banksias, sundews Drosera, and all of its dryandras, to mention only a few, are found in this small region of Australia. Yet it is remarkable that the bulk of these species comes from relatively few families, such as the Proteaceae, the family containing species of Banksia, Dryandra, Grevillea and others. Thus many species of rather similar plants coexist. This is all the more surprising as the landscape of the southwest is, superficially at least, rather monotonous. Most of the area is covered by highly infertile sandsheets, and there are few mountain ranges or sharp topographic features to provide microhabitats that might facilitate speciation. Subtle differences in soil type do, however, support different plant communities. Many species in the region possess unusual adaptations to extreme soil infertility. The Western Australian Christmas Tree Nuytsia floribunda is a treesized mistletoe that gains nutrients by parasitising the roots of grasses and other plants. The carnivorous plants are particularly abundant. They represent well over half of all the carnivorous species found in Australia and two out of our seven genera, as well as the majority of two others, are found only in this small area. More than half the worlds species of sundews Drosera are endemic, as is the Western Australian Pitcher Plant Cephalotus follicularis, which is placed in its own family. Furthermore the bladderwort genus Polypompholyx is entirely restricted to the region as is one of the two rainbow plants genus Byblis. All of these plants have turned to carnivory to meet their nutrient needs they obtain nitrates and phosphates from insects, and they speak eloquently of the harsh constraints that the infertile soils of Western Australia places upon the flora. They add emphasis to the question of how so many different plant species could have evolved and come to coexist in such an infertile environment. Could the answer be in the very poverty of the environment itself David Tilman of the Department of Ecology, University of Minnesota, suggested in 1982 that, in environments where nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates are in plentiful supply, those species that are best at utilising these nutrients can outcompete all similar species. A prime example of such a species is ourselves. In areas where nitrates, photo caption phosphates, water and soil abound, we can destroy almost all other species through intensive agriculture, reducing the environment to a monoculture. In less productive areas, such as those used for grazing, our ability to destroy the species competing with us is less, although with modern technology we are improving that ability. In the most unproductive environments, humans are reduced to just another species among the multitudes, if they can exist at all. Tilman referred to such species as superspecies, but this term is already in established use in taxonomy where it has quite a different meaning. Perhaps the term exterminator species is more appropriate for, although emotive and used in other contexts, it does adequately describe their effect. Humans are just one exterminator species among many, and Tilman argues that it is only where exterminator species are excluded that many species can coexist. They do this by becoming specialists, exploiting subtle differences in the levels of critical resources such as water and nutrients in different areas. Thus, in the Western Australian heathlands, one species of Banksia may be able to survive in runoff areas where more nutrients are available than elsewhere. Another may survive in sand at the foot of dunes where water may accumulate. Yet another may caption survive in barren interdune areas because it can exist on very few nutrients. Because of the complex interplay of soils, nutrient levels and water availability, many combinations of resource availability are possible in a nutrientpoor landscape, leading to the evolution of many specialist species. One further aspect of Australias heathland has long puzzled me, and that is the spectacular heathland flowers, some of which are present throughout the year, and most of which drip with nectar. It seems anomalous that such apparent waste of effort should occur in such infertile areas. However, I think I have found a convincing explanation as to why this is so. Because of the diversity of plant species in the heathlands, the nearest potential sexual partner of any individual plant may be a long way off. This means that pollinators, such as insects, mammals and honeyeaters, must be used for effective pollination. Yet in a nutrientpoor environment such organisms, particularly the warmblooded ones, are likely to be scarce. Thus competition exists between plants for these few pollinators. It takes fewer nutrients for a plant to make nectar, than it does to produce new leaves. This is because only water, air and sunlight are needed to make sugar, while nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates are essential for the production of new plant tissue. Thus, where nutrients are limited, it makes sense for a heathland plant to have blooms that produce lots of nectar to outcompete its fellows for the attentions of the rare pollinators. This is because its ability to produce nectar is not as tightly constrained by low soil fertility. The presence of abundant nectar alone, however, may not increase the abundance of most pollinators. Their numbers in most cases may not be restricted by the amount of nectar but rather by protein, because most species need some proteinrich food such as insects in order to survive. And the number of insects present is probably limited by low soil primary productivity due to poor soils. The process can perhaps best be thought of as an arms race a literal war of the roses, where flower power wins the day. Some species avoid the arms race by flowering at times of the year when few caption photo other blooms are around, providing a continuous food supply to the pollinators. Thus in a seeming paradox, these very nutrientpoor soils that heaths grow on support an abundance of plant species with the most luxurious flowers. Upon these feed specialised pollinators, including the tiny ten grams Honeypossum Tarsipes rostratus, which is the only nonflying vertebrate to depend totally upon flowers for its food. So rich in nectar and pollen are the heaths of southwestern Australia that a Honeypossum can virtually feed every day of the year and, for much of the time, find its food requirements from an area of no more than 40 square metres. And all of this because the environment is so nutrientpoor A somewhat different example of great diversity is provided by the Great Barrier Reef. Coral organisms are animals that support photosynthetic algae inside their bodies. Such a strategy is most likely to have evolved in a very nutrientpoor situation, the ancestors of coral animals being unable to find enough food by themselves, and taking advantage of a relationship with plants to supplement their food supply. The relationship remains useful, for coral reefs grow only in the most nutrientpoor warm waters. The reefs provide a home for an enormous diversity of fishes, and it is interesting that the nutrients present in a coral reef environment are cycled through the living animals of the reef very rapidly, with very little loss. Thus a small amount of nutrient is made to go a long way. Unfortunately, the toorapid removal of parts of the system such as large fishes can have disastrous effects. Today, the relatively small commercial and recreational fisheries on the Great Barrier Reef are having a profound impact as predators, algal grazers and other types of fishes are removed from the environment. What happens if we enrich such a system We do not need to guess, for we are carrying out an immense experiment. Queensland sugar cane growers fertilise their fields with large quantities of nitrates and phosphates. During the wet season much of these are washed down rivers and into the sea, eventually finding their way onto the nearer parts of the reef. In consequence, a monoculture of algae takes over from the wonderful reef diversity, much in the way that people and their agriculture take over from heathland with an application of superphosphate. Although Tilmans hypothesis seems to work well for plants, and perhaps coldblooded creatures such as fish, there are difficulties in applying it to the larger, warmblooded creatures such as mammals. This is because these animals have high energy requirements and, in resourcepoor environments, there might be not enough resources for them to survive at all. Biologists from the CSIRO studying treedwelling marsupials mostly possum species in the eucalypt forests around Eden have found that 52 per cent of the forests contain no treedwelling mammals at all, and that 63 per cent of the treedwelling fauna is found in just nine per cent of the forests. They hypothesise that much of the forest is simply too nutrientpoor to support treedwelling marsupials, and that only the forests growing on better soils support large populations. In this case, however, matters are complicated by the eucalypts propensity to manufacture toxins when they grow on poorer soils. The eucalypts that grow on more fertile soil respond to the presence of leafeating possums simply by growing new leaves as the old ones are eaten. Eucalypts that grow on nutrientpoor soils, however, cannot do this because the lack of nutrients limits their growth. Instead they produce carbonbased toxins, especially tannins and phenolics, for much the same energetic reasons that the heathland plants produce nectar that is, they are cheap to produce, and are thus a less expensive way of dealing with leaf loss than by simply growing new leaves. The tannins and phenolics work by disrupting the acid balance in the digestive systems of the leafeaters, preventing them from digesting their food. Despite the fact that the most resourcepoor environments may have insufficient resources to support mammals, it may still be that environments with moderate resources might support more species than those with abundant resources, because of Tilmans proposed exterminator species effect. It is difficult caption photo to carry out comparisons of mammal communities in resourcerich and resourcepoor environments in Australia because of extinctions almost a third of Australian mammals have become extinct since humans arrived here and because of the fact that our few resourcerich environments have been so dramatically altered by Europeans. A better place for such comparisons would be the highlands of New Guinea, where very few to date only seven mammal extinctions have been documented over the past 40,000 years, and the highest diversities of Australian mammals up to 120 species in a small area occur. In particular, the areas of western and central New Guinea offer ideal comparisons because, while they are roughly similar in size and still harbour substantial areas of upland rainforest, they differ markedly in their soils."

        "text": "Ten Such is the ferocious garden growth of summer, Cairo asks Cec will he work an extra day each week to keep pace with the weeds. Now its school holidays, Clementine visits her school friend who also lives on the southside of the river. At Beths there is always summer thunder, always too far away. They spend their evenings with binoculars, watching the way bits of leg and body writhe across the drivein screen late at night when the Rrated films are showing. When Mrs Anderson comes in with snacks for them and asks what on earth they are doing, they answer innocently enough counting the ratio of sheet lightning to fork. Or, sometimes, they wander with pikelets spread with the cheap tinned jams Mrs Anderson buys, down the back to where Mr Anderson works. He is a sadseeming man and is it any wonder, Clementine thinks, whenever they stand watching him carve out dead names onto curves of marble. He often works past midnight under the warm night skies, ever anxious on behalf of the dead persons relatives to have the job complete. Mosquitoes can eat him alive and he doesnt appear to mind or notice. Or, in the daytime, Beth will lead Clementine to the corner shop for provisions and then into the bucket seats of her fathers sevenyearold Ford Falcon. Beth lies in the front, Clementine in the back. Her father parks it beneath an old camphor laurel so that there are always leaves to look up into. They lie on the black upholstery, silently imagining men so big beside them that limps would have to poke out the little triangle windows that whistle when the car is being driven. The two girls eat sweets there that come in rolls of cellophane. Made in America, says the very small writing. Tart Talks reads the much bigger lettering not because they are slightly sour, but because they are girl sweeties, always pink or pastelcoloured. With these, and the loose, twoforonecent Conversation Candies, Beth and Clementine construct weirdsounding, doubleweighted conversations. Camphor laurel berries rattle on the roof of the car. They lie there until all the sweets are gone, converstaions and titillations over, and become envious of each other in different ways. Clementine envies her friend her normal name Elizabeth that can be so conventionally shortened. Beth is in love with her friends skin, which is so brown and smooth and lean it makes her own look like porridge, she says. Nettles and nightshades grow in Beths garden and monster paspalums, threading through abandoned chips of marble and cement. Some kinds of marble are as ivory and smooth as old piano keys or wedding satin. Mrs Anderson does have her rose circle. Clementine knows she can always make her own mother laugh and exclaim when she comes home from Beths with tales of gardening peculiarities greater than their own. The Gummers are also busy in their garden, tidying and reshaping. Inspired by British topiary, Bunny has urged Dr Gummer into reshaping some of their old conifers. The one by the front door is meant to be some kind of ceremonial ball but ends up mushroomshaped. By Christmas Day, its regrowth is exploding into Clementines view like an atomic bomb going off. Lesser projects have been attempted and abandoned halfformed kangaroos in croton bushes. Christmas day is stinking hot. Alexandras peppermint creams, made to her deluxe recipe with slices of fresh mint, melt the moment she takes them from the fridge. They taste nice enough though. She offers them to the Gummers, who are sharing the Youngs Christmas lunch. Patrick arrived three days earlier in his Holden station wagon. He will stay with his brother until he finds a house to rent. Nobody knows what to do with their sticky fingers. Patrick licks his clean. Sky wipes hers on the back of her dress and Dr Gummer takes a large and immaculate handkerchief from his pocket. The girls are all in new dresses, of similar design and pattern. Their mother is going to extraordinary lengths to make the lunch table beautiful and no one is helping. Only Lettie keeps getting in the way. Cairo has planted candlesticks in wet sand in crystal bowls. She decorates the sand with small fresh flowers that are dead by the time Ventrys begun to carve the turkey. You look lovely, Grandma. Sky hovers around the faded finery of Letties dress. Thank you. And so do you. Can we sit next to each other at the table Of course we can. Lettie holds her granddaughters hand and moves around the table looking for their place names. Look, Mummys already put us together. The names are written in gold, in Cairos lavish hand, and have been laid into trails of maidenhair ferns. See the Christmas lights in the bunya pine Clementine says to Patrick when they are all seated at the table. Away from Coogee he looks more ordinary, more like his brother, but that is possibly only because his ponytail has been lost in deference to his brothers prejudices. The pink roses. Like Christmas lights. We think so anyway. They always come out for Christmas. They look dotted line papery, Patrick replies, dazed by the heat and the hot green look of the river and the town on the otherside of it to which he has, it seems to him now, so rashly committed himself. He has arrived not at some exotic end of the earth but in a conservative tail end of New South Wales. Nobody will visit me, he panics, and wishes himself anywhere but in the midst of a family of girls, his brother far from friendly alongside. Some more leg for you, Patrick Ventry offers. To the new arts officer. Cairo is lifting her glass at him. Go steady. Charlie doesnt join in the toast. Leave some turkey for the growing girls. He is feeling neglected by Cairo and wondering what he can do to remedy this. Rose and champagnecoloured jellies sit on silver platters at either end of the table. Patrick holds one up to the sun. What on earth Cairo Scented basil jellies. I found the recipe on a mail order seed pack. How unusual, says Charlie, who has seen them before at Cairos parties. Patrick keeps his held to the light. Sun jewels, he says and feels a sudden lifting of his heart. How ever did you get such delicate colours Cochineal Bunny Gummer guesses, but nobody takes any notice. Liquorice basils make the pinkier hues and the other is made with the leaves of holy basil. No cochineal at all, Bettina. Holy basil, laughs Sky in an imitation of Batman. What a beautiful idea. Patrick picks up his teaspoon, Can I have a taste Of course. Its savoury. Meant to go with the turkey and salads. Cairo spoons him some. It glistens and trembles beside his turkey and everyone is watching as he takes a taste on the end of his knife. Not allowed to lick your knife, Sky grins at him, already won over. Delicate Patrick smiles in such a way nobody is quite sure whether he means the jelly or the youngest daughter. He has a theatrical air rarely seen in most country towns. Everyone at the table except his brother, and Ventry who is oblivious, is already half in love with his boyishness and lazy eyes. Ventry casts his wife glances that hold more than affection. Cairos fennel in the salad will make him burp terribly later on but it doesnt really matter. And the man who has put her into such a good mood isnt at all as bad as hed imagined. Patrick Gummer looks quite respectable. And hes kind, helping Cairos mother and Sky to some more of the white meat they like best. Ventry begins to tell Patrick the story of how he once made all his girls go to church in jodhpurs before racing off to a show. Before Clementine grew so musical, he adds. Ooh, its lovely to have a bit of fowl, Lettie is saying. Then, Whats your name again Patrick. Paddy the Irishman Only a long time ago. Can see it in you though. Lovely blue eyes you and your brother both have. Patrick begins Clementine. The whole family is clamouring for the newcomers attention or Patrick would have told how one of his eyes is glass. Mr Gummer, you mean, corrects Ventry. No. He hates being called that, dont you Clementine squints her eyes at Patrick to avoid seeing the top of the atomic bomb topiary behind his head. Wouldnt answer to anything else. Im not a doctor. He shoots a bland grin over to his brother. Dont tell me you have to call him Doctor, do you Hows the flute playing going Charlie Gummer swallows his anger down with cool white wine. Clementine answers very well thank you, hating the stilted, uneasy sound of this expression that Cairo taught her is a suitable response for most questions. She eats cherries nervously to fend off any more personal questions. Sweetheart, dont steal all the cherries. Her mothers voice has a sudden and unexpected pitch of exasperation so that Clementine knows she cant expect her mother to elaborate her fluting achievements to date. Oh, she plays beautifully, Bunny says. We love to hear her practising in the afternoons. Dont we, Charlie Dr Gummer acts as though he hasnt heard the question. Clementines fingers fray away her serviette. Patrick But her voice trails away. Although his ponytail has gone he doesnt look like he belongs in this town. He is laughing now at how Bellini has found his toes to lick. She thinks youre a puppy. Clementine bends under the table to watch. Cairos irrational judgements of people which depend on how friendly her dogs are towards them have been taken a step further by Clementine. She assesses visitors by Bellinis reaction to their taste. She thinks youre delicious The dogs tongue laps up the rivulets of sweat under Patricks knee. Its those pongy old sandals you wear, suggests Charlie, and feels reassured when Cairo and Ventry both seem amused. What sort of dogs are they exactly Pig dogs No, say all the daughters. Staffordshire Bull Terriers. Sensual, isnt it Patrick laughs too as the licking continues. Oooahh, you can do that to me all day, puppy. Shes not the puppy, Sky tells him. Figgy, Fig, she calls over the real puppy and puts him in her lap. See how lovely he is Patrick leans over the table to pat him. His heads like a camera case, he says. Same shape. Ive always liked dogs. Charlie went in for the guinea pigs. Me too. Ive always been a dog lover, Clementine confides, because she has never seen Bellini lick a strangers legs so lovingly. I used to bark at the dogs, didnt I, Dad When I was a little girl Yes, you did. Ventry laughs and feels in need of a sleep. And is embarrassed when the mother dog begins to lick her puppys penis and Charlie makes a fellatio joke. By the time Bunnys annual and awful boiled fruit cake has been brought out, all the adults appear to be drunk. Cairo laughs a lot and slices the cake in a reckless way. It is so hot now the sand around the candles dries out and one by one the candles, which looked strange alight in the day, topple over. Timber, calls out Charles Gummer each time. Lettie wishes hed stop. It was the word her dead husband used to call out just before ejaculation. Something to do with his timbercutting past, Lettie always thought, or the way hed wield the axe in the woodchops at the show. Cairo, on her way to opening another bottle, is so worried to see her mother looking pained and frail that she stops for a moment to rest her fingers on the crepy skin of her mothers neck. The swell of weeds from the vacant lands beneath their house is momentarily overwhelming."

SYDNEY. 2001 Dear Sir, In the Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday 3rd September NRMA advertisements espousing the Yes option of the float and shares proposal states that During September youll receive a Proxy Voting Paper. WHY are we to receive a proxy voting paper Why are we not receiving a normal Postal Vote paper as is the case with normal voting procedure Will there be a CLEAR explanation of the difference between a directed proxy vote and an open proxy vote I am bewildered as to why a proxy vote has been chosen as the means for people to register their vote. Also in the same newspaper on the next page was another advertisement which I felt was misleading. If you dont act you wont get any shares is not quite true If I act and cast my vote regardless of what that vote is and 5l of 75 of the membership decide they do not want the NRMA to be turned into a listed company, I will not get any shares. On the contrary, if I do not act and 5l of the 75 of the membership of the NRMA vote to list the company, then according to earlier information given out by the Directors because I was a member of the NRMA as at the 16th March, 1994 then I will receive shares. Why this misconception Is this scare tactics to frighten us all into voting Yours sincerely, Mrs Diane Masland Memb. No. 1893906 S. D. Masland 43 Rickard Road, UNANDERRA. N.S.W. 2526 Australia.

Some questions which were not answered and clarification of some other problems which I ask you to answer for me Is the ONLY reason for the proposed change to convert members indirect, inaccessible stake in NRMA into a direct, financial stake Were other avenues of sharing the wealth investigated If so what were the alternatives and why were they rejected Your letter mentions that the float would enable NRMA membersdotted lineto share the organisations wealth without eroding the NRMAs capital which cash giveaway would do. Is it not possible to continue to pursue the 64 Objects laid down in the Memorandum of Association without eroding capital The original brochure states the NRMA already make profits that are accumulating because we cant share them with members these ongoing profits should be used to better the lot of ALL Australian motorists including us members without giving FINANCIAL gain to individuals WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE INTENT of the founders of the N.R.M.A.. How do you reconcile this proposal to give me a financial stake in the N.R.M.A. with the possibility of CASH bonuses andor cash for the sale my shares with the definite instruction in the Memorandum of Association paragraph 4 that no person will profit by their membership Have you explained clearly to members that the issuing of shares brings with it not only potential profit, but potential loss What will each shareholders liability be in case the company collapses Is it limited to 10 as it is under the existing structure Will these concerns been explained to ALL members together with the tax and pension implications in the prospectus What provision is being made for all those motorists who will join the NRMA from 6th March, 1994 Will share be kept in reserve specifically or will they have to buy shares from other members If, as your letter suggests, these shares will be so keenly guarded by members, this may be impossible. Will you please explain to me the meaning of the phrase Currently, NRMAs profits are locked up used in answer to L.G. Normans letter Can NRMAs profits currently be used for expansion of services and upgrading of equipment Your letter says that special permission was granted by the Australian Securities Commission to enable the proposed float to be openly debated. Why is the Board of Directors not giving full information on BOTH sides of the question Why is it depending entirely on members to write in to newspapers or the Open Road in the hope that their letters will be published, with the further hope that ALL members will read these letters Surely it behoves responsible leadership to fully inform members before asking for them to vote on such an important issue. What shortterm or longterm gains do the members of the current Board of Directors see for themselves in this proposal The original brochure when answering the question How will the NRMA be different as a listed company states only the ownership structure will change. In you letter to me you say that it is not the ownership of the NRMA that is under review. Could you explain that to me please Currently the members own the NRMA, even with a 5 limit on share holdings it is quite possible that future owners of the NRMA will not be members therefore destroying the theory that the share holders will always have the interests of the members at heart. Will share holders always be members, will all members always be shareholders With the freedom to trade shares this must be impossible to predict. Can you see my concern Were you able to give copies of my letter to each of the Directors as I requested Yours sincerely, Mrs Diane Masland. Memb. No. 1893906 S. D. Masland, 43 Rickard Road, UNANDERRA. N.S.W. 2526 Australia. Phone 042713526 July 27, 1994 Memb No. 1893906 Chief Executive Officer, N.R.M.A., Locked Bag 1994 G.P.O. SYDNEY. 2001 PLEASE GIVE A COPY OF THIS LETTER TO EACH OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS Dear Sir, I am very disappointed in the onesided approach which has been taken in giving members of the N.R.M.A. information about the proposed floating of the N.R.M.A. and herein give my own responses with some additional questions to which I would appreciate specific answers to the brochure which was posted to me NRMA SHARE THE FUTURE. Why is NRMA considering this change If it isnt broken dont fix it The NRMA has a proven record in high quality, low cost service to its members. You please read those who compiled this brochure where I use the word you state we want to change the structure to give access to that wealth to our members. This can be done equally efficiently, through a similar consultativevoting process, without opening opportunities for individuals to increase their control or vested interest in the organization. Has NRMA looked at other ways of sharing its wealth Here only one other option is mentioned. What other options were considered Why were each of these options rejected There are many ways in which this wealth could be used to benefit members Reduce membership fees increase the insurance rebates on ALL insurance policies held through NRMA and its subsidiaries continue to improve level of road service, particularly wait times and country services. These would take many years to erode the wealth which is locked up, but would benefit ALL members instantly and continually. OR ways to help the community could be considered driver and pedestrian education more money spent on research into accident prevention and in training drivers in better driving techniques grants to country shires and councils to upgrade roads or driver facilities such as rest stops. information centers etc. do as one member suggested in a letter to the Sydney Morning Herald, set up trust funds to encourage Australian research, science and enterprise. Some of these suggestions would require amendments to the Articles or constitution or whatever, but as this current advertising promotion is proving would not be an impossible achievement. But how will the new proposal actually share the wealth Yes, you are appealing to the minicapitalist in each of us, we would all be instantly wealthier in convertible assets and that is the main danger of this exercise shares are commodities to be bought and sold, members can sell them realizing a one of return, other members can buy them thus gaining more benefit over time, both financial and in influence over the company THE NRMA WILL GO FROM BEING A MUTUAL ORGANIZATION OF EQUAL MEMBERS to just another listed company on the stock exchange to be haggled over for profit and prestige, and the interests of the individual member will be of less importance that the financial interests of the share holders. How can NRMA afford to give away 2 billion In your printed answer to this question you have specified the very reason for concern sharesdotted line can be sold to others Will my shares affect my pension or my tax liability Is it realistic to expect the current Federal Government to make new rules to apply only to holders of NRMA shares If it does, there is no guarantee that the next government will not revere any special legislation.Rather than expect the Federal Government, Taxation Department and Social Security Department to alter their rules to suit the NRMA would it not be wiser, simpler and fairer on the rest of Australians for the NRMA to alter its own rules and regulations so that this excess money can be spent or allocated according to the wishes of the majority of current members Why will shares only be given to those who were members as at March 16 this year While agreeing that there had to be a cut off point, if the proposal does go ahead, what provision is being made for all those motorists who will join the NRMA from that date Will shares be kept in reserve specifically or will they have to buy shares What will the vote in October decide I shudder to think Surely this matter should be dealt with in similar fashion to a government referendum with equal time, space, money, exposure being spent on BOTH SIDES of the argument. How can members make an informed choice when the bulk of information is so rosily slanted to the lets do it choice This is unprofessional and unethical. And I am bitterly disappointed in the Board for allowing this bias. What shortterm or longterm gains do the members of the current Board of Directors see for themselves in this proposal Are they going to make immediate gain, or are they just better at playing the stock market than the average person How do you suggest I vote If the majority of those Directors who were present at the meeting where this proposal was passed were NOT in favour, then we wouldnt be at this stage of confusion. This is faintly tainted with dishonesty, people trust those whom they have put in power and will follow their lead. It is up to the integrity of the Directors to GIVE MEMBERS ALL DETAILS of both sides of this proposal. How will NRMA be different as a listed company In my view this is the granddaddy of the deceptive answers. THE OWNERSHIP SHOULD NOT CHANGE. Please answer this question for me Who owns the NRMA now To my understanding, I own it along with every other member.So in reality everything about the NRMA could change with listing. The owners will not necessarily be members, members will not necessarily be owners. The main aim of the company will be to make profits whether or not this entails providing road service. In fact, looking at the recent changes that have been implemented in giving road service i.e. limits on the number of calls which will be answered free of charge for a particular car, makes me think that if this is the least profit generating operation of the NRMA, it will gradually be phased out. Big earners like insurance will continue to grow. Under the proposal will all members of the NRMA always be share holders"

        "text": "CONFIDENTIAL To Dennis Hepburn 11 November, 1994 From Ian Chesterfield cc VMcC Subject Hong Kong Update The simpler we think, the more complex it becomes, however we are working through it. A complication I mentioned is the ongoing warranty obligations of BFP HK Ltd., particularly in the area of transit mixers. Also, we have the question of staff until and beyond 31 Dec 1994 and potential transit mixer business between now and then and thereafter. We have not changed the intent of the ongoing business, but until we can assess the real potential, I have decided to retain the Sales Manager Ricky through into I dont get carried away with huge transit mixer business just because the political game has got around to signing the Agreements. Work had been going on for at least the last 2 years but there will be ongoing potential of at least 30 sets through 1995 which is around HK8M. We shouldnt pass it up until we have had Vaughan and Arthur check it out. That will happen in December they will both be in HK as you pass through. If we see the potential, we need Ricky if we dont keep Ricky now we wont have him in December so Ive kept him. He is aware of the change in the business and the narrow focus and that if it doesnt pay he doesnt stay He understands the challenge. When Vaughan is in HK with Arthur, he will be meeting not only our 2 specific transit mixer builders, but their customers the users. We will be looking to determine whether there is customer service talent we can train at our cost if needs be to make them service self sufficient and educated to specify Eaton Trasmital. We can take the training to them in HK or bring them to Sydney. We have also had talks with Rheem in Brisbane and Zicom, their associate in Singapore who see good things in Hong Kong over the next 2 years. We can work this end in part from Brisbane. So our start up crew in Hong Kong will be Ricky Sales Manager Janice Administration Henry Stores Service Another advantage of retaining Ricky is that he is a polytechnic graduate and has excellent English if someone has to talk to Tony Bush Ricky can do it. We are in the process of advising the key customer group of the New Year changes and Arthur, Vaughan and Ricky will cover the waterfront before Christmas. Kind regards, To Dennis Hepburn 5 April, 1994 From Ian Chesterfield Subject Development Down Under Dear Dennis, I need to share with you our current situation since the last visit of Jorgen and our new goal of A100M hydraulic turnover. I have been very busy and I have a number of people keen to move and to move quickly. Since the slow down message a couple of weeks ago, I need to know How far I can go and how fast I have a number of areas of concern but they are interrelatedboth in relation to our Vickers potential and our secondary network plans and could also start our third opportunity non hydraulic industrial products. On the assumption that the green light for Meadows is on, we have our Parker start and presence in 2 strategic locations Newcastle and Wollongong and bonus opportunities at Gunnedah in North West NSW and another location in Sydney. You will recall we had a quick chat with Robert Archer of Archer Hydraulics. The situation now is he wants to sell. With a degree of urgency Robert wants out totally and that would be a good thing. He is the third generation and the classic situation seems to prevail so we would not want him to continue in the business. From the Vickers point of view, the acquisition of Archer would secure our Vickers place in Sydney. Their Vickers turnover is around 700Kannum one of Vickers bigger distributors. Vickers would like us to buy Archer. It would make the Sydney BFP YesNo decision not have to be made. Archer total turnover is around A4M and by the time John A. has finished the numbers, the EBIT our way will be around 200K. I believe we can make money through Archer and secure our national network. We could move our NSW sales operation into the Archer operation and end up with a A7M business. We could move the nonhydraulic activities of Archer air compressors, pneumatics and maybe even honed hydraulic tube sales into Villawood. I will fax you an acquisition evaluation sheet on Friday, 8 April. This will be a share purchase of the total business. The Brisbane situation is very interesting. Vickers are not happy with their total representation in the greater Brisbane area. BFP are OK but we range a bit far and wide. Mathers are not OK and may be made an OEM not a distributor. John Cooper, whose main business is in Mackay, is not really turned on in Brisbane. Vickers will change the status of Mathers if we step up our activity. I suggest that it needs more than just another couple of Field Sales Reps, it needs an additional location. We are working on a possibility Applied Hydraulics a non aligned hydraulics business just up the road from Simons. This would give us a very suitable second location at Eagle Farm. It has an Enerpac business base, a fair servicerepair business and current sales of about A2M. We are not up to acquisition evaluation yet, but we will need to move quickly to keep up with Vickers. There are 2 more opportunities in this region that would virtually tie up the Vickers business. One is Hiway Hydraulics 70km just south west of Brisbane and at the gateway to the Darling Downs which is a very significant agricultural area. They are a Vickers Q.A. and a neat business. We have the data now to prepare an acquisition evaluation sheet and they are keen to take the matter further. The other is Southport Hydraulics, about an hour south on the Gold Coast. This is a less than A1M opportunity but one that Vickers would like because we could displace Denison with Vickers at a rate of about A5M our sales. We have not made an approach yet. Moving down south to Victoria and to Geelong, an hour southwest of Melbourne, we have Controlled Hydraulics and Air Hydraulics. I say Controlled is not on as we cant pay enough to give 3 young guys enough after tax considering what they can make over the next 5 years. Air Hydraulics is significant in that it is based on Parker, has sales around A5M and 4 locations in Victoria. We will have an acquisition evaluation sheet complete next week. Finally in this current scenario, we have Integrated. They operate out of Coffs Harbour with offices in Bri, Syd and Mel. You know their product line up, we would expect ongoing sales at around A15Mannum and they want to sell. I rank the strategic significance of these acquisitions as follows Rank Business LocastionMain Brand Turnover 1 Meadow NSW Parker 15 2 Archer NSW Vickers 4 3 Applied Qld. Vickers 2 4 Air Hyd Vic. Parker 5 5 Integrated QNV 15 6 Hiway Qld. Vickers 3 7 Southport Qld. Vickers 5 5 Current BFP 26 5M and all this could cost between 15 and 20 million A. It could also all be done within the next 12 months. I would appreciate your thoughts and guidance in this matter. Kind regards, To Dennis Hepburn 25 March 1994 From Ian Chesterfield Subject Meadows Acquisition Dennis, Further to our discussion last evening and with reference to Tom Froburg fax 23 March 1994, I confirm that Meadow are not interested in a swift signing of the Letter of Intent and then a delay in determination of the effective date. If they dont get significant usable funds before 30 June 1994, I suspect they will tell us to go away and come back in 1012 months time. They will enjoy the next years profits, ask a higher price, and want settlement before 30 June, I understand that Jorgen needs to pursue his deal with Jim McKee and that this deal may be a lever I see it as a lever to illustrate to Jim that we are doing what we told him we would do and that is, get on with growing our Australian business. If we end up with Vickers in Australia with their maximum addtional 15M turnover, we will not achieve our goal of 100M turnover with Vickers alone. As I have said previously, some current Vickers distributors will defect because they see us as opposition and they will take on and sell other brand product. We could end up with 10M turnover. We will not make 100M turnover with any one brand name major manufacturer unless we bought out the entire Parker business in Australia. To reach our goal, we will need to buy some lumps like Meadow 15M and Integrated 17M and this will lead us inevitably into brand name conflict. Getting back to Meadow we can work to an effective date of 1 May It is then up to Meadow to organise their affairs to give us time to review the data in time to pay 65 of the funds in time for them to use them by 30 June, They have a current and accurate stock count and they have a current asset register and personnel records and they are not tardy with month end accounts. The biggest problem I see is us getting the initial funds. If we have to get them from National Australia Bank we will have to start running, if we get them from Ole Balle, we should not have a problem. John A. is working up a deal with NAB such that we have access to say A10M on Authority from JorgenOle, but that is not in place yet. Dennis, I look forward to your O.K. to proceed with speed. Kind regards, To Dennis Hepburn 3 March, 1994 From Ian Chesterfield Subject BFP Australia Growth Strategy If the aim is to gain 15 of the total hydraulics market of some 600M, then we need to build a business with sales of 90M say 100M. Other than our direct import products, our principal distribution brand name is Vickers with 1994 plan sales of A5M. Vickers pretend we have a partnership, but in fact play a very unilateral game and we are expected to comply. We may be Vickers biggest single distributor customer but in order to keep us in our place, they do not recognise us as a national business but compare us on a site by site basis with other Vickers distributors. Considering we are new to the Vickers business having only been serious for just over 2 years and considering that nearly all the opposition is ownermanaged by ex Vickers executives with years of experience and association, it is not unreasonable that on a site by site basis, we dont come first. However, Lucas was attractive to Vickers because it was a national distributor and we intend to continue to operate as such, even if Vickers did disenfranchise us in some locations. We do not have APRs to consider in Australia at this stage. Our ability to grow our business with Vickers as a major partneris hampered by the lack of availability of good businesslike Vickers distributors that are for sale and even if we took all the good ones, we would not reach 100M. There are good businesses for sale that represent other main line manufacturers particularly Parker and I consider we will have to develop a second distribution network based around businesses strong on another manufacturer say Parker. This does not present a problem to me and Vickers have been told by Jorgen Ajslev that we are going to grow with or without Vickers and Vickers know I am looking at non Vickers distribution companies."

        "text": "Manufacturers data on the LM1875 20W audio power amplifier IC As used in the amplifier module elsewhere in this issue, the LM1875 IC requires only a few external components to deliver 25W into 8 ohms,It has quite impressive specifications for its size, as well as inbuilt thermal short circuit protection. By Darren Yates The LM1875 Audio Amplifier IC from National Semiconductor is now a few years old but it is still one of the most costefficient devices available when it comes to simplicity and output power. The LM1875 comes in a 5lead TO220 package. The heatsink tab is connected to the negative supply rail of the amplifier ie, to pin 3. However, it must be isolated from the heatsink via a TO220 insulating kit otherwise earth loops are likely to be a problem. Incidentally, diagram caption even if this IC is not driving a load , it must be bolted to a heatsink as the quiescent current of 70mA is enough to cause the thermal protection circuitry to switch in more on that later. Main features The main features and specifications of the LM1875 are as follows bullet Up to 30W power output into 8 ohms bullet Typical harmonic distortion of 015 1kHz, 20W output bullet Short circuit protection bullet Supply voltage range of 2060V bullet 94dB supply rejection ratio bullet Inbuilt thermal protection bullet Low noise SN ratio in excess of 100dB bullet Open loop gain typically 90dB bullet 70mA typical quiescent current. The LM1875 can drive either 4ohm symbol or 8ohm symbol loads but it delivers slightly more power into 8ohm symbol loads. With 4ohm symbol loads, the maximum output power is 20W. Although the data sheets indicate that the device can deliver a maximum output power of 30W into 8ohm symbol, this is at its absolute maximum supply voltage of 60V. With practical power supplies, some allowance must be made for variations in mains voltage and therefore 25W is a more realistic rating. Single or dual rails The LM1875 can be operated from dual or single supply rails and the amplifier module project featured in this issue shows both supply arrangements. The pinout diagram can be seen in Fig. Fig.2 shows the internal circuit diagram of the IC. Two NPN devices, Q35 and Q39, are the output transistors. If you look closely, the emitter resistor for Q35 is split in half and this split feeds another NPN device, Q36, which monitors the output current on positive half cycles of the output signal. In fact, Q36 and Q37 form part of a loadline protection system which shuts down drive to the output stage if the diagram diagram caption loading conditions are excessive. Fig.3 shows the distortions vs output power for both 4ohm symbol and 8ohm symbol loads while Fig.4 depicts distortion as a function of frequency. As you might expect, the device has increased distortion at both ends of the audio spectrum. Power output Fig.5 shows the expected power output at 1 total harmonic distortion for supply rails of between plus and minus10V to plus or minus30V RL 8ohm symbol. Power supply rejection characteristics vs frequency are shown in Fig.Note the difference between the positive and negative rails, with the negative rail being some diagram 30dB or so worse at 20kHz. The maximum figure of 94dB is relative to a 0ohm symbol signal source resistance, a 4ohm symbol load and at a frequency of 1kHz. The inbuilt thermal protection activates when the die temperature reaches 175degreeC and shuts down the device, which remains off until the die cools down to 145degreeC. In the case of a continuous load or overdrive problem, if the die rises to 150degreeC the device will again shut down. The beauty of this is that if the fault is a oneoff event, the thermal circuitry will allow the die to heat up further than if it is a continuous fault. Figs.7 8 show details on the power output vs power dissipation for 4ohm symbol and 8ohm symbol loads. Notice how the device dissipation is much higher for 4ohm symbol loads. In fact, even with a 1degreeCW heatsink, the LM1875s internal thermal shutdown circuitry switches on once the power output reaches 20W. By this stage, the power dissipation has reached about 32W and the die temperature has surpassed the 175degreeC mark. With an 8ohm symbol load, the LM1875 will happily deliver 25W continuously without running the risk of thermal shutdown. Stability Most power amplifiers dont drive capacitive loads all that well and the LM1875 doesnt either. Long speaker leads can produce enough capacitance to drive some amplifiers into VHF oscillation. In this case, the manufacturers data sheets recommend that you add a Zobel network consisting of a 0,22micro symbolF capacitor and a 1ohm symbol resistor to the output. This has been included in the amplifier module in this months issue. As with most designs, PC board layout is important in minimising the noise and distortion components. Keeping the input signal away from the supply rails will help keep the distortion low.Review Magnet LS621 2way loudspeakers The magnet LS621 loudspeakers are a compact bass reflex system which will fit well into most lounge rooms. Magnet will be a loudspeaker brand name new to most Australians. It is a company based in Thailand which makes loudspeakers designed by engineers from Holland. The European link is claimed to give the speakers a natural sound which otherwise might not be there if they had been designed in the East. The LS621 system we reviewed is a compact 2way system based on a 165mm polypropylene woofer and a 25mm tweeter. The bass reflex enclosure is wedgeshaped, tapering from the bottom to the top to angle the front baffle in such a way as to give some photo timecorrection to the tweeter. That and the small frontal dimensions of the speaker combine to make it quite unobtrusive in appearance. Its dimensions are as follows 435mm high, 206mm wide, 312mm deep at the base and 275mm deep at the top, with the grille cloth frame. Actually, the cabinet is also slightly smaller than its measurements suggest. Internal volume is 15 litres. The enclosure is ported with a tube of 55mm internal diameter and surprisingly long at 220mm. That is probably part of the reason why the enclosure is tapered, to allow a long port without making the box too deep overall. The cabinets are finished in simulated walnut veneer with a black grille cloth. We removed the woofer to have a look at the internal details of the enclosure and found that, surprise, surprise, the woofer is not of Asian origin at all but made by Peerless of Denmark, although we dont know the model number. It is a wellmade unit with a large magnet and a neoprene rubber roll surround for the polypropylene cone. And having revealed that the woofer is of European origin, the ferrofluidcooled 25mm soft dome tweeter is too, made by Philips of Belgium. The two drivers are coupled together via quite a complex crossover network and this has an aircored inductor wound with heavy gauge enamelled copper wire and uses wirewound resistors and a mixture of plastic and nonpolarised electrolytic capacitors. The system is biwired so you can drive the tweeter and woofer with separate amplifiers, if you wish. The enclosure The enclosure is lined with bonded acetate fibre or a similar material and interestingly, there is an internal sloped shelf which undoubtedly adds to cabinet rigidity but we dont know if it serves any other purpose. The four terminal posts are deeply recessed in a panel at the rear of the enclosure. This makes it quite difficult to make wire connections to the terminals unless you have wires fitted with jacks. The terminal panels are so deeply recessed that the terminal posts do not protrude at all and this means you could set the cabinets right up flush to a wall, if desired. Frequency response of the enclosure is quoted as being from 40Hz to 22kHz within 1dB and 6dB. We do not have access to an anechoic chamber so we are unable to verify this claim although the response is quite smooth overall. At the base end there is usable response down to below 45Hz although if pushed hard the woofer does tend to frequency double. At the high end, the tweeter is a little prominent in the region of 7 8kHz and then tapers off a little above that although it is smooth right to the limits of audibility. Efficiency is quoted as 5dB at 1 watt and 1 metre and the unit is claimed to be suitable for amplifiers rated from 15 watts to 150 watts. Our impressions were that you would need an amplifier of at least 40 to 50 watts and that anything much over 100 watts on program would be too much. That is backed up by the stated maximum SPL sound pressure level of 106dB. On music, the Magnet LS621s give good account of themselves although the tweeter seems a little muted for our tastes. We found that they sound rather better with the grille cloth frames off and we think most people would listen to them this way. On voice, they sound very natural without any tendency to chestiness or emphasis of sibilants. Our overall impression was that they were very satisfying on classical music, especially chamber works, and they give a good account of themselves on jazz material. If you are a heavy rock fan, you will want bigger guns and it would not be fair to expect them to do the job. Recommended retail price of the Magnet LS621s is 1150 a pair and they are available from AOne Electronics, 432434 Kent St, Sydney, NSW 2000 phone 02 267 AOne has recently fitted out a sound lounge and to introduce the Magnets, they have them on sale at 950 a pair, so get in quickly. L.D.S. Tektronix TDS 320 100MHz digital scope In the last couple of years, digital scopes have been redefined presented with an ease of use undreamt of even with analog scopes. The Tektronix TDS 320 continues this process, combining a simplified menu of control features with a 500 megasamplessecond sampling rate and 100 MHz bandwidth. By LEO SIMPSON The big challenge to scope manufacturers these days is how to combine the everincreasing performance and potential complexity of features in a package that is intuitively easy to use. No longer do users want to refer to thick manuals to find out how to make a measurement they want to do it all simply by pushing some buttons on the front panel. Over last 18 months or so, we have reviewed a number of digital scopes and they have all had a different approach to solving the conflicting requirements of ease of use and flexibility of use. For its part, Tektronix has chosen yet another approach one which makes extensive use of soft buttons and pictorial menus. First impressions First impressions of the Tektronix TDS 320 scope are that it is quite a bulky unit, but one which is surprisingly light for its bulk. Overall dimensions of the unit, not including its handle, are 325mm wide, 165mm high and 470mm deep, including knobs and rear projections. Its mass is only 8kg which means that it is easily carried with its large handle. The front panel is uncluttered although it does carry quite a lot of buttons, when you count them all up there are 35 buttons and six knobs. The layout is logical though and you can clearly identify the main knobs for vertical sensitivity and time base. To the left of the vertical sensitivity knob are buttons to select channels 1 and 2 and others which become clear as soon as you press them Math, Ref 1 and Ref Math gives you the choice of CH1 CH2, CH1 CH2 and CH2 CH1, all selectable via soft buttons down the side of the screen. I should explain that many digital scopes nowadays make use of these soft buttons whereby the functions change depending on what control menu is being displayed on the screen. It actually sounds more complicated than it is to use and it is a highly practical way of providing lots of features without having huge numbers of buttons."

        "text": "Introduction We live today in an information society where technology regularly bombards each and every one of us. I believe, as a consequence, we are losing the common art of communicating talking to one another and telling stories. When I was a small boy nothing would excite me more than spending hours with my grandparents listening to them describe how life used to be dotted line it truly was a wonderful investment of time the interaction of young and old. One of the most powerful tools of communication is humour. The ability to laugh at oneself and lifes many sticky predicaments, is a valuable asset. I have discovered writing to be a therapeutic distraction. Many a long night spent pondering alone with my trusty fountain pen, searching for the right sequence of words to unlock the laugh. I actually became a writer by default. Very early in my television career it became apparent that few script writers were able to consistently capture my turn of phrase. So as a selfimposed discipline I began penning a weekly page for the Australasian Post. Over the course of two years 104 articles were completed. A selection of the best anecdotes formed How to Hypnotise Chooks a title which took much time to sell to the publisher. Incredibly it proved to be an enormous success. The positive verbal and written feedback encouraged me to write more. How to Tame Lions, How to Kiss a Crocodile and How to Puzzle a Python followed in quick succession. A warped Tasmanian sense of humour has certainly helped the flow of tales. dotted line I trust this collection of my favourite stories brings more than a chuckle or two and thanks again to everyone who supported my literary efforts with the past four titles. Words are not sufficient to express my gratitude. Max How to Kiss a Crocodile I WAS THE ONLY ONE OF OUR EXPEDITION PARTY TO HAVE INSURANCE AGAINST BEING EATEN BY A CROCODILE The more I think about it the more I ask the question. What was a fully grown Tasmanian, with a reasonable amount of commonsense, doing cruising around a crocodile infested billabong at 30 at night dotted line To make matters worse, I was in an aluminium vessel, barely better than an upturned VW car bonnet that used a sick lawnmower engine for propulsion Gee, it could have easily been my last goodbye. See ya later alligator or See ya in a while crocodile. This deathdefying, extraordinary event happened in September, Yours truly, Wide World of Sports producer, John Murray, our very talented camera man, Phil Hanna, and his assistant, Brad King, were invited to cover the 1988 Barramundi Classic, one of Australias most unique game fishing tournaments. Here was a great opportunity to step aboard the big bird in the sky and head off for some sunshine in the Northern Territory. Definitely too good to miss after a nippy Melbourne winter The event was to be contested along part of the meandering Mary River system some 300 kilometres south west of Darwin. Our accommodation for the stay was at a place called, appropriately, the Wildman River Safari Lodge situated on the Wildman River part of the waterway. This austere cluster of metal deck, louvre windows, concrete block and flywire screen structures was not exactly Sydneys Regent Hotel, but then again what could we expect hundreds of kilometres from nowhere Our task was to capture on video the week long competition for Channel Nines Wide World of Sports programme. The concept being to tell the story through the eyes of a fisherman. Now the best way to understand what goes on is to have a go. As honorary commodore of the twoman teams in thirty boats, I did. And in doing so I almost lived up to my Tooheys 2 commercial reputation as the worlds worst fisherman In fact, between the four of us we travelled 28,000 kilometres and caught only one fish in five days. I guess that fish had a right to feel unlucky he was in the wrong part of the river at the wrong time Whilst that hookup, tag, and release sequence of vision was an important part of our footage, the chance to shoot images of crocodiles in their natural habitat, under spotlight at night, was what made the Barra Classic a memorable one for all concerned. None of us could have predicted the drama that would unfold during our adventure in the balmy darkness under a vivid Milky Way. Our nocturnal expedition consisted of two craft and was coordinated by the rangers of the Northern Territory Fisheries Department. Dont get the idea for a moment that it was a hairbrained idea spawned by a wish to emulate the antics of Mick Dundee of Crocodile Dundee fame. No way We had a serious task. Wed heard about the notorious rogue saurian named Sweetheart, only the day before. She wasnt too fussy about eating humans or fragile tin can boats like ours. The story came from the manager of the Safari Lodge, Ray Alright, after a comforting, bellywarming port or three in the early a.m. A man of much experience, integrity and never one to exaggerate the truth, he willingly divulged that Sweetheart had snapped the bum out of his dinghy dotted line and didnt even chew the stem of the outboard motor before gulping the lot down Now thats whats called a cast iron constitution And clearly the tale suggested a very large mouth. Sweetheart was then quite a local identity, although she was to be caught by the rangers a few months later and moved to a reserve. A quick glance at the visitors book made this point. Mick Dundees cousin in comedy, Daryl Somers, the host of the top rating TV show Hey Hey Its Saturday, had lobbed at the lodge a few weeks earlier and had added his experiences to the Sweetheart legend. His personal note of warning in the visitors book was both blunt and colourful. There was no way we could avoid reading what Daz said. All I can say is thanks a lot, mate You certainly put the wind up and out of me and my team. That fateful night, I was assigned a seat in the middle of the tiny lead vessel dotted line and I use that term loosely. Honestly, it was barely three metres long and sat very, very low in the water. The precarious level of the plimsoll line had a fair bit to do with the bulk of my four minders, all strong, rugged angler types. Will, an intrepid barehanded croc catcher, hung continuously like a question mark over the bow with bulging eyeballs scanning the shiny, moonlit lily pads for those telltale eyes of old scaly. Standing up beside Will was our human lantern, holding a carbattery powered spotlight. He had the worst job in the crew. Apart from being our navigator he also became the easy target of thousands of mosquitoes. This had to be the ultimate test for a can of Aerogard There were so many mossies around that everytime he opened his mouth, which wasnt often, his tonsils became speckled with tiny insects. I knew he was breathing mostly through his nose, because so was I. Even with my ample hooter, it got clogged up very quickly. The only respite from being eaten alive by the biting squadron was to turn off the light, but then wed be in the dark dotted line and I definitely didnt want to be left in the dark Not here I was nearly seven years old before I could go to sleep with the light out. The only thing we planned to turn off was the outboard motor that barked painfully in our eardrums. Then we experienced an eerie feeling as we drifted, the light stabbing silently ahead of us. The other two crew members of our Boat One had their bums firmly planted on the rear seat. One had a hand on the tiller and an ear to what his mate was saying. In between the odd nervous cigarette, they both looked a bit toey. I think they were more concerned about appearing on national television for the first time than coming face to face with a rogue croc. I was the bloke who ought to have been nervous. No way known was I prepared for what was about to happen when Will zeroed in on the first crocodile for the night. From my safe seat, all I could see was the end of a scaly tail threshing about to one side of the dinghy. Will confidently shouted with the voice of experience as he struggled No, hes too big Immediately he let go of his target Away the startled croc bolted like a frightened goldfish. I reckon this one that got away was every bit as long as the boat, and most of that consisted of a powerful tail Nevertheless, with any croc theres still plenty of room for a full set of teeth. The theory is to stun them with the glare of the spotlight. Then grab them firmly around the mouth so they cant snap their powerful jaws. But the trick here is to ensure that you can actually get your hands around the buggers mouth one slight miscalculation and youre always going to be a little short when counting the fingers on each hand Im told that while their jaws can close with great tenacity, the opening muscles are much weaker. At night, with the aid of a spotlight, its very easy to judge how big these scaly monsters are dotted line by the distance between their eyes, which light up like shimmering, pale pink marbles. What a profile nostrils, eyes and ears all above the water line enabling the creature to breathe, see and hear whilst the majority of its body is hidden. The huge flattened tail makes up about half it body length. This is also a massive weapon. The back legs have webbed feet, which are useful in climbing muddy banks. The jagged teeth offer a firm grip on struggling prey. These snapping jaws and surprisingly fast reactions give our awesome Australian salties numerous teatime snacks along the waters edge. They are also very territorial and when pressed for space between the river bank and a dinghy, can become quite explosive. Its really frightening when what looks like a floating log suddenly erupts into action right before your eyes. It leaves a big, gaping hole in the water thats how fast they dive. It should be mentioned that anything a large crocodile sees in the water or on the land dotted line or even in a boat, is regarded as good, so their diet ranges from insects to kangaroos, cattle or people What a comforting thought. Anyway, there were no flies on my mate Will. The next time our boat got into the action, there was definitely no mistake. Clunk, just like a giant handcuff snapped around the crocs mouth dotted line and barely a ripple on the billabong. Extraordinary, Phil said ecstatically from the camera boat following. Beautiful stuff, he confided. His boat was slightly larger than ours with a flat bottom and rails of tubular pipe. The shape made it ideal for setting up the camera tripod and viewing over the side. Seven people were comfortably piled aboard this second boat, and not all related to Wide World of Sports. Chris Makepiece, the tournament director, was overseeing proceedings, along with Bob and Kathy Dennis, the husband and wife fishing team from Fort Smith, Arkansas. Would you believe Kathy was six months pregnant at the time Sitting back with a firm grip on the throttle was a true blue Territorian. A philosophical character who, in passing, mentioned how the crocodile that can be seen is not a worry, its the one you cant see, because hes a hunter All terrific information to have on board in the black of night, knowing that crocs mostly feed then and have splendid nighttime vision. For the moment though, we were floating around aimlessly in their back yard."

        "text": "Chapter 3 Cat Breeds Burmese HistoryMost breeders agree that the Burmese seen in Western countries today were derived from one female, Wong Mau, imported from Burma in the 1930s. As this was the only cat of its type in the West it was mated to a Siamese, then the progeny mated back. The Burmese has been recognised as a breed since the 1950s60s. It probably equals the Siamese as Australias most popuar, pedigreed, shorthaired cat. AppearanceBurmese are mediumsized cats, slim but heavier and rounder than Siamese. The coat is very short, silky and glossy the eyes shoudl be golden. There are ten colours brown, blue, lilac, chocolate, cream, red, lilaccream also called lilac torti, blue torti, chocolate torti and brown torti. TemperamentBurmese are described as being intelligent, affectionate cats, vocal but not as loud or demanding as Siamese, active, playful and inquisitive. Some can be trained to retrieve toys or balls of paper. Most Burmese are outgoing and accept strangers well. Breeders say aggression should not be a part of the Burmese makeup, so prospective buyers should inspect parents of a kitten for any aggressive tendencies. Certain lines seem to have a problem with this. Generally, this breed has a good temperament. Kittens and costLitters average five kittens, with litters of eight or nine kittens not uncommon. It is unusual for there to be kittening problems. The kittens tend to be very strong. Kittens can cost from 200 to HealthBurmese seem to be more susceptible to respiratory infections than crossbred cats. This means vaccinations against cat flu and feline enteritis are very important. Like many Oriental breeds, Burmese seem to be lactose intolerant and should not be given milk. Males can tend to spray even after being neutered, and the odd habit of eating wool appears to be more common in Burmese than other breeds. A lifespan of ten to twelve years should be expected, although cats up to fifteen years of age are reasonably common. Breeders warn they are wanderers if allowed and those tend to get hit by cars. ROAD TEST Housepet potentialMany Burmese will scratch the furniture if not provided with a scratching post. Some breeders trim their cats claws. Fleas should be no more of a problem than any other cat and are usually easier to spot in the silky coat. Ideal ownerBurmese can be good pets for families as they are reasonably well balanced and cope with children quite well, however, no cat will suffer extreme teasing. Many single people, retired or otherwise, find the Burmese a companion which will talk back to them. Someone who spends a lot of time away from the home should probably have a second cat, as they can get destructive if bored. SpaceexerciseAn ideal cat for the average home or flat, although they do like room to roam in if they are not allowed outside. They will exercise themselves. GroomingExtremely little. Hand stroking will remove any loose hairs and shedding is also minimal. Cost to feedA diet based on tinned food, cheese, some mince and dry biscuits should be adequate and cost the average pet owner between 5 and 10 a week. They shouldnt be fed solely on dry food, as this is mooted to cause kidney problems in males. For further information Burmese Society of Australasia Secretary, Hazel Rossiter 28 The Crescent Marayong NSW 2148 Telephone 02 671 4158 This society should be able to provide contacts for interstate inquiries. CORNISH REX The Cornish Rex is a very new breed of cat, occurring as a mutation in a litter of kittens in 1950 in Cornwall, England. The curlycoated kitten was mated back to its mother and several similarly coated kittens resulted. A breeding programme was established and nowadays the Cornish Rex is found throughout the world.The breed was named Cornish after the area of origin, while Rex refers to a similar mutation in Rex rabbits which have curled fur. Devon Rex cats appear very similar but are a separate breed, occurring through a different mutation. AppearanceCornish Rex cats have a short, wavy coat referred to as a marcel wave which gives the coat a crimped appearance. The gene results in the Cornish Rex lacking guard hairs but having very short and curly awn and down hairs. The whiskers are short and curly. The body is hard, muscular and slender with a long, whippy tail. The Cornish Rex has a Roman nose, and highset ears. Devon Rex cats have quite a short nose and prominent whisker pads. As the Cornish Rex breed is still developing, a wide range of colours is available. The most popular colours are black, smoke, white and white with Siamesepoint markings. TemperamentCornish Rexes are described as being animated and affectionate cats. They are very active and some breeders say individual cats can be hyperactive. Breeders say the Cornish Rex are easy to house train and some have been known to be trained to walk on a lead. Many are quite talkative, but with a voice softer than that of the Siamese. BreedingMany of the characteristics of the Cornish Rex relate visually or temperamentally to its breeding, as in order to introduce new colours Cornish Rex breeders can outcross their cats with any other cat breed. While New South Wales and Queensland breeders can also outcross to domestics, many other states do not accept an outcross with a domestic. The resulting litters are entered on an experimental register until the genes for coat and colour are established. If a Cornish Rex is crossed with another breed, the first generation usually has straight coats but carry the curly genes. The second generation when mated back to a Cornish Rex should have about 5050 straightcurly coats. After wavy coats have become established there are no throwbacks to straight coats if bred with other Cornish Rex wavycoated cats. Breeders discovered that the Cornish Rex and Devon Rex were two different breeds when straighthaired kittens resulted from a mating between the two. In other words, the gene governing the curly coat is different for each. Cornish Rex litters usually consist of three to four kittens. Caesarian births are uncommon and Cornish Rex queens are normally ideal mothers. Kittens cost around 150 to As this is not a common breed, prospective owners may need to join a waiting list for kittens. Housepet potentialLess hair is shed by the Cornish Rex than other shorthaired breeds, and much less than longhaired cats. While most allergies to cats are caused by a reaction to the saliva on the fur rather than actual dropped hair, the few people who are allergic to cat hair may find this breed more tolerable. Cornish Rex are active cats which would best suit a home with a garden in which to roam, but many will settle into life in a unit if allowed time to exercise outdoors. As mentioned, breeders say individual cats have been known to accept lead training. Health and lifespanThe lack of guard hairs in the Cornish Rex coat means new owners should be careful of sudden temperature changes by transferring their pet from very warm conditions e.g. inside the home to very cold conditions the backyard in winter, but generally the breed seems quite hardy. One advantage of the lack of guard hairs is that fur balls do not seem to be a problem with this breed. The characteristically crinkly eyebrows of the cat shoudl be checked weekly that they are not curling into the eye. If a hair appears to be irritating the eye, breeders recommend plucking it out with tweezers. The Cornish Rex seems to have benefited from the outcrossing colour programmes, producing a hardy, vigorous cat. Breeders estimate a lifespan of around fifteen years, possibly more. GroomingHand stroking is the recommended method of grooming, or a rub over with a velvet glove or comb through with a flea comb if desired. FeedingBreeders feed their cats a wide range of foods from commercial cat food and biscuits to grated cheese, cottage cheese, yoghurt and lean meat, with added calcium for kittens.

MANX HistoryThere are many legends about how the Manx came to lose its tail, however, most breeders agree it was a mutation which occurred on the Isle of Man probably several hundred years ago. The natural water boundaries of the island restricted the spread of the breed as well as preventing much outside influence. Since this century, however, Manx have been taken worldwide and are recognisable and popular pets in the United States, United Kingdom and Australia, although never a common breed. AppearanceThere are basically four types of Manx, determined by their tail or lack of it bullet Rumpy no tail a dimple where the tail would normally start. This is the type of Manx to which breeders aspire. It is also likely to be the cat with the most deformities. bullet Rumpyriser very similar to a Rumpy except that if you stroked the cats back you would feel a little lump or kink at the base of the spine rather than a dimple. bullet Stumpy cats with a bunnytype of tail, short, knobbly and usually a little fluffy. Breeders will usually use these to cross with British Shorthairs to produce more Manx bullet Longies cats from a Manx litter with a tail. Other than the tail, the Manx is a fairly ordinary looking cat, able to be bred in any colour. There is a longhaired version called the Cymric. Older types of Manx had long back legs, which caused them to hop rather than run like other cats. Temperamenthousepet potentialThey are generally quite calm, placid cats which wont usually scratch furniture, climb curtains, call loudly or make general nuisances of themselves like some breeds can. They are fairly adaptable and can cope with being left alone for much of the day. Like any cat they will get along better with children if brought up with them. They arent wanderers as a rule and tend to be standoffish with strange people until they size them up. They are not known to be aggressive. Some are proven hunters. ROAD TEST HealthSome cat breeders and texts suggest that if the Manx mutation occurred today it would not be recognised, as the gene governing tailessness is linked to potentially serious deformities. Cat authorities are becoming less likely to recognise breeds which have genetic flaws. However, the Manx has been recognised and exhibited for years. Veterinary surgeons we consulted listed several problems, the majority of which related to neurological conditions. Spina bifida can occur and can range from a small dimple or sore on an otherwise healthy cat, to severe deformities causing the death of the kitten. Some Manx have problems with their bowels and bladders. This is often because the nerves in the spine control the bowel and bladder and any weakness affects its control. The problem can range from very minor i.e. the cat has a touchy tummy which can be controlled by diet to fairly serious, were the cat has such little control that it dribbles faeces or urine or dribbles when it is patted. One breeder said that any serious breeder would not sell a kitten like the latter, although the former condition is controllable. According to breeders, many Manx cats are hardy and healthy and can live to fifteen years of age. Deformities, if they do occur, are usually apparent at birth and the kittens are culled. Burkes Backyard strongly recommends dealing with a reputable breeder who is unlikely to sell you a kitten until it is at least twelve weeks old, by which time it should be trouble free. PopularityA popular breed in that theres always a waiting list for kittens. There are few breeders Australiawide. Breeding, litters and cost Only one parent has to be a Manx to produce Manx kittens."

        "text": "Question 4b. The case of Hamilton v Hunter held that a mortgagor debtor is not able to dispose of property that is subject to a floating charge, in a manner in order to defeat the security holders security. The case therefore places a limit on the concept of the ordinary course of business. This is important because a debtor under a floating charge may deal with the property subject to the charge, free of the charge, in the ordinary course of business. Accordingly, because the debtor can deal relatively freely with the goods, it would be possible, as was attempted by the scheme manager in Hamilton, to defeat the security, thus rendering the chargee effectively an unsecured creditor. Therefore, the holder of a floating charge, if not for this limit, would be required to continually monitor the debtor to ensure that the property charged was not dealt with inconsistently with the charge. The essence of the floating charge, as noted above, is the ability of the debtor to deal with the charged goods in the ordinary course of business. In order to explain the conceptual basis for this, two theories have been put forward an implied licence, or a mortgage of future of assets. Neither theory can explain all aspects of the characteristics of floating charges. See article by Burns 1992 ablr 125 In Hamilton v Hunter, the implied licence theory was invoked, it being held that it is not compatible with such Q 4b a licence to allow the debtor to dispose of goods for the purpose of defeating the security. A transaction made to defeat a security will therefore be set aside, thus strengthening the security. In Tricontinental, it was held that the holder of a floating charge does not have a proprietary interest in the goods prior to crystallisation of the charge. Therefore, a security holder, is generally, unable to intervene to prevent the debtor under a floating charge from disposing of the property. However, in Re Margart Helsham cj in eq in the nsw Supreme Court, held that the charge holder did have a beneficial interest in the property under the charge prior to crystallisation. Therefore, by an injunction a charge holder can prevent improper dispositions of property. Hamilton v Hunter therefore provides an instance in which a charge holder can prevent a disposition of the goods under the charge. Once a receiver is appointed, a floating charge will crystallise and give the charge holder a proprietary interest in the goods under the charge. However, it is prior tounclear crystallisation that the holder of a floating charge is subject to the debtor dealing improperly with the goods. Question 6a In Tournier v National Provincial Union Bank of England, the English Court of Appeal per Bankes and Atkin ljj, Scrutton lj dissenting held that the bank owes a general duty of secrecy to its customers. This is not an absolute duty but a qualified duty. The duty of secrecy applies to knowledge which the bank acquired before the bankercustomer relationship was contemplated, or after it has ceased. It also applies to knowledge derived from other sources during the continuance of the relationship. However, Scrutton and Atkin ljj each said that a bank may disclose information about a customer in order to protect its own interests, but only when it is reasonably necessary. The Evidence Act 1898 nsw s 49 provides that a banker is not compellable to produce information about a customer if the bank is not a party to that litigation. However, this section has not been included in the Evidence Bill 1993 nsw. Nor was it in the 1991 Bill, or the Commonwealth Evidence Bill 1993 or in the alrc draft evidence Bill. This was confirmed to me by Marion Pascoe in the nsw Parliamentary Counsels Office 228 A further exception was not revealed in Bankers Trust v Shapira. A bank was ordered to disclose account details of a customer who was prima facie guilty of fraud, to enable the plaintiff access to its full equitable rights. Section 50 of the Evidence Act re provides a court may order a banker to produce documents. Similar provisions are in the Bills. Question 6b in Woods In Great Western Railway Co v London County Banking Co, it was held that in order to be a customer of a bank a person must have an account of some type. However in Woods v Martins Bank, it was held that a person who used a service provided by the bank, in this case the provision of financial advice, was a customer though he did not, at that stage have an account with the bank. The decision expressly relied on the fact that the bank held itself out as providing financial advice. Professor Cooray argues that Great Western Railway is confined to an interpretation under s 82 of the Bills of Exchange Act 1882 uk, as it was in However, a better view is that a customer of a bank is a person who uses a service that the bank holds itself out as providing. Therefore in Great Western Railway, the banks only business, as found, was to operate accounts. In Woods, the banks business included the provision of investment advice. Therefore, if it is part of the banks business to advise, then a person who seeks advice is owed a duty of care by the bank, and is a customer. Question 6d The initial remedy that is apparent from the facts, is an action for damages under the trade Practices Act or the Fair Trading Act for misleading and deceptive conduct. The representation made by Jerimiah was in trade or commerce, was false breach of s 53 and was misleading and deceptive s 52. Therefore damages under s 82, probably on a tort basis can be recovered. Alternatively an action for fraudulent misrepresentation could be used, based on the principles in Commercial Banking Co of Sydney v R H Brown Co. This case held that it is banking practice that it is understood that a bankers opinion will be relied upon. Thus as the statement was in fact false, made knowingly, then it can be inferred that an intention to deceive existed. Whereby Steve and Earnest acted upon it and thereby suffered damage. Of course Earnest and Steve have an action against for a quantum meruit against Bullwinkle Corp. They would also be able to sue upon an implied covenant to pay. Other bases would include conversion, detinue and possibly trespass. They would be able to recover damages, or because it is a work of art, equity could order specific performance or rescind the contract, because the good is special. damages. Steve would also have an action unclear in contract against Earnest because Earnest commissioned him to produce the sculpture. Question 5a An indemnity, as explained by Clarke J in Citicorp v Hendry involves a contract by which one party agrees to keep the other party harmless against a loss. A guarantee is a contract, whereby the promisor agrees to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another party who is to be primarily responsible to the promisee. The essential difference between an indemnity and a guarantee, is that an indemnity only involves two parties, whereas a guarantee involves three. The legal consequences of the distinction are is that a party who c indemnifies another is under a primary obligation to make good the other partys loss. In the case of a guarantee, the party giving the guarantee is subject to a secondary obligation. Accordingly, a guarantee will be avoided or unenforceable where the primary obligation is void. However an indemnity can still be enforced as long as the indemnified party suffers a loss. According in Citibank, the transaction which was expressed to be an indemnity, was held, after examining the substance to be a guarantee, and because the primary obligation was void as an al attempt to enforce a penalty then so was the guarantee also avoided. If the Court had held that it was an indemnity, the defendant would have had to have paid the loss suffered. Question 5b In cba v Amadio, the High Court held that a guarantee and mortgage were to be set aside, because it was unconscionable, considering the inequality between the parties that the bank be allowed to enforce its rights. In Nobile, a similar conclusion was reached, but it was added that the statements by the stronger party inducing the weaker party to enter into the guarantee and mortgage were in breach of ss 52 and 53 of the Trade Practices Act, which prohibit misleading and deceptive conduct, and false representations respectively. As regards commercial lenders, this means that they should always ensure that borrowers, particularly where they are private individuals, are fully appraised of the total effect of the documents they are being asked to sign. Commercial lenders will almost always be in a much stronger position than a borrower, in regard to knowledge of lending, effect of documents, subject of guaranteed debt etc. Exceptions might be if the borrower were a large corporation, which had the resources and bargaining power to counter the lenders. Because of the inequality in bargaining power, it would best if the weaker party were at least given, or told to obtain, independent advice as to the consequences of entering the transaction. This is a more feasible approach than expecting a commercial lender to act against its interests. Further because, banks who are usually the lender are only required to disclose unusual aspects, or elements not normally to be expected, they may not be thorough enough to enable the guarantor to decide what is in their own best interests. Question 3a The question of In determining whether the agreement containing the reservation of title is a registrable charge, the first step is to consider s 262 of the Corporations Law. Subsection 2622 then provides a charge arising by operation of law is not registrable. Therefore, if the agreement is a Romalpa clause, it is not registrable. However, as noted in Borden v Scottish Timber, one must consider what the parties intended to create, and if a charge was intended to be created, the document is registrable. A Romalpa clause provides that the property in goods is not to pass until the purchaser has paid the purchase price. The purchaser is accordingly, constituted as the sellers fiduciary agent, and is a bailee of the goods. However, it would appear that such a clause is only effective if the goods will not be mixed. Further, very clear words are required to constitute the buyer as a fiduciary agent. Accordingly, the main advantage is that a formal security does not have to be created and registered. This is because there is no transfer of title. The other option to consider is that discussed in cases such as Wilson v Kelland, Re Connolly Bros No 2 and Re Bunbury Foods. These cases held that where a company acquires goods subject to a charge, then they do the company does not acquire a full title to the goods, but rather receives an equity of redemption. However s 264 of the Corporations Law provides that where a company acquires property that is subject to a charge, being a charge that would have been registrable when it was created if it had been created by a company, the company must lodge a notice in accordance with s 2631. Question 3b The interest in the bales of leather The leather that has not been sol The charge Because Bootco is in liquidation, it must first be determined whether the agreement is registrable and if so, was it. If the agreement was registrable, but was not registered, then under s 266 of the Corporations Law Blue Cow will have no interest. It would appear that the parties intended to create a charge, and as Bootco was empowered to onsell both processed and unprocessed leather, together with a lack of clear words constituting Bootco a fiduciary, the agreement is a registrable charge."

        "text": "CONDUCTIVE, ELECTROACTIVE POLYMERS PROVIDING THE BASIS OF INTELLIGENT MATERIAL DEVELOPMENT Gordon G Wallace Chemistry Department University of Wollongong Synopsis Intelligent polymeric materials are capable of monitoring and controlling the chemical environment in which they are operational. The inherent properties of conductive, electroactive polymers are such that they provide an ideal basis for the development of such materials. These polymers can be made to specifically interact with target molecules they are capable of generating and processing electrical signals and finally they are capable of instigating chemical reactions by triggering the release of chemicals. Conductive, electroactive polymers can be prepared in a variety of physical forms including coatings, particles and membranes. Biographical Sketch Professor Gordon Wallace received his PhD degree from Deakin University for studies involving electrochemistry and chromatography. He has since established a research discipline in the area of Intelligent Polymeric Materials. Professor Wallace is currently Director, Polymer Systems Technology, Coorindator of the Intelligent Materials Research Program University of Wollongong. In todays academic environment Gordon Wallace may be described as a Material Electrochemist. BACKGROUND Polymers are known to provide the mechanical properties yet the light weight required to solve many of todays material application problems. The chemical and physical inertness of polymer Materials has led to their application in many areas of modern technology. For example, the use of polymers for packaging or protective coatings is based on the fact that they are chemically inert they do not interact with their chemical environment. In addition traditional polymers are highly insulating a property desirable for many applications. In recent years, however, a new generation of polymer materials has evolved. These materials are conductive, electroactive polymers. An excellent review of the properties of these polymers is available Skotheim, 1986. Such materials may have conductivities as high as metallic copper. In addition, the fact that they are electroactive produces a means of reversibly changing their chemical and physical properties. These materials are not inert in fact they are interactive they may be designed to interact with and respond to species in the chemical environment in which they are operational. For example, materials capable of selective chemical interactions have been developed and employed as the basis of molecular separation devices Wallace, 1989a. Those materials which are capable of generating an electrical signal as a result of such interactions have been employed as chemical sensors or biosensors Wallace, 1989b, Wallace, 1989c. Active polymers have also been developed for use in controlled or triggered release devices capable of delivering active chemical species. These materials can be made to respond to an external electrical impulse which initiates and controls the release of chemicals from the polymers Wallace, 1989d. Such materials have been used to create chemical delivery systems to release insecticides and even drugs. The concept of producing chemically active polymer materials which can interact with and monitor the chemical environment, with the ability to respond to the information provided is one being pursued in these laboratories. This ability to monitor predefined chemical parameters and respond to correct them, if necessary, attributes a crude level of intelligence to the material. This research group is in pursuit of Intelligent Polymeric Materials. WHY USE CONDUCTIVE ELECTROACTIVE POLYMERS Intelligent materials must be capable of selective chemical interactions if they are to detect and respond to appropriate chemicals in the operational environment. Conductive electroactive polymers may be synthesized in a variety of ways which allow the introduction of specific chemical properties. They are prepared according to Formulae The substrate, monomer and counterion C are chosen according to the application at hand. The chemical, electrochemical and the mechanical properties of the resultant polymer may be controlled by the judicious choice of these variables. Control of the chemical properties enables polymers capable of selective interactions to be engineered. Sorry I had to use that word somewhere. There are two approaches by which the ability to undergo selective interactions can be incorporated into the polymer. The first involves the incorporation of selected chemical reagents such as complexing agents, antibodies or enzymes into the polymer during synthesis. The second approach involves manipulation of the polymer backbone to enable molecular recognition to occur. In these laboratories we have shown that conductive, electroactive polymers have an additional unique feature it is possible to control interactions on their surface by application of small electrical potentials. The ability to control chemical processes such as ion exchange, complexation and hydrophobic interactions on conductive electroactive polymer surfaces by the application of potentials which are only in the order of millivolts has been demonstrated. This introduces a new dimension which can be used to ensure that only selected predefined chemical interactions occur on the polymer surface. In addition to ensuring that selected interactions occur, intelligent materials must be capable of generating an appropriate signal which relates information about such interactions. Conductive polymers are well suited to the generation and processing of such signals. Electrochemical processes such as oxidation or reduction and other electrical signals such as changes in capacitance or resistance are readily generated and monitored on these materials. Finally, intelligent materials must be capable of initiating appropriate chemical responses when required. It has already been demonstrated that certain chemical processes can be initiated either chemically or electrochemically on conducting polymers. For example we have used the application of external potentials to trigger chemical reactions in the development of online derivatisation devices. In these laboratories, it has been shown that chemical reactions on conducting polymers can be triggered by changes in the chemical environment andor by application of small electrical potentials. The status of conducting polymer research with a view to their use as Intelligent Materials will be discussed and the areas which require our future attention have been highlighted in this report. MONOMERS AVAILABLE A range of suitable monomers are available, off the shelf, shown below. These form the basis of most polymers. It is possible to add substituents to these base monomers to introduce specific chemical or electrochemical properties. Formulae SYNTHESIS OF ELECTROACTIVE CONDUCTIVE POLYMER The polymerisation process have been initiated either chemically or electrochemically, according to equation In the case of chemical oxidation stand alone polymer particles have been formed. Chemical polymerisation has also been used to coat nonconductive substances such as membranes or glass. However, chemical polymerisation is somewhat limited in that usually the counterion of the oxidant will be incorporated into the polymer. This restricts the range of chemical properties which can be engineered into the polymer. On the other hand electropolymerisation provides a means of incorporating a range of counterions into the polymer. Since with electropolymerisation no chemical oxidant is required the only stipulation is that the counter anion be soluble in the solvent and preferably be electroinactive at the potentials required to initiate polymerisation. The counterion is usually the anion of the supporting electrolyte employed. It is possible to coat even non conductive substrates using electropolymerisation. Figure 1 shows silica particles which has been coated electrochemically. It is also possible to employ solution additives which encourage the incorporation of nonionic chemical reagents into conducting polymer materials. In these laboratories various techniques have been employed to achieve the incorporation of various chemical species during polymer synthesis. The success of the synthesis program is measured in terms of the strict performance criteria required to ensure specific interactions, signal generationprocessing and controlled release to occur. Under each of these headings the achievements to date will be discussed. CHEMICAL INTERACTIONS ON CONDUCTIVE ELECTROACTIVE POLYMERS In the pursuit of intelligent materials it is imperative that selective predetermined chemical interactions take place on the polymer surface. This has been achieved by careful design and development of the polymeric material as discussed in the synthesis Program. In early work in these laboratories interactions on conducting polymers were explored using batch experiments wherein polymer coated electrodes were soaked in analyte solutions. It was verified in this work that reactions such as complexation, ion exchange and precipitation could easily be induced on appropriate polymer surfaces Wallace, 1988a. In the course of this work we have established that with conducting polymers a further degree of sophistication can be introduced and interactions can be controlled by the application of small electrical potentials Wallace, 1990a. The fact that this electrochemical control was reversible enabled fine tuning of interactions on the polymer surface. For example in the development of complexing polymers we have produced a material with contains dithiocarbamate groups. This material was used to complex mercury ions from solution and it was found that the application of a small potential markedly enhanced the rate of complexation Wallace, 1988b. This was not due to electrodeposition since the mercury ions were trapped chemically. Another example involved the use of ion exchange polymers to trap AuCI4. Once again the application of a potential to the polymeric material had a dramatic affect on the performance Wallace, 1990b. The ability to influence complicated processes such as those which occur during antibodyantigen interactions has also been demonstrated Wallace, 1990c. SIGNAL GENERATIONPROCESSING An integral part of Intelligent Material development is the generation of an electrical signal related to chemical interactions. It is on the basis of this signal that the material must make decisions regarding the quality of the chemical environment and whether or not corrective chemical actions are required. Since the polymer materials employed in this work are conductive, electrical signals are readily generated. For example after species interact at the electrode, and if a change in analyte oxidation state can be induced then either changes in potential or current flow can be used analytically. Such a mechanism is used in the detection of the gold chloride anion after preconcentration as discussed previously Wallace, 1990b. Current measurements are inherently more accurate and sensitive than potential measurements. Consequently, such measurements are favoured. However, the response does not have to be due to oxidation or reduction. For example, in the development of a chromium sensor Wallace, 1989c a response due to movement of dichromate ions out of the polymer and not due to a conventional electrochemical oxidationreduction process was obtained. This example illustrates that conductive polymers can be used to produce electrical signals not observed on conventional substrates. Other electrical signals such as changes in the capacitance or conductivity of polymers as interactions occur at the surface can also be used. Such techniques are not as inherently selective or sensitive as amperometry or voltammetry. However, the selectivity and sensitivity can be engineered into the polymeric modifier to ensure that only the target chemical interactions with the polymer. Such a procedure has been used in these laboratories development of various sensors. TRIGGERING CHEMICAL REACTIONS The intelligent material must be capable of accepting the electrical signal generated, processing it and initiating chemical responses if required. We have already discussed the use of electrical signals to control chemical interactions. In the extreme case chemical reactions can be initiated or closed down electrochemically by the application of appropriate potentials to conducting polymers. This process occurs according to Formulae For example, in these laboratories we have demonstrated the release of complexing agents, precipitating agents and even antibodies Table 1 all capable of acting as remedies to environmental problems. We have shown that the ability to trigger and control the rate of release depends on the chemical environment and on the properties of the polymer employed. The incorporation and release of simple anions small, highly charged is readily achieved. However, triggered release of more complicated species is not so readily achieved. Consequently we have been concerned with the development of techniques which enable the incorporation and release of more complicated reagents. This can be achieved by using additives which induce the required behaviour in the active material to be released. A SIMPLE INTELLIGENT MATERIAL The simplest form of an intelligent material involves the monitoring of a well defined chemical reaction which generates an electrical signal capable of directly triggering a chemical response when required. Such a situation occurs in corrosion of zincalum. Where the zinc corrosion generates an electrical signal. This electrical signal may then be used to trigger a chemical reaction which stops the corrosion. For example, in these laboratories we have employed a conducting polymer coating from which the release of a corrosion inhibitor can be triggered upon the onset of corrosion."

        "text": "FIFTEEN Women, Paid Work and Social Policy Lois Bryson The last two decades or so have seen significant changes in the position of Australian women in relation to both the economy and social policy. Womens increasing participation in the workforce is widely acknowledged, but there is less recognition that the changes are far more comprehensive. As well as changes in womens employment patterns, we have a major shift in the way women are responded to by the state, which impacts directly on what is traditionally seen as the private sphere of social life. Taken together, the changes amount to a fundamental restructuring of womens position in the society women are being directly absorbed into the class structure, rather than this relationship being essentially mediated by male kin. This chapter is concerned with these changes in their historical perspective. It focuses on womens position in the public world of work, and the definition of women within social policy. The connections between the changes in these areas are teased out and the implications discussed for our understanding of that ubiquitous feminist question is gender equality increasing. Womens Work in Historical Perspective Despite steadily increasing participation in paid employment, women still clearly occupy an inferior position in the workforce. To understand the gendered patterns of the world of paid work today it is necessary to seek clues from history, or rather, herstory. These clues make clear that it has not been cultural inertia which has kept women in the domestic sphere and their involvement in the labour market at a low level systematic political forces have operated. The historical evidence shows that women were actively excluded from the workforce1 and their independent economic activity within households was redefined as noneconomic. During the nineteenth century domestic labour was classified in official statistics as economic activity at the beginning of the twentieth century, it was redefined as noneconomic and expunged from the national accounts.2 From the time of colonisation to the beginning of the twentieth century and beyond, the poverty of most families ensured that virtually all members had to be economically active.3 Aboriginal women were also often involved in work, besides the significant economic activity they undertook in their traditional societies where they were responsible for the collection of about 80 per cent of the food.4 After colonisation many Aboriginal women were forced into domestic including sexual labour or work on properties, usually without financial remuneration. Women contributed to family finances through waged work outside the home which Edna Ryan has termed their visible breadwinning.5 In 1891 this involved about 37 per cent of women in Melbourne in the Sydney region, where there was less manufacturing, the figure was about 30 per cent.6 The census of 1891, however, classified only 17 per cent of women from New South Wales and 21 per cent from Victoria as breadwinners.7 A second strand of womens economic activity is identified by Ryan as invisible breadwinning. The visible and the invisible earners overlapped but the invisible women were more likely to be married and of mature age.8 The invisible economic activities consisted of women earning money wherever they could. Besides taking in lodgers or boarders, women worked to earn money by laundering, or sewing at home, going out to do sewing, domestic work or child minding teaching cultural accomplishments such as elocution, music, dancing, painting poultry keeping vegetable gardening cooking saleable edibles such as cakes and scones.9 From around the turn of the century, womens visible and invisible labour came to be progressively written out of economic history, as male unionists fought for and won a family wage for men. These unionists apparently believed that if they acknowledged the income earned by their wives, the case for higher wages would be undermined because the Arbitration Commission judges would take these earnings into account.10 Womens wages were lower, and their work was intermittent so it was, as Anne Curthoys has pointed out, important for workingclass women, as well as men, to secure the male wage from cheap competition.11 The unions might have taken the course of advocating equal pay to eliminate this possibility, but they did not choose to fight for this option. Gradually, through persistently denying their wives economic activity, union members were made to feel ashamed if they condoned it.12 Thus disapproval of womens employment and denial became a tradition, a myth distorting the true role of the history of women in Australia.13 A complementary facet of this process shows up in the construction of work in official statistics. Statisticians of the various states colluded with unionists by dividing the workforce into just two categories, breadwinners and dependants. Desley Deacon suggests that this was partly done in the interests of workingclass men.14 At the same time as married womens invisible employment was discouraged by male workers and denied by state statisticians, womens visible employment was being systematically restricted. Male unionists were intent on the exclusion of possible competition they managed to achieve a raft of restrictions to womens employment opportunities15 at the same time as they successfully excluded immigrant competition by means of the White Australia Policy. Arbitration Reports of the time show, during the period 1909 to 1912, women in New South Wales alone were prohibited from taking apprenticeships in more than twenty trades, including those of baker, butcher, pastrycook, and bootmaker. Some bans were industrywide, for example, in the iron trade. Even where women were allowed to enter, it was on far less favourable terms than their male counterparts.16 From the 1970s on, with the establishment of formal equal pay and the gradual introduction of antidiscrimination legislation, the extensive restrictions on womens employment have been progressively dismantled, clearing the way for women to participate in the workforce on a more equal gender basis. Recent Changes in Broad Outline Recent developments can be understood only in terms of the earlier patterns. What has been happening is a gradual undoing of past exclusions and the systematic absorption of women directly into the class structure as paid workersPreviously, at least from the turn of the twentieth century, the relationship of the majority of women to the economic system, and hence the class system, was mediated by male kin through their role as workers or, in a minority of cases, owners. Women are now moving into a more direct relationship to the class system as they take on the role of worker. While the process of change has been supported and indeed, promoted by the womens movement, it has been driven by economic imperatives, particularly the increasing demand for labour and, more recently, attempts to restructure and make more flexible the conditions of work in many industries. It can readily be suggested that the logic of capital is best served by a large workforce of people who consequentially have greater spending power, and who are prepared to work under conditions that suit employers interests.18 The changes have advantages for women insofar as they provide a degree of economic independence and place women squarely within the main structures of the society. They have disadvantages because women still occupy the least powerful positions in the employment structures, at the same time as they maintain major responsibility for the domestic sphere. Advantages and disadvantages notwithstanding, womens lives are being modernised. To be largely confined to the domestic sphere today, in contrast to peasant societies where the home is also the site of productions, means exclusion from the socially powerful economic sphere. Changes are not confined to the labour market. Many consequential strands of social policy can be pointed to as well. Social security provisions, for example, are moving away from defining women as mothers and wives, and moving towards defining them as workers. Policies in such areas as wages, education and training, childcare, equal employment opportunity and affirmative action have contributed to and accelerated the general trend. Women are thus gaining a place, albeit a secondary place, in the public domain, rather than largely being confined to the family sphere. The gradual convergence of mens and womens involvement in the labourforce and the manner in which they are defined by public policy can be encapsulated as a move for women away from private dependency, and from a marginal to a more central role in the economy. The process is by no means complete, but it is readily discernible in virtually all countries. The movement of women into paid employment has led to an increase in their general wellbeing. This is particularly evident in Third World countries where, broadly, the higher the rate of womens employment outside the home and the higher their education levels, the longer their lifeexpectancy.19 It should be noted that in Western societies, since the beginning of the process of industrialisation, poor single and married women have usually not had much option but to stay in the labourforce despite bad working conditions, restricted work opportunities and low rates of pay. Nonetheless, social policy treated women as if they were financial dependants. This is nowhere more evident than in womens award wages in Australia during the first half of the century. Womens wages were set at just over 50 per cent of the male rate, regardless of their responsibilities. All adult men received the full rate of the male family wage, whether or not they had a family. Single men were the major beneficiaries of this single women, especially those with dependants, were the great losers. The family wage component of award wages was abolished only in 20 Despite increasing female employment, there remains substantial financial dependence among partnered women. In the early 1980s the proportion of women in ten OECD countries who were totally financially dependent on their partners ranged from a low of 2 per cent in Sweden to a high of 2 per cent in the Netherlands. The Australian figure was 46 per cent in 1981, but dropped to 6 in Given that the proportion of women in employment has risen since then, this figure would no doubt be lower today. Only a minute proportion of women have achieved complete economic equality with their partners. This ranges from a high of 6 per cent in Sweden to a low of 6 per cent in Switzerland. Australia occupies one of the higher rankings, despite the fact that a modest 7 per cent of women are in positions of economic parity with their partners.21 Women certainly are being drawn into the labour market. But they are entering a secondary rather than a primary labour market, with poorly paid, often parttime, jobs a narrow range of occupations and, for mothers in particular, fragmented working lives. Both inside and outside the workforce, women are still subject to many impediments to equal power and equal resources. The restricted involvement of partnered women in the economy and their economic dependence is a major impediment to equality. As well, it remains a fundamental factor in the construction of family relationships. Decisions within families, particularly about who does the parenting, have been shown to be significantly influenced by the superior earning capacity of the male partner.22 Labourforce Participation When we turn to the major characteristics of womens participation in the labourforce, we find that mens and womens participation rates have been gradually moving closer together. This trend has been fed from two directions. There has been a gradual reduction in male participation rates at the same time as there has been an increase in the participation rate of women see Figure 1. Between 1981 and 1991 the overall rate of employment for men dropped from 77 per cent to 74 per cent it maintained a high level, well over 90 per cent, for those men in the age bracket where the rate of child dependency is highest.23 During the period between 1970 and 1986, while the labourforce rate for all men fell by 10 per cent, the rate for married women rose by 12 per cent from 2 per cent to 1 per cent.24 These trends have continued since. Although the overall labourforce participation rates for married and single women are at the same levels today, with married womens rates actually slightly higher, the age profile for married women shows a singular pattern and is clearly linked to family responsibilities. For males, the employment rate rises to age thirtyfour then plateaus to age fiftyfour."

        "text": "1 G.A. Wilkes and Australian Literature Elizabeth Webby In an interview recorded by Hazel de Berg in 1966, four years after he became the inaugural Professor of Australian Literature at the University of Sydney, G.A. Wilkes noted that he got the habit of reading fairly early .1 His first encounter with Australian authors came in his final year of high school when he began reading people like Henry Handel Richardson and Brennan . The two authors named were, significantly, to be the first on whom Wilkes carried out extensive original research. In an unusual move for the time late 1940s he chose to write his English Honours thesis on Henry Handel Richardson and, subsequently, his Masters on Christopher Brennan. During these early years at Sydney University, Wilkes also began his involvement with Southerly, Australias oldest literary quarterly, then being edited by another staff member, Guy Howarth. His first appearance in print there was in the third number for 1949, as a reviewer of the 1948 volumes of Australian Poetry and the Jindyworobak Anthology. Though only twentytwo, he had already adopted the measured and judicious tones that were to become familiar to generations of university students, noting that while the editors of these anthologies Judith Wright and Roland Robinson had dealt adequately with the verse of the periodicals...their selection from the poetry published in book form had not been so felicitous . p. 155 While none of his thesis on Henry Handel Richardson was published, Wilkes did review Nettie Palmers Henry Handel Richardson A Study 1950 in Southerly 1, 1951. As in many of his later reviews, he drew attention to the lack of scholarly exactitude, especially in Nettie Palmers failure to note sources for new information and to correct factually wrong details given in Richardsons autobiography. In 1950 G.A. Wilkes became editorial secretary of the English Association, Sydney Branch, the publishers of Southerly, and assisted with the editing of the journal during Howarths absence overseas in He also contributed articles on two other Australian women writers, The Progress of Eleanor Dark 3,1951 and The Novels of Katharine Susannah Prichard4,1953. While our understanding and appreciation of the work of both these novelists has been enlarged by subsequent criticism, especially from feminist perspectives, there would still be general agreement with many of Wilkess views, for example that Working Bullocks, Coonardoo and Intimate Strangers are central to Prichards achievement as a novelist. During the 1950s, however, G.A. Wilkess major contribution to Australian literary criticism and scholarship was undoubtedly his MA thesis on Brennan, resulting in the series of articles New Perspectives on Brennans Poetry, published in Southerly during 19523 and subsequently issued as a monograph. Wilkes also wrote a general account of Brennan and his work for The Union Book of 1952, published by Sydney University Union in celebration of the centenary of the University. Here he outlined the significant reinterpretation of Poems 1913 argued in more detail in his Southerly articles and book The 1913 volume, one cannot insist too often, is a continuum, demanding appraisal not as a mere collection of poems, but as a single entity. Brennan fashioned it, quite consciously, according to the principles of the symbolist livre composeacutedotted line p.164. Though critics continue to debate the value of Brennans contribution to Australian literature, this reading of Poems 1913 put forward by Wilkes in the early fifties remains the accepted one. He went on to publish several other articles and notes on Brennan during the fifties Brennan and Blake Southerly, 1,1954 The Writings of C.J. Brennan A Check List Meanjin, 2, 1956 Brennan and his Literary Affinities Australian Quarterly, 2, 1959 all showing the detailed scholarship which, while the norm in studies of English authors, had much less frequently been applied to Australian ones. In the 1966 de Berg interview, Wilkes noted that Australian literature differed from English in the sense that there are so many authors on whom no monograph exists, no biography has been written, no edition has been prepared, and the only way this can be done properly, I think, is by training people at the universities, research students, to do this kind of work . While there has been a considerable improvement in this situation over the past twentyfive years as Brian Kiernan notes in his essay in this collection, for example, we now have some substantial biographies of major writers much still needs to be done. Wilkess work on Brennan remains a model of the sort of meticulous and wideranging scholarship that is required. G.A. Wilkes continued to publish a significant number of articles on Brennan in the first half of the 1960s, culminating in his chapter in Geoffrey Duttons The Literature of Australia 1964. The decade following his appointment to the Chair of Australian Literature was, however, marked by a series of critical articles on other major Australian writers, nearly all published in Southerly, which he also began editing in These essays, on A.D. Hope, Judith Wright, Henry Lawson, R.D. FitzGerald, Joseph Furphy and Patrick White, were clearly related to the Honours courses on Australian literature which he was developing at Sydney University at the same time. So, too, were some overview articles on Australian literature and how it should be taught, such as A Course in Australian Poetry Poetry Magazine, 6, 1963 and The Development of Australian Literature, published in the Indian journal Literary Criterion 3, 1964. This work on establishing and making better known the canon of Australian literature culminated at the end of the 1960s in Australian Literature A Conspectus 1969, an expansion of a series of lectures given in 1967 for the Foundation for Australian Literary Studies at the then University College of Townsville.2 Here, partly no doubt because of the original threelecture format, Wilkes provided an alternative to the fourstage division of Australian literary history given in H.M. Greens pioneering A History of Australian Literature 1961 by consolidating Greens first two periods, 17891850 and 185090, into one Colonial Period to 1880. The decision to begin the Nationalist Period in 1880, rather than in 1890 as Green had, can be seen as part of the reappraisal of the significance of the 1890s begun by Wilkes in a 1956 lecture later printed as Literature in the Eighteen Nineties in Australia,3 and subsequently collected in Grahame Johnstons Australian Literary Criticism 1962. Here, while agreeing that many writers of the 1890s do make a vigorous use of Australian material, and their work is coloured by the political sentiment of the time , he goes on to argue that this was not the only kind of writing that was being done in the nineties...and may not have been the best writing that was being done. p.19 As well as Lawson and Furphy, this decade produced Brennan and Henry Handel Richardson, whose work is neither particularly Australian nor particularly political in the 1890s sense of these terms. Furthermore, Wilkes argued, Lawson and Furphy should be valued for the literary qualities rather than the nationalist or historical features of their work. Although he was appointed to the Challis Chair of English Literature in 1966, Wilkess work on Australian literature continued. During the 1960s and, more particularly, the 1970s, Wilkess earlier reappraisal of the 1890s led to a reassessment of nineteenthcentury Australian Literature. In the early sixties he had cooperated with A.G.Mitchell on an edition of J.F. Mortlocks Experiences of a convict transported for twentyone years 18645, published by Sydney University Press in The following year he told Hazel de Berg about some of the research involved in this, undertaken not just in Tasmania, but in London, Cambridge and California. He also spoke of his desire to see a series of Australian literary reprints that brought back into print some of the authors of the nineteenth century especially. This was eventually to come to fruition, if for an unfortunately limited season only, in the series Australian Literary Reprints issued by Sydney University Press during the 1970s with Wilkes as general editor. Wilkes also provided introductions to two of these, facsimile editions of Brennans Poems 1913 and Charles Tompsons Wild Notes from the Lyre of a Native Minstrel, originally published in Sydney in Other important nineteenthcentury texts brought back into print in this series were Rolf Boldrewoods The Miners Right, Marcus Clarkes Old Tales of a Young Country and Henry Kingsleys The Hillyars and the Burtons. In addition to his work on the Reprints series, Wilkes edited a collection of nineteenthcentury Australian poetry, concentrating on the work of Charles Harpur, Henry Kendall and Adam Lindsay Gordon, The Colonial Poets 1974. This, fortunately, has remained in print, enabling several generations of students to be introduced to at least some pretwentiethcentury Australian poetry. In an earlier article, The Emergence of the Australian Novel Hemisphere, April 1965 he had argued as in his 1956 lecture on the 1890s against a confusion of literary values with historical and nationalist ones . A further extension of this led to a questioning of just what, for the nineteenth century, constituted a genuinely Australian vision p.22 and to the conclusion To a surprising extent, the conception of the typical Australian that was becoming established in the earlier nineteenth century, and the dream of a Utopian future for the new southern continent entertained by an early poet like Harpur, anticipated ideals that the Nineties school came to think of as peculiar to itself. p.24 These ideas were further explored during the 1970s in a series of articles published in Southerly Kingsleys Geoffry Hamlyn A Study in Literary Survival 4,1972 Going Over the Terrain in a Different Way An Alternative View of Australian Literary History 2, 1975 and The Australian Legend Some Notes Towards Redefinition 3, 1977. The culmination of this strand of Wilkess contribution to the study of Australian literature came with The Stockyard and the Croquet Lawn Literary Evidence for Australias Cultural Development 1981. Here Wilkes argues against the binary oppositions which have so persistently coloured interpretations of Australias literary and cultural development the antithesis of the genteel and the robust, the refined and the crude, the old world and the new. There are, as he points out, other modes of literary nationalism than the antiEnglish one associated with the 1890s, just as there are alternative literary traditions to the realism so often seen as the Australian tradition. While Wilkes remains fairly conservative in the range of literature he draws on for evidence, ignoring nineteenthcentury drama and most womens writing for example, he does demonstrate the need for inclusive rather than exclusive definitions of Australias cultural identity. The need has become even more obvious in the decade since The Stockyard and the Croquet Lawn was published, as Aborigines, women and writers from nonEnglishspeaking backgrounds make increasingly important contributions to the corpus of Australian literature. In the fortyodd years since he began publishing, then, one can sum up G.A. Wilkess contribution to the understanding and assessment of Australias literature and literary culture under three broad headings. First, his pioneering research on Christopher Brennan demonstrated the value, and the need, of applying to Australian texts the kinds of scholarly assumptions and apparatuses that were then common in the study of English and American ones. Second, his detailed critical studies of major Australian authors, especially those increasingly set for study at schools and universities, led to a wider knowledge and appreciation of their work. And, third, his reappraisal of the significance of nineteenthcentury Australian literature demonstrated that colonial does not necessarily mean inferior or unAustralian writing. Though his work in these three areas was undertaken in a roughly chronological progression from first to third, they do, of course, all interconnect. Wilkess study of Brennan, for example, feeds into a reassessment of the significance of the 1890s, which leads in its turn to a reconsideration of earlier writing. The germ of The Stockyard and the Croquet Lawn can be found in the lecture on the 1890s given in Equally, Wilkes continued to publish on such major figures as Christopher Brennan, R.D. FitzGerald and Joseph Furphy well into the 1890s. His study of FitzGerald was published in 1981 as part of Oxford University Presss Australian Writers and their Works series, while Joseph Furphys Such is Life appeared in One new departure, however, was work in the area of Australian English, most notable in the production of A Dictionary of Australian Colloquialisms, first published in 1978, with a second edition in 1985 and a third in"

        "text": "Law limits native title Canberra bid to ease Mabo fear By WALLACE BROWN national affairs editor in Canberra NATIVE title will be extinguished over residential, pastoral and tourism leases under federal Mabo legislation. In other cases, such as mining, Aborigines will not have automatic veto over the use of the land. But companies will be obliged to take part in a process in which a special tribunal will try to settle any disputed negotiations, and the federal or state government will have the final say. Compensation by governments to Aborigines will be capped. Existing Aboriginal reservations in tourism areas will be excepted under the new law. In Brisbane, Premier Wayne Goss welcomed news of the federal move. I hope they have taken into account the range of issues raised by the states in particular relating to mining leases, to problems with funding Aboriginal land councils, the revival of native title and validation of titles issued before 1975, he said. We will be asking for a copy of the legislation dotted line so we can start drafting our own legislation to validate existing titles in Queensland for instance Comalcos Weipa project. Mr Goss earlier vowed to protect Comalcos bauxite mining against claims of native title. Comalco said its 75 billion investment had been put at risk by native title claims. Australian Mining Industry Council executive director Lauchlan McIntosh said the exclusion of mining leases from developments which extinguished native title was absolute nonsense. He said the Federal Governments approach could lead to reduced investment. PhotoCaption Its a nonsense to suggest that you might move two thousand million tonnes of materials in a mine and it doesnt extinguish native title and yet if you build a few houses it does, Mr McIntosh said. Wheres the equity in all this We have to have a practical outcome you cant have a practical outcome if you have snippets of principles being leaked to the press. Aboriginal leaders said the legislation would jeopardise many land claims in Queensland. Activist Michael Mansell said pastoral claims in north Queensland, the Northern Territory and especially Western Australia were in doubt. Some of the these claims wont even get a hearing, he said. Mr Mansell said aborigines now had to attack the Government in the international arena and learn from black South Africans fight against apartheid. He said Aborigines would discuss seeking international support through trade sanctions, political boycotts and fighting Australias bid for the Olympics. He foreshadowed a big Aboriginal response to the about face. Foundation for Aboriginal and Islander Research Action coordinator Bob Weatherall said Aborigines would be disappointed. He said the decision inadvertently gave miners and pastoralists more rights and awarded minimal rights to Aborigines. The High Courts historic Mabo decision in June 1992 rejected the longheld principle of terra nullius that the land was not owned before British possession was declared 200 years ago. The decision recognises prior title by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Federal Cabinet reached key decisions on Mabo legislation in six hours of discussions yesterday. The legislation, aimed at clarifying the complicated Mabo issue and reassuring people on all sides of the argument, will be introduced in Parliament by AttorneyGeneral Michael Lavarch in the Budget session starting on August In some instances the states may need to introduce complementary legislation but, under the Constitution, Commonwealth law supersedes state law. The sticking points with the states which Cabinet discussed yesterday are understood to include Aborigines rights to negotiation. Under the new law, companies must consult Aborigines before any activity begins on Aboriginal land. If no agreement is reached, a new tribunal will arbitrate. The Crown either the Federal Government or a state government will be able to override a tribunal decision if, in its opinion, the decision does not accord with the national interest. Where there is not yet acknowledged native title, state land management authorities will be able to issue grants of interest in the land in effect a potential lease, subject to the fact that the lessees may be required later to pay Aborigines compensation for native title. Compensation will be capped at the freehold value of the land, to be determined by the tribunal. But more than freehold value will be required if there is special Aboriginal attachment to the land. Sources said the proposed legislation would make it clear that Aborigines will not lose any existing land or rights. United Graziers Association of Queensland chief David Moore said his organisation welcomed the Governments move but said the problem was still far from solved. Mr Moore said landholders could still be liable for court costs involved in defending their leases against claims. He said federal legislation should take care not to override legislation already in place in Queensland. Queensland legislation recognises areas outside leases such as water courses, stock routes and water points, he said. Federal legislation should not ignore this. Cairns casino winner named BY ROB CULLINAN in Cairns A CONSORTIUM involving the Australian Olympic Committee has won preferred applicant status for the new Cairns casino a 160 million development to be built on the controversial Customs HouseAnzac Park site. State Treasurer Keith De Lacy announced yesterday that Cabinet had approved the Reef Consortium as the preferred applicant and that construction could begin on the project before the end of the year. Mr De Lacy said the Reef Consortium was required to pay an upfront fee of 36 million to pay for a new convention centre which would further boost Cairns status as a major tourist destination. Mr De Lacy will be holding talks with Cairns Mayor Kevin Byrne today and said an announcement on the convention centre would be made later in the week. But Ald Byrne and other community leaders yesterday expressed disappointment at the decision to build the casino and hotel on the Customs HouseAnzac Park site. Ald Byrne was joined by the National Trust, Aboriginal groups and the State Opposition in claiming the State Government had ignored the wishes of local interest groups. A spokesman for the Yirrganydji tribe said they would be seeking a Supreme Court injuction to prevent any work taking place on the site. The Yirrganydji people are in the process of preparing a Mabostyle claim for Anzac Park. Three tenders applied to build the casino on the controversial site with a fourth tender opting for a disused railway site on the fringe of the central business district. The Reef Consortium includes international casino operators Casinos Austria, hotel group Country Comfort Trust, the AOC, and Touraust Mangement Pty Ltd. Mr De Lacy said the proposal included restoring Customs House and doubling the size of Anzac Park through the addition of land from the Cairns Port Authority site opposite. I think youll find that most people in Cairns, when they look at the quality of the design, the sympathetic treatment to Customs House and the fact Anzac Park has not only been preserved but about doubled in size, that most of the concerns dotted line will evaporate, he said. Mr De Lacy said he was aware of Aboriginal interest in relation to Anzac Park and said that any issues arising from this would be resolved at the appropriate time in a way that was fair to all concerned. He said the successful consortium won preferred status on the basis of its design. The proposal involves a relatively lowrise, lowimpact building that will enhance the character of Cairns, he said. As well as an initial 45gaming table and 540machine casino, the complex will also include 130 fivestar hotel rooms and suites. The most outstanding feature of the building, however, will be a magnificent rooftop observatory featuring local rainforest plants. Mr De Lacy said the casino was due to open in May 4600 rail jobs to go Sweeteners for idle staff EXCLUSIVE By TONY KOCH A FURTHER 4600 Queensland Rail jobs will be shed in the next five years, confidential documents show. The attempt to make the department commercially competitive comes amid embarrassing details of idle railway staff who are not allowed to be sent where they are needed. In one case new employees were contracted for a rail project while workers in a nearby town had no work to do. The documents say that even after the shedding there will be an estimated 1364 surplus staff by 1998, costing 57 million in pay. Railway employees whose jobs have been swallowed up in recent government rail closures and rationalisation have refused to accept voluntary redundancy packages on offer. Queensland Rail is being advised to sweeten the deals or come up with more creative redundancy packages so employees will take the money and go. The department is running into problems because of the stated policy of Transport Minister David Hamill barring dismissals, forced retrenchments or forced relocations. Already dozens of railway employees in centres throughout Queensland including Maryborough, Toowoomba, Warwick and Wallangarra are doing nothing or are enrolled in TAFE courses learning skills such as smallengine maintenance in the hope they might start lawnmowing businesses. The employees cannot be moved to other centres. For example, Toowoomba has up to 20 redeployees employees who are paid but have no work to do. Just down the range from Toowoomba, the Ipswich to Rosewood line is being electrified but the work was not offered to them. Instead, employees have been especially contracted to do it. The department is considering offering some of its redeployees gainful employment working on roads for local authorities. But Queensland Rail would continue to pay their wages because of Mr Hamills commitment on no forced redeployment or retrenchment. Mr Hamill said last night that since the voluntary early retirement package was introduced in April 1991 there had been 3700 applications, of which about 3000 had been accepted. Despite any suggestion from anyone in the human resources area in QR, the Governments position is very clear that we will not be changing our policy position. VERs will be used, he said. If that means dotted line that QR goes through a period of carrying surplus staff, so be it. It is not the fault of these people that the railways have been run down or technological change is altering the number and nature of jobs available in QR. The staff problem has been worsened by Cabinets decision last week to close most of the spur lines in northern and western Queensland, putting in jeopardy up to 530 rail jobs including 70 train crew and 98 shunting staff. There are 126 jobs involved in the CharlevilleCunnamullaQuilpie closures alone. In Gayndah there are 26, Mitchell 18, Mareeba 43, Blackall 18 and Winton A confidential Queensland Rail document outlining the proposed strategies for the deployment and outplacement of surplus staff was prepared for QR human resources management head David Hemple as a briefing paper for QR chief Vince ORourke. It says Queensland Rail is currently facing a period of unprecedented largescale restructuring which will necessarily involve a number of positions being declared surplus. QR will be carrying additional salary and wages of 57 million by 1998, an unacceptable amount especially in light of the pressure dotted line to operate on a commercial basis. The only options currently available to QR management include natural attrition through resignation or retirement, or VERs. Schools warn of fee rises PARENTS of the 140,000 children in Queenslands private schools would face fee increases under State Government plans to cut funding, school groups warned last night. The funding cut, which Education Minister Pat Comben said would be less than half a percent, would represent at least 4 a student based on last years 9 million State Government funding of nongovernment schools. Mr Comben said yesterday the 199394 private shcools grant would be more than ever before. But a Federal government decision to slash 115 million from Queenslands share of states grants forced cuts to private schools funding. Association of Independent Schools of Queensland executive director Bradley Smith said funding cuts would lead to fee increases in the associations 115 member schools. It also would have an impact on struggling bush boarding schools already battling the rural crisis."

        "text": "Qumran, in the Wilderness of Judea, had been the place of exile of the Essenes since at least the second century BC. They were the old aristocrats, who longed for a return to the great days of Israel, when a David was on the throne and a Zadokite high priest was in the temple.1 While they waited and prayed for such a Restoration, their priests performed all the services in a courtyard on the barren plateau, acting as if it were a temple. The lay acolytes who had accompanied them into exile lived a monastic existence in the large building east ofthe aqueduct, devoting their lives to the service of the priests and to prayer. Every day, at ll a.m., the monks ceased their work and came to the large stepped cistern on the east side of their building. Taking off their working clothes and leaving only a loincloth, they went down into the water and had a long, refreshing bath.2 The cisterns, of which there were five with steps, were supplied with water directed through an aqueduct leading from the wady Qumran, a winter stream that filled them up once a year.3Taking a bath not only washed away sweat, but washed away sin, for the men must now be in a perfectly holy state. They were about to eat the holy food of priests, acting as if they themselves were priests. A Jewish priest had to be born into a special tribe, that of Levi. They enjoyed many privileges, especially the tithe system, by which ordinary men supported them fully giving them onetenth of their income, usually in the form of produce such as corn and grapes.4 When the old families of priests were expelled with the Davids, some devoted followers continued to bring them the tithes, believing that they were the only true priests blessed by God. It was this practice that distinguished village Essenes from other Jews. After they were exiled to Qumran, the tithe offerings made the difference between life and death. The priests and monks had water, from the deep round well that had been on the western side of the settlement since the eighth century BC but no food would grow in the barren wilderness, except a few vegetables near a spring three kilometres down the coast. Their supporters made the journey from the north, often from Galilee, to bring them the food. In return they were allowed to stay for a time, to receive instruction and to take part in the prayers. Tithe offerings should be eaten only by priests on behalf of God. But the worker monks needed to be fed also. So the practice grew up of admitting them to the meal of priests and treating them as honorary priests, in a state of acquired purity through their ritual baths. The meal was called the Purity, a term often found in the scrolls5, and it was used as a means of exercising discipline. If a monk broke any of the strict rules of behaviour, by disobedience to superiors, by bearing malice against a companion, even by guffawing loudly, he was excluded from the Purity for periods ranging from ten days to a year.6 The elements in the sacred meal consisted of bread and new wine. At the beginning they were blessed, the wine and bread together by the priest, then the bread alone by the levite.7 This meal has always been seen to resemble the Christian communion meal, and the history of the relation between the two groups shows that this was, in fact, its original form. The building at Qumran, and its related outposts down the coast of the Dead Sea, played a vital part in the events recorded in the pesher of the gospels. The Qumran buildings stood on an elongated plateau, separated by a narrow neck of land from a row of brown limestone cliffs in the background. They were in two clusters, separated by a wide corridor running northsouth, down which the aqueduct ran to feed the water systems. On the west side of the corridor, around the deep round well, was a group of small and larger rooms, including a long northsouth courtyard. On the east side a large square building, with a tower in its northwest corner, plainly acted as the main centre for monastic life. It was enclosed within what had been an ancient wall going back hundreds of years to the earlier Israelite settlement.8 Outside the wall on the south stood a long, wellproportioned hall running eastwest, and attached to it on its south a room called the pantry, as hundreds of dishes were piled up in it.9 This hall opened directly on to the esplanade, the long southern projection of the plateau. The esplanade terminated in steep cliffs rising directly from the bed of the wady Qumran below. Throughout the settlement was a number of rectangular cisterns with steps leading down to them, plainly used for ritual bathing the round well was sufficient for drinking water. One large cistern, outside the wall on the southwest side, had no steps within it. The buildings on the Qumran plateau, built from the stones with which the whole area is plentifully littered, were the main centre, constructed when the exiles came there in the second century BC. But in the Wilderness of Judea round about was a number of outposts of the monastery. Their location, if measured in Greek stadia, corresponds exactly to certain locations in the gospels. A stadion was 607 feet and five stadia l012 yards, or 2024 cubits, roughly a kilometre.10 Five stadia down from the neck of land leading to the main plateau stood a building whose few remains have been described by archaeologists.11 It came to be called the queens house, for reasons that will be seen later, and it occupied a significant place in the story of Jesus. About two kilometres further down, or three kilometres fifteen stadia from Qumran lie the ruins of Ain Feshkha on the shores of the Dead Sea itself. Now a favourite swimming resort for Israelis, the bases of the walls lie, half hidden in grass and shrubs, just off the main path. They include the remains of a fine Herodian door.12 Another fifteen stadia down the shoreline, past the great headland of Ras Feshkha, stand the ruins of another building, now called Khirbet ruin of Mazin, just a little north of the exit of the wady Kidron into the Dead Sea.13 This building is thus thirty stadia six kilometres from Qumran, and twentyfive from the queens house. It includes the remains of a great watergate, which must have stood at the end of a short channel leading up from the sea the distance to the sea is now a little over two hundred cubits one hundred yards. These distances may seem unimportant at first sight, but they become very relevant when a device used in the pesher is understood. After they had been exiled to the wilderness, the Essenes came to believe that they were establishing their own temple and Jerusalem at Qumran. They began to call it Jerusalem, in the way that expatriates name places in their new country after places in the homeland. To distinguish between the two, they drew on two forms of the name Jerusalem, and these were able to be reproduced in Greek. When the singular form of the word was used, the real Jerusalem was meant when the plural, it was the New Jerusalem, Qumran. The two forms of the name also served the purposes of secrecy when it became necessary. Qumran became a centre for those loyal to the traditional priests to visit. Councils were held there, and the government of the Essenes was centred at Qumran and its outposts. When a certain leader who was the bishop of Galilee came to Ain Feshkha for the seasonal councils held at the equinoxes and solstices, he brought Galilee with him, for in their understanding of the role of a bishop, he was so identified with his bishopric that it resided in his person. The Christian Church still follows the same principle. An archbishop takes as his surname the name of his city, for example, John London, so that, in a sense, wherever he is London is. When the bishop of Galilee was at Ain Feshkha, it was called Galilee. Ain Feshkha, which had been established as the place to which monks went when they were temporarily expelled from the monastery, was used at the time of their visits by men who had the status of outside celibates. The story includes such a leader who came from Samaria thus the building by the shore of the Dead Sea was Samaria while he was there. Mazin, further down beyond the headland, was used by men of lower status. Some of these were Essene villagers who met in Capernaum, on Lake Galilee. When they came to Mazin for the seasonal councils, it became Capernaum. The boat trips taken by Jesus and the disciples were on the Dead Sea, not on Lake Galilee. To go the three kilometres between Mazin and Ain Feshkha, it was easier to go by boat, as the headland of Ras Feshkha came right to the sea, forming a natural barrier. It was Mazin that was the Capernaum at twentyfive or thirty stadia according to a story in Johns gospel. This gospel is strangely inconsistent about locations it can be bafflingly vague about where things happened yet give exact distances in stadia where they do not seem to be needed. In one place it says that the disciples, rowing in a boat to Capernaum, travelled to a spot at twentyfive or thirty stadia.14 Mazin is thirty stadia from Qumran and twentyfive from the queens house, which acted as an outer boundary to Qumran. In another episode at Capernaum in John s gospel, a net of fish was dragged two hundred cubits one hundred yards to the shore. This was the length of the channel at Mazin, leading up to the watergate. Johns gospel also says that Bethany was fifteen stadia from Jerusalem, using the plural form of the name. Ain Feshkha is exactly this distance from Qumran. It reproduced the original Bethany, at about this distance east of Jerusalem, when the locations were moved to Qumran. The distances were related to hours of walking. The rate, in the hot dry conditions, was five stadia per hour. Thus it took one hour to go to the queens house, three to Ain Feshkha, and six to Mazin. The neck of land was the starting point of measurements because it was at the top of the chasm down which everyone had to walk to go south. The purity rules of the Temple Scroll, a product of Palestinian Essenes, show that when a man became unclean he had to stay away for varying lengths of time and wash himself and his clothes before coming back.15 At Ain Feshkha, the first outpost south, archaeologists found the remains of some shallow pools, with a white deposit over the bottom. Analysis proved it to be calcium carbonate. Beside the pools were paved terraces with cylindrical stones lying lengthwise.16 These arrangements can be accounted for as being used for the washing of clothes. Essenes rubbed their white linen garments with frankincense, a starch like substance consisting mainly of calcium carbonate.17 When they were washed the substance would come out, remaining on the bottom of the pool. The clothes would then be spread over the cylindrical stones to dry in the sun. Ain Feshkha was obviously the place to which monks went when they were expelled for episodes of uncleanness. It became also a place for celibates of the Diaspora, who because they did not live in the holy land, were classed as equal in status to such monks. Two further places in the wilderness were part of the monastic complex. One was the place now called Khirbet Mird or Hyrcania, nine kilometres inland, on about the same latitude as Ain Feshkha."

        "text": "Chapter Three RECONSTRUCTION REORIENTATION 19661993 Art was rarely considered to be a criticism of life or even of other art and was thought of as culture, an adjunct to gracious livingdotted lineMaterial wealth and the desire for culture also fostered the art prize. Many local government bodies, dotted lineprompted by citizens anxious to bring a measure of sweetness and light to their localities, provided moneys for annual art prizes1 Bernard Smith, Australian Painting 17881990, Oxford University Press, 1991, p.291 The establishment of the Manly Art Prize in 1962, and subsequent similar exhibitions, and the formations of an Auxilliary and an Art Group revitalised the Gallery to some extent, but what was needed was financial support. Manly Council became aware of the problems through Councillors Bannerman and Boyle, and their support was forthcoming in 1966, when plans were approved for the extension and renovation of the Art Gallery. This included an additional gallery, a storeroom, a new ceiling, an entrance through the Rubbo Annexe and improved lighting. The renovated building was opened on October 7th, An honorary Director, Mrs Clarice Thomas was appointed. Mrs Thomas is one of three daughters of the late John Young, cofounder of the Macquarie Galleries, Sydney, and had previously carried out restoration work on a number of paintings in the collection. She was to play a vital role in the reconstruction and reorientation years of Manly Art Gallery. Her work included the reestablishment of the collection and extended into areas of art administration which were developing in parallel with other small art institutions scattered throughout New South Wales, such as Broken Hill, Bathurst and Lismore. Such areas of administration included the shaping and establishment of workable policies covering acquisitions, exhibitions and the funding of public art institutions. These occurred as patronage of the arts gradually moved away from the individual to the Government between the 1940s and the early 1970s. When Clarice Thomas arrived at the Manly Art Gallery in 1966, the state of the Gallery represented a neglected and decaying 19th Century public institution. The Gallery itself consisted of a barn like building, now the main gallery, with pictures tiered up the walls reminiscent of an auction room. Various works were stacked on the kitchen floor, where she found a Grace Cossington Smith painting on a loose piece of canvas. Old photographs were uniformly framed in concertina style on the side walls. The entrance to the gallery was by a single door, and what now constitutes the Rubbo annexe was a small room on the harbourside of the main gallery in which paintings were stored. More works were held in Council Chambers and in the loft of the Council depot. A very old custodian sat next to the door. The cataloguing system consisted of a small list of pictures which was inaccurate many of the works had been crossed out as having gone to the tip or had been sold by tender.2 Heika CostinNeilsen, An Interview With Clarice Thomas, Art Write, Vol 1, Number 4, Dec. 1993 During her time with the Gallery the Art and Historical Collection was gathered together and properly catalogued after the almost irreparable neglect suffered throughout the postwar years. Mrs Thomas expertise in saving pictures gave the collection new life and new direction and an active exhibition programme followed. Between 1966 and 1983, the Manly Art Gallery developed an exhibitions programme of a standard which rivalled many Sydney galleries and galleries interstate. Reflecting both local and national developments in Australian art, these exhibitions covered new areas and included printmakers, quilters, ceramic artists, and the retrospectives of individual artists. Exhibitions of the collection were interspersed with loan and travelling exhibitions. Ladies of Fashion, an exhibition by Anne Schofield during this time was purchased by the National Art Gallery in Melbourne in its entirety. Printmakers exhibitions included a 1976 Print Council of Australia Touring Exhibition and work shown from the Sydney Printmakers and the Print Circle. An Exhibition of Canadian Quilts was held in This presented an early recognition of craft based art which was to be a significant part of the Gallerys content in later years, notably in the exhibiting of ceramics, and annual quilt exhibitions. An acquisition fund was established in 1967 which attracted a membership to support the Gallery later called the MAGM Society, and through the instigation of selling exhibitions further acquisitions could be made. Between 1967 and 1983 the Gallery acquired paintings which added prestige and substance to its collection, purchasing representative works by Michael Kmit, Desiderius Orban, Donald Friend, Godfrey Miller, Kevin Connor, Ralph Balson, Thomas Cleghorn, Rodney Milgate, Carl Plate and Clem Millward. Some purchases were made to fill areas in earlier periods buy artists such as Margaret Preston and Jean Appleton. The major purchase of the Annunciation by Tom Thompson was also made in Acquisitions were made adhering to the policy of intimate works for this small gallery, and Mrs Thomas acquired many works at her own expense, later being reimbursed by the Committee, demonstrating a strong commitment to the collection. These included a Sydney Long landscape and Fred Liests Salt Marshes. In 1968 the Manly Art Prize 19621984 was altered to become a selection exhibition at which purchases for the Gallery collection were selected by an art panel. Contemporary works by artists such as Hector Gilliland, Stan de Teliga, Guy Warren and Brian Dunlop were acquired through the Manly Art Prize. Aware that the Gallery had to overcome the stigma that Manly was across the harbour,although only seven miles from Sydney across the harbour can seem to be a long way when seeking media coverage for exhibitions,3 Clarice Thomas sought to develop the Gallery in a way which would make it unique to Sydney and also compliment other Sydney galleries. Heika CostinNeilsen, Notes on an Interview with Clarice Thomas, Manly Art Gallery Records, 1993 In 1968 the Gallery held its first ceramic exhibition which included one hundred and thirty items by invited potters. From this was purchased the first two pots of its collection, one by Peter Rushforth and the other by Hiroe Swen. Nowhere in Sydney could a permanent contemporary display of ceramics be seen, this was at the forefront of the crafts movement and was to become a unique collection. The ceramics collection grew steadily and its importance was further recognised in the establishment of the Lady Askin Ceramics Room, following the Lady Askin Bequest to the Gallery in This presently contains a permanent survey of ceramics tracing the development of studio work in Australia from the postwar years. From 1975 an annual ceramics exhibition was held which further contributed to the Gallery collection, including work by Derek Smith, Les Blakeborough, Jenny Orchard, Shiga Shigeo, Ian Mackay, Christine Ball and Peter Travis. By 1980 the Manly Art Gallerys Acquisition Policy had developed to include the following The established collection covering a broad spectrum from Martens and Piguenit, through Australian impressionism, to work of the Thirties and Forties, has broadly dictated the collecting pattern which is being pursued today. Because of the obvious educational value of these relatively small, intimate works that form the majority of the collection, the aim and policy is to unify, develop and extend it to cover more modern and contemporary areas with paintings of similar scale and significance, while also endeavouring to fill obvious gaps in the existing collection. Also, acquiring mostly relatively small works is a realistic policy as regards maneouvrability and accommodation in a small gallery, and with regard to the very limited funds for acquisition. Special attention is also being given to building the ceramic section, which is within the scope of our financial position and a definite need in the Sydney area.4 Manly Art Gallery Report to RGANSW, 1980, unpaginated The development of this policy signifies a defined direction for the art and ceramics collections and shows that the management of small public institutions maintained a regard for the educational value of works held within their collections. By the 1970s artists had come to be seen as part of an art market, the focus being on developing their careers through the cultivation of collectors. Terry Smith, in Australian Painting 17881990, describes this shift in focus as being due to the fact that The market took over from the artists societies the complex but crucial role of setting professional standards. photograph caption photograph caption Artists became part of what was known as a stable attached to particular commercial galleries and their work was tailored to what Terry Smith describes as appreciative audiences and the buying public. Small public art institutions such as Manly Art Gallery had no place in the commercial art market, and private patronage which previously had supported public galleries through gifts and bequests found it more profitable to invest in the marketplace. The Australian art market became a set of interlocking, interdependent institutions, and private and corporate sponsorship of the visual arts grew substantially. The greatest growth in arts patronage came, however, from governments. State government support continued to focus on the major capital city galleries, and expanded to a network of regional art galleries, especially in Victoria and New South Wales.5 Smith as in n.1, p.453 One of the most significant steps Clarice Thomas undertook in the administration of Manly Art Gallery was to include the Gallery as a founding member of the Regional Galleries Association of New South Wales, henceforth referred to as the RGANSW, which formed in This allowed the Gallery access to combined resources and to gain greater recognition through joint lobbying in the area of government funding. The origins of the Regional Galleries Association grew out of the perceived need of fifteen councils in New South Wales to gain greater recognition and support from government for their role as trustees of public art institutions, writes Michael Goss in Regional Galleries of New South Wales, a design, planning and development manual.6 Michael Goss, Regional Galleries of New South Wales a design, planning and development manual, RGANSW, 1987 As a result of such lobbying improvements occurred to the Gallery which would have been difficult to achieve by other means. In 1977 Manly Council financed the installation of further airconditioning and a year later the State Government provided for a new lighting system. These improvements brought the Gallery up to a standard desired for its collection. Although the acquisition fund established by Mrs Thomas in 1967 had instigated the ceramics collection, such selling exhibitions were not part of Manly Art Gallerys relationship with the RGANSW and, as of 1972, were no longer initiated. This limited growth of the collection in the short term. It was expected however, that the overall benefits of membership with the RGANSW ensured long term stability and permanency for the collection. A good collection takes at least a generation to form, while an art museum or gallery never stops evolving according to Goss. In hindsight, the RGANSW now clearly sees its role as that of a service organisation, and the decision not to initiate selling exhibitions during these three years seriously limited opportunities for acquisitions and the exhibiting of individual artists work, through oneman exhibitions. The new affluence of the Sixties had the consequence of an increase of solo exhibitions in commercial galleries, which came to take over from the annual exhibitions of the art societies, so significant up until the late Fifties.7 Smith as in n.1, p.292 Relying on government funds was a further consequence of this and Manly Art Gallery thus committed itself to becoming part of the official art culture which by the 1970s had come to dominate much art activity. This can be further seen in developments at Manly Art Gallery in the following years. The elaborate world of modernist practice, theory, criticism and connoisseurship, so recently triumphant, had ossified into an official art culture.8 ibid., p.453 Clarice Thomas management of the Manly Art Gallery was not developed in isolation and was reflective of the situation of other galleries in regional centres at the same time. Manly Art Gallery became part of the emergence in New South Wales of museums and galleries which were trustees of public art, with local government as their major patrons, during the 1970s and 1980s. Manly Art Gallery, therefore, also constituted part of what Michael Goss describes as a significant resource of inestimable national importance for the general public and practicing artist alike.9 Goss as in n.6, p.7 A grant from the Division of Cultural Activities, in 1981, to assist with the salary of a fulltime Director ensured the permanent care of the collection and a continuous programme of exhibitions. Mrs Thomas was appointed Director of Manly Art Gallery on March 17th, 1981, after serving as Honorary Director for fourteen years. A further grant from the State Government contributed towards the building of a Museum to adjoin the Gallery on the eastern side. These significant renovations provided, as well as the Museum, a new entrance and reception area, a kitchen and loading dock, to serve both Gallery and Museum, and the Rubbo annexe was doubled in size. The Art Gallery and Museum building was officially opened by the Premier, Mr. Neville Wran, on 13th September, 1982, by which time the complex had been officially named the Manly Art Gallery and Museum MAGM. The addition of an area to be used specifically as a Museum was largely the result of Council support through the vision and efforts of Ald. Joan Thorburn. The establishment of the Museum was not without difficulties. Originally conceived as a folk museum it was expected to house and exhibit memorabilia. Clarice Thomas was able to elevate the role of the museum by illuminating MAGMs regional based collections of beach culture and historical photographs. This gave the Museum a regional and historical role of significance. Given this context it would become unique to Sydney and had the potential to complement the Gallery. Under the Directorship of Clarice Thomas, MAGM saw the establishment and development of a number of acquisition policies, the essence of which are carried out by management today."

        "text": "2 APPROVING TRAVEL 1 INTRODUCTION The first step in arranging official travel is a decision that there is a need for the journey. This prompts three important questions Who makes the decision What other matters need to be decided And, how should these decisions be recorded This chapter addresses the first two questions and Chapter 3 looks at the third. 2 PRIOR APPROVAL When a journey requires air travel or overnight accommodation, cost may be substantial. For such travel it is therefore essential to have a reliable means of controlling payments. A system which focuses attention entirely on approval of payments after the trip risks creating a rubber stamp for ad hoc decisions made earlier in the process. Control of the travel payments system will be most effective if it starts in the planning stage with documented approval before the journey commences. A good prior approval system has several advantages. ADVANTAGES OF PRIOR APPROVAL bulleteliminates ad hoc decisions bulletensures consistent application of travel policy bulletprovides better control of the travel arrangements in each case bulletimproves planning and coordination bulletestablishes limits for expenditure bulletensures the person travelling knows what is expected of them bulletprovides a basis for checking subsequent payments bulletassists in budget management Approval in writing before a journey commences should be mandatory. In most cases this will be a relatively simple procedure. If the written authority to travel encompasses approval for all aspects of the journey it can streamline processing of the arrangements. If exceptional circumstances are likely to arise, where prior written approval is impossible, then the policy should clearly specify the exceptions and how they apply. If anyone can approve official travel the system will be difficult to control. On the other hand, if approving officers are too few to cope with the volume of travel, or they are too remote to assess travel needs properly, informal and perhaps inappropriate practices are likely to develop to overcome the difficulties. A balance between these extremes is needed. To meet the practical needs of the organisation and preserve accountability, an appropriate number persons of suitable seniority should be delegated to approve travel. Provisions should also be made for approval by a more senior officer for travel by delegated officers, as it is inappropriate for them to approve their own travel. Recommendation 1 Require prior written approval by a delegated officer for all travel involving an overnight stay away from home base. Prohibit approval of own travel by delegated officers. Approval for travel by local councillors is the responsibility of Council and should be given by specific Council resolution prior to the journey. The resolution, recorded in the minutes, is therefore the authority to travel. Notwithstanding this difference in the approval process, the underlying principles in the recommendations which follow are applicable to travel involving overnight stay by councillors. 3 BUDGET MANAGEMENT AND DELEGATIONS When travel is approved public money is committed. Proper management of resources improves efficiency and helps to eliminate misuse. Some organisations compromise this by separating the approval process from control or awareness of the budget. Approving officers who are unaware of their travel budget allocation cannot make informed decisions when planning or approving journeys. Those who are fully informed about expenditure to date, availability of funds, and journey costs have a greater incentive to eliminate inefficiency or misuse of funds than those who are isolated from such budgetary imperatives. It is also essential that those responsible for approving travel be given appropriate financial delegation. Delegations, which usually apply to a particular position rather than to individuals, should be in writing and should specify expenditure limits. Manuals or instruments of delegation, which sometimes do not reflect actual practices, require regular review and revision to ensure they continue to serve the practical needs of the organisation. Recommendation 2 Ensure all approving officers have appropriate financial delegation and access to sufficient budget information to make informed decisions. Review delegations regularly to ensure they are practical and reflect actual requirements. Sometimes it is necessary for more than one officer to be involved in the approval process. For example, a recommending officer may examine the details of each applicationauthority to travel and sign it prior to consideration by the approving officer. In large organisations, processing a lot of travel, approving officers may be able to improve efficiency by delegating the confirmation of certain details in this way. However, whenever it is necessary for more than one to be involved in approval there is always a risk that each person in the chain will assume that someone else is checking the details more thoroughly than they do. It is therefore prudent to eliminate any overlap in function by separating responsibilities and clearly defining the role of each person in the process. The responsibilities of all officers involved in considering andor approving travel should be fully documented in policies and procedures. Recommendation 3 Clearly define and document the responsibilities of approving officers. Separate responsibilities where there is a need for more than one person to be involved in considering an applicationauthority to travel. 4 KEY APPROVAL QUESTIONS The need for travel is the first question to be considered by the approving officer. Some types of travel are part of an annual plan, or are so integral to the agencys functions that the need for the trip is established well in advance. Nevertheless, even with such preestablished commitments, shifting priorities and competing work demands may force review of the need for each journey. Once the need for travel is established, several other questions should be considered before a journey is approved. The key approval questions are set out below. Properly addressed, these questions can ensure the most effective use of resources and limit misuse of public money. KEY APPROVAL QUESTIONS bulletIs the trip necessary bulletWho should travel bulletWhat mode of transport is appropriate bulletIs an overnight stay necessary bulletHow much will the trip cost bulletAre sufficient funds available How carefully these questions are considered will depend on bulletthe attitude of the decision maker bulletthe design of the system. A good approval system requires conscientious and wellinformed approving officers and procedures which encourage and facilitate consideration of the key questions. The relative importance of these questions may vary depending on the circumstances in each organisation. Approval systems can be designed to reflect these priorities and to ensure that the most important issues are explicitly considered. This may be achieved by bulleteducating approving officers about the nature of their responsibilities bulletproviding clear guidelines for decision making bulletdesigning formsprocedures which facilitate proper decisions. Recommendation 4 Require that approving officers consider the key approval questions concerning necessity for travel and overnight stay, appropriate person and mode of transport, cost and availability of funds before approving travel. 5 GUIDELINES Guidelines can help approving officers to consider the key approval questions in a systematic and fair way, consistent with the policies and priorities of the organisation. Guidelines may range from simple principles to comprehensive criteria for selecting from a range of options. Necessity for travel Factors determining the necessity for a particular trip will depend on the functions and priorities of the organisation. Some general principles may be sufficient to encourage proper consideration of this question. Issues which might be relevant, for example, are Can the work be completed in another way Is there an officer available in the region who can do the job Would it be sufficient to send one or two rather than five officers to a conference Appropriate person to travel Often circumstances dictate the appropriate person for a particular journey. For example, the travel may relate to a specific project, or require someone with particular skills, or address the training needs of an individual. However, where there is frequent travel by a pool of similarly qualified officers, a number of factors might influence selection of the appropriate person. Matters which might be considered include nature of the task and the seniority, skills, and experience of available officers distance to be travelled ie residential address may be significant in some cases workloads and personal preferences of available officers number of trips already undertaken by each officer. Personal preferences are a legitimate consideration, so long as they do not operate unfairly or in conflict with the public interest. Family or study commitments, relatives or friends living in particular destinations, may influence an officers willingness to travel. However, personal preferences should not have priority over workrelated considerations. Policy guidelines can assist approving officers to ensure that the needs of the organisation are given priority and that opportunities to travel are fairly allocated among equally qualified officers. Mode of transport Policies often require travel by the most economic mode of transport, but delegates sometimes have insufficient details to make an informed assessment of this. Choosing the most economic mode of transport is not simply a matter of finding the cheapest fare. For example, time in transit and accommodation costs can influence the choice between travel by car or by air. When several officers are travelling to the same destination it may be more economical for them to travel together by car rather than by air. Sometimes the importance of getting an officer to the destination quickly will outweigh the cost of transport. Policy which specifies a preferred mode or modes of travel and requires officers to provide cost comparisons for any proposed alternatives including extra accommodation costs etc can help to ensure the most appropriate mode of transport is used. Guidelines can alert approving officers to some of the common traps and assist them to decide on the best way to travel in each case. Necessity for overnight stay If the destination is sufficiently close to an officers residence that it is practical to return home every evening then an overnight stay may be unnecessary. The need for overnight accommodation and the number of nights required will also be affected by how long the job is likely to take. In assessing this issue it is obviously important to take account of the reasonable comfort of the person travelling. Nevertheless, delegated approving officers should be encouraged to give special attention to situations where there is doubt that expenses will be properly incurred. Such cases may warrant refusal or reduction of an allowance for accommodation expenses. Recommendation 5 Establish guidelines for application of the key approval questions. 3 DOCUMENTING APPROVAL 1 INTRODUCTION Records of decisions are essential for keeping track of travel expenditure. Efficiency and control can be enhanced by well designed forms and other systems of documentation. The aim is to limit travel payments to properly authorised official journeys, to minimise illicit, duplicate, or excess payments, and to ensure incorrect payments are recovered. 2 AUTHORITY TO TRAVEL Methods of documenting the authority to travel vary considerably from diary entries to rosters, memoranda, forms, schedules of multiple assignments, or Council resolutions. Whatever method is used, the authority to travel should constitute the master record which governs all travel arrangements and payments for the journeys to which it applies. If there is no record of the original authority, or it is simply filed away and forgotten, control of travel payments will be severely undermined. If the system relies on retrospective approval, if any, improper payments can easily slip through. Making the authority to travel the master record helps to ensure that bullettravel arrangements comply with the authority bulletvariations to the original authority are documented bulletall payments are supported by a legitimate authority bulletduplicate payments are avoided bulletcancelled journeys are accounted for and any advances are recovered. A system which treats the authority to travel as a master record, does not necessarily require physical reference to the original document each time a payment is made, although this is one way to achieve the aims listed above. Alternative approaches might involve use of a registration system, or an electronic data base, as a means of crossreferencing transactions. Recommendation 6 Treat the authority to travel as the master record for control of all transactions for a particular journey. 3 FORMS DESIGN"

        "text": "Victoria, grist for the election mill Some of the initiatives emerging from the Spring Street bunker of the newly installed Victorian Premier, Jeff Kennett, are welcome ones. Some are puzzling. Several are plain silly. It is important to differentiate between the good, the bad, and the ugly. To begin with, the move by the fledgling Governments Treasurer, Alan Stockdale, to apply the reins to a runaway budget lifting some artificially low State taxes, cutting capital expenditure, sacking 7,000 public servants were painful but necessary measures. Mr Stockdale has followed up his minibudget moves with other initiatives to bring to heel the blowout in costs for the States workers compensation scheme, running almost 2 billion in arrears. So far so good. Subsequent to the minibudget in Victoria, the new administration has been moving on other fronts, notably industrial relations. Here the moves are less clear, the motives blurred, the outcomes more farreaching for the whole of Australia. The move to end the 5 per cent holiday leave loading for State public servants contained in the minibudget makes good fiscal sense for a Government facing a major budget crisis in recessionary times. The separate motive to end penalty rates in Victoria, by decreeing that all hours of work be regarded as equal, is a step in the right direction of liberalising working hours. It will speed a process already well under way and long overdue in Australia towards implementing a more flexible working regime. Clearly, such a change will not come without problems. Treating all hours as equal for wage payment purposes equates an hour worked in business hours with one worked on a Sunday, as if there is no difference in the degree of effort or dislocation caused to the worker. The easy argument is that people are not obliged to undertake such shift work. If they dont want to work abnormal hours, someone else will. Harsh, but a realistic assessment of the state of the Australian labour market in the 1990s. Economic purists will argue that the market will set the price for such labour. If groups of people do not want to work at those hours, the price of labour will be bid up. In tough times such as at present the biddingup will not be great, if at all. In buoyant times, the price of labour on rotating night shift will be higher, as employers compete for labour. Problem what of the wide range of service areas, almost all within the public employment domain, which require 24hour attention Buses, trains, trams, ferries, hospitals, police, garbage collection, to name a few. Can such labour simply say No thanks, Id prefer to work weekday daytime hours And if it did successfully bid up its price, as the pure labour market theorists would presumably applaud, what of State and federal budgets In better times, the pressure would be intolerable, and something would give either quality of service, or budgetary responsibility. These conundrums aside, the move is in the right direction. So, too, is the initiative to hurry along the opportunity for business and its workforce to negotiate individual or workplace agreements. From March 1 next year, they will have to choose to opt back into the present system of awardbased regulation of work, rather than opt out to the more freewheeling enterprise negotiations. Outlawing compulsory unionism and the closed shop has been long in coming. And to allay the fears of some that the world is about to end, the Victorian Government has reaffirmed certain socalled safety net conditions a weeks sick leave, four weeks annual leave, maternity leave and a minimum hourly rate of pay based on the present award minimum applicable in each industry. If it was not for certain other changes, the package would deserve high praise. But the good sense of Kennett and his Industrial Relations Minister, Phil Gude, has deserted them on their crude attempts to prohibit or punish industrial action. If the new Victorian Government is as sure of its liberalising reforms, it should have carried them through. Instead, it has introduced several halfbaked, wouldbe Draconian approaches to industrial action. Limiting a picket line to a maximum of six at any workplace entrance is plain silly. Making industrial action illegal other than over health and safety issues while an award or agreement is in place, with a 5,000 damages action available against each employee involved in a dispute, suggests the Government is abandoning its liberalising stance in favour of hardline enforcement techniques more appropriate to totalitarian regimes elsewhere. Australia is a democracy. The right for an individual to offer his or her labour for hire, and withdraw that labour under certain conditions, is one of the tenets of the unclear of democracy Australia has become. This particular aspect of Kennetts proposed changes suggest he is uncomfortable with such notions of individual liberty. Predictably, the changes in Victoria are being seen as a model for the sort of changes which Dr Hewson and John Howard are planning for all Australia or at least those covered by federal awards. Not surprisingly, the federal Liberals are keeping at least some distance, in case the whole package has serious political fallout a wise move. Also predictably, the big guns from Labour including the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, and his Industrial Relations Minister, Senator Cook, are being wheeled out to portray the package as a heinous affront to the dignity of all Australian workers. Kennett is even crying foul at federal Labours plans to encourage the Victorian workforce to consider shifting its award protection from the State to the federal arena. All grist for the mill in this unusually important election year. Dawkins stunning flight of imagination Victoria may be plummeting in the credit ratings, and the A may be sinking out of sight, but Australian politicians are scoring top marks for brazenness. Yesterday, the Federal Treasurer, Mr Dawkins who should consider himself a lucky man to have kept his job during the stillunravelling Victorian loans scandal implied that the real fault lies with those who have revealed the truth about Victorias shocking debt shenanigans. Mr Dawkins said that since the news broke of the concealed 3 billion blowout in State debt, yields had risen by 20 points. So the actual cost of Liberal Party posturing is actually coming home to ordinary Victorian taxpayers as they see the Governments interest bill go up, he said. The attack on the secret loan blowout was a Liberal Party stunt, a divisive, destructive stunt. And the Victorian Labor spokesman on Industrial Relations, Mr Jim Kennan, complained yesterday that investors were being scared away from Victoria because of Mr Kennets industrial relations reforms. This is a real tribute to the imaginative powers of Victorias otherwise discredited Labor Party branch, conjuring up images of queues of investors readying themselves to leap aboard the Victorian economy revitalised under a returned Labor administration only to turn back in horror on learning that following the coalition victory they would now be prevented from paying holiday loadings and penalty rates. Mr Dawkinsimaginative effort is even more disconcerting, however. For it raises a stream of questions about quality of Treasury advice, about how the Treasury manipulates its political head, and about how Australia relates to its creditors. As the depth of Victorias problems became apparent after the Kennett Governments election, the ALP attempted to conceal its significance by focusing attention instead on Victorias industrial relations reform. The reform is in itself welcome, but in its present radical form it would not have been politically feasible if the State had not already been in penury. Mr Dawkins appears to believe that demanding honesty in public accounting is tantamount to talking the economy down of which the fall of the A below US69c yesterday may be seen as a further symptom. The very opposite is true. Confidence in data is crucial to market confidence. It is concealment which is bound to come undone sooner or later in an open democratic system that most undermines that confidence. The Treasurer is either naive or desperate to urge collusion on the coalition. Shoot the messenger is the classic guilty response, and in this case the messenger was primarily the Victorian AuditorGeneral, rather than the Liberals. What would Mr Dawkins do with an auditor who attached qualifications to a set of corporate accounts Suggest he was guilty of destroying the company if its shares took a consequent tumble The Treasurer has even resorted, after earlier attempts at explanation, to the Sir Yes, Minister Humphrey defence I was just obeying Treasury advice. The first problem with this is that the advice was misconceived. The Treasury warned that publicly revealing Victorias 3 billion breach of its borrowing limit, distancing the Commonwealth from the States borrowing arrangements, could have adverse market consequences. Thus nothing should be said about it. Further, such a move would force Victoria into a corner without addressing the fundamental problems. Instead, a major concern must be to protect the credibility of the Loan Council arrangements. That is, keep them confidential. It must be said that the Treasury was right in its analysis. The markets have not taken kindly to the news of Victorias woes. But they have exacted an extra measure of punishment because the element of concealment has added an extra measure of risk to the outstanding paper. However, the Treasury was precisely wrong in its prescription do very little, but with heavy breathing stentorian tones. In fact, it is the very degree of the debt that has both energised the new Government in its reform programme and is convincing most Victorians of the need to suffer pain now. It may not be much comfort to the poor Victorians, but the markets are blowing overdue fresh air through the system, which had grown fetid from mountains of unsustainable debt. The complicitous nature of the Treasury line with its implied realpolitik deference to the difficulty a Labor Federal Treasurer might have in exposing the sins of a State counterpart on the eve of a State election emphasises the value of regular changes of government. The second problem with Mr Dawkins Sir Humphrey defence is that he was under no obligation to accept the advice he was given. His release of the Treasurys line does not let him off the hook at all. Indeed, the public interest demanded, in this case, public accountability of an order that Mr Dawkins is only now willing to offer belatedly, after Labor has lost Victoria. The situation is analogous to that of a company breaching its debt covenant to a bank by failing to disclose offbalancesheet items. The repercussions would, rightly, be extremely serious. Such behaviour, when uncovered within the private sector, is frequently condemned as typical of the wayward, spendthrift 1980s against which people are now reacting by insisting on measured Government interventions in the economy. Power games in US Federal Reserve Through the 1970s and 1980s, Arthur Burns and Paul Volcker ran the US Federal Reserve like a personal fiefdom, building immense power and prestige through almost unilateral determination of the nations credit policies. Polls of leading Americans regularly put the Fed chairman as the second most powerful person in the US after the President, and there was little reason to think when Wall Street economist Dr Alan Greenspan took over in 1987 that he would be any less vigorous and visible. But according to a series of US reports, the Fed chairman has recently been outgunned by a hardline antiinflation group among the Feds 12 regional presidents. In October last year Dr Greenspan was reportedly deflected from his desire to cut shortterm interest rates by half a percentage point and the Fed compromised on a far smaller cut, even then only after the White House and Congress confirmed their fiveyear Budget plan. Then, in recent months, hardliners questioned Dr Greenspans use of longstanding precedent to unilaterally cut interest rates as the US recession deepened. The power struggle at the upper levels of the central bank is unresolved, but its consequences could be considerable."

        "text": "SAND, SHELL SEA The Green Turtles of Heron Island Sitting on the beach under a half moon we watch and wait. The occasional shadow of a tern flits restlessly across the sand. Waves lap gently only metres away. In a small hole before us, alternatively sleeping and shuffling, lie the objects of our vigil, the tiny pristine forms of baby green turtles. Incubating for around eight weeks in a nest deep in the sand, these turtles have just hatched from their shells. Now, having worked their way up to just below the surface of the sand, they lie stacked atop each other readying themselves for the start of their seaborn life. It is high tide so their beach dash isnt too taxing. Unlike the many hatchlings who make this journey when the sand cools at dusk, these newborns at least run the gamut of predators under the cover of dark. Suddenly, the turtles start to jostle one another more vigorously. Pushed up from below, they erupt forth in one dark gyrating mass. Scrambling furiously, they separate and some 120 baby turtles, flippers digging tenaciously in the sand, propel themselves down the beach. On occasion, some turtles are taken by birds on this initial land leg of their journey. Tonight however, human watchers ensure they all make it to safety, some even flattening the sand into a path along which the hatchlings travel at breakneck speed. Cued by the moonlit horizon, the hatchlings reach the water surprisingly quickly. Plunging in, they are lifted by the waves and it takes only a few strokes to learn how to use their flippers in the one rowing motioin. They disappear from view within a few seconds. Despite their astonishing instinct, survival will be and ongoing battle as more birds, predatory fish, rays and reef sharks await. Only 20 out of a hatch of 110 are likely to survive the swim across the reef lagoon. For the next five days they will swim at great speed, utilising their internalised egg yolk for energy. Only onein 5,000 hatchlings will survive to maturity a lifespan of 10 to 15 years. Of the worlds seven existing species of sea turtle, six are now listed as threatened or endangered, says Dr. Jeff Miller, Principal Conservation Officer with Queenslands Department of Environment and Heritage. They are experiencing a myriad of problems interfacing with human beings. In Australia, sea turtles have been protected since 1968 but in many neighbouring countries adult, young and unborn turtles are still being harvested. In other parts of the world, such as the Cayman Islands, man has wiped out entire populations. The 1994 nesting season saw over 266,750 hatchlings on Heron Island, off the coast of Rockhampton in caption photo Queensland. On one night as many as 110 females made their way up the beach to nest. Along with Capricorn and Bunker Islands, Heron Island is a significant rookery for green turtles and occasionally the loggerhead variety. Added to these species, there is a year round feeding population on the reef. For this reason and the added advantage of its logistical infrastructure the island has a tourist resort and marine research station Heron Island has become one of the main bases for the Queensland Turtle Research Project, headed by zoologist and turtle expert, Dr. Col Limpus. A priority in this research is finding out what Dr. Miller describes as the nonnegotiable aspects of sea turtles lives. To do this their life cycle must first be fully understood. You cant, says Dr. Miller, have good management without a solid base in biology. American zoologist and researcher, Nancy FitzSimmons, who is working on her PHD thesis with the Queensland Turtle Research Project and Dr. Limpus, says, Most of our research is really oriented toward a better management and better understanding so we can conserve them. FitzSimmons says a lot of turtles are killed in prawning nets, shark nets and floating garbage. The propellers of boats also pose a great danger to the creatures. They are international populations and go places where they are harvested. So we have to approach it on a really broad scale, says FitzSimmons. Turtle research involves not only tagging, genetic studies, constant surveying of migratory patterns and breeding and feeding populations, but also liaising with international bodies and research bases. It is genetics in which FitzSimmons specialises. Sitting in the shade of her improvised outdoor laboratory as she takes muscle samples from mutant hatchlings, the initial impression is of work that is far from glamorous. As she speaks though, an intriguing glimpse into the complex life of a turtle is revealed. FitzSimmons explains that a female green turtle will breed only once every 3 to 8 years. She will migrate a vast distance to her nesting beach, may mate with several males and then store the sperm for a number of months during which she lays 5 to 8 clutches of 110 eggs each. If you are going to travel all the way across the Coral Seas, says FitzSimmons, you certainly wouldnt want to mate with a male who didnt have very good sperm, so it makes sense that they would have multiple paternity of clutches. Inset piece If this is the case it has yet to be confirmed that every female has multiple partners0 then it would also assist the species in terms of their diminishing numbers and gene pool. Each time the female mates with several males, she is optimising the genetic diversity of the next generation. FitziImmons has spent most of this years nesting season on Heron Island. She took blood samples from nine females at the start of the season and relocated their eggs. Every time these females have come back to nest, she has tried to find them and relocate their next clutch. As females are accessible to researchers when they nest and repeatedly return to do so often on the same beach, there is much data on them. Less is known about male sea turtles, their migratory patterns and contributions to specific populations. FitzSimmons work will, in part, address this imbalance. Of the mitochondrial DNA, passed down from mother to mother, and the nuclear DNA, passed from both parents via the chromosomes, FitzSimmons is interested in the latter. By looking at a hatchlings nuclear DNA, she is able to ascertain how many males have fertilised each clutch and in what success ratio. FitzSimmons explains how nitochondrial DNA tells us that offspring are coming back to breed in the same region in which they were born. By looking at nuclear DNA instead,she says, I am able to look at the variation that males contribute to offspring as well. It makes good sense that a female would have found a nesting place that works but a male doesnt necessarily have the same traits. Do male offspring also come back to the same region they are born in or do they travel the ocean more widely It is known that many of the hatchlings researched at the moment will not be ready to breed for another 30 to 50 years. However, turtle research goes on. Having come a long way in the past 26 years, research coupled with tourism on Heron Island will ensure that ongoing work will continue to guarantee turtle survival. THE AFRICAN ELEPHANT TO CULL OR NOT TO CULL STORY AND PHOTOGRAPHS BY DAVE PATON photo caption NO ANIMAL HAS STIMULATED MORE HEATED debate within conservation circles than the elephant, for no animal has a greater impact on the environment. Elephants and humans share a parallel lifespan, rate of development, strong family structure and memory that is perhaps superior to our own. The question of how best to manage these animals or if they need to be managed at all evokes very mixed and strong feelings. To complicate the issue even further, ivory means money and, where money is involved, feelings run high. The socalled elephant problem stems from their gregarious nature and feeding habits. Elephants usually congregate in breeding herds which compromise adult females and their associated young including males to the age of puberty, ten to twelve years of age, or bachelor groups of males. Breeding herds may vary from two to 200 animals and are led by the oldest female known as the matriarch. Adult males are frequently found in breeding herds, but they are not a cohesive part of the group. Bachelor groups vary from solitary males to bull herds occasionally numbering up to 50 animals. Problems arise from the impact of the herds feeding habits. Elephants are mega herbivores large animals which eat plants on a massive scale. They are both grazers and browsers and feed on a wide variety of vegetable matter including grasses, leaves, twigs, bark, roots and fruits. They frequently break quite large trees in order to get at the leaves. An adult averages a daily food intake of 250 kilograms. Because of their feeding habits and gregarious nature, elephants have the capacity to excerpt quickly turn dense woodland into open grassland, especially in drought years. Elephants are natures bulldozers. Reduction of natural home ranges in Africa has been a major contributing factor to the elephant problem by leading to excessive densities of animals in localised areas. Other factors include reduced natural mortality, limited hunting pressure and tighter controls of illegal hunting. Elephants do not have effective natural predators, so natural dispersal could have played a major role as a selfregulatory mechanism for the elephant. With the provision of artificial water points and the control of fires, more food is now available to sustain elephant numbers above natural carrying capacities, especially in times of drought. Within a relatively short time, the elephant problem appeared in countries all over Africa which had large elephant populations. One of the best known cases is Tsavo National Park in Kenya. In 1970, with a severe drought and a large population of elephants, Tsavo underwent a radical transformation from woodland to scrub and grassland in a very short time. The authorities decided not to cull elephants to prevent this transformation and nature began to take its own control methods. With a reduction in food supply, birth rates were reduced. By this time food had become so scarce that many animals weakened and retreated to permanent water sources where food was very sparse. Malnutrition, along with declining levels of blood sugar, induced everincreasing lethargy until the elephants became comatose. They laid down, were too weak to get up and the end came quickly enmasse. This is one theory which may explain the legendary myth of the elephant graveyards. More than 9000 mainly female elephants perished in 1970 at Tsavo National Park. With greatly reduced elephant numbers, 20 years on, Tsavo is now slowly regenerating. Culling means killing normally with a rifle. It is not sport. Culling is a serious function of wildlife management. Culling is typically conducted by shooting an entire cow herd starting with the matriarch the dominant female. All animals, including calves are shot. During culling, a suitablysized group of elephants is located from the air and the ground party, of two or three hunters and their assistants, are then guided to the group by radio. Killing is quick and effective and the shooting is usually over within one minute. The killing is done so rapidly that the group does not disperse and the carcasses remain close to each other. The animals are then skinned and butchered. Dried elephant meat biltong is an important component of the rural peoples diet especially in the proteinstarved and tsetseflyinfested parts of Africa. The hide of each animal is removed in panels, stripped of excess flesh and fat, washed, and steeped in a bactericide. The hide is an extremely valuable byproduct of the elephant culling operation more valuable on average, in fact, than the ivory. Additional biological information is collected, eg reproductive status, age, condition and stomach contents, which is adding to the better understanding of the species as a whole. There is a very good reason for killing a whole herd. Firstly, elephants have a very strong family structure and share with humans the same sense of family and death."

        "text": "AUSTRALIAS ENDANGERED COAST Dr. Andrew D. Short Director Coastal Studies Unit Department of Geography University of Sydney SYDNEY NSW 2006 Abstract Australia possesses 30,000 km of open coastline with an additional 90,000 km of shoreline lying in more protected estuaries and bays and surrounding the smaller islands. The entire coast is an extremely dynamic environment representing an interaction of the land, sea, air and biota that comprise each coastal system. The sheer size of Australias coast together with the range of climates and oceans to which it is exposed presents a tremendous variety of natural coastal systems and their ecological communities. All of these systems and communities are however geologically very new having adapted to the global warming between 18,000 and 6,500 years ago which saw sealevel rise over 120 m, drowning our continental shelf and forming the new coastline while Australias climates become warmer and wetter. Since the sea level and climates stabilised about 6,000 years ago our coast has been far from stable. During the past 6,000 years major changes continue to occur around the entire Australian coast. In order to understand the present Australian coast we must consider these past and present natural changes together with two new sources of change that threaten the coast namely man and man induced Greenhouse effect. INTRODUCTION Australia is the oldest of the continents with rocks dating back 450 million years and with fossil records of earths earliest life forms. For all but the most recent fraction of its long history, its evolution, movements and change were unobserved and uninfluenced by man. Throughout its evolution Australias coastline has changed dramatically in response to geological force such as plate movements, mountain building and vertical land movements as well as cyclical change in sealevel which has advanced and receded across the ancient shores thousands of times Jenkin, 1984. Most of this was also unobserved by man. The present coastline in contrast is geologically refreshingly young, having formed in Australia as elsewhere within the last 6 to 7,000 years Thom, 1984. Unlike our ancient land surface the formation of the present coast was observed by man. The aborigines would have followed the receding shoreline as sealevel fell to its lowest point 18,000 years ago. At that time the present continental shelf was dry land with the shoreline lying up to 120 m below present sealevel and up to several hundred kilometres seaward of its present location. Sydney Harbour was a deeply incised river valley, flowing to a low straight shoreline 20 km east of the heads. Bass Strait and the Gulf of Carpentaria were dry land as was the north west shelf, Torres Strait and the Great Barrier Reef. However having followed the receding shoreline to its lowest and most distant points the aborigines then retreated as in response to global warming and ice cap melting between 18,000 and 6,000 years ago as sealevel rose over 120 m at a rate averaging l m per century. The aborigines witnessed some of the most rapid and dramatic changes ever to occur to Australias coastline. They lived and moved with these changes utilizing the rich resource of the coastal wetlands, shoreline and ocean. Their sites marked by shell middens occur in abundance around the entire coast, and across northern Australia are still occupied by traditional occupants. When sealevel stabilised between 7 and 6,000 years ago much of the coast did not look like as we see it today, major changes continued and continue to occur. Once again the aborigines coexisted with these changes, that is, until The celebration of our bicentenary at this site two years ago also marked the 200th year of a change in mans appreciation of and utilization of the Australian coastline. 1788 marked the beginning of the second of three phases of man and the coast. The first began when the first inhabitants crossed Torres Strait and ended in 1788, the second extends from 1788 until this decade, the third is the purpose of this conference. In the remainder of this paper I will address each phase in terms of what has happened to the coast during phases 1 and 2, and what might or should happen as we enter phase THE COAST 10,000 YEARS AGO TO 1788 The physical evolution of the present Australian coastline began about 10,000 years ago when sealevel was still about 30 m below present. As sealevel advanced across the continental shelves surrounding Australia it flooded, exhumed and often reworked earlier sedimentary deposits left by the prior fall in sealevel and by rivers, deltas, lakes and soil formation. The nature of these deposits and what happened to them as sealevel rose depended on where they were located. For this exercise Australia can be divided very generally into the northern half and the southern half bisected along a line from the top of North West Cape to the top of Frazer Island. Northern Australia is typified by a warmer, wetter climate resulting in an abundance of rivers and supply of sediment to the coast. The coastline and continental shelf are at their lowest gradient and widest across the north. These same shelves cause the ocean tides to be amplified up to 100 times usually exceeding 3 m and reaching 11 m in the north west. In contrast to tides wave energy is relatively low owing to the low wind velocities and low occurrence of cyclones. The result is a coast which following the stabilization of sealevel 6,000 years ago rapidly filled in the drowned river valleys building substantial deltas and coastal plains fronted by either low energy beaches or tidal flats which are arranged and rearranged by the prevailing waves, tide and winds. Because of the tropical climate a rich coastal ecosystem including mangrove forests and corallinealgae reefs surround much of the coast. The coastline of southern Australia is dramatically different from the north. The climate is drier and cooler resulting in a low and across the south and west coast, often zero supply of continental sediment to the coast. The continental shelf is often steep particularly along the New South Wales, Tasmanian and parts of the south coast. The tides are low, always less than 2 m, whereas the waves are the biggest and most persistent in the world produced by continual cyclonic activity and often accompanied by strong winds. As sealevel rose across southern Australia it also flooded the shelf and valleys, however as it did so on the open coast the waves mobilized the shelf sediments driving them shoreward building beaches and barriers that kept pace with the rising sealevel. At the same time the possibly stronger winds mobilized this beach material blowing it inland as massive coastal dune fields. Even when sealevel was still below present, dunes tens to over 100 meters high were being built well above present sealevel down parts of the entire east coast and across most of the south and west coast up to North West Cape. The beaches and barriers that supplied these early dunes were themselves moved shoreward by the rising sealevel until sealevel stabilized across the south about 6,500 years ago. Once sealevel stabilized, one major cause of instability, the rising sealevel, ceased and with it the coast began to settle down to living with the present sealevel. What has happened since depends on location. In areas exposed to high winds and waves such as the Great Australian Bight and parts of the southwest and southeast coast the waves continued to mobilize the shelf sands moving them offshore, onshore and alongshore. The winds moved the onshore sands further inland as successive coastal dune systems. In these areas this continued until all shelf sediment was depleted resulting in erosion of all or most of the beaches such as along most of the eastern Great Australian Bight and exposed locations around the entire southern coast, including along the Sydney coast. Where sediment is still available it continues to more offshore, alongshore and onshore producing a highly dynamic shoreline. The only relatively stable parts are those where the sand is trapped in headland bound embayments such as many of the Sydney and south New South Wales coast beaches, and in the more protected estuarine systems. The estuaries themselves owe their origin to both the drowning by sealevel and the inability after 6,000 years for the rivers to fill in the drowned valleys. While they are protected they are however evolving as both marine and river sediments slowly infill from either end and as rich ecosystems occupy these favoured sites. Up to 1788 the Australian coast continued to evolve in response to all the above forces as well as the habits of the aboriginals. However their impact in the coastal zone was light and nonexistent deeper than low tide. The evolution and status of the Australian coast up to 1788 can be explained without need to invoke mans interference. THE COAST 17881990 The last 200 years have seen a rapidly and everchanging perspective and utilization of the Australian coast. In 1788 only one part of the Australian coast was of interest to European man, Botany Bay, soon switched for Sydney Harbour. Both are estuaries providing safe anchorage deep estuarine basin, freshwater rivers and streams and arable land flood plains. Every subsequent major Australian settlement chose estuaries the Derwent, the Yarra, the Brisbane, the Swan, the Torrens and so on. In those days the only good part of the Australian coast was a safe part a safe port, and preferably one with water and arable land. The beaches were dangerous and later prohibited, the dunes and barriers were unfertile and worthless, the cliffs only useful for lighthouses. Apart from the short lived and self destructive sealing industry little use was made of nonestuarine areas until this century. Because the estuaries and their ports were so vital for 19th and 20th century maritime Australia nothing stood in the way of their development. Shorelines, tidal flats and sand bars were filled, dredged and reclaimed to build Australian ports. The tidal flats, deltas and floodplains were ideal for growing crops and later industry, housing and airports. The effluent of all went straight into the estuary to hopefully go out with the ebbing tides. When this did not work as in Sydneys case it was piped further to the coastal cliffs at Bondi or as in Melbourne to the Weeribee swamps. During the 19th and particularly the 20th century we have increasingly modified or developed estuaries for shipping, industry, housing and recreation. The remainder of the coast remained relatively pristine until after World War II when the deserted beaches and barrier dunes became an increasingly prime site for our growing leisure time. Coastal housing boomed in Sydney and Melbourne, shacks occupied most of the low South Australian coast coastal camping grounds expanded to caravan parks and small coastal towns to retirement centres the invasion had begun coastal tourism and development took root on the Gold Coast and spiralled upwards and outwards with scores of tourist developments planned and complete now surrounding the coast. All this took place at a time when little was known about the coast, and even if it was it would be ignored, because the impact was development and development was good. We know now that impact means more than development. This is why we are here today. THE COAST 1990 AND BEYOND In this section I would like to look at the present status of the Australian coast the credit and debit side, and address the two biggest threats endangering the coast namely man and potential man induced Greenhouse changes. 1 The present problem It is very easy to prepare a list of all the man made problems around the Australian coast Table 1. They relate to both natural and man induced shoreline erosion such as along the Gold Coast Figure 1a and b, the Adelaide coast Figure 2a and 4, at Portland, Victoria Figure 3a and b, in Sydney Figure 4a and 6 and at Brunswick Heads Figure 5 to storm water and sewerage pollution such as here in Sydney Figure 6 to modification of most coastal ecosystems illustrated in all previous figures and Figure 7 to modification of coastal river catchments by land clearing, farming and dams in most coastal river systems, leading to increased siltation Figure 8 and modified discharge and estuarine salinities."

        "text": "down on the farm The farm is not easy to get to at 50 fathoms plus, but it sure is loaded up with critters to harvest. Fred Studden explains his super deep water fishing system. photo caption AS THE DAYS GROW SHORTER and cooler, fishing thoughts turn to the deep water. On my stretch of the coast, deepwater fishing is synonymous with The Farm. The Farm is a stretch of reef running parallel to the coast off Swansea on the nsw lower North Coast. The rather pastoral name comes from the early days when one of the marks used to locate the reef was a distinctive tomato farm on the coast. The light green of the tomato plants stood out from the dark green of the gum trees and made an easily distinguishable mark. Naturally, the spot was know as the Tomato Farm mark, which over the years became simply The Farm. While originally the name referred to only one section of the reef, common usage has expanded the name to generically cover just about all of the deepwater reefs from Swansea to Norah Head. These reefs are in water depths from 90 to 120 metres, and are in fact the old coastline that existed in the last ice age, some 10,000 years ago when the sea level was about 100 metres shallower than it is today. This line of reefs, or more correctly the dropover, is common to most of the coast of nsw and probably exists in many other places. From Swansea the reefs are just under ten nautical miles off the coast, and can be best described by imagining flying along the present coastline at 300 feet, looking down on the headlands, excerpt photo bays and beaches. The reefs are almost a mirror image of the coast, big dropovers, long stretches of gradually shelving sandy bottom, usually directly off coastal beaches and areas of broken reef extending for some distance behind the dropovers. Once past the dropover bottom, which is mud or muddy sand, gradually slopes away until it reaches the edge of the Continental Shelf, 20 to 25 nautical miles further east. This area is know locally as The Desert, which is an apt description, for nothing seems to live there. To fish deep water with some degree of success, requires special techniques or modifications of methods used in the shallower water. Gps has made the fishing of places this far offshore much more practical, as numerous trips in the past were aborted because the coast was obscured by cloud, mist or bushfire smoke. By using accurate compass courses and a reliable distance log it was often possible to find the reefs with little or no visibility, but once you arrived at your chosen spot it was impossible to move from there to another location. Fortunately, all this is in the past, and with a gps plotter stuffed full of waypoints it is possible to move around just as freely at night or in zero visibility as it is on a bright clear day. However, the single most important item of gear for deepwater fishing is not a gps, but a good sounder. Gps will put you onto the reef, but it is the sounder that will tell you if there are any fish there, where they are sitting and, with experience, what sort of fish they caption caption photo photo photo photo caption are. There is an old adage which says you get what you pay for, and this could not be a truer description of sounders for deep water work. The most desirable features for a sounder to be used for this type of fishing are definition, transducer cone angle and, to a lesser degree, output power. Definition is the sounders ability to define and separate small targets from each other and from the bottom. Closely related to definition is bottom expansion or zoom. Even the most moderately priced unit these days will have a zoom facility, which ideally should give a bottom picture section of about thirty metres. Any less than this magnification and it is difficult to see snapper tight on the bottom, any greater magnification and the wave motion of the boat makes the bottom so jagged it is almost impossible to make any sense out of the picture. Snapper are perhaps the most difficult of all fish to see on a sounder. At frequencies normally used in modern sounders, the echo from all fish will be photo largely made up of returns from their air sack, and snapper do not have a very large sack compared to other species. Also, snapper do not school up close together like baitfish, for the snapper is usually the predator not the prey. All of this makes them difficult to find on a sounder trace. A feature of many of the more sophisticated sounders is bottom lock. True bottom lock is the electronic feature which straightens out the bottom, displaying it as a straight line regardless of hills, hollows or waves. The only things which shows above the straight bottom line are fish. With no wave action to worry about, magnifications of as little as ten metres are possible, and practical. But while I find bottom lock great for detecting fish, it is difficult to identify species because the very electronic manipulation which makes it possible to have bottom lock seems to distorts the fish echoes and makes them difficult to sort out. Cone angle is the angle sound spreads out to when it comes from the transducer, rather like the beam of light from a flashlight. At 200 KHz the common frequency for most sounders, a excerpt photo narrow cone angle is considered to be 10 degrees or less, and a wide angle is about 20 degrees. A narrow cone angle in deep water is important for two reason. Firstly a wide angle cone spreads the signal over a very large area, about the area of a 20 metre circle at 100 metres, and thus the signal strength is greatly reduced and the echo return is weak. Fish displayed on the sounder screen could be anywhere in that 20 metre circle, not necessarily directly under the boat. With a narrow cone angle the probability of a strong echo return is dramatically improved and accurate positioning over fish is now possible. While the two factors of definition and cone angle are of utmost importance to sounder performance, output power will also have a bearing on effectiveness. Obviously, the unit must have enough power to sound to these depths, and unfortunately, many of the cheaper units will simply not do this. In fact, many are struggling at 30 metres. Published performance figures need careful scrutiny, units with an advertised depth capacity of 600 feet have a rider in small print saying under good conditions. One would have to presume that these good conditions are gin clear water with a mirror smooth sea, for most of these units will, in average practical fishing conditions, not sound to one quarter of this depth. Unfortunately, we seldom fish in good conditions. The best advise is to seek out a fishing mate who uses a sounder in these depths and can recommend a set, or go to a reputable dealer who has tested various sounders for performance in deep water. In the early days I used a Lowrance X15 graph sounder fitted with a narrow cone angle transducer nine degrees, and now use a jrcjfc850 colour video, excerpt dual frequency unit with a 10 degree cone angle on the KHz. This is a superb unit giving high definition and a clean bright picture. Next to finding fish the most important part is to anchor over them, and this can often be the most frustrating part of coming to grips with fishing deep water. Even the most experienced skipper will have days when nothing will go right, when after three or four attempts he will still not be just where he wants to be positioned. The first rule of anchoring in 100 metre plus water, is to have plenty of chain on the anchor four metres of 8mm chain is minium, and five metres is not too much. The second rule is to have plenty of anchor rope, at least 300 metres, but half as much again is a good rule of thumb. I use 8mm silver rope for my boat, a 5m Broadbill, which is heaps strong enough and fairly easy to handle. Storing so much rope can be a problem, and we use the bow rope system, which means we anchor and retrieve all from within the cockpit storing the rope, anchor and chain, in one of the large Nally fish boxes. For most things I do in the boat I work to a set pattern or sequence and I can explain this easily to other people, but with anchoring I find it to be instinctive and almost impossible to put into words. The key in knowing just how far to go ahead of the spot you are going to fish, and in what direction. In deep water the distance will be at least 100 metres, a lot more in windy conditions. It is of prime importance that the anchor and chain reaches the bottom before the boat starts to drift back and pull on the anchor, for in this depth and with so much anchor line out, the anchor will be lifted off the bottom or pulled along at a sharp angle which makes it almost impossible to hook in. We achieve this aim by going a little further into the wind and then turning the boat to be facing down wind and moving very slowly in that direction. The anchor is put over and the chain stretched out. The idea is to get the anchor to sink down towards the bottom in exactly the position is will lay when the boat takes up the slack rope. To ensure the anchor and chain will sink in the right configuration, I slowly circle the sinking anchor while the crew usually my wife, Yvonne, throws rope out of the box onto the water surface. With the boat slowly circling over the sinking anchor it is possible to see when the anchor reaches the bottom by noting when the rope is no longer pulled down. Silver rope floats and it now becomes a simple matter to lay out on the surface the right amount of rope to take you back over the right spot. The hard part is estimating how far to go up into the wind and how much rope to lay out. When learning this system it caption diagram is better to go too far into the wind, rather than not far enough, and then let plenty of rope out, With plenty of scope on the anchor you can take in or let out rope to fine tune your position. Many times, in fact I would say most times, there is a current of some sort and this will skew the boat and stop it from laying true to the wind. If you are only off the mark a little it may be possible to swing across by tying the rope off at an angle to the bow, a procedure called using a swing rope, but most times it means retrieving the anchor and starting all over again. However, before you do, note the compass bearing the boat is actually laying so next time you can use this bearing to steer to find the correct spot to drop the anchor. If you are using a GPS plotter, and have marked the spot on the screen where you dropped the anchor, this will prove invaluable as a reference point to work from for a correct drop. Pulling up by hand 200 to 300 metres of rope with an anchor and 4 metres of chain from 100 metres of water, is only for a masochist and those looking for a heart attack. The buoy system is simple and uses the boats motor to do all the hard work."

Although most of this programming is fairly routine, the process has not been amenable to simple automation because conceptual models do not provide sufficient parameters to make all the implementation decisions that are required, and numerous special cases arise in practice. Most commercial CASE tools address these problems by essentially implementing a waterfall model in which the development proceeds from analysis through design, layout and coding phases in a partially automated manner, but the analystprogrammer must heavily edit each intermediate stage. This paper demonstrates that by recognizing the nature of information systems, it is possible to specify applications completely using a conceptual model that has been annotated with additional parameters that guide automated implementation. More importantly, it will be argued that a manageable number of annotations are sufficient to implement realistic applications, and an architecture will be described that enabled the authors commercial CASE tool, the Intelligent Developer to automated implementation without requiring complex theorem proving technology. Apart from addressing the problem of maintaining systems developed using a waterfall model, this approach makes it feasible to build conceptual libraries that reduce the interactions when reused modules are combined, and can also enable more sophisticated end users to tailor applications in a controlled manner. Keywords Information Systems, Conceptual Models, CASE, Extended NIAM, Reuse, User Interface Design 1 INTRODUCTION There has been considerable research into the development of sophisticated techniques that capture abstract requirements and refine them into functional prototypes. Good examples include the programmers apprentice Reubenstein and Waters 91 which is concerned with resolving informal descriptions that are ambiguous, inconsistent and incomplete by referencing a library of reusable clicheacutes, and the Daida project Jarke et al. 92 which uses advanced knowledge representation techniques Telos to capture general requirements and map them to conceptual and implementation descriptions. Daida also uses a general system of nonfunctional goals to determine optimum implementations. Both of these systems describe transactions using first order logic which requires advanced theorem proving technology. While designing detailed conceptual models may require human like intelligence that is difficult to reproduce, much of the cost of developing applications using conventional CASE technology is incurred in the writing and maintenance of 4GL code and end user documentation that implements these models. Tools such as Oracle 91, or described in Ovum 92 effectively implement a waterfall model in which tools partially automate the mapping from conceptual to logical models and then 4GL code, but the programmeranalyst must extensively edit each intermediate stage. This is an expensive process and makes the resultant applications difficult to maintain. This paper argues that by recognizing the limited types of operations that are commonly performed by information systems, it is possible to largely automate the implementation of production quality applications from annotated conceptual models using well understood reasoning technologies. As well as reducing the cost of implementing and maintaining information systems, this technology enables reusable conceptual library modules to be constructed and can also be used to empower more sophisticated end users to tailor information systems to suit e their individual needs in a well defined manner. The next section describes the types of decisions that need to be made, how rules can be used to automate them, and mechanisms to handle exceptions. The IFIP conference example IFIP 82 will then be used to give examples of specific annotations. Conceptual libraries will be introduced followed by techniques to manage potentially cluttered conceptual schemas. User editable schemas are discussed after an architecture to manage the rules has been described. 2 Decisions, Rules and Annotations The decisions that are required to implement information systems may be classified in terms of where they would be made in a waterfall model, which include bullet Generating Relational Schemas When denormalizations should be introduced whether derived facts attributes should be evaluated eagerly or lazily whether constraints should be maintained in the applications or an active database how data should be distributed over a network. bullet Outlining User Interfaces How many user interfaces there should be and the scope of each one determining which attributes should be manipulated together controlling end user access to sensitive data. bullet Detailing User Interfaces How many windows should be used how should the fields be laid out within each window which widgets1 should be used for each field how can nonform interfaces be used. bullet 4GL Coding How to code unclassified business rules and special cases. Many of these decisions can be made on the basis of well defined rules. For example, the decision to select an appropriate widget largely depends on the number of valid values a field may have a ding bat is good for two alternatives, radio buttons for up to four, thereafter a conventional text field is more appropriate. Another rule states that when a screen includes a foreign key, the attributes that identify the foreign entity to a user ie. the Descriptive ones should also be displayed if there is sufficient room. For example, students names would normally be displayed next to their number on a class list, rather than their age, say. At the relational level, the use of keyword tables to allow efficient searches for words within strings is a common reason to introduce denormalizations.2 The decision to use one could be made by the following rule If a column is used for subword searching, And the number of rows is greaterequal to 500, And searching is at least four times more common than updating, And this column is often used as the sole search criteria Then create a keyword table. Conceptual schemas and dynamic models provide the base parameters required by the rules. Some parameters such as an attributes data type form part of most modelling techniques while others may be introduced to the models using additional Annotations. Typical annotations indicate which attributes Describe foreign keys, how and when derived attributes are calculated, and when keyword searching is useful. Annotations can be loosely classified in terms of their conceptual purity as follows bullet Conceptual Constraints that are part of a NIAM model, such as uniqueness and exclusion constraints. bullet Conceptual Parameters that are independent of specific implementation techniques, but do not directly affect conceptual semantics. Examples include specifying which attributes are Descriptive, which uniqueness constraint defines the primary key, or whether a subtype is collapsible.3 bullet Overrides to the standard rules. These can be quite specific, for example, to specify that a particular attribute on a specific interface should be represented using radio buttons rather than the default ding bat. bullet Ad Hoc 4GL Code that can be attached to any attribute or interface. This classification is orthogonal to the waterfall approach used for decisions, and the more conceptual annotations may be used by several decisions. For example, an enumeration of the valid values an attribute may contain requires an integrity constraint to be created during table definition while also affecting the widget used in the user interface. While implementation rules can produce useful prototypes directly from Conceptual Constraints and Parameters, Override and Ad Hoc Code annotations enable analystprogrammers to override rules or to add arbitrary procedural extensions when developing production quality applications. Unusual modules could require numerous annotations,4 but in practice most modules either require no annotations or have specific, minor idiosyncrasies. Specifying these idiosyncrasies with impure annotations at the conceptual level is undesirable, but when the need arises it is much easier to maintain a few lines of ad hoc annotations in a conceptual model than to find and understand the few changed lines interspersed amongst hundreds of lines of generated 4GL code produced by a waterfall approach. Moreover, if the schema changes in ways unrelated to the overrides, the complete 4GL program can be easily regenerated.5 The effectiveness of this approach is dependent upon the ability of a manageable number of conceptual annotations to provide significant automation. If new special case annotations were required to effectively implement each new application module, the problem of designing a conceptual model would degenerate into that of understanding the meaning of innumerable different annotations. The authors experience with the Intelligent Developer ID Berglas 93b BHA 92, a commercial 4GL generator, shows that the following types of requirements account for the majority of 4GL code bullet Enabling rows to be selected, edited and reported within the basic relational structure. This is usually achieved through forms oriented interfaces that process related tables, with most of each forms fields corresponding directly to columns in the database. Complications include using nonstandard indexing systems such as keyword tables, and looking up Descriptive values for foreign keys. bullet Making salient derived data conveniently available, such as totals of detail rows. This is similar to the functionality provided by conventional views, but there are subtleties such as deciding whether to use lazy or eager evaluation, and if eager the use of delta rules6, or perhaps the derived data is a default that can be overridden. bullet Different users have different access to sensitive data. This is also similar to views whose queries can relate the accessed data to user profiles, but additional details need to be addressed, such as telling a user that they have no access rather than just pretending a row does not exist. bullet Triggering rules based on specific state transitions in a dynamic model. bullet Producing elegant user interfaces. This involves connecting windows together, providing convenient default values, context sensitive help, and designing reasonable form layouts. The types of requirements are limited because most of the processing involved in an information system can be described in terms of accessing, updating or disseminating the information that they contain using standard algorithms contained within a database manager. Most constraints on the data are of a standard type, such as referential integrity and uniqueness, while simple finite state machines can be used to provide dynamic constraints and trigger actions upon state transitions. The dozen specific types of annotations described in the following sections account for most individual annotations used in practice because they correspond to these requirements. Further, the data centred approach makes it unnecessary to detail many transactions such as Enroll a new student if they mainly involve accessing and editing data subject to constraints, in this case editing details about each student. By capturing common constraints and implying basic transactions, annotations reduce the need for formal specifications using languages like TaxisDL part of Daida. It is acceptable to specify remaining Ad Hoc definitions procedurally because there are not many of them in an information system, so the limitations of technologies that automatically refine formal specifications into production quality applications can be circumvented. 3 The IFIP Example The IFIP example defines an information system for managing conferences. Authors submit papers, which may have been invited to conferences. The information system should keep track of papers and authors, allocate the referees, produce exception reports of overdue papers etc. A typical Intelligent Developer style user interface is shown in figure 1, which could be used to submit papers. The user enters the Paper Nr of an existing paper, or creates a new paper record by allowing it to default to the next available number. When the ID of the conference being submitted to is entered the conference Name is shown to the user. The papers Title, Subjects and Authors may then be entered, the latter in scrolling regions. An acknowledgment is sent to the first author once the paper has been logged. If the user does not know the Conference ID, they may press the Select key to pop up the conference selection window shown in figure Conferences may then be selected by entering a fragment of a conference name or a period during which one may have been held. Although these interfaces are fairly simple and have a common structure, they take hundreds of lines to implement properly in a conventional 4GL. Figure 3 shows part of the corresponding NIAM or Object Role Modelling conceptual schema Nijssen and Halpin 89 or Halpin and Orlowska 91. Entities are circled, and facts, the relationship between them, are represented as rectangles."

        "text": "Question 4 the Australian workplace industrial relations survey The Australian Workplace Industrial Relations Survey awirs was a much need piece of research to fill the gaps in the understanding of how Australian workplaces are structed and operate. This is particularly so in the current climate where the trend is towards a workplace focus for Industrial Relations ir. The study encompassed a broad spectrum of industries, sectors and firm sizes where previous studies had been typically industry based. The survey examined first the characteristics of Australian workplaces with classification based on the traditional industry, size and sector groupings. Findings of note under this first pass investigation were included dash The degree of unionisation contrasts between large and smaller firms large firms being more highly unionised. dashThe contrast in degree of unionisation between the public and private sectors public being higher. dashThe different union densities in different industries with higher densities for example in mining and manufacturing and lower in retail, tourism and agriculture. dashThe trend towards declining union density was noted across the board. dashThe relative industrial peace, with a large proportion of workplaces never experiencing a strike action. The study moved on to examine the organisation of industrial relations at the workplace. The organisation of management, unions and the interaction between them in the industrial relations arena were examined. It was concluded in terms of management that managers are significantly influenced and restricted by corporate headquarters when the workplace is merely a division of a larger company. Management at the workplace was found to often be restricted by a lack of autonomy to conduct relations with employees and unions at the workplace level. awirs discovered that a large number of Australian socalled unionised workplaces lack a union delegate. It was also found that were such delegates exist they spend a majority of time dealing with individual issues rather than employeeunion business. The union was found not to be the line of communication between employee employer as usually expected. The level of interaction was found to be relatively low between union and management at the workplace level, further reinforcing the above point regarding lines of communication. External influences such as senior management, union officials, the Arbitrain Industrial Relations Commission and government were found to significantly influence the industrial relations interaction and agenda at the workplace. The awirs noted similarities in the nature of industrial relations between workplaces in different industries, sectors and in firms of various size. An alternative classification system was developed so that such firms could be grouped together. The classifications proposed were i Informal ii Unstructured Inactive iii Structured Inactive iv Reactive Bargainers v Active Bargainers. It was found that the majority of Australian workplaces fall into groups ii or iv. Such a more purposeful classification allows policy implications to be more easily considered in terms of types of workplaces rather than by incorrectly considering industry, sector or size groupings The awirs challenged a number of traditional assumptions about Australian industrial relations. An important finding was the extent of external influence on industrial relations. There is relatively little experience and expertise at the workplace level in both management and employeeunion camps. Therefore the assumption that we are ready for workplace bargaining and that it will be a magic pudding solution to improving our workplaces must be questioned. The survey highlighted that unions are not necessarily the main line of communication between employee and management. This relates to the question of union relevancy and the declining union density. It suggests that union effectiveness at the workplace level can be improved. The myth that Australia is a strikeridden country was dispelled by the survey. A significant proportion of workplaces had experienced little or no strike action. A significant number of overaward payments, other agreements and management practises that are outside the award system were uncovered. This questions the assumption that there is no flexibility or bargaining possible within the centralised system. Finally it was noted that a significant proportion of managers believed that there were a range of other impediments restricting their ability to implement workplace reforms and improve efficiency that were of more significance than industrial relations eg capital shortages, trade barriers, autonomy etc. The awirs will form an important basis for future policy making and further research into the Australian workplace. It has certainly raised a number of questions and challenged some long held myths. Question 1 technological change The last ten years have seen unprecedented contextual change in Australian industrial relations. Economic, political, social and technological change have all been rapid and significant in proportion. The latter of these, technological change has presented a major challenge to managers, unions and employees across a broad range of the Australian workplaces, from services to manufacturing to mining and others. Technology, in this context, is considered to represent the information, skills and experience to improve the methods by which we produce goods and services. It requires the scientific knowhow, the engineering ability to put this knowhow into action and the management capacity to organise the production operation. Clearly then, as we shall see later, the key to technological advancement is going to be the transfer of this knowledge, skills and experience amongst the workforce. The traditional union view, particularly in the 1970s, was been that technology wa not in the workers interest. It was thought to alienate the worker, reducing jobs, skill levels, working conditions and job satisfaction. Not surprisingly management view was traditionally to opposite. They held that technology brings more jobs, increased pay, more job satisfaction and increased skills levels. Where does one go from here other than conflict However, during the 1980s, and especially since the mid 80s, the union movement has, as part of its new unionism, economically responsible attitude, changed its view to a more favourable outlook on new technology. The actu has promoted the benefits of technology such as better job satisfaction, higher pay, more leisure time etc. This promotion is qualified by the need for management to consult and cooperate with unions in order to implement the technology in a way that will minimise disruption and maximise benefit to the employees. Any benefits, they believe, should be shared between the employer and employees. This need for consultation and was recognised by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission then Conciliation Arbitration Commission in what is known as their Termination, Change and Redundancy Decision in This decision required management to consult with the unions prior to implementation of technological change. Similar requirements are now built into federal and state awards. It is noteworthy, however, that such awards only require consultation prior to implementation. By this point the decision has usually been made. In general the implementation of technology at the Australian workplace, and therefore the adaptation by unions and management, has been impressive over the last ten years. A prime example is the Australian telecommunications industry where there has been rapid technological advances with little industrial unrest. Telecom have reached an agreement with workers and unions whereby the broad focus of issues is considered in the implementation of technology. Such issues include job satisfaction, customer and service and very importantly staff training as well as many others. Perhaps the areas where additional effort may be focussed in the years to come when implementing new technology are consultation and training. Consultation with the union movement at the early decision stage is quite often not a natural measure for management but can be highly effective in generating general acceptance of the proposal and efficient implementation methods. Providing the appropriate training for staff not only maximises the efficiency of the technology but improves job satisfaction and the whole host of benefits that go with it. Technology will be a lynch pin in the economic development of Australian industry. Smooth and efficient implementation is vital. The union attitude is favourable, it is now up to management to take the appropriate steps to take advantage of and maintain this opportunity. Question 2 the accord The Accord agreements have been central to alp policy over the past ten years. Following the recent election result it appears that they will continue to remain central to Australian policy also. The strengths of the Accord have been put forward by the union movement and alp consistently over the past ten years. The strengths have remained the same as the focus of the Accord has been consistent throughout that time. The Accord provides an incomes policy mechanism for the government. As such it provides an additional economic lever to help fight inflation. In fact, in 1982 when the first Accord was drafted it was intended as a means to fight inflation and unemployment at the same time. The Accord used the centralised industrial relations system to provide wage restraint through National Wage Case Decisions. This method, however, fell apart in the 1991 when a strong disagreement saw the airc refuse to support the Accord proposals. The future methods of implementing across the board wage policy is therefore under some doubt. The Accord has been a vehicle for dramatic social reform. By trading off wage increases the union movement has been able to achieve significant items on the social reform agenda. The union movement would argue that a strength of the Accord is that it gives the unions a voice in government. As Simon Crean said in his address to the 1989 actu Congress The Accord trades wages restraint for a voice in government . This is seen as particularly importance to the union movement following the experiences of declining standard of living throughout the 1970s. The Accord does have significant acceptance throughout Australia, both from unions and employers. It provides stability and there is a reluctance to switch to the more frantic negotiation necessary if a totally decentralised system were adopted. The Accord has been criticised by employer groups and the Liberal National Coalition Parties. It has been argued that although real wages have fallen wage indexation has led to excessive growth in money wages. They argue that the Accord provides too rigid a structure and that it inhibits the flexibility required to improve productivity at our workplaces. Centralised wage outcomes lack consideration of individual industry and company needs. Further criticisms by employer organisation and coalition parties include that it provides too much union power and that the jobs growth achieved is unsustainable. The Accord has also been criticised from within the union movement. Left wing factions believe that the Accord has overly restrained unions and reduced them to a monitoring and policing role. They also criticise the reduction in real wage levels it has brought about. There have been significant achievements under the Accord. On the economics side of the ledger one can consider the jobs growth throughout the 80s and the wage restraint a 10 reduction in real wages. It is argued that this has been central in the reduction of our inflation rate. However, claims of this nature are difficult to assess as a benchmark is not readily available other than other oecd countries. Undisputable are the enormous social gains achieved by the Accord. Womens issues, immigrants and social security provisions as well as superannuation have been dramatically reformed. QUESTION 1 The impact of technological change on Industrial Relations over the last 10 years has been profound. Technology has impacted on the workplace in the following areas a Improved production processes and technology have driven the costs down of manufactured items causing increasing competition in the global marketplace. The impact for IR is that we given that the Australian economy has been deregulated and we are now part of the global marketplace we must strive for productivity increases to compete. b Robotics and increasingly sophisticated machinery has revolutionised job roles in manufacturing industry. The impact on IR is that we now require a higher skill level of both worker and manager at the workplace. c There has been an increasing variation in types of materials used. The impact for IR is the requirement to ensure that Occupational Health and Safety is maintained at high levels and that sufficent training is given."

        "text": "18 Kimberley Avenue Lane Cove NSW 2066 25 October 1994 Dear Tony and Lorraine Thank you for your recent letter with the news of your activities you both are keeping very busy, which makes the days fly, as we remember from our more active days. We have sent off to HK with this letter a tape that is probably the best we have sent over it contains the movie Strictly Ballroom, which was on tele two nights ago and from which Pamela edited all of the commercials there must have been more commercials in length than film footage as they appeared. She was up and down like a brides nightie Allan had to put that in, as he couldnt recall hearing it before Sunday, when we had lunch at Paddy and Annes. We hope you wont be shocked, Lorraine, at such vulgarity And we hope you enjoy the movie. Also on the tape is part of Thats Entertainment, which we know you will enjoy just as much. Its quite nostalgic, and we loved it. You may recall in our last letter we told you about the kerfuffle the NRMA is going through. Well, the latest development is that the Federal Court found in favour of the NO directors, with costs, and agreed that the ballot paper was unfair in that it propagandized the YES vote and didnt give equal prominence to the NO vote. Of course the YES Directors are appealing against that decision. It has all cost the Association about 30 million so far, and looks like costing a few millions more before the YES Directors and their mates get their sticky fingers into the NRMA till, which in our view is what its all about. Some six months or so ago Allan was driving Pamela to her favourite bread shop at Chatswood. He stopped in a No Stopping zone at the end of the deadend street, let Pamela out of the car, and watched while she safely negotiated the cobbled walkway to the smoother surface of the plaza, then drove 50 metres or so back down the street to a vacant parking space, where he waited for her to return. While he was waiting, he noticed a Parking Officer walk past his car down the street, cross to the other side, and come back up again. He was a bit puzzled about this strange behaviour, but his puzzlement evaporated when two days later he received a 115 fine for stopping in a No Stopping zone. He paid the fine, as he had stopped in the zone, albeit for about two minutes, but after stewing about it for a few days, wrote a letter of protest to the North Shore Times, which was published, and after stewing for a few more days, decided to write to the Minister, Terry Griffiths, complaining about the Parking Officers conduct, and suggesting that the officer should be counselled. Anyway, to cut a long and boring story short, several exchanges of correspondence took place, with the Minister adopting an unsympathetic and totally negative attitude, which absolutely enraged Allan. So you will not be surprised that when Griffiths was more or less forced to resign from his position for having made repeated sexual advances to his female staff, Allan thought it would be appropriate to write him a brief note as follows You can imagine how pleased I was to learn of your resignation in disgrace from the hallowed office of Minister for Police, and how avidly I followed each denouement as you wriggled and squirmed in your futile attempts to extricate yourself from the situation in which you had landed yourself. My belief in the law of natural justice has now been reestablished. Todays Herald featured Griffiths again, with a prepublication story on the report by Carmel Niland on the matter of his sexual harassment of his staff, and with Fahey saying I no longer consider Mr Griffiths should remain a member of my team. So as you can imagine, its all happening, with us feeling no sorrow at all. Incidentally, Allan has since observed that it is impossible for a vehicle to turn around at the end of the deadend street without stopping in the No Stopping zone, reversing, and driving out, so logically, without a timeframe, the prohibition is senseless, and should really be changed to No Standing. But apart from thatdotted line Incidentally, Pamela has suggested we enclose a special Australian newspaper supplement on the Liberal Partys 50th birthday for you, Tony, as she thought you might be interested in reading it. So it will be in the cassette. Jan and young Matthew are evidently doing OK, as evinced from phonecalls Pamela has made we havent visited them yet, as we thought shed need some time to resettle herself and get organized. But apart from the above, theres no news, so with love and best wishes, well sign off and prepare this for mailing. Pamela Allan 18 Kimberley Avenue Lane Cove 2066 Australia 20 April 1994 Dear Tony and Lorraine, Just a brief note to accompany the next two episodes of the infamous House of Elliott herewith. Also on the tape to fill it up is the ABC news of the 19th April. We cant remember if theres anything startling on it apart from the MLA from the Blue Mountains being accused of making bomb threats the cops are also investigating whether he might be the perpetrator of a bombexplosion up there some time before. Also, wrapped around the cassette is a newspaper story about where you live we thought you might like to compare notes. We have been enjoying the most beautiful weather lately almost of the summer variety dotted line beautiful clear skies, fluffy clouds, and temperatures around the 23C mark. Great golf weather, Tony, were sure youd love a game Allan has been playing his regular Wednesday and Friday games at Moore Park, and is pleased to announce that he is out of the doldrums with his game which were sure will fascinate you. Minna is here at home right now shes come to pick up Pamela to take her to town for a leisurely dinner and to the ballet at the Opera House after that. Minna sends her fondest regards to you both, and hopes you are well and happy in the service, as do the writers of this epistle. Incidentally, thank you for your postcard advising that you have received the video via HK you might let us know if via HK is the way to send them, or should they be sent direct to Shanghai Pending your advice, well send them via HK. All the best to you both from sunny Lane Cove. Love from Pamela Allan 18 Kimberley Avenue Lane Cove NSW 2066 Australia 23 January 1994 Dear Tony and Lorraine, We suppose that you have been reading about the bushfires around Sydney, and perhaps seeing them on television, with scenes of leaping flames and firefighters trying to combat them and perhaps you were wondering whether the Grant family had been affected by them Fortunately the bushfires never came closer than a couple of kilometres to our house, and we were never reallyin any danger. Some of our friends were, though, and they described the 30metre walls of flame threatening their homes in spinechilling detail though fortunately the fire was subdued by the firemen in time to save their properties. Bruce Hamilton, whom you of course know, took Allan for a drive around his River Avenue, Lane Cove environs when it was all over, and the sight of the blackened ruins that the week before had been happy households was very sobering indeed. So the next day Allan took our chainsaw down to Bruces place, and they cleared a lot of the useless but dangerous shrubbery from around his house. That same weekend Bruce and Allan went up to Bruces riverside property at Wisemans Ferry to see what, if any, damage had been caused there by the fires, but luckily the fires had not been near his 20hectare holding. He has no buildings on the land, which consists of ten hectares of sandy and grassy river flat and ten hectares of fairly heavily timbered mountainside, and he would have been very disappointed if the fire had burned it all to ashes, particularly the river flat, on which he has planted about two hundred flowering trees which are very immature. Some of the nearby properties had been absolutely ravaged by the fires the scenes were of blackened desolation, with not a speck of greenery, nor an insect, nor a bird anywhere to be seen. They went home that day two very subdued men, we can assure you. What with Frances torrential rains, floods and ice, Californias awful earthquakes and our dreadful bushfires, and the wars that are going on here and there over the world, things are not very pleasant these days, are they They must get better, surely To now write of more pleasant things on Tuesday last it is now Friday, Pamela and I and our good friends Paddy and Anne decided that it would be a good idea to catch a ferry from Circular Quay and go to Parramatta it was Pamelas idea, actually, as we reminded her several times later, have a pleasant lunch there, and return to Circular Quay via the ferry. After all, we agreed, we never travel by public transport, and have never enjoyed the pleasures of doing lunch at sunny Parramatta the river should be picturesque the weather was fine and sunny and all that sort of thing. So we met at Circular Quay, bought our return tickets for the journey, and boarded the sleek Rivercat, along with what appeared to be the rest of the population of Sydney with their squalling brats. We were lucky enough to get four seats adjoining a window, and after a while the Cat took off, passing by the Opera House to the accompaniment of the tourists Oohs and Aahs, then moving under the Bridge and up the Parramatta River towards our destination. At first the scenery was quite pleasant, with palatial homes lining the river, and here and there treeclad parks and swards but the further we went the more ordinary it became, with disused factories and Government buildings, then stretches of mangroves, with the river gradually narrowing and becoming more and more prosaic. But all in all it was pleasant enough, until over the public address system came the unpleasant news that all passengers must disembark at Parramatta and return to the city by train as the ferry we were on would be filled by passengers who had been waiting an hour on the wharf for their return trip and the ferry that was supposed to take us back had broken down and would not be fixed for some hours. What a disaster we thought. But then we told ourselves that it had been some years since we had travelled by electric train, and that it would be quite an adventure anyway, and besides we had no option, did we so we agreed to go back to Circular Quay by train and have lunch there. Thereupon we climbed aboard the waiting bus that would take us to the station, which it did and we caught a train, which was covered with graffiti, including the seats, and which passed through suburbs whose buildings next to the lines were also covered with graffiti. Our middleclass souls were horrified by all of this, of course, but we agreed that this was the way the world was, and we had to accept it, having no option. After all, we said, prehistoric cave art was another form of graffiti, wasnt it and perhaps in 50 000 years people would pay real money to see todays graffiti I dont think we really convinced ourselves of this, actually. Anyway, after a change of trains we arrived back at Circular Quay to our relief there was no graffiti on the Opera House as far as we could see, where we went to an excellent little Italian restaurant and enjoyed a very tasty lunch."

        "text": "121m offer for Austereo inadequate By Simon Evans Directors of radio network Austereo Ltds board of directors have labelled the 121 million takeover bid by entertainment group Village Roadshow as inadequate despite its substantial premium to the issue price of the shares. Village, which operates the Triple M network, launched its takeover bid on Friday night with a 20 per share cash bid for Austereo, which listed on the Australian Stock Exchange in July following a 62 million float at 90c a share. Austereo chairman Bill Cooper said yesterday that Villages proposed offer was clearly inadequate, especially in light of the recent takeover offer by Australian Provincial Newspapers for Wesgo Ltd. APN launched a 106 million bid on September 12 for Wesgo, which operates eight radio stations in the eastern states. Austereo comprehensively leads Villages Triple M network in all the key indices in which broadcasting is judged audience delivery, revenue and trading profitability, Mr Cooper said. Village said its bid for Austereo is subject to approval by the Trade Practices Commission and is conditional on it gaining 1 per cent. Austereo shares closed on Friday at Mr Cooper said Austereo shareholders should take no action, pending receipt of formal offer documentation from Village. Austereo managing director Paul Thompson said yesterday the Village offer ignored four key issues. They were Austereos leadership in broadcasting, its plans to develop a second national network to complement its existing successful network, the potential for developing business in emerging technologies such as pay television and the value of synergies available to Village in any merger of the two companies assets. Speculation that Village would make a bid heightened about ten days when it revealed it had snapped up 1 per cent of Austereo to become its secondlargest shareholder. But last Thursday Austereo announced that British media company Associated Newspapers Holdings had taken a 10 per cent stake in the company following an 5 million share placement by the Adelaidebased broadcaster. The placement was widely viewed as a defensive strategy by Austereo. Mr Thompson said he expected that ANH would make a formal statement abut its position some time this week. Trade Practices Commission chairman Professor Alan Fels said on Friday night the TPC had been notified about the bid and it had been agreed that if the bid was successful Austereos GOLD104 station in Melbourne would have to be sold by Village. Austereo owns SAFM in Adelaide, 2DAYFM in Sydney, FOXFM and GOLD104 in Melbourne, B105FM in Brisbane and FM7 and 2CA in Canberra. US inflation fears spark new round of money market hysteria Bond selling wave By DAVID LUFF USfed inflation hysteria has jolted the Australian bond market again, prompting resignation that yields would climb to 11 per cent before Christmas. The pressure on Australian bond markets intensified further yesterday, with long bond yields now firmly entrenched above 10 per cent. Commonwealth 10year bond yields rocketed as high as 27 per cent before a late afternoon recovery pushed the mark to 08 per cent at the close. Yields closed 20 basis points higher on Fridays 93 per cent finish. The pressure on bonds was not restricted to the long end.Threeyear Commonwealth bond yields closed at 63 per cent, advancing on Fridays close of 50 per cent. Further 90day bank bill yields jumped sharply, leaping to 96 per cent from 91 per cent on Friday. The bondmarket selloff registered some collateral damage on the stockmarket. The markets All Ordinaries index staggered 9 points lower yesterday to finish at Most of the backlash came from worsethanexpected inflation statistics on Friday night which infected the US bond market before spilling over to the local scene. A fiveyear high for capacity utilisation data in August 7 per cent compared with a forecast 84 per cent inflamed fears of an inflation jump and triggered a frenzied selloff of US bonds. As expected, the Australian market mirrored the rout, but local bonds were punished more than their US counterparts. Citibank senior economist Stephen Koukoulas said Australias contribution to the giant flow of funds on a global basis exacerbated the impact of major bond movements. When the US sells off five basis points we sell of 10 or 15 thats the biggest problem, he said. Mr Koukoulas expected a period of consolidation during the next few weeks before culminating in another frenzied selloff. He said it would be surprising if yields continued to surge through the 11 per cent barrier because of the strength of the economy. It is very hard to see it going much higher than 11 per cent because the fundamental inflation story is not that bad, Mr Koukalis said. Schroders Australia senior economist Bernadette Fulton agreed yields will crash through 11 per cent but forecast it will pierce the mark in the next few weeks. Bond yields are virtually at 5 per cent and its not too hard to see them at 11 per cent within the next month, Ms Fulton said. Garry Lord from Bankers Trust said 11 per cent was a fair and reasonable target but he did not expect yields to rise much above that level. While most observers agreed the US Open Market Committee was likely to raise official cash rates before the end of the year, speculation has arisen over a further two interest rate hikes before Christmas. This will increase the pressure on the bond market. Ms Fulton said the market had effectively factored in one jump in US official rates but a second hike was not out of the question. The rumours have escalated in the wake of the poor statistics on Friday night. There are a number of people in the US who are arguing there could be an increase in rates following the committee meeting in September and on 15 November, Ms Fulton said. Presser disappointing By DAVID LUFF NINE Network Australia Ltd has lent its inprinciple support for a change of ownership at its Perth affiliate, Sunraysia Television Ltd. Senior Nine sources confirmed yesterday they were disappointed at the operating performance of Sunraysia which has been controlled by executive chairwoman Eva Presser for the past four years. However, they were adamant the Kerry Packercontrolled broadcaster would not materially intervene in the 60 million battle for Sunraysia. Sunraysia has consistently performed poorly in both operational and ratings terms in the four years of Ms Pressers tenure at the helm and stands out as the worst performing of the Nine affiliates. She clearly hasnt performed well theres no doubt about that, a senior Nine executive told the Daily Telegraph Mirror yesterday. You only have to look at their ratings to get an indication.. The source added there would certainly be room for improvement with a new direction introduced from a new management. The comments came as Ms Presser rejected a 60 million hostile bid for the broadcsater by Kerry Stokes Australian Capital Equity group. Ms Presser was adamant yesterday she would not sell her 47 per cent holding to Mr Stokes. The vehement rejection sparked a stunning 11 per cent climb in the price of Sunraysia shares. Shares soared 60c to a record high of 00 after Ms Presser criticised the Stokes bid pitched at The bid is uninvited, unnecessary, unwanted, unspectacular and my rejection is unequivocal, Ms Presser said. She branded the 60 million takeover bid as an attempt to destabilise the Nine Network itself. Qantas earnings take off Result boost for 2b float By DAVID LUFF A NET profit of 156 million by Qantas Airways Ltd in its latest financial year will erase doubts about its financial viability in the leadup to a 2 billion float, according to chairman Gary Pemberton. The result represents a 530 million turnaround on 1993 when 400 million in writeoffs stemming from the acquisition of Australian Airlines pushed the carrier to a 8 million loss. At an operational level the result was also vastly improved, with profit before tax and abnormal items jumping almost tenfold to a record 302 million from 9 million previously. Sales revenue firmed 13 per cent to 6 billion. The result was characterised by much larger earnings in the second half of the 199394 fiscal year, boding well for a further improvement in 1994 A net profit of 3 million was booked for the second half compared with 6 million in the first six months, contrary to the usual trading pattern. Mr Pemberton said the results were especially pleasing, coming as a prelude to the public float in the first half of next year. It demonstrates we are on line towards the target we have set ourselves, Mr Pemberton denied Qantas ever aimed for a 1315 per cent return on shareholders funds before launching the float. The carrier posted a 5 per cent return in 1994 The market would be looking for the signs of where we were going rather than where we had arrived to, he said. It would be expecting to see evidence that that was an achievable objective and I think this result is starting to get towards that. Productivity improved following an increase in capacity, offsetting a jump in costs associated with the higher passenger loads. Trimming the cost structure would remain a major priority with management staff with the carrier planning to slice 10 per cent off costs in the current year. Qantas will continue to do whatever is necessary to continue to improve our efficency, Mr Pemberton said. While more economic fleet use and a tangible contribution from the Australian Airlines purchase helped boost earnings, Mr Pemberton said a stronger market was the key to the revival. Passenger demand, for both domestic and international services, picked up significantly, with local business grabbing a marginally larger slice. While citing the healthier demand as a major factor in the result, Mr Pemberton said more efficient operations were a major contributor. Its been driven, certainly, by a strong market but unquestionably it also reflects an improvement in Qantas underlying performance, he said. A timetable for the float has not been worked out at this stage but Mr Pemberton indicated it would fall close to the Federal Budget in May next year. Qantas management had not been able to focus solely on the proposed float because of more strenuous market competition and new directions, Mr Pemberton said. Qantas could expect to post stronger profits in the current financial year. Country Roads 8m detour By JANE SCHULZE Country Road Ltd will set aside 8 million this year after its American executives deceived the company about the true cost of establishing its American stores, chief executive officer Mike Howell revealed yesterday. However, before this abnormal loss the company increased its aftertax operating profit to 25 million to July 31, up from 950,000 last year. The 8 million abnormal loss followed massive writeoffs which sent Country Road to a bottom line 29 million loss in the year to August Mr Howell said while recovery of lost money from the executives was a priority, the directors wanted to immediately account for the loss in the balance sheet. He said the company first discovered its American problems only two weeks ago. Its disappointing that it took so long to come out because it was obviously concealed from us, but when we did the reorganisations it had to come out, he said. The two or three people involved have since been removed he said. To our knowledge there has been no additional to the 8 million loss to the company or removal of assets, he said. Mr Howell said the closure of 22 stores in the US and Australia last year meant their sales increase had been marginal up 9 per cent to 244 million from 242 million. But now it ensures we are able to sell into markets where margins will be better, he said. Country Road declared a fully franked dividend of 5c, making a total of 4c for the year, up from last years 3c. However, the dividend reinvestment plan has been suspended as the company was very financial with unused capacity of 20 million, he said."

        "text": "By Jean Norman Illustration by Nigel Buchanan Men and women are not equal when it comes to Australias healthcare policy mens HeaLTH scanDaL Thirty years of feminism may have stressed the need for an equal society, but female gains have been at the expense of Australian male health care. An old feminist slogan says We dont want a bigger slice of the cake we want the whole damn bakery. In terms of health, women have taken the whole damn bakery while men enjoy the crumbs. Its an understatement to say that more money is spent on womens health than mens. Because in Australias case, more means a difference of tens of millions of dollars. One official reason why so much more of the health dollar goes to women is that because they live longer than men, theres always been more of them. Why Because they are more health conscious and their health is superior. Why Because the prevention of womens diseases and the promotion of womens health is important to the Government. Important to the tune of 24 million to the Cervical Cancer Awareness campaign over the last four years a campaign that has just been topped up with another 4 million for this year. Mens Health Important to the point that the recent Federal budget, reaffirming the Governments commitment to improving womens health, gave the National Womens Health Program 32 million. Womens health is so important that in New South Wales alone, 93 million has been set aside to provide specific funding for womens health. So important, in fact, that special Federal health funding of 29 million will be matched dollarfordollar by the states and territories this year dotted line and the whole sackload goes to the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer. Obviously womens health is important. But nowhere within the vastness of the Federal Health budget, or the juggernauts of eight State and territory health departments, is there even the mention of mens health, let alone a mens health budget. This may seem wrong, but rest assured, it is correct. In politically correct circles the nonexistence of mens health at the expense of womens is called positive discrimination. Positive Discrimination is the politically correct way of saying that we are all equal but some of us are women. And it pays not to disagree with the party line. One official from the Federal Department of Health told us Setting up affirmative health action for women is like starting a special whitesonly healthcare clinic in Alice Springs. But he didnt want his name used for fear of reprisal. Positive Discrimination is like that. An analysis of government health data shows that one gender is definitely disadvantaged. We know this gender is dying of cancer. The Australian Bureau of Statistics calls it morbidity due to malignant neoplasms and it kills more Australians than anything else. Most cancer victims get their death warrants via lung cancer, which kills three times as many men as women. The next most common cancer is that of the breast. Approximately 2,500 women die of it annually. Cancer of the prostate gland kills approximately 2000 men each year and, as its incidence increases, the death rate rises. Which cancer are you the most aware off While the Federal and State governments throw 58 million at the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer, a program that would attack the killer prostate cancer is still seen as inappropriate. The only reason more men dont die of prostate cancer, according to one specialist, is that they dont live long enough. The only way for a man to definitely avoid it is to die young, says Sydney Hospitals Dr Basil Donovan. Its a bit of a mystery because there hasnt been much research done into it. It receives nowhere near the attention nor respect it deserves as a male health issue. As with breast and cervical cancer, the key to treating male cancers lies in early detection. How many men, asks one doctor, are aware that a basic testes examination is a far more accurate and effective preemptive anticancer measure than the breast examination that women are taught from widespread advertising and education A nursing sister from a major STD clinic told Australian Penthouse shed been trying for months to get hold of leaflets showing men how to examine their own testes. excerpt Young men in their teens and twenties are the most at risk from cancer of the testicles but Ive been told theres no funds available. Testes selfexamination can be effectively taught in a matter of minutes, but there is not one education department in Australia that advocates or sponsors the teaching of testes selfexamination to high school boys. There are plenty of funds available to educate women about osteoporosis thanks to an exhaustive public health campaign there cant be a woman alive in Australia unaware that calcium rich foods help prevent the disease of bone deterioration. Osteoporosis weakens and thins the bones to the point where tripping over the cat could leave one in line for a hip replacement. The disease has become one of the female health issues but its as much a problem for elderly men who die far more frequently following a fall as it is for elderly women. If most men have even heard of it they assume its an old womens disease, largely because that is the only way it has ever been marketed. Many men are similarly unaware of the risks connected with vasectomy which range from testicular pain and erectile incapacity through to cancer. Equal numbers of men and women get skin cancer but twice as many men die from it. Women outlive men by an average of six years, perhaps partly because men are three times more likely to commit suicide. So who is disadvantaged The gender with the highest death rate, whose best tactical bet for preempting painful, drawnout diseases is to just die of something else anyway Or the statistically far healthier gender whove somehow gone from being half of the human species into a disadvantaged minority group with a massive slice of the health pie If one malespecific cancer kills practically as many men as the major female cancer kills women, wouldnt both diseases get equal research funding For an answer we went, logically enough, to the Federal Department of Health Youre doing a story about what Whats that The switchboard operator sounded as puzzled and aghast as if Australian Penthouse had phoned the department for help with an article about dinosaurs. Male health issue, we repeated. What on earth do you mean Never mind, could you connect us to the Womens Health section Which one Theres so many different areas of it. Eventually we were connected to the Health Minister, Senator Graham Richardsons office, where his spokesman said they absolutely reject any suggestion that men are being discriminated against. The reason there are special programs for womens health, the disadvantaged such as Aboriginals and so on, is not that were placing a greater priority than needed, but that in the past a lot of issues were ignored. To do a special remedial health program for men would suggest that men arent getting a good deal and there is nothing to suggest that. But several highranking Government health officials say theres a lot to suggest that male health is neglected. One official admits that the obvious gender bias in public health is becoming an issue inside the department A lot of people would find it outrageous and totally unacceptable for a male health clinic to be opened up, so why is there something targeted at purely one half of the species he asks. Nearly everyone is targeted in the health budget young, old, disabled, nonEnglish speaking persons, persons with HIV, womendotted lineThat leaves the white, English speaking dotted line middle Australian man untargeted. This nontargeting is what yet another senior DOH official thinks has led to 500,000 Australian men missing in action each year. From the age of zero, men die off at a much greater rate. It honestly reminds me of Flanders in the First World War. An argument thats been advanced by feminists and womens groups is that its mens own fault obsessive, stressed, workaholic, incommunicative, drinkers etc. that theyre more likely to die. Thats blaming the victim, says the senior official. She got raped because she wore a short skirt. He got AIDS because he was a poof. Its a politically incorrect argument that shouldnt be legitimate in human rights circles. But, he explains, when it comes to Homo Australis the attitude becomes Oh, bad luck men are just the weaker species dotted lineimagine if that argument were applied to a premature baby He doesnt even think ordinary women particularly benefit from the National Womens Health Program. They dont see themselves as disadvantaged and are exasperated at what is being done in their name. Obviously one must have obstetrics and gynaecology but these women cant see the point in special womens health centres to provide what should be general health care for both men and women. Its a radical feminist objective and its basically separatist. Pointing out that hes not in favour of male health clinics either, the Doctor asks Why separate the sexes I thought the whole idea was to eliminate sexual apartheid Radical feminist and Womens Electoral Lobby spokeswoman, Eva Cox, was incredulous when Australian Penthouse phoned her. What are you writing about Male health Oh, you mean theyre worried about their little appendages Explaining that as one of Australias best known feminists we assumed shed be in favour of equal rights, we asked her opinion of the clear disparity between the time and money given to female over male health issues. Oh, the poor little blossoms, she says. If Im sounding unsympathetic, its because I am. Im disconcerted by the sudden trend of men wanting to shove women over and become victims too. Men, she says, have been running the medical profession for over 500 years and if men arent looked after by the health system, then its noones fault, but their own. Australian Penthouse raised the subject of prostate and testicular cancer I know women live longer and all that stuff, she snaps. But men have stuffed it up and now they want to unstuff it up. They want us to feel sorry for them. It makes Eva Cox sick, she explains, that men are now whingeing and pretending to be victimsdotted line They can sort themselves out and stop expecting us to take care of them. This thinking is dangerous for men and women, warns Dr Donovan, who specialises in sexually transmitted diseases. As a venereaologist, I am opposed to singling out one sex for special attention. Its a recipe for disaster to treat just one half of the combination. There isnt much use, he explains, in having women aware of genital health, the need for regular smears and diseases such as chlamydia sexually transmitted, symptomless, common in both sexes and can cause infertility if men are being left out of the equation. Male health issues are seriously undercatered for, he says. Theres been an attempt to positively discriminate in favour of women but its forgotten that the health system has never actually been positively skewed towards men. He admits that people with, for example, genital cancers, often used to be frightened, given barely any explanation of what was happening and were uninformed of selfhelp or preventative measures. The situations been reversed for women but when it comes to men, not a lot has changed. As were all the medical professionals consulted for this article, Dr Donovan was at pains to stress hes not against womens health as such. Id just like to see a health service that didnt distinguish between the sexes. If you visit the health section of any large book store, most of the books are about or relating to women premenstrual tension, menopause, female depression, hormone replacement therapy, eating disorders, osteoporosis, fertility, infertility, female cancer, female orgasmdotted line"

        "text": "LINDY CHAMBERLAIN AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY THROUGH MY EYES To broad shoulders, the freedom of the outback, a freedom kept at such high cost. A Great Scam Liz and John had to get dressed and Liz was to ring the house we were going to. John had to get the truck ready. I was to finish shutting my cases, then wake Stuart up. Wed let him sleep as long as possible, knowing he was tired. John gave us strict instructions not to turn on any lights as this would let the press know what was happening. I knew Stuart was in young Joshua Parrys room and the location of the bed, but not what other furniture was in the room, or where hed put his suitcases. It was pitch black in there. I had visions of Stuart hitting me over the head, mistaking me for an intruder when I tried to wake him, but when I spoke his name he woke immediately, fully alert. I quickly told him our plans he had ten minutes to get ready then left to help load my gear in the truck. Liz and I were so excited we had started to get the giggles. The quieter we tried to be, the more things we walked into or dropped in the dark. John reprimanding us made us giggle even more. Sure enough Stuart came down, hair combed, dressed and ready to go in the allotted ten minutes. Still in the dark, we crept outside. There was a street light close by, so we kept in the shadow of a huge banyan tree. John often had carpet cleaning or pest control jobs in office blocks at that hour of the morning, so it was not unusual for the truck to be moving at that time. Stuart was just as clumsy as Liz and I, and on the way to the truck we both nearly fell over a board lying in the middle of the path. Trying to tell one another to be quiet and say, Ouch softly made us nearly fall over again laughing. We felt like a band of conspirators. We finally jumped into the cab of the big pest control truck, donned pest control hats, and sat there trying to stifle our laughter while waiting for John not feeling half obvious Johns slogan was All our patients die we hoped we were going to be among the lucky ones that day. John waited until Liz had driven out of the gate in the other direction and watched while the reporters took the bait and followed her. As if on cue, Footsie arrived as Liz was pulling out the driveway, and followed also. He had thought he would drive past early and check everything was OK for the escape just in case he was needed as an extra decoy. It couldnt have been better timed. With the two cars going together the press was sure I was aboard. They gave chase. Liz had strict instructions from John not to drive beyond her capabilities. She was to lure the press as far away as possible so we could get clear. Then she was to return home. We had a quiet trip across town to a mystery destination, finally pulling up and unloading our gear into a guest flat under a high block house. Upstairs we were introduced to Greg and Jill Dawkins, who were kindly giving us shelter. We learnt that the flat had been specially built so that Michael and the children would have a new place to hide on visits as the press knew their regular accommodation, or in case we needed a place to escape to, like now. The flat had only just been finished and we were its first occupants. I was most grateful. Greg and Jill gave us a warm welcome. While we were talking, Footsie and Liz arrived. They had led the press a merry dance Liz had parked her car at home and then arrived with Footsie to see if we were OK. As neither the press nor John had returned to the Parrys by this stage, Liz had presumed John knew Footsies new plans. Meanwhile, John arrived home and found no Liz. He waited, unaware of Lizs movements, and began to fear that shed been kidnapped or something. Liz rang later to see he was OK, and he berated her for not following the plan as instructed. Liz was determined, however, to spend her last few hours with me it was the only time wed had together alone after nearly three years of weekly halfhour visits and Liz deserved that. We had a lovely breakfast with our hosts, then Liz and I went downstairs to the flat to get some sleep. Stuart had a room upstairs, and talked for a while longer, then went back to bed too. It was shortly after dawn. Liz and I were too excited to sleep for more than half an hour and finally realised we were both lying there trying not to wake each other. We started chatting again, despite the fact that that was all the sleep Id had that night. We talked and talked. When Stuart woke and came down to rouse us, he found us excited and ready to go. He had his camera, so we took photos and clowned around while waiting. The three of us were in top form. Back at the Parrys, the press scouts had returned. John got the boys breakfast and organised them for the day. He was relieved to note that the rest of the usual press contingent turned up. That meant our plan had worked. If the media had suspected anything they would have left by now for the new location. Plan two could go into action. To make the media continue to believe I was still there, people had to keep visiting. The cricket was on and Bob Donaldson was going to watch it with his boys. That was perfect, because he was the only other person in Darwin I knew as well as Liz. If he arrived with his family to watch the cricket at John and Lizs house, with a bit of luck the media would decide I was still there just having a quiet time with my closest friends before I left on the plane for home. It also meant there was someone to care for the three Parry boys until Liz and John got back. Seven boys watching cricket provided all the noise that was needed to convince the media they hadnt followed a hoax and that I hadnt left. So they waited, and waited, and waiteddotted line Mike Lester, knowing we were giving the press the slip, hung around to see what would happen. As the time arrived for us to leave for the airport and nothing happened, the crews grew more and more anxious. John left on his own and no one bothered with him. Pleased with the way things were going, he turned up to see what we were all doing. He still hadnt quite forgiven Liz, though Just before I left I was handed two large sheaves of gladioli and mixed flowers that had just been delivered. What on earth was I going to do with them They obviously werent going to last much more than the trip, and yet I wanted to take them with me. Stuart laughed and said he was sure I would think of something to do with them, so they went with me. We said goodbye to Liz and our hosts when Footsie returned, and piled into the vehicle to make our way to the airport. Paul Brain, now moved from the Alice to manage Ansett Industries in Western Australia, had said once before that if we needed any help he would be available. He can look quite fierce, and his karate experience and build are also offputting. We thought it was wise to have some security plus the arrangements for the trip dealt with as one. One phone call was enough for Paul. He hopped a plane to Darwin and was there for the trip to Sydney with us. He had arranged everything with the airport managers at each airport, and they were there waiting for us at each place. The trip went without a hitch. The reporters had decided to stake out the airport also there was one lone car under a tree near the entrance. As we passed we saw feet up in the drivers window. The cars occupant was obviously either reading or sleeping in the midday heat, and not watching the cargo bay or the trucks coming and going. We were able to go across there without hindrance. Paul had arranged for our luggage to be checked straight in, including a big picture they were worried might get damaged. I said to them, Look, its unfinished. I dont mind. Just send it through as it is, anyway. Finally, they said they would. We got the luggage checks and gave them to Stuart for collection at the other end, so I could be whisked away immediately. We then hopped back in the vehicle to drive to the plane. Once again we passed the reporter on guard. This time, however, he followed us, but could not get past the barrier. Mike told us later that his news team had had an emergency radio call I assume from him telling them we had done it again and were already at the airport. This sent them into a flat spin and a highspeed trip to get to the airport before the plane left. We drove up to the plane steps to board early Paul was in charge, and obviously quite at home. Suddenly Stuarts words about the flowers were prophetic. Other press were now swarming inside the terminal barriers and I still had to get up the plane steps. The flowers were the perfect cover, so the press were unable to take photographs of me. We had bills to pay they werent going to get useful photographs for nothing. I put both arms around the flowers and hid my face behind them. The media had no idea how slim I was because the dress I was wearing was the fairly flowing Aline postnatal dress Jenny Miller had bought me for Michaels graduation. With Paul standing between me and the press, plus the flowers, all they could see was a blue dress and legs. High Flying Stuart and I sat in the seats right at the front near the door. We couldnt have been in a worse place for initial boarding. We pulled the blind down so no one could see in the window. Paul was seated directly behind us so that he could keep an eye on things and stop anyone who came too close. The rest of the passengers boarded, including the press. Paul gave me a newspaper and said, Here, they might try with their cameras as they walk past, so put that in front of you. I hurriedly put up the newspaper just in time. I forgot I still had a lap full of things though. My legs were too short to reach the floor why are plane seats so high and the things started to slide off when I let them go to grab the newspaper. Reaction took over and I used the old prison sit one leg across my knee at right angles to hold them there forgetting that I now had to sit in a ladylike fashion. One of the photographers snapped a shot the result was a view of Lindas dress, leg up, petticoat showing, and a newspaper over her head. When the girls in prison saw that they were highly amused, saying, Thats the prison sit. Shes forgotten shes out now. I realised fairly quickly what I had done and was able to get Stuart to grab the stuff on my lap, so I could put my head behind the newspaper better and my leg down without anything else sliding."

        "text": "Donors must be identified Olsen From DAVID WASHINGTON CANBERRA The head of the Liberal Party committee on disclosure of political donations has called for stronger Government moves to enforce full disclosure. The call, by South Australian Senator John Olsen, flies in the face of concern by Liberal Party organisational figures that the disclosure provisions will have a disastrous effect on party finances. Senator Olsen said yesterday the Governments legislation should be improved, to close loopholes which allow the true source of donations to be disguised. Liberal Party divisions on the issue widened at the weekend, with the Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, hitting back at the NSW Liberal Partys senior fundraiser over his criticism of the Oppositions decision to support full disclosure. The chairman of the NSW Liberal Partys central finance committee, Mr Bevan Bradbury, has reportedly written to Liberal MPs criticising the decision. His letter said disclosing the identity of donors would have a devastating effect on the Liberal Party. The impact on the inflow of funds to the party of legislation that requires the identity of donors be revealed will be horrendous and it will be immediate, the letter said. Dr Hewson said he could understand Mr Bradburys frustration but he must accept that he and the party organisation do not make the policies of the parliamentary party. He said the Coalition would work to ensure that the Governments draft legislation was fair and equitable. Senator Olsen, in a statement which will anger party officials such as Mr PhotoCaption Bradbury, called on the government to toughen its disclosure legislation. With this disclosure bill, there is not true disclosure, Senator Olsen said. This was because the last person or group to handle the donation before it was given to the party was disclosed as the donor, but the real donor could be completely different. Full of rhetoric Senator Olsen said the bill was full of rhetoric and fulsome wording aimed at creating the perception of action. But careful analysis shows the Government is committed, as always, to protecting the prime source of donations from its mates, perpetuating the deviousroundrobin of bags of cash weve heard so much about from the WA royal commission, he said. Senator Olsen said the Electoral Commission should be given the power to conduct spot audits, to ensure the true sources of donations were revealed. The Opposition would propose substantial amendments to the disclosure bill, including giving union members the right to decide whether their union dues should go to the ALP. Senator Olsen said the bill made no mention of unions disclosure of the millions of dollars in affiliation fees and other donations they passed on to the ALP every year. Yet a massive 44 per cent of union members 32 per cent Coalition, 12 per cent Democrat do not vote for the ALP, he said. Liberal Party officials are concerned that many financial backers will refuse to donate if their identities are revealed publicly. Last week, the Government introduced the bill to ban political advertising and enforce full disclosure of donations but it is yet to be debated. Summit rebuff to Bannon From Chief Political Writer LINDSAY OLNEY CANBERRA The call by the Premier, Mr Bannon, for a national summit on unemployment faces certain rejection by the Federal government. Despite varying degrees of support for a summit from other Labor premiers, the Government will agree to no more than a full discussion of unemployment at the annual Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on May The summit idea also faced opposition yesterday from employers and the ACTU. But Labor state premiers continued to support the push by Mr Bannon for the special conference. In BRISBANE, the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, said Australia needed national policy changes, concrete public works programs and tax breaks for private industry to tackle the growing unemployment crisis. He said it was time for the Federal Government to look at some major national projects of public works. The Victorian Premier, Mrs Kirner, will contact other premiers in a bid to get agreement on a joint States push for national action on job creation. Mrs Kirner said she would contact the premiers before the May 31 Premiers Conference to establish an agreed agenda for the talks. Although no formal decision has been made about the summit, sources said the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was a bit cool on the idea. There was doubt about what such a summit could achieve and there were dangers it could become purely atalkfest. Yesterday, the Employment Minister, Mr Dawkins, attacked Mr Bannons proposals to bring forward major infrastructure projects such as the DarwinAlice Springs railway and the multifunction polls to boost employment and provide Austra Table Banks, business to blame Keating blockThe Treasurer, Mr Keating, told Parliament yesterday there was no doubt Australia had substantial economic difficulties, but it would pull out of the recession with lower interest rates. blockHe blamed the business and banking community for many of the economic problems. blockThis recession is deeper than official policy would have had it be, he said. blockMr Keating said banks were the only institutions able to conduct a credit squeeze and were now doing so to some sections of the community. lia with infrastruture resources to take advantage of the recovery. You certainly dont want to go ahead with crazy ideas like building unwanted railway lines betweeen Darwin and Alice Springs, he said. It would cost a fortune and is just not appropriate for our current circumstances. The summit proposal was condemned by the Opposition employment spokesman, Mr Howard, as a stupid gimmick. He said it would do no more than raise false expectations and would not help the growing unemployment problem. You cannot solve unemployment by talkfest, he said. Unemployment will go higher.M One of the biggest problems is that people lack confidence. If the Government showed some confidence maybe this would rub off on the economy. The Confederation of Australian Industry chief executive, Mr Ian Spicer, said he saw no good reason to have an unemployment summit at this time. What needs to be done is no mystery, he said. There should be no need to gather everyone together to decide to do the things that obviously need to be done without delay. Mr Spicer said the Federal Government had to look at its interest rates policy, support the recent national wage decision and restructure the tax system with the introduction of a consumption tax. The ACTU president, Mr Martin Ferguson, said the union movement was not interested in an unemployment summit, as it believed such a summit would be just another talkfest. Meanwhile, the consumer price index for the March quarter, to be released tomorrow, is expected to show that price rises slowed almost to a halt. With the Government counting on a low figure to ease the battering its credibility has received over unemployment, another drop in interest rates is thought to be inevitable. The Reserve Bank board met last week to discuss levels of interest rates and is believed to be poised to cut 5 per cent from offical rates. The major banks are expected to pass any fall on to mortgage rates almost immediately, bringing their lowest housing rates to 5 per cent or lower. Yesterday, the forecasting group BIS Shrapnel predicted housing rates would go to 13 per cent in the JulySeptember quarter, with rates unlikely to rise again for two years. It said banks would be keen to increase their home lending through lower rates and this would encourage new buyers into the market, promoting a recovery in the housing market in the September quarter. This indicated that general economic recovery would be slow in the second half of this year but would quicken in The consumer price index release is likely to show the lowest quarterly inflation rate in many years, and will put the annual inflation figure on track for a result of about 5 per cent or less. There have even been suggestions that the CPI for the quarter will actually fall. No more Umines ALP From LINDSAY OLNEY and DAVID WALKER The Labor Party has ducked the issue of changing its uranium policy and will not permit more mines to be developed at its national conference next month. The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, who has described the existing threemine policy as illogical, is believed to have told backbenchers that a change would not justify the political aggravation of a conference row on uranium. The decision is expected to anger the mining industry and put the Government under further Opposition pressure for putting political considerations before the countrys economic imperatives. Party sources last night said the issue would be debated briefly at the June ALP conference but that the factions had agreed in advance that the policy would not change. A decision to retain the existing policy would contradict the recommendations of a party policy review committee, which said the policy should be overturned. Although Mr Hawke has not given a public view on the threemines policy for several years, it was understood he and other rightwing ALP figures favored a change to promote export earnings and increase developer confidence in the Government. But it is now believed that Mr Hawke sees no point in changing TableOpposition gaining support poll SYDNEY The federal Coalitions lead over the Hawke Labor Government has widened one percentage point to 17 per cent, according to the latest Morgan Gallup Poll. The poll, published in the Bulletin magazine, showed support for the Government remained on a record low of 32 per cent while support for the Opposition increased one point to 49 per cent. Approval of the way Mr Hawke was handling his job dropped one point to 38 per cent, while 54 per cent disapproved. Opposition Leader Dr Hewsons approval also dropped one point to 48 per cent, while 29 per cent disapproved. When electors were asked who would make the better prime minister, 44 per cent opted for Mr Hawke and 41 per cent said Dr Hewson. the policy, especially with a depressed world uranium market. Last night a spokesman for the Prime Minister would neither confirm nor deny the reports. However, he did say Mr Hawke had reached a position regarding uranium policy.Last night leftwing MPs claimed that leadership pressures had forced Mr. Hawke to adopt a nochange position although other MPs said that the main consideration was the generally low standing of the Government. In 1982 the ALP decided that uranium mining would be confined to Roxby Downs, Ranger and Narbalek, which has since closed. At the 1988 conference the party established a review committee on the policy. The committee decided, with a dissenting minority report, that expansion should be permitted. That report is now certain to be rejected by the conference. The ALPs national executive is due to consider the report on June 1, although this is now no more than a formality. Yesterday the convener of the Centre Left faction, Senator Michael Beahan, said he did not think there were sufficient numbers in the party to force a change. Senator Jim McKiernan, from the Left, said the faction would continue to fight to prevent any change and would not settle on anything less than a formal pronouncement that the push for expansion had been abandoned. Last night the Opposition spokesman on energy and resources, Mr Tim Fischer, said if Mr Hawke refused a change he would be walking away from his responsibilities to the national interest. The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that Labors policy is illogical, he said. Australia has missed another opportunity and is sending an extremely confused message to overseas interests who may be considering development projects in Australia. What may be good for the political unity of the ALP is an absolute disaster for the mining industry and Australia generally. A spokesman for Western Mining Corporation Ltd, which operates the only uranium mine in South Australia at Olympic Dant, said there was no major expectation of a change. Were steaming ahead pursuing new markets for our products, he said."

I do hope the land an airfield takes off so that you two are not out of pocket for very long. The trouble with getting older is that if you invest in something financially it isnt much use if you have to wait 25 years for your return. So may you soon be the winners of latter or have your money back from the land or both. Even without work retirement is busy. Today we didnt even find time to go to the beach. I had to drive to the dentist this morning for a lengthy appointment followed by a small amount of shopping shopping pluslike ampersand photocopying. I wasnt home for very long before we had to leave again for our Spanish lesson. When we arrived home I prepared tomorrow nights dessert one of those 24 hour arrangements pluslike ampersand then it was time to leave for a lecture on cancer, mainly skin cancer, given by the local G.P. expert pluslike ampersand a Cancer Council representative. It looks like Ill find myself doing some volunteerwork for the Cancer Council presenting certificates to schools which hold their swimming carnivals at night for example. We have just arrived home and its Incidentally the lecture was magnificent pluslike ampersand accompanied by horrendous but fascinating slides. Actually I visited the lecturer 2 weeks ago pluslike ampersand had my skin checked. He said What a magnificent skin. What he really meant was I know youre face is sporting many crows feet pluslike ampersand your skin is like leather but you, you lucky devil, have a skin that can withstand the harmful effect of U.V. rays. Naturally the only words I quoted when I returned to forename1 were He said I have a magnificent skin. I still recall that when I attended a June Dally Watkins Course at the age of 19 the beautician said How old are you When I replied 19 she said You have the skin of a 25 yearold at least It really is grim to think that I have more crows feet than my sisterinlaw who is about to enter her 70th year well on July 14th that is. Sorry forename2 I think its the 11th. Our Spanish teacher is a delightful lady pluslike ampersand we love our Spanish lessons.forename3 surname2, our teacher, lived in Spain for 15 years. Recently the Spanish Govt. changed the regulations for Canadians pluslike ampersand Australians insisting that they lodge many thousands of dollars in a Govt. trust fund or something like that dollars forename3 didnt have. She sold her cottage pluslike ampersand returned to Australia. She is an artist pluslike ampersand a writer. She has had childrens stories published pluslike ampersand stories published in womens magazines. Ive decided there are a lot of multitalented people in placenameforename3 will be coming here because she wants to come to astronomy lessons pluslike ampersand I am the astronomy coordinator for the University of the 3rd Age, or U.A. Im sure if we had remained in placename3 we would not have become involved in the same way as we have here. Of course there would be other activities. The thing you miss most when you change your domicile is the friendship. Old friends which include your brother pluslike ampersand sisterinlaw can never be replaced. They have known you so long that there is no point in putting on an act to impress. You feel very comfortable with old friends knowing that they have realistic expectations. Because you have been rubbing shoulders for a long time you rarely misunderstand them pluslike ampersand they rarely misunderstand you. I dont think you can ever find this with new friends. Well perhaps you can but it is rare. Dont faint but I have written to a publisher about my proposed limerick book pluslike ampersand about my Yr 2 spelling worksheets pluslike ampersand he has replied saying he would like to see some samples. I became quite excited when his letter arrived. Of course I am no nearer to publication now than I was before I received the letter, but I couldnt help kidding myself just a little bit. When we climbed into bed last night I said to forename1, You know, there is one thing we have completely overlooked as an addition to our pension. Whats that said forenameThe royalties Ill receive from my publications, I said, which caused us both to laugh. Ill keep you posted. Did I tell you about my limerick book Forgive me if Im boring you with this a second time. When I wrote to the publisher I stated, The brilliance is not in the limericks I have written but in the idea I have devised which means that each limerick can be applied to 20 or 30 different names or something like that. I have written them pluslike ampersand am still writing them with the name inserted within the line pluslike ampersand not at the end of it, which means you slot any name into the space without altering the rhyme. They are written for young children Yrs 2 pluslike ampersand 3 basically pluslike ampersand the index will probably say One syllable boys namestwo syllable boys namesthree syllable boys namesOne syllable girls names ditto marks for 2 lines under last 3 words 2 3 pluslike ampersand perhaps Limericks appropriate to a girl or a boy by slotting in the name pluslike ampersand changing his to hers changing the pronoun Any ideas for the index would be appreciated. Any limericks would be appreciated too. With your permission familiarname1 Ill include the limerick you wrote about me There was a young girl called Frances Who was very fond of going to dances One night in the dark, she slipped in the park And came home with mud on her pantses . Can you believe that the pet name for Francesca in Spanish is Parke Dont ask me how to spell it The limericks I have written are on scraps of paper at the moment. Tomorrow pluslike ampersand Sunday I will type a few out pluslike ampersand send them off to the publisher. I went to the Community Centre today pluslike ampersand photocopied some of my spelling work sheets ready to post away. I have such a giaone lettertgiant sized ego that I am afraid someone will steal my limerick idea. When I wrote the S.O.S,book the brilliance on that occasion was not in the content but in the idea. Anyone could have written the book. It became the best seller for Met West. Infants Mistresses Publications at that time pluslike ampersand do you know that someone stole my idea pluslike ampersand produced it commercially. I guess this is why Im wary. forename2 how is your book progressing Are you any nearer publication Would one of the model aircraft magazines publish it They have the audience pluslike ampersand the printing facilities.

On that occasion she was speaking about the antismoking seminar but that wasnt the first time we had seen her on tele. The snakes continue to be conspicuous by their absence pluslike ampersand I for one am not complaining. The goannas pluslike ampersand water dragons great swimmers continue to visit. We have one goanna with a stumpy tail. Do such creatures exist or would he have had it bitten off Mother duck has one duckling at the moment pluslike ampersand as it is not a tiny creature I have hopes that this one will survive. The duck population varies. For several weeks there were about 10 on the lagoon. This week there have been between 20 pluslike ampersand We havent seen Johnny Raper the drake, a large white domestic type drake for some months. He was named Johnny Raper by forename1 after we were told that he had drowned a goose on the next lagoon when he tried to mate with her. Someone should give him a pair of spectacles pluslike ampersand then perhaps he wouldnt make such ridiculous mistakes. Our library here has videos so I borrowed Pride pluslike ampersand Prejudice the Olivier Greer Garcon excuse spelling version pluslike ampersand I loved it. I read Sarum last week pluslike ampersand enjoyed it. Its a novel about the history of Salisbury in England. Sarum is the original name. I am appalled at how little reading I fit in.

The financial experts fascinate me. Here am I with my dumb maths brain, but thanks be to Dad I am sometimes able to see through their rubbishy logic pluslike ampersand their half truths. Naturally they are interested only in pushing the lump sum option. At one meeting they put up a list of advantages of the lump sum over the pension pluslike ampersand listed one such advantage as Assetsto be passed on to your children Under pensions no assets to be passed on to childrenas pension ceases on death. So cheeky me jumped up pluslike ampersand said, Do you consider a house an asset Yes said the lecturer.Well I said, Most people have a house to pass on to their children quite a substantial asset I would suggest. Then there is the argument which I havent jumped up pluslike ampersand down about at a meeting but which occurred to me when I was reading the prospectus suggested plan for my retirement. They are always saying, And of course even though you do have the pension adjusted according to the CPI you should keep in mind that you will gain only 61 of the increase owing to the tax rate. Sounds good Makes you think the lump sum might be better And then it hitme So whats new Every time Ive had a salary increase for the past 20 years Ive ended up with only 50.

He also said that black people living in cold climates with not much sun suffer from rickets because their skin cant absorb the vitamin D.

        "text": "Dearest Dianne 24 March 1993 Wheres your manners You said youd write after you moved away AND YOU HAVENT So Im writing to you first I guess thats why I am a communications graduate and you are not what does pharmacy teach you . So how are you going over in WA Whats the weather like, the streets, the water like And hows your job going Just fabulous, I hope. Hopefully by the time I finish this letter I will have some photos to include in here. I say this because I have cut my hair off again and dyed it very red, and now I feel almost hip and glossy again. Short hair shows off my eyes and brows better, I like to think it should, for all the pain I put up with plucking my eyebrows into gorgeous lines. Im trying to get them thin like the magazines a genius look Hows youre eyebrows going I still remember drawing them into place in the Westfields toilet. Dont press too heavy with that brow pencil Remember, lightly does it. Anyway, I think it will take me a while to finish this letter my fingers dont feel like typing, and after the megascreen I use at work my own little Mac is proving quite a pygmy. So let me fill you in. I am working still at Telecom in Parramatta, and really enjoying it even though I dont have much responsibility, creativity or even much of a prospect of lasting there with a great future its just a fillin job for more money and variety as I see it. But Im still there, Thursdays and Fridays. I left Grace Bros finally I am so glad to be out of there they really treated you like shit there, the hours and pay was lousy for the amount of crap you had to put up with was just not worth it. I missed the opening of Penriths grand store, but hey, if I do want anything from GBs I would go to another store just to show that the Penrith store is lousy. Im not working at the uni this year it was nice but I also felt it was time to leave uni Big news is that I am working parttime three day a week, MonTuesWed at Penrith City Council in the Promotions PR dept. I am wait for it the Economic Development Project Officer. Basically Im assisting in the Councils economic development plans attracting business and investment to Penrith. I am responsible for researching, designing, writing a promotional package including a folder, a series of information brochures and booklets. Sort of bigtime Ive been there three weeks now and its getting better each day. I also help out with their Japanese Sister Cities stuff Ive written their annual report finished that today and other reports and submissions for award competitions and so on. So now I have some money rolling in regularly, which is nice and secure. This means I can save lots more I like to try for about 100 200 a week. I can also spend more on big things I bought a new pair of sunglasses, I have some new shoes picked out, I bought a navy pinstripe and manstyle jacket for winter so now I want it to hurry up and be cold so I can wear it. I can also buy some music at the moment Im playing to death my REM Automatic for the People and the Pet Shop Boys Discography remember the PSBs I used to love their stuff and I still do. Its so very cool and english which a friend taped for me. I might get the Whitney Houston soundtrack, or I quite like Arrested Development, or maybe just one of those records that has a big collection of singles, because theres quite a few that I like at the moment ie Duran Duran, Lenny Kravitz, Jeremy Jordan. How about you I have to tell you I met a fantastic guy at the recent federal elections I worked at one of the polling stations Ive done it for the past three or four elections now and we worked together for a few of the hours and he was great. Gorgeous. Fab u lous Okay, so thats 730 words more than youve written, Dianne Get that pen out and WRITE TO ME NOW Dianne hi 52896 I got a letter from Dianne I read it last night or was it the night before Good to hear from you, dearest It was weird I must admit that I didnt really want to hear about your cousins diarrhoea, but hey, if thats the best news that youve got dotted line Its great that you live so close to the big city. Things really happen in Perth I always thought of it as a quiet place, but I guess that sort of changed when they got the Americas Cup over there. I loved you sentence though instead I stay at home, watch tv, get at and watch life pass me by . Can I tell you something Thats how I feel, too. Go to work, get home, stay home. Life is passing me by, too. I have found that all my friends have dried up either theyve gone travelling like you but I dont hold that against you, its just that I miss my friends being close by or they have really abandoned me. Two close friends correction, friends I thought were close just stopped talking to me. It took me a while to realise this. Kelli you know the one you went to school with Well I saw her in Parramatta one day, we organised to have lunch, she cancelled, and thats sort of the end of the story. Jason hmmm, even now I have really mixed ideas about this, about him. Kiri, my friend who has gone back to Greece, came home to Australia for about a week she phones me the night before shes due to fly back to Greece again and she tells me that Jason has gone overseas. He doesnt tell me, does he No. That hurt a bit. A lot I think that maybe if I was more of a friend you know, didnt try so hard to be more, that maybe we could have been better friends. But you dont know with people, do you Im starting to feel really hurt by other people, really paranoid. Theres my friend Justine from Grace Bros but we hardly talk now maybe see one another once a month and it never feels like it used too. But because Im feeling so paranoid, I think that maybe people are sensing this and dont want to be with me that its my fault Work is OK. I leave the council in a week or two it was only a four month contract, but like you said, its really valuable experience and Ill be able to walk away with something that I can say I did this. That makes me feel good Telecom is going ok, too, and I think they may offer me a fulltime PR job there soon. And a friend from the State Library of NSW where I did work experience while at uni is leaving and they have told me to look out for her job being advertised I should maybe apply for it The thought of working in the city is very appealing, even though working at council was good because it was close to home, getting out of home is a nicer thought right now. Maybe I can come and visit you for a week or so We can sit at home and get fat together Let me know what you think about it.You can show me Perth and it would be good travelling practice. OK Of course, I wouldnt come when Tony is over here. Can I tell you something You did ask me what I thought about your longdistance relationship. You may not want to hear this, but oh well. My friend Kiri, in Greece now and engaged to and Englishman first went back when I knew her in our second year at uni, met a great guy called Costas. There was beautiful, envious talk of romance, how the two of them wrote letters, talked on the phone, promised to always love one another and meet back in Greece some day. Does this sound familiar to you OK, about this time last year, Kiri did go back and they met and it just didnt feel the same in fact she said it was a really bad situation and she was angry she had wasted so much time on him because they just couldnt make it the same as it was when they were first in Greece together or as perfect and simple as their love letters. I remember us talking before she returned again and saying but what if you cant recapture what you had Or if you find that letters and phone calls are one thing but meeting again is a totally different She said that yes, that might happen. And now, unfortunately, it has happened. So, Dianne, enjoy it while you can, I guess, but be careful about these longdistance things. And if, when you meet again, its not all hearts and roses, dont try and force it to be what you remember it was like. Kiri said they tried that to try and ignore how bad it was and pretend it was good again, because it might be embarrassing to admit she flown all the way around the world to marry someone and now she didnt even like him anymore. But that was to hard, so they agreed it wasnt working and gave up. So be careful, OK I wouldnt want another of my friends hurt. As you can see from my photos, my hair is short and red do you like it I do although I want to get it cut even shorter. I havent made any clothes for about a moth or two now how lazy of me But I have lots of fabric that I have bought for when I will do some sewing nice long skirts. I like them they make you feel really elegant, much smarter than a short skirt I think sometimes. What about you Plus I saw the summer clothes are coming into store now. We havent had much of a winter over here, but its not so warm that I want to start thinking of my summer wardrobe already Im still cross stitching and Im thinking of moving onto making a tapestry cushion soon. Do you get a magazine that comes out every fortnight called Needlecraft It is very good and costs only 95. They have small embroidery kits to make bookmarks or potpourri sachets and great ways of teaching new techniques and ideas of things to make. You should have a look for it if you are still interested in your sewing and craftwork. Mum also bought me the Family Circle Cross Stitch bookmagazine, and its great. Over 70 stunning projects to tempt you , it says on the cover, and its 95 and distributed by Gordon Gotch in newsagents or supermarkets. Im going to see Super Mario Bros movie tomorrow, just for a giggle. And I cant wait to see Jurassic park and the Firm, because Ive read both of the books that the movies were based on. How about you Well, write soon. Let me know about the idea of me coming over for a week or so could be fun Dear Dianne 10 September 1993 Howdy Is it my turn to write or yours Mine, I think."

        "text": "Wearys seniority in 1932 and 1933 did not release him from the pressure to achieve high marks in examinations and keep his place at or near the top of his year. When he was offered a place in the Australian Rugby Union team that was to tour South Africa in 1933, he refused as a scholarship boy he could not afford to take a year off and he referred to this as one of two hurtful decisions he had to make while at Ormond. The other was when he decided not to apply for a Rhodes Scholarship on the advice of Dr Picken, who thought it inadvisable for Weary to go back to junior status at Oxford. No one in Ormond was unaffected by the Depression, but scholarship holders, particularly, balanced on a knife edge of uncertainty. The high value attached to membership of the Ormond brotherhood was given an even keener edge by the realisation that times were hard, money short and scholarship places eagerly sought. Picken did not give too many a second chance if he believed that they did not perform to the required standard in examinations, and there were plenty of clever students waiting to take the place of someone found wanting. That summer, when examinations were over, Weary did not work for Garrick or McCall Say with Charles Hopkins, he caught the train to Queensland. From Brisbane, they trundled up to Townsville, dividing the best part of two days and nights between a poky carriage and their second class sleeper. The Hopkinss sprawling bungalow on The Strand was to be their base for the next six weeks. Charles took him up the coast to Cairns and then inland to stay on the Heale familys property on the Atherton Tablelands. Weary has never been able to resist a challenge, especially one involving extraordinary physical effort, and he accepted a bet that he couldnt swim across Lake Eacham and back, a distance which he calculated to be about a kilometre and a half. His ambition almost outstripped his capabilities. These lakes were popularly said to be bottomless, and although a metre or so down was icy, the hot sun had warmed the surface of the water until the temperature was almost unbearable. He only just managed to reach the shore on the return journey no one realised how nearly he had not made it until he doubled up, streaming perspiration and suffering from severe cramps and heatstroke. This was the third time he had come close to drowning once in the Sheepwash Creek, once in the river at Benalla during an underwater swimming competition when he became entangled in a fallen tree and now in Lake Eacham. A day or so later, after everyone dined unwisely on a boiled tongue which had gone off in the heat, Weary and Hazel Heale had to drive at speed to the local bush hospital and borrow a stomach pump, stopping frequently along the way as the effects of acute food poisoning brought on vomiting. Weary helped the local doctor pump out the stomachs at the homestead and then washed out his own. The effects did not disappear for two or three weeks. For months, he could summon up the sound and feel of the seawater slapping beneath him when he had to hang himself repeatedly over the stern to cope with persistent diarrhoea, as later they sailed steadily up to Dunk Island then zig zagged from island to island and out to the Reef back south to Townsville. It was the longest holiday he had ever had, a magic vacation tour on which Charles sailed us up the coast, handling the navigation and the kerosene marine engine with skill and experience and back again. Magnetic Island, Palm Island with its Aboriginal settlement where Weary was photographed with an old Aborigine nicknamed King Tiger, Hinchinbrook Island and on to the scented paradise of an almost uninhabited Dunk Island, owned by the Hopkins family, for Christmas he had never been to sea before, never seem anything to compare with it. Unforgettable, unforgotten, the unbelievable violet, cobalt, green and opalescent sea and the magic night phosphorescence of glowing silver as the dark water was stirred by the leap of gleaming kingfish, or dipped to bright flaming rings by the successive strokes of the oars in the dinghy.6 The memory was as vivid when he described it over half a century later as it was when they celebrated the bright new year of Wilson Hall overflowed with students that 7 April 1933 when Weary walked onto the platform to receive a Full Blue for Rugby. It was Commencement, and as President of the Club, his evenings were monopolised by initiation activities as a member of the Students Representative Council, he was involved in broader issues affecting the whole of the student body and as a Representative player for the Victorian Rugby Union, he had already begun training more intensively than any other year. Medicine, Surgery and Obstetrics and Gynaecology, the final year subjects, had to be fitted in as well. Wearys tendency to collect more than his fair share of injuries was well known to the sporting press, who mentioned it at intervals. His enthusiasm for boxing was waning. As a fifthyear medical student, he was now spending more time in the hospitals and was reluctant to injure his hands in any way that might jeopardise a career in surgery. Nevertheless, when the adrenalin was flowing during a match, at times he a showed reckless disregard for his own safety. The rugby season opened with a match at Middle Park in which Weary played for the Victorian Probables team against the Possibles, so that the selectors could decide the positions for the match against Australia in May. During that first term, he was completing the required spell of obstetrics at the Womens Hospital in Grattan Street, Carlton, and on the first Friday in May, Weary had his first delivery. It was twins. Such an euphoric occasion for both mother and doctor made him late for football practice. Borrowing Charles Hopkinss bicycle, he peddled furiously up Grattan Street, the late afternoon sun full in his face. Weary did not notice the car coming straight for him until it was too late. He applied the brakes. They failed. And he found himself flying over the car and landing face down in a rockery. Charless bicycle had been reduced to a heap of crumpled metal on impact and Weary, blood streaming down his face from a broken nose, was helped up by a very worried driver. Never willing to confess to feeling pain, Weary made light of the accident and he recalls saying, Oh, dont worry it was my own bloody fault This rash honesty was rewarded by the cars owner sending him the repair bill, which he had great difficulty in paying. He was diagnosed as having a compound fracture of the nose and concussion. Someone took care of the nose and lectured him on the foolishness of his ways. Weary did not listen he was due to play for Victoria against Australia in four days time. At the Motordrome the following Tuesday, when the Victorian Representative team ran onto the ground to do battle with the Wallabies, the crowd greeted his appearance with a rousing cheer. Victoria fielded its strongest team ever against the full might of the Wallabies to draw the match at 12all, tha Australian teams lastminute try saving them the ignominy of defeat. The 3000 spectators and the sports writers were in ecstasy. It looked as if the southerners might vanquish New South Wales, despite the absence of three Victorian Representative players in South Africa. That night, the Victorian Rugby Union exuberantly farewelled the Wallabies at a ball in Leonards Cafeacute in St Kilda. Weary then put in a full days work at the Childrens Hospital and left it to the diehards to wave to the Ulysses as it steamed down Port Phillip Bay at 4 pm on its outward journey to Cape Town. Charles had persuaded him to see the physician, Sidney Sewell, about his concussion, but apart from a lingering headache and throbbing pain in the centre of his face which he was determined to ignore it was work and play as usual. In their last match before leaving for New South Wales, Victoria played The Rest. Weary was breakaway and, with Phelan, was spectacular in the loose and lineoutsdotted line after the first ten minutes, Dunlop gave his best game to date. When the Victorian team drew out of Spencer Street Station that Thursday evening, bound for the first interstate game of the season, its reputation was already being discussed in the Sydney newspapers there is now a definite menace from the south to the dotted line supremacy of New South Wales. And on the billboards at Central Station next morning, the sporting headlines warned, Win not certain. Victoria Ready for Fray. On Saturday 3 June, the rugby faithful paid their one and sixpences to watch New South Wales play Victoria on the North Sydney oval. When the teams filed onto the field, there was a gasp from the crowd. The Victorian forwards might have formed an All Black pack, so big were they. Dunlop, Perrin, Land and Arnold are magnificent specimens dotted line New South Wales seemed flustered by the All Black tactics dotted line They had been training for seven weeks, even undertaking a special course of physical culture. Playing with the forwards was the New Zealander and former All Black hooker, Jessep, one of Wearys adversaries in the third Test the previous year. Throughout that 1933 season, commentators and sports writers repeatedly would liken the eight to an All Black pack. Jessep has done wonders with them. They are big and fast and can ruck like the devil. At 16 stone 6 pounds and 6 foot 2 inches, Tom Perrin as lockforward was the heaviest Weary, at 6 foot 4 inches and 14 stone 10 pounds was next. Weary and Perrin were both Internationals. With Dewar they formed a formidable front row. The forwards carried the game. Jessep had trained them well. It was a new era, said the Sunday Observer, the rise of Victoria to a power dotted line capable of football in a manner that would not disgrace the high traditions of the home State. The official program displayed photographs of Jessep, Dunlop, Perrin and Ward. They did not disappoint the crowd. The North Sydney Oval was covered with the same Bulli soil which had caused Weary such problems during the third Test. Ironhard, and with great cracks about an inch across, the Victorians attributed to it the large number of injuries they sustained that day. Scarcely a man did not limp off when the whistle blew. Perrin and Burke had sprained ankles Jessep an injured right thigh Wearys face was badly battered and two others were doubtful starters for Monday. Dr Ward, the teams manager, summoned two extra players from Melbourne. Bruce Judd Dinty to his mates was a great, tough Irishman, over 16 stone in weight, and the only forward in the New South Wales pack who performed well in the match. Weary and he were old rivals from interstate games and the third Test. Not long before the final bell, Weary had the ball and was breaking through when someone caught his foot in a tackle and Dinty jumped on the back of my shoulders and neck and skidded my face for about two yards along the compacted Bulli soil. I still remember Dinty Judd saying in slow measured tones, Well, Weary, youre down and youre down to stay. Streaming blood, the skin and flesh stripped from the bone and Bulli soil ground in its place, Wearys nose was a mess. He never had a sound skin on his nose again. Next day, the Rugby Union took them to Bulli for an outing. On Monday, at Manly Oval, the bandaged giantstrounced New South Wales 14 to Photographs of the match show Wearys face partly obscured by strapping which failed to protect him from further provocation by the opposing team, Ron Walden, also a forward and the New South Wales boxing champion, persisted in putting his hand out and rubbing Wearys nose whenever he was nearby. When Weary warned him off, he took no notice, so the next time the hand came out, Weary swung his arm up savagely."

        "text": "Dispute turns ugly By ANDREW DARBY, Burnie, LEON GETTLER and KAREN MIDDLETON Police and picketers clashed violently outside the Associated Pulp and Paper Mills plant in Burnie late yesterday, as the dispute spread to the mainland with a planned national coalminers strike next week. Police, strengthened by reinforcements, heaved picketers to one side as they escorted about 20 workers through the lines of screaming strikers, who had locked arms. Two people went to hospital with injuries. The violence came after weeks of tension and bitterness over the threemonthold dispute, which yesterday resulted in about 300 of the companys 850strong workforce being sacked. Late last night, the number of picketers had swelled to about 400, as the 11 pm shift change went by without confrontation. A police spokesman said almost 1000 people police, spectators and the picketers were gathered outside the mill gate. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said the situation in Burnie had deteriorated into industrial mayhem. He said this would end only when the company comes to its senses. But the mill manager, Mr Ken Henderson, said that police had to prevail over what threatened to become the law of the jungle Mr Henderson said that workers who did not report for work yesterday, or did not formally declare that they had tried to report, no longer had a job. He expected to lose up to half the workforce. Yesterday morning, police were twice repelled by picketers. Then at the afternoon shift change, more than 80 police struggled for more than 10 minutes to take about 20 returning workers through the picketers. There were five arrests. Earlier in the day, 36 picketers were arrested when they refused to part ranks for returning workers on the morning shift and when they turned back a laden fuel tanker. After facing a total of 40 obstruction charges and one of assault, all those arrested were released last night. Tension was heightened on the picket lines by the presence of a squad of security guards, clad in black, whom the strikers dubbed the ninja turtles. They were alleged by picketers to have been involved in two assaults. The company defended its right to hire security guards. The ACTU president, Mr Martin Ferguson, said the security guards had been imported from interstate and included individuals who had previously been involved in violent clashes with strikers in other disputes. Police Inspector Roy Fox said at the millI see it remaining like this, with flashpoints all around the mill, until the dispute is solved by some other means. A union official on the picket line, Mr Mike Grey, said that yesterdays clash reflected the federal coalitions industrial policy. Theyve come out supporting APPM. Its going to be the same for every worker in Australia. Another organiser, Mr Shayne Murphy, saidWell sustain it the industrial action as long as the company can. The fact is, they dont have the numbers who they claim want to go to work. Theyre just trying to create a violent scene by the tactics they are using. Despite the events outside his mills gates, Mr Henderson said there was now no agreement to negotiate with unions. He said APPM had stuck by an order of the Industrial Relations Commission last Friday for a return to work, and it did not require any further negotiation. The Tasmanian Premier, Mr Ray Groom, described the events as a disgraceful way to conduct industrial relations. He hoped that a compulsory conference called by the Industrial Relations Commission in Melbourne today could act as a circuitbreaker for the dispute. Mr Ferguson welcomed the compulsory conference.Frankly I wouldnt want to hold my breath waiting for Mr Peter Wade the managing director of North Broken Hill Peko, the mills owners and his cohorts to face to up their responsibilities, he said. He also condemned APPMs sackings as unAustralian, and called on the community to support the workers. The coalminers stoppage, called by the 15,000strong United Mineworkers Federation for next week, is the first time the dispute has spread to other parts of Australia. It comes as the ACTU moved yesterday to seize the high moral ground and take to the public its fight North Broken Hill Peko. The federation is also calling on the Federal Government to enshrine a right to strike in legislation. In a surprise move, the Tasmanian Police Association has sent 10,000 to the fighting fund. The association is affiliated with the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council and the ACTU. The associations secretary, Mr Keith Morrow, said the ACTU and Trades and Labor Council had been told that police facing picketers at Burnie would do their job, regardless of the donation. The Oppositions industrial relations spokesman, Mr Howard, yesterday accused Senator Cook of encouraging violence with his parliamentary warnings about bloodshed on the picket line. What I have criticised is the government taking sides and from the very beginning of this dispute, Peter Cook took the side of the unions, Mr Howard said on ABC radios PM program. Key ruling boosts blacks land claims by CAMERON FORBES, Canberra A full High Court judgment in a legal battle by the people of tiny Murray Island in the Torres Strait is being hailed as being of sweeping significance for Australias indigenous people and the death of the concept of terra nullius that Australia was no ones land when Europeans arrived. In a 61 majority decision on what has become known as the Mabo case, the full High Court found that Australian common law recognised a form of native title and declared that the Meriam people are entitled as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands. Lawyers involved in the Murray Island case say that the judgments as a whole have profound implications for present landrights legislation, the process of reconciliation with Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, land claims by traditional Aboriginal communities, and relations between Aborigines and miners. Two of the judges, in language they said might be thought unusually emotive for the court, described a process of dispossession, degradation and devastation of the Aboriginal people that left a national legacy of unutterable shame. Justice Mary Gaudron and Mr Justice Deane said The acts and events by which that dispossession in legal theory has carried into practical effect constitute the darkest aspect of the history of this nation. The nation as a whole must remain diminished unless and until there is an acknowledgement of, and retreat from, those injustices. The federal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Tickner, said History was made in the High Court today. The highest court in the land has taken the position that terra nullius is to be rejected and relegated to the dustbin of history. Mr tickner was guarded about the consequences. A battery of lawyers was considering the judgment, he said, but in the short term he could dismiss as unfounded alarmist speculation about possible outcomes. The chairman of the Northern Land Council, Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu, said the pathetic excuse of terra nullius is now dead and called on the Federal government to move quickly to negotiate a treaty and implement comprehensive land rights legislation or face a barrage of litigation. On Murray Island, Lillian Passi, the first to hear, cried Thank God, thank God. The islanders immediately started preparing a victory feast. And a Torres Strait leader, Mr George Mye, of neighboring Darnley Island, who is the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission representative for the region, said that all islanders would now move for recognition of their traditional ownership of their lands. Im overjoyed, Mr Mye said. We want to be part of Australia, but we want autonomy. The court pointed out that its formal order was cast in a form which will not give rise to any possible implication affecting status of land not considered in the case. It also declared that the Meriam peoples title could be extinlguished by Queensland by a valid exercise of power, provided that this was not inconsistent with the laws of the Commonwealth. However, lawyers for the Murray Islanders pointed out that in 1985 the Queensland government has passed legislation expressly extinguishing all native rights to the Torres Strait islands, retrospectively to This had been ruled invalid in a majority full High Court decision on the ground that it was inconsistent with federal racialdiscrimination legislation. And lawyers involved in Arboriginal landrights claims and other legal cases were clearly delighted with the reasoning of Mr Justice Brennan with which the Chief Justice, Mr Justice Mason, and Mr Justice McHugh said they agreed and that of Justice Gaudron and Mr Justice Deane. They said the judgments contained invaluable ammunition for future battles. On terra nullious, Mr Justice Brennan saidIf it were permissible in past centuries to keep the common law in step with international law, it is imperative in todays world that the common law neither be, nor be seen to be, frozen in an age of racial discrimination. The fiction by which the rights and interests of indigenous inhabitants in land were treated as non existent was justified by a policy which has no place in the contemporary common law of this country. Mr Justice Brennan also made important observations on how indigenous peoples links with the land should be viewed. Under the landmark Northern Territory landrights legislation, Aboriginal groups have to demonstrate continuing traditonal links with the land. Mr Justice Brennan said Of course, in time, the laws and customs of any people will change and the rights and interests of the members of the people among themselves will change, too. He said it was immaterial that the laws and customs had undergone some change since the Crown acquired sovereignty, provided the general connection between the indigenous people and the land remained. Mr Justice Brennan indicated a wider application of his rulings Nor can the circumstances which might be thought to differentiate the Murray Islands from other parts of Australia be invoked as an acceptable ground for distinguishing the entitlement of the Meriam people from the entitlement of other indigenous inhabitants to the use and enjoyment of their traditional lands. Government backs down on law for contractors by KAREN MIDDLETON and LEON GETTLER The Federal Government has backed down on parts of its contentious industrial relations legislation to appease employer groups and win crucial support from the Australian Democrats. The Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, said last night that Cabinet had approved an amended version of the bill aimed at tying independent contractors into the industrial system and stamping out sham contracts. The Government, under pressure from the Confederation of Australian Industry and other groups, will ask the High Court to clarify the powers of the Industrial Relations Commission. Senator Cook has also agreed to a Democrat demand to drop the requirement that contractors be members of a union before they can approach the Industrial Relations Commission for a contract review. This was also a sticking point among employer groups, which looked upon the clause as de facto compulsory unionism. Employers have welcomed the Governments decision. The chief executive of the confederation, Mr Ian Spicer, said last night that employers had called off plans to mount a costly advertising campaign against the legislation. I think the Government was influenced by our concern dotted line but I think they also saw there was a very widespread opposition to the bill from an enormous section of the community, Mr Spicer said. The Governments decision to support any future High Court case to test the commissions powers would effectively hold up the proposals until at least after the next election, as any test case could take up to 12 months. Mr Spicer said If the CAI participates in any High Court proceedings that take place, it will be to strongly oppose interpretations that would extend the reach of the present powers of the Industrial Relations Commission. He said the confederation still opposed other provisions in the amendments to the Industrial Relations Act, including measures that would give the commission the power to review unfair contracts."

        "text": "New tests in mystery death case, Heather Kennedy FORENSIC scientists will conduct new tests in an attempt to find what killed Birgit Munro the second wife of South Melbourne Doctor Neil William Boyce to die in mysterious circumstances. But thorough testing by the Victorian Institute of Forensic Pathology will not be possible because both women were cremated within days of death. Acting state coroner Iain West is conducting an inquest on the death of Ms Munro, 36, and will deliver his findings tomorrow. On Friday, the Coroners Court was told the institute was continuing its investigations into Ms Munros death. Dr Boyces first wife, Josephine Boyce, 27, collapsed and died on December 28, 1982, after eating a chocolate and pear dessert prepared by her husband. Ms Munro, his de facto wife, collapsed and died on March 31, 1992, after taking two mouthfuls of peanut butter and toast prepared by Dr Boyce. Both women were apparently fit and healthy. Mrs Boyce was 14 weeks pregnant at the time of her death. A spokeswoman for the Victorian Institute of Forensic Pathology told the Sunday Herald Sun Tests are continuing on ante and postmortem specimens on Ms Munro but it was not possible to do tests on Mrs Boyce. We have done the general screen for 100 common substances and are now checking for specific substances. On the first day of the inquest, the court was told that numerous tests had been carried out on Ms Munros body to determine the cause of death. But consultant forensic pathologist Dr Richard Collins told the inquest that tests had not been done to detect thallium and ricin, two poisons used in documented homicides. Pathologist Dr David Ranson, who told the court he had not been able to ascertain the cause of death, agreed with the Munro familys counsel Andrew Kirkham, QC, that poisons ricin and thallium could produce some symptoms displayed by Ms Munro. On Thursday, Dr Boyce, 39, who attended the Coroners court with his third wife, Dr Jennifer Boyce nee Bartlett, refused to give evidence on the grounds that he could incriminate himself. In an interview with homicide squad detectives which was tendered to the court, Dr Boyce denied having done away with his wives, and said I find it the suggestion just so offensive. He said he had a enjoyed a close relationship with both women, whom he described as lovely ladies. The officer in charge of the homicide investigation, Det. Sgt. Denis Linehan, told the court on Friday there was no evidence to link Dr Boyce with Ms Munros death. In the interview, conducted in July last year, Dr Boyce told Det. Sgt Linehan and Det SenSgt Brendon Murphy that he met Mrs Boyce when they were at school. We met, subsequently became friends, and married in my fourth year of university studies. Jo was 15 when I first met her dotted line We were married when we were We were formally engaged for 18 months, he said. Dr Boyce said his first wife worked as a therapeutic radiographer at Peter MacCallum Clinic for nine years. He said she was a keen netball player. She kept fit by jogging three or 4km three times a week. Dr Boyce described Jo Boyce as an attractive, tall, darkhaired lady dotted line she described herself as big boned but she was not overweight. He said Mrs Boyce became pregnant on two occasions. The first time she lost the baby. Dr Boyce said his wife had experienced terrible morning sickness, although her obstetrician told the court she had not mentioned this to him. At the time of Mrs Boyces death, Dr Boyce was working 80 to 100 hours a week at Prince Henrys Hospital as renal registrar. Dr Boyce told police that the night before Mrs Boyce died, he and his wife had watched television. He had prepared the evening meal, including a pear and chocolate dessert. Dr Boyce said he got up at six the next morning and went to work. He said Mrs Boyce was too ill to go to work, and stayed home. She rang me at work while I was in the middle of a ward round and it would have been I think early afternoon dotted line she said, I feel dreadful, come home. dotted lineShe said Ive got a terrible headache and Im sick and theres something wrong. So I stopped the ward round and went home dotted line And she said Neil, theres something wrong cant remember anything, and Ive been ill all morning. Dr Boyce said he put his wife to bed. She asked for flat soda water and he went to the local milk bar to buy some. Lynne Polson, who told the court she was Birgit Munros best friend, gave evidence that Ms Munro had told her she had been having an affair at this time with Dr Boyce, and that she was distressed that he made a phone call to her while he was on this errand. When I came back she Mrs Boyce was still in bed, but there was vomit everywhere, Dr Boyce told the police. dotted lineShe didnt have a pulse and was blue. Dr Boyce attempted to resuscitate his wife but was unable to do so and called the ambulance, but Mrs Boyce was dead. Dr Boyce then formed an attachment with another woman but said that was brief. He said he had met Birgit Munro in 1980, but said he had not begun an affair with her until after his wife died. Dr Boyce told police that Ms Munro was a ridiculously healthy woman who played squash and tennis. She had gone to a German class on the Monday night. Our routine was after German we would always eat in front of the telly. That was our sloth night, he said. So Id set the table down in front of the telly and have the wine poured and the snack ready dotted line So we sat down and started to eat and after a minute, maybe two, she said, I feel really dreadful, and I looked at her and she was ashen. dotted line And she said, I think Im going to faint. She then lay on the floor and her eyes rolled back in her head. I couldnt feel a pulse. Dr Boyce called a friend and they took Ms Munro to the Mercy Hospital where she died the next day. The court was told Dr Boyce had sent 100 roses to another woman, Dr Jennifer Bartlett, three days after the death of Ms Munro. He subsequently married Dr Bartlett. In reply to claims by Dr Boyces counsel, Richard Stanley, QC, that Ms Munros family had mounted a vendetta against his client, the Munros barrister, Mr Kirkham, emphasised that the family had not initiated the investigation into the two deaths. Two pathologists could not determine the cause of Ms Munros death. Dr David Cade, who treated her at the Mercy Hospital, told the inquest he believed she died as a result of a severe infection acute toxic enterocolitis but neither he nor cardiologist Dr William Heath, who also saw Ms Munro in hospital, were prepared to sign a death certificate. Libs back Downer on sacking By PETER COSTER and FIA CUMMING SENIOR Liberals have backed the Opposition Leader, Alexander Downers, sacking of former leader John Hewson. The Liberal leadership group was consulted by Mr Downer before he decided to dump Dr Hewson for disloyalty, according to senior Liberals. Mr Downer received unanimous support. Senator Hill, the Opposition Leader in the Senate and a leading moderate, said yesterday Dr Hewson was not sacked for his views but the way he went about expressing them. He said Dr Hewson faxed everyone with a letter he wrote to Tasmanian Liberal Dr Chris Miles expressing his concern over opposition to the proposed overriding of the Tasmanian antigay laws. Senator Hill said the letters, outlining Dr Hewsons change in attitude were faxed to Liberals MPs late afternoon on Thursday coinciding with Mr Downer flying to Tasmania. Senator Hill said he believed Liberal moderates were sympathetic to Dr Hewson, but believed what he did was inappropriate. Dr Hewson did not speak to Mr Downer before faxing the offending letter. But despite support from the leadership of the party for Mr Downer, some backbenchers were yesterday prepared to air their concerns. Former Opposition AttorneyGeneral, Daryl Williams QC, criticised the move, saying the was disappointed, while Brisbane MP Alex Somlyay said it would hurt the Liberal Party. I have a great problem with it Dr Hewson is a tremendously talented man and we cant afford to lose that talent from the front bench, he said. SA Liberal Senator Baden Teague said Dr Hewsons loyalty was beyond question. I dont accept that Dr Hewsons clarification of his views on privacy laws is in any way a disloyal act. WA Liberal Eoin Cameron described the sacking as a terrible, terrible thing while Senator Sue Knowles, also of WA, said it was a mystery to her as there was no reason to demote Dr Hewson. Former Opposition minister David Jull said yesterday he was surprised by Mr Downers sacking of Dr Hewson, but the partys direction would be debated by the full party room. I dont think the Liberal Party is going to blow apart from this at all, Dr Jull said. Another leading moderate said yesterday You have to remember, the Liberal Party is a conservative party. The senior Liberal said moderates in the Liberal Party comprised only about a quarter of the party and that is not about to alter. He said while 95 per cent of Liberals felt Tasmanias antigay laws were inappropriate, 55 per cent would not vote to override State legislation. Other MPs pointed out it was Dr Hewson who, as Leader, had decided in April that the Opposition would oppose any federal move to overturn the Tasmanian law. Hewson did more than anyone in the history of the Liberal Party to narrow it and now he is the great apostle of broadening it, one MP said. Its just unbelievable. Liberal sources said Mr Downer would not use his sacking of Dr Hewson to reshuffle his front bench, which has only been in place for four months. State Law They said Mr Downer would promote one backbencher to fill the vacancy left by Dr Hewson, who had been the Oppositions industry spokesman. Ironically, Mr Downer was in Launceston yesterday, repeating his opposition to the State law which outlaws homosexual acts. Mr Downer told Tasmanian Liberals the law was an anachronism, but also said the Commonwealth had no right to override the wishes of the State. A relaxed Dr Hewson yesterday said he slept like a log despite the new round of leadership turmoil engulfing the Liberal Party. Colleagues, party members and the general public have inundated Dr Hewsons offices and staff with messages of support, urging him to stay in politics and not be silenced. I am definitely going to stay on in Parliament and fight for the principles and policies I believe in, but right now I am on my way to play a round of golf, Dr Hewson said. White to contest lower seat in poll By DAVID WILSON THE ALPs chief state political strategist, David White, will contest the Lower House seat of Tullamarine at the 1996 election. Tullamarine is the Liberals secondmost marginal seat and is held by Bernie Finn by about two per cent. Speculation has been rife within the ALP that Mr White, the Opposition spokesman for major projects, would remain in his safe Upper House seat of Doutta Galla. His move to contest Tullamarine completes an agreement made by Labors Left and Rightwing factions last July which allowed Mr White to contest a Lower House seat. Mr Whites formal decision to move to the Legislative Assembly sets the scene for one of the most bitter contests for a state seat. Private polling by the Liberal Party over the past three months has shown that Mr Finn has increased his majority by about 5 per cent since the 1992 election."

        "text": "What the new Europe means to Australia The 1990s are shaping up as the decade of competition for capital. If Australia does not want to be left behind in the new moves engulfing the world, it will have to be sharp. Robert Gottliebsen outlines the possible moves For most of the past decade, change in Europe has been painfully slow. Now it is proceeding at a pace that can make carefully prepared longterm strategies immediately irrelevant. Each February, hundreds of key executives and government leaders from around the world go to Switzerland for the World Economics Forum in Davos to swap ideas and strategies for the years ahead. But this time, longterm planning became very difficult as the changes in Eastern Europe unfolded almost before the eyes of the forum participants. For the first time since the dramatic events in 1989, representatives of Eastern Europe were able to parade before those who control much of the worlds capital and skills, hoping to attract the support necessary to make a quick transition from the woes of communism to their vision of the riches of capitalism. It will be much harder than many of them imagine. Although Australia and New Zealand are side players in this game, during the next 18 months rapid changes in business patterns will have a profound effect on both countries. It became obvious in Davos that whereas the 1970s could be described as the decade of competition for resources and the 1980s as a competition for technology, the 1990s are shaping up as the decade of competition for capital. Japan and Germany will be wonderfully placed in this battle. As the sun sets on communism around the world, opportunities for capital investment are emerging. Because Australia is short of capital, it stands to suffer from this new development. We will need to be extremely precise about the projects we put to world players because they will have many investments to choose from. Since investors of capital will now have a much greater choice of projects and countries, Australian environmentalists and unions will carry much more responsibility for the fate of new projects than was the case in the past. Australians were present in great numbers in Davos but, not surprisingly, they found it hard to attract investment dollars. Nothing illustrates the rapid change better than the pressure being put on the European Community and its 1992 deregulation deadlines by the changes in Eastern Europe pressures that will reduce the scope for the EC to negotiate on matters such as agriculture and cars. Early in the forum, the vicepresident of the Commission of the EC, Frans Andriessen, explained that it was simply not possible for the EC to abandon its farm policies. Farming has become as much a symbol for many parts of Europe as IBM is for the US. Farming has a direct relationship to the German political power structure. Andriessen pointed out that Europe had stopped producing huge surpluses under subsidy, but wanted much more time to rationalise and would not agree to anything more than a commitment to introduce policies substantially reducing farm protection over the next five years. Even the fiveyear proposal would need to be part of an acceptable multilateral set of trade proposals that included reduced protection in the US and Japan. He also wanted time for Europes rationalised automobile industry to adjust before exposing it to world that is, Japanese competition. He would not be drawn on the time required. This is not a new stand by the EC, but it is becoming more resolute in face of the changes in Europe. At the same time, before 1992 a formidable list of negotiating points has to be sorted out in the internal affairs of Europe. This is being made more difficult by the breakdown in Europe. Andriessen, who comes from Holland, explained to brw that he wanted the existing EC of 12 countries consolidated before the countries of Eastern Europe were brought in, and especially before the two Germanys were united. However, while the Davos conference was in progress, Andriessen found this key pillar of his 1992 strategy was removed. As he was talking to brw, in another part of the Davos Congress House a large number of Germans and a small number of other Europeans had gathered to listen to the mayor of the East German city of Dresden. The Germans applauded when he said it was essential that the country be united within the year. Unless this happened, the migration of youth from East Germany would destroy both his city and the country as a whole. This tugged at the heartstrings of the Germans and set the tone for the following day, when Chancellor Helmut Kohl gave one of the most dramatic speeches ever heard in Davos. He emotionally photo welcomed the prospect of reunification and the prospect of Germany taking its place in the EC as one country. He expressed support for German minorities in other countries of Eastern Europe, even going as far as connecting Russian and German culture. Kohl offered abundant financial aid to the countries of Eastern Europe. He went out of his way to emphasise his friendship with the French President Francois Mitterrand, clearly making a dramatic bid to dominate the new Europe. The sight of the German race once again emerging as the dominant photo photo caption photo photo force in Europe horrified the British as they realised that their aspirations for the 1990s might now take second place to the new fatherland. I did not get the chance to discuss the Kohl speech with Frans Andriessen, but clearly he must go back to the drawing board if he is to prevent the spirit of 1992 from being engulfed by events that would follow reunification. In turn, that makes it hard to shift on matters such as agriculture and automobiles. Indeed, although there was no formal discussion on this subject at Davos, once some form of infrastructure can be established in Eastern Europe, great emphasis is likely to be placed on agricultural development and natural resources an obvious way to lift the income of the countries. If Australia wants to participate in the revolution, this is one area where they have skills. Indeed, our rural skills were publicly hailed early in the forum when the Hungarians held up as a model Australia and New Zealand efforts to improve agriculture in Hungary. When the party from Czechoslovakia indicated that its country needed help to improve its coal mines, the Meekatharra Minerals group, which has a joint operation with bhp in Ireland, was quick to establish its credentials. But the overall picture that unfolded suggested that Australians who do not know exactly what they are doing should probably not dabble in Europe instead they should take advantage of opportunities closer to home created by the changes in Europe. Meanwhile, although few have other solutions, there is a genuine concern that German reunification will add to tensions in Europe. If the EC is to survive the disruption in a recognisable form, the role of NATO and the US become crucial. So throughout his speech Kohl spoke in glowing terms about the US and his friend George Bush, and his desire for a continued US presence in Europe. With Russia no longer the likely enemy, the US is wanted as some form of policeman to ensure that Germany will photo caption stay committed not to separately rearm. At this stage, the Americans have not publicly adjusted to the possibility of entirely new roles for NATO and the Warsaw Pact and are still talking about arms cuts with their traditional foe, the Soviet Union. The Americans remain overwhelmingly concerned with domestic considerations. Americans at the conference, including people of the calibre of investment guru Henry Kaufman, ITT Corporations Rand Araskog and Jim Wolfensohn, were preoccupied with an internal battle over how serious the coming American corporate debt crisis would be. There is no doubt that overborrowing by US companies, coming at a time when Japan is universally recognised as having replaced the US as the worlds strongest economic power, has made many Americans bitter. Many Americans claimed that the Japanese won by not playing fair on investment and trade policy. Few recognised that equally the US passion for the quick buck led it to the shortterm planning including junk bonds that proved so disastrous to the longterm interests of US companies and the institutional shareholders that fostered the move. One of the most vocal critics was the president of the US economic strategy unit, Clyde Prestowitz, who pointed out that the US was plagued by declining educational standards, failure to invest longterm, a low savings rate, crumbling infrastructure and political paralysis as a result of the stalemate between the White House and the Congress. In contrast, Australianborn consultant Jim Wolfensohn believes that Prestowitz sells America short, although he recognises the problem of US corporate debt. The Europeans, for their part, are anxious that the US play a substantial role in their future, particularly in defence. This is not necessarily good news for Australia because in rural and natural resource areas Australia competes with the US. Indeed, the USs clout in trade with Asia is already well know to Australia. The US is by far the largest market for goods from the Asian market and so is given preference in many areas. At Davos, the Taiwanese related how they import highcost US beef to make beef noodles, thus limiting the intake of much lowercost Australian beef. They are looking at making the beef noodles in Australia, which would get around the pressure to buy from the US. The future of Australian commodity exports, whether rural or mining, will increasingly depend on securing markets for secondary processing by linking into plants in Australia or overseas. Australians moving into Europe must realise that they have no national clout and must recognise the potential of the US. Although the Japanese are now fully recognised as world leaders and the major supplier of capital, with that crown comes the tag of the ugly Japanese the title once accorded to Americans. Attacks on the Japanese by the US, Europe and, to a lesser extent, from Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore, were unprecedented in the history of Davos. The UnderSecretary of Commerce for US International Trade, Michael Farren, was greeted with loud applause when he pointed to the enormous difficulties US and EC companies were having in trying to invest in Japan. Although Japan was the secondlargest world economy, foreign companies were welcome only on certain terms, such as joint ventures. There had been no big takeovers of Japanese enterprises by overseas interests. The ECs Andriessen said that one of the main dangers to the world economic system was the lack of capital investment in Japan, given its role as a capital exporter. US trade representative Hills said that since Japan had become a major power it should no longer have so many restrictions on access to its markets. Japan was a bad model for other developing countries. The Japanese were stung by the nature of the comments and at one stage a visibly upset Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Koji Watanabe declared that there were now no impediments to investment in Japan and it was very welcome. He pointed out that it was foreign to Japanese culture to sell businesses. The Japanese are also concerned at the effect their tourismrelated residential property purchases are having on their image. Watanabe told me, for example, that he would welcome Australians and New Zealanders who wanted to set up tourist facilities in Japan. He felt that the avalanche of Japanese tourists and associated real estate buying in specific overseas areas was harming Japans standing and should be reduced. Those in Australia who depend on the Japanese tourist trade, or those in property in places such as the Gold Coast, where the Japanese are heavy investors, should watch the position very carefully. Clearly, however, in Europe the Japanese are not going to be deterred by unpopularity."

        "text": "Qu 13 feminist gender historian. Around 1975 a number of new books were published in Australia by feminist authors concerned to with the neglect of women in previous historical works. Since that time there has been much discussion about the role of women in Australian history, and ways to approach the portrayal of this role. There has been some impact on mainstream history writing, but much of it continues to perpetuate older images of the Australian past. Other factors and trends have also affected the writing of Australian history and womens place in it. In 1975 Anne Summmers published Damned Whores and Gods Police around the same time as Kingstons My Wife, my Daughter and Poor Maryanne and unclear Wilsons Meal Matilda appeared. Summers in particular was concerned with the origins of Australian sexism she was studying cultural identity. This work fitted very much with the feminism of the mid70s for instance, her attempts to show women as a homogeneous group were part of the contemporary feminist charter. These works are now generally outofdate but criticism of them had the virtue of generating discussion about women in Australian history, and creating discussion about approaches. For instance, reaction against Summers ideas of homogeneity of women as a group led to prompted the suggestion that class and race were significant factors, and thus a more sophisticated fin form of analysis arose the emphasis in these works on women as victims led to another view of womens roles. Despite the many criticisms of these womens histories, they were a radical change from previous st versions of the Australian past. Russell Wards Australian Legend was first published in 1958 it explained the nature of the typical Australian by the absence of women from the Outback, thereby excluding them altogether. Hence the typical Australian was a practical man , and the cult of mateship was generated by an absence of female company. For Ward, the features which enacted the stereotypical Australian were all masculine they did not include the virtues of cwa ladies. This has been a persistent view, despite evidence to the contrary the work of Mary Durack, for instance, has shown that women were an integral part of Australian pastoral and frontier history evidence exists in numerous diaries and letters of women. A revised version of to The Australian Legend was published in 1977, but Ward remained unaffected by the new form of history Summers et al. had suggested was possible. Other historians did make some effort to draw upon the idea that women should be included in history but Cornell and Irvings Class Struggle in Australian History, published in 1980, showed how women largely remained peripheral. The history writing of P. Robinson has attempted to put women back into colonial history. She actively tried to deny the picture of the Summers damned whores and in doing so, pe exaggerated the virtuous qualities of her women still, an interest in womens history allowed her to show that women were active, and in positive ways, in the early colony. One contribution which has been made s by womens and feminist historians is debate over methodology. There is a tension between the idea of writing womens history, which is, in a sense, a separate discipline of history, or whether history should be written with women at its centre. The approach of feminist historians like Summers has a polemic political edge, seeking to understand why, for instance, social structures which oppress women exist the form of history which is certainly more common now in mainstream journals and historical works aims to include women into a full history. The benefits of the latter approach can be seen, for instance, in the work of Kay Marking who, in the early 1980s, investigated the role of cheap female labour in the process of accumulation of capital in the early Australian manufacturing industry. In this way women are portrayed as an integral part of society. The contribution which the use of gender history can make has made to this the writing of Australian history is shown by unclear s article on the Masculinist Context, published in Here she studies gender relations the the masculinist image popular at the time, in popular jo culture such as the Bulletin she shows how this affected mens behaviour and their attitudes to and treatment of women how women suffered as a result, when mens pay went on drink and smokes, and domestic violence was common and how womens reaction against this led th to their participation in the temperance movement. Lake has shown how a study of men can be useful to a study of women and aspects of womens history gender history, the socialization of male female and their interaction, has been shown to play a significant role in history. However, dep despite the clear benefit and contribution of feminist and gender historians, their approaches unclear and methodologies have to not had a major effect on much mainstream history. There has been some effect Lakes article on The Masculinist Context was published in the mainstream Historical Studies, as was discussion generated by it in that sense womens history, is with or topics concerning women, are now regarded as respectable. B. Kingstons Volume III of the Oxford History of Australia shows how women can be suc made a part of a mainstream, general history she shows them to have been an active and integral part of the society she discusses. They are simply there in the main text no question of history and womens history as separate compartments. McCalmans use of oral history in her Struggletown similarly shows that it is possible to write a history in which women play a central part. However, not all is rosy. Jill Matthews in 1988 1986 was able to complain about the far greater number of male contributions to the Australian bicentenary project than women, and also to state that, in these volumes, the role of women generally remained confined to childcare and food production, and providing an audience while men got on with whatever real business . Ken Inglis Australian Colonists has been republished this year, but Inglis felt no need to revise his work to include some women. His index contains one reference to women in public life this consists of one paragraph on women in a 35page chapter on Australian Heroes . Womens feminist and gender historians have made a major contribution to Australian history writing and methodology since 1975 however, the effect seems to have been limited. Where the new approaches have entered mainstream history they tend to have been written by women Kingston, Lake, Moe. Male historians, like Inglis and Ward, remain largely impervious, or even resistant defensive hence Chris McCorvilles reaction to Lakes masculinist discussion he effectively questions whether feminists are the appropriate people to write about male socialization. Qu 12 Oral History. The rise in awareness that traditional history has many gaps and gives only a limited understanding of society has led to the a rise in the use of alternat different methods of gathering of information. One of these is the use of oral history or oral tradition. One school of thought claims that this material represents a valid primary source for historical inquiry if used with care, like that is with reference used to the methods used in the interpretation of other historical sources however, this is to take a very narrow view of what history is and how it must be written it is to run the risk of denying to both individuals and some cultures the right to their own history. Part of the question depends on the definition of history which is accepted. That which seems to be in the minds of those historians who deny that oral sources are history in their own right is the nowtraditional unclear form. This depends upon facts which are objective, and found in sources such as newspapers and parliamentary records. The history created by this approach is the very maledominated history of significant events on a national scale, politics and wars and so on. Oral testimony does not fit this mould, and is thus subject to suspicion from believers in this tradition. However, much older history relied on oral testimony Thucydides, for instance, largely relied on eyewitness accounts, and he is now regarded as largely respectable many medieval historians, such as unclear of Malmesbury in the twelfth century, also relied on oral testimony. These are the sources upon which modern history is based. There is a change of emphasis growing in history, which places more importance on social history, and also the history of groups which are neglected by Rankean history women, the lower classes, nonliterate societies. To many of these groups, oral traditions generally referring to the traditions of a group or culture or reminiscences individual recollections are the only way to retrieve and record their historical experience. It is not a perfect form of collecting historical records. Oral traditions change constantly according to the needs of the society to which they belong, and thus raise the problems for historians looking for facts personal recollections are subject to a wide variety of influences, including poor memory, sentimental overtones, unclear the influence of external sources such as media report which may affect memories. There is also the role of the interviewer questions asked, attitudes or perceived attitudes of the interviewer and som so on, all play a role in the creation of the oral testimony. It is these factors that lead historians to assert that oral traditions and reminiscences are raw material of history, to be interpreted, checked with other sources and, by implication, formed into a type of history which meets a rigid definition of what constitutes history. So, when Loh and Lowenstein published their Immigrants which included a number of oral accounts of migrant experiences without commentary Patrick OFarrell from unsw was able to assert that such a work was not history, although he conceded it might represent some aspects of historical reality. Similarly Forb asserts that history is more than the sum of collective experiences to create historical reality the historian must look for deeper themes and processes which remain hidden to the protagonists. Thus the material gained from oral testimonies is but one source among many on the creation of history. His Oral History can be used as raw material le Roy Ladunes Montaillou is an outstanding example of how oral testimonies, in combination with other resources, can be used to create an anthropological study of a community. This Testimony can be used to confirm or deny what is known from wil other sources Boltons history of West. Aust. in the Depression found testimony from someone concerned to deny the common conception that British immigrants of this period were all slumdwellers. However, to claim that trad oral history in only a raw primary material denies the right of individuals to a history of their own. The To Loh and Lowensteins immigrants, their experience represented a historical reality for Fork to assert that, in effect, they were simply swept along with no idea of the processes at work is a very patronizing attitude. It is one J. McCalman specifically denies in her introduction to Struggletown there she points out that, with moderntechnology, it is impossible to remain unaware of the events of the outside world she aimed to look at the effect of the public world on personal life. This The attitude to oral history and tradition represented by unclear is especially threatening to cultures who do not share the western definition of history so especially nonliterate societies. The ultimate effect of unclear unclears attitude is to deny such people the right to create their own history. A traditional attitude to the use of oral tradition is seen in J Varsinas work in Africa he suggested wrote that collecting oral tradition was rather like gathering various corrupt versions of a text and then studying all of them to find the correct one. Thus, history is facts. unclear Spear, writing on African traditions, claimed that this was entirely the wrong approach that oral traditions represented secondary sources."

        "text": "62 Weil Ave Croydon Park NSW 2133 Australia 19th December, 1994 Dear Lesley, It sounds as if you are kept very busy, what with Magnuss infected leg, all the childrens activities and all the animals aswell. As you are aware last JuneJuly we travelled to America for one month. We visited and stayed with family and friends and Kate absolutely loved every minute. Phil also had a wonderful holiday. Kate has just celebrated her 5th birthday. She has a Calamity Jane party which was a success. We even hired two ponies for the kids to ride. Naturally, the ponies were a great hit with the kids. They were very well behaved and enjoyed the carrots that the children fed them. I made this huge cake that I thought looked quite ridiculous, however it tasted good and the kids all thought it was a wonderful cake with plastic cowboys, Indians and tepees on it. She received lots of Power Ranger toys. She is crazy aboout them and wants to be Trini. In fact the Power Rangers are currently in Sydney filming their first movie, but unfortunately for Kate they have not made any public appearances. The day after Kates birthday her first tooth fell out. She was SO excited I was with her and she didnt know whether to laugh or cry. It was the most precious moment to see. The tooth has been carefully placed in a plastic bag so that Kate can display it to any interested or oven not interested person. Her second tooth fell out two weeks later. My lectures have finished for the year and I continue to work on my research and business. Last month I received a letter to tell me that I have been awarded a scholarship, the King Amy OMalley scholarship he was an American who came to Australia and founded our first national, or commonwealth, bank. This allows me to studyresearch full time next year as the award is worth 10,000, although I will still undertake a little lecturing as the students have insisted to the head of the school that I teach them. I cant believe that Spoofie is about to celebrate her 13th birthday. She is still so spritely, jumping fences and getting into a bit of mischief and looks so well. Mushka has even turned Luckily, all the animals are very well, although Mushka suffered two epeleptic fits this year. We have had our first couple of hot days for the Summer. Kate has recommenced swimming lesson and her grand achievement was that she floated on her back for ten seconds water restrictions are getting tougher due to the drought. How is Tasmania bearing when it comes to water I hope it is better than here. Goodbye for now. 62 Weil Ave Croydon Park. N.S.W.2133 6th January, 1992 Dear Ellen, I hope that you all had a very happy Christmas and are now enjoying a happy It is such a long time since I have written. 1991 was a busy year, to say the least. I continued to lecture parttime which I enjoy, even though it pays poorly and involves a heavy workload. The other major undertaking was that I commenced further studies, also parttime for a Masters of Education. I have wanted to start my Masters for a long time and so I did. The workload is difficult and especially tiring as I can only work once Kate has gone to sleep at night and dont have the luxury of a block of time to read or study. Nevertheless I have really enjoyed the courses that I undertook this year I did 4 courses I find it hard to belive that I am enjoying studying as I can very clearly remember that when I left Teachers College I swore I would escape and never return and found that I learnt a great deal and that was exciting. Anyhow, the studies are going well and I shall be continuing this year. With parttime work and studies it means that my parents babysit for three and a half days a week. Kate just loves her Baba Russian for grandmother and Jeda grandfather and understands Russian and also Polish and is learning to speak them. My mother always talks in Russian to her and now my mother has a Russian guest over from Germany so that she also speaks in Russian and i think that this is the language that she will pick up most quickly. Its so interesting to watch her development and how she can pronounce Russian words so well. Kate talks non stop. This age is just wonderful She is now normally very good and loves helping us around the house. She and Mushka are devoted to each other. In fact when we returned from our Surfers Paradise holiday Mushka and Kate both went berserk with excitement. Kate screamed and hugged Mushka, Mushka jumped on and nuzzled Kate and they both ended lying on the floor together with Kate still hugging Mushka and saying beautiful Mushie. We could not separate them for three hours Kate is the same with the cats and loves hugging them they tolerate it for a while before jumping away and also joins me each morning in saying good morning birds to our budgies and peachface parrot. She knows each cat by name and calls them for meals and checks that they are all there and eating. Once when one cat did not turn up for dinner she became quite upset and I had to calm her down. At Surfers Paradise not only did she go to the beach for the first time which she absolutely loved, but she also was able to hand feed lorikeets and pat kangaroos. This was heaven for her. In fact on each occasion she was photographed and videoed by the many Japanese tourists who were there Last week we had another surprise holiday. A friend rang up and asked if we could help her. She had not had the chance to go to her holiday house in a year and could we go and have a holiday there and check that the house was O.K. Naturally, as Phil had a few days holiday from work we said Yes The house is at Huskisson, on the south coast of New South Wales. It was two blocks from the beach and one block from a nature reserve. We stayed for four days. We visited an animal farm, where once again, Kate went berserk with delight. This time she got to see a Koala and was so pleased that she kissed it. She certainly loves animals. She was again able to feed animals, but she also hugged and even kissed one of them. Then she was treated to a pony ride, so it was a very exciting day for her and now Kate asks for more holidays please. My sister Helen is also devoted to Kate and visits often so she can play and walk with her. She also spoils her with gifts. I believe that Kate is a very lucky child to have so many people devoted to her and to have already experienced two exciting holidays. She is at an age where she can now understand so much and that is very interesting. She had a birthday party and was very excited about that. My parents bought her a swing and a slippery dip and for weeks after she would sit at the top of the slippery dip, before sliding down, singing Happy Birthday to Kate. She thought Christmas was magical and was fascinated by the tree and decorations. She helped me decorate it and we also put a Christmas wreath on the front door. She them disappeared and I found her staring at the wreath. When I asked her what she was doing she said beautiful with a sigh while still staring at the wreath. We took her to a local church up the road to join in the carols, but the only word that she recognised was Jesus we have a manger under our tree and she knows the characters, so that each time the crowd sang or said Jesus, Kate would yell out, at the top of her voice Jesus I thought it was quite funny. Obviously, she also enjoyed all the presents at Christmas, bothe receiving them and giving them. She only gave on the condition that she could also assist in unwrapping them. For Christmas Eve we went to my parents for a traditional Polish Dinner and on Christmas day we went to Phils sisters home for a traditional Australian Christmas lunch. As the weather is so hot more and more people are tending towards cold pork and ham, rather than the hot roast. We are currently renovating our laundry again. It is now seven years since we moved into the house and time to start repainting for the second time. So, we are starting with the laundry and will work up to bigger rooms. The garden is looking great with the roses in bloom and masses of marigolds crowding the front plots. It was fortunate that only two weeks ago we received some rain as we have been experiencing drought conditions this year and even with watering the grass was always dry. Did the water reach you Now things are looking green and lush. This greenhouse effect is certainly changing things. A taxi driver, while at Surfers Paradise, told us how in the past five years the weather has completely changed there as well, with very little rain now. Have a wonderful trip to Melbourne for the Phantom, Im sure that you will enjoy it. Keep well and happy, 62 Weil Ave. Croydon Park. N.S.W. 2133 27th January, 1993 Dear Ellen Thankyou for your card at Christmas. We had a wonderful Christmas and it made more fun because Kate was SO excited. I can imagine it was the same for James and Amanda. Kate met Santa several times and wasnt at all greedy when it came to asking her what she wanted for her present a box. We even bought presents for all our animals and wrapped them and put them under the tree. Kate snuck into the hallway and told Mushka about her surprise and then came giggling back to me and revealed that she had told Mushka about the secret gift. We then went to the greengrocer and bought a large bag of carrots to leave out for the reindeer. Kate was literally jumping up and down with excitement. At Christmas Eve we had a traditional meal at my parents house, Christmas day we went to Phils family. On Christmas morning Kate couldnt believe that her stocking had been filled She was so happy and thought that that was itdotted lineof course, there was more under the tree. She was in kids heavendotted linepresents, presents, and more presents, as well as food and fun Kates third birthday went well. We organised a party at the Plaster Pot. I bought a large gingerbread house for the party and all the kids eyes were wide with delight,especially when it came time to eat it In November Kate was a flowergirl at a friends daughters wedding. At the rehearsal she played up, running around the church, etc. Fortunately, on the day, she was wonderful. We were extremely proud, of course . She stood at the alter holding her heavy basket of flowers and would occassionally ask if it was over yet, when told it wasnt then continued to stand there quietly. Her walk up and down the aisle was also perfect and she looked cute dotted linewell, I think so,dotted lineIve enclosed a photo, so see for yourself The union won my case for some backpay at work as I wasnt being paid for my marking, examination setting, etc and that has been a nice little windfall, so,dotted line, Phil, Kate and myself are off to Singapore in early February."

        "text": "Recent developments and performance of radar wind profilers and RASS Peter T. May Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre, Melbourne, Australia Manuscript received June 1991 revised August 1991 A review of recent progress in the development of wind profilers for both operational and research meteorology is presented. Wind profilers are having a significant impact and are coming into use in Australia. The development of a temperature sounding capability using the RASS radio acoustic sounding system technique will only enhance the impact. The review concludes with discussion of ongoing work in Australia. Introduction Wind profilers are now a key component in many research and operational programs. Their capability to measure wind profiles with very good time 20 minlh and height 150500m resolution throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere is unparalleled. Developments are still taking place on a number of fronts. Analysis techniques to take advantage of the good time resolution in both singlesite analyses and networks for operational forecasting are being studied. There have also been technological advances such as the development of very portable boundarylayer profilers and temperature sounding with profiler resolution up to several kilometres using the RASS radio acoustic sounding system technique. The wind profiler is a reasonably mature technology for wind sounding, but important research is continuing on such topics as using the radars to measure dropsize distributions in precipitation Gossard 1988 and RASS May et al. 1990a. This review will cover the technique and recent advances, illustrated by some applications, and will conclude with a description of research being performed in Australia. Wind profilers are Doppler radars capable of detecting the backscatter from the fluctuations in the refractive index which is a function of temperature and humidity of the clear air through the troposphere see Balsley 1981 and Larsen and Rottger 1982 for reviews. Profilers are characterised by long dwell times of the order of minutes to obtain a velocity estimate and observing in three or five fixed beam directions, all close to the zenith within 15degree. This is in contrast to a weather radar which is continually scanning and uses dwell times of less than a second. The radial velocity of the scatterers along the radar beams is measured and the wind is estimated assuming that the wind field over the beam separation is uniform. While this can lead to errors under severe convective conditions, profilers have proved to be excellent observing platforms for the study of mesoscale systems such as fronts, jet streaks and short waves e.g. Shapiro et al. 1984. An example, using data from the Denver 915 MHz profiler, is shown in Fig. Note how the very thin region of directional shear associated with the front is resolved, although the region of large velocity shear is over a layer about one kilometre thick and two hours in duration. Another interesting feature is the quasiperiodic fluctuation period 2h in wind speed ahead of the front. These have a considerable amplitude gt5m s1 and the spatial scale corresponding to a twohour oscillation will not be spatially resolved by any foreseeable operational network. This kind of oscillation will severely contaminate the calculation of gradient quantities such as vorticity and divergence using any observing technique, although with the profiler time resolution there is at least some hope of identifying and possibly filtering such fluctuations. Some profilers, such as the Adelaide very high frequency VHF radar Vincent et al. 1987, use an alternative observing method known as the spaced antenna SA technique, but it has similar limitations to the technique described above May 1990. There have been numerous statistical comparisons between profiler and radiosonde wind estimates which have generally shown excellent agreement. The most comprehensive of these compared two years of data from a profiler and radiosondes launched from the Denver National Weather Services NWS site. This study showed root mean square differences of about 5m s1 Weber and Wuertz 1990 very good considering that the profiler gives a volume 150 m in height and time 15 min average above the radar, while the radiosonde is a slantwise point measurement. With the volume and time averaging inherent with the profiler, it can be argued that profiler wind estimates should be more representative of the mean wind than radiosonde estimates. Profilers operating in the tropical Pacific are providing data to both the National Meteorological Centre NMC and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF Gage et al. 1988. These data are increasing the skill of analyses in this datasparse region. Wind profiler types Profilers have been built at a number of frequencies Strauch et al. 1984. The radar equation for received backscattered power, Pr, can be written as equation where K is a constant, Pt is the transmitted power, A is the antenna area, Greek characteris the radar wavelength, Greek characteris the radar reflectivity, Greek characterr is the range resolution and r is the range. The radar reflectivity from precipitation is given by equation where C is a constant and Z is the reflectivity factor often expressed as dBZ 10 log10 Z. For clearair scatter from isotropic turbulence in the inertial subrange equation where Cn2 is the turbulence structure constant. Examples of low and high power profilers are shown in Table Note that the sensitivity of a profiler is proportional to the mean power multiplied by the antenna area. The strong wavelength depenence of means that the capabilities of different frequency profilers and the relative importance of clear air and precipitation scatter differ substantially. This also impacts on their applications. Therefore, we will now discuss separately profilers operating at differing frequency bands. 50 MHz profilers The capability of observing winds through the troposphere and lower stratosphere was first shown using highpower ionospheric radars operating near this frequency Woodman and Guillen 1973. These systems use large antennas, about 50100 m in diameter, and high power systems e.g. Fukao et al. 1985 can measure winds as high as 25 km routinely, while more modest systems generally see to about 15 km. Their main limitation, however, is that they have a minimum observing height of 12 km, which is not adequate for many meteorological applications. They have been supported by 915 MHz boundarylayer profilers, but the added complexity probably means they will not be deployed operationally. However, the 50 MHz profiler has significant research applications not feasible with profilers operating at 400 or 915 MHz. These radars can always see the backscatter from the clear air, unlike profilers at higher frequencies where the backscatter from precipitation may drown out the clearair scatter. Thus they are one of the very few observing systems capable of directly measuring the vertical component of the wind w under a wide variety of conditions. This has important implications. For example, they can measure the vertical motion field around frontal regions. The vertical circulation around fronts is crucial for understanding the dynamics of fronts and these systems provide excellent tests for models. An example from the third phase of the Australian Cold Fronts Program is shown in Fig. The horizontal winds above 2 km are measured by the Adelaide profiler, while the winds below 2 km and temperature observations are from sixhourly radiosondes. The temperature structure and the warm and cold conveyorbelt flows described in the conceptual model of Ryan and Wilson 1985 can be recognised with the aid of satellite observations May et al. 1990b. Of particular interest is the vertical component and the horizontal component normal to the front. A deep upward circulation driven by lowlevel convergence is seen around the time of the passage of the surface front. This deep circulation is responsible for the generation of the midtropospheric cold dome. The circulation is a feature noted in the numerical models of Reeder and Smith 1987, but the observations show a smaller horizontal scale and are more intense. This and other cases are discussed in more detail by May et al. 1990b. These radars have also been used for studying short timescale wind variability associated with internal gravity waves. A key finding is that although the energy density is concentrated towards low frequencies, it is the high frequency components that are responsible for the vertical flux of horizontal momentum and the momentum flux divergence, at least near mountainous terrain Fritts et al. 1990. The vertical flux of horizontal momentum associated with internal gravity waves has been parametrised in many large models to provide a drag on the mean flow, but this technique provides one of the few tests of these parametrisations in the real atmosphere. When there is heavy precipitation rainfall ratesgt10mmh, it has been observed that a second peak associated with hydrometeor scatter appears. Because we have independent measures of both the fall speed and vertical motion, as well as automatic correction for spectral broadening due to turbulence and beam width since these are the same for clear air and precipitation, these radars may be able to measure the dropsize distribution with great sensitivity and fewer assumptions than in previous radar studies Wakasugi et al. 1987 Gossard 1988. This kind of measurement should lead to improved estimates of rainfall from weather radar as well as better radiation transfer models for clouds, since dropsize distributions are major uncertainties in both areas. Clearly these radars will play a major role in research meteorology for some time. 400 and 915 MHz profilers Profilers operating at frequencies of 400 MHz and higher have somewhat different characteristics. They have more acceptable minimum observing heights, which may be as low as 200 m, and the prototype for the NOAA profiler network has routinely observed winds to greater than 15 km above ground. Even a very lowpower mobile 404 MHz profiler Moran et al. 1989 routinely sees above 6 km, which is adequate for many applications. Even quite powerful radars operating at around 915 MHz are limited to a maximum height of about 10 km Strauch et al. 1984. This is most likely because the inner scale of turbulence becomes less than half a radar wavelength at greater heights, so the fluctuations in radar refractive index are highly damped. A small inner scale is also presumably why 10 cm weather radars are mostly limited to the boundary layer for scatter from the clear air. A significant difference compared with 50 MHz profilers is that when there is precipitation, the shorter wavelength means that the precipitation echo is many orders of magnitude greater than the clear air. This means that they cannot always measure the vertical component of the wind instead they measure the fall speed of the precipitation. This does not, however, greatly affect the accuracy of the horizontal wind estimates Wuertz et al. 1988. In this sense they can be regarded as supplying similar data as a radiosonde, but with more representative estimates and much better time resolution. A number of very low power 915 MHz profilers, capable of measuring winds continuously up to about 23 km, have been built. These initially were designed to support 50 MHz profilers, but have been used in a number of experiments, for example in looking at flows in complex terrain. They are very useful for these and other experiments studying smallscale phenomena since the profilers are small and easily deployed. Networks There have been a number of studies devoted to developing singlestation diagnostics using profilerderived winds. For example Nieman and Shapiro 1989 used geostrophic methods to estimate temperature gradients and temperature advection from profiler data in regions where fronts had little curvature and were not evolving rapidly. Zamora et al. 1987 used line integral methods to obtain three station estimates of vorticity, divergence and deformation around fronts and jetstreaks. They were also able to diagnose the ageostrophic wind component in some cases. As noted earlier, profilers have been used to document fronts and jet streaks e.g. Rottger 1979 Shapiro et al. 1984, and operationally to look at developments between the synoptic observing times Beckman 1990. However, it is clear that many of the major benefits for operational and research meteorology will lie in the deployment of networks. NMC and ECMWF are assimilating data from the profiler network in the tropical Pacific area with a significant impact Gage et al. 1988."

All the lamps in the atrium were all the same and the clients requested that it remain. I therefore had to design a matching set of paintings that were to be hung either side of the lamp. Due to the size of the atrium and the layout of the house the paintings on the stairwell would be seen from several rooms through a lush tropical indoor garden on the ground floor of the entrance hall and atrium. photo Here, step by step, is how I tackled the project. Initial feelings sizing the commission I measured the size of the wall and stairwell took note of any artwork, plants etc., around the surrounding area that would have an effect on the paintings to be done. I took note of the minimum size to the maximum size that would fit in this position, and I spent enough time at the house to absorb its atmosphere. Satisfy the client not just yourself Remember, when you are painting a commissioned work the client has to like it when it is finished At the initial client briefing I made a detailed list of all the objectives that had to be considered. I find it Continued on page 30 photo caption caption photo caption photo caption photo artistically satisfying to piece the whole puzzle together. When you are doing this use your own individual creative talents but leave experimental artistic whims and fantasies out of commissioned work Keep within the set boundaries of the commission. Initial pencil sketches Back in my studio, remembering all the objectives, I drew out a few thumbnail sketches. I thought at that stage that a rainforest scene with King Parrots in it would be appropriate as the paintings would act as an extension to the indoor tropical garden. Consider turning your painting into prints I considered my options and decided that by doing the painting as one panel, then cutting it in half I would gain three advantages a. One panel would be easier to work with. b. It gave myself and the clients the option of one painting or two if they changed their mind about the lamp on the stairwell. c. I could take up a print option this would enable me to photograph the major work as one piece. I would then have the option of putting the painting into print either as one image or as a diptych. i.e. the printer could use the 8 x 10 transparency as a single image or mask the transparency to give a matching pair of images. Final pencil sketch I had some reference photos on file from Lamington National Park. I settled on a combination of five images. A waterfall with rainforest, a large moss covered horizontal branch and three individual King Parrots. I realised that if the painting had to be cut, I would need a strong horizontal branch to create enough tension to span the gap between the two paintings. It would also look good as a single image. I completed a rough pencil sketch using the five photographs mentioned. caption photo caption photo caption photo photo caption photo caption photo caption Check the pencil sketch and concept with the client I submitted the sketch and concept to the clients. We remeasured the site. At this stage we all decided to think big and go for the maximum size possible with two paintings 800 mm wide x 1200 mm high including frames. I allowed 100 mm for the width of the frames therefore leaving actual painting size of two panels 600 mm wide x 1000 mm high. Keeping print options in mind, left me with a single panel 1200 mm wide x 1000 mm high which would be painted to completion, then photographed, then cut. Important tip to prospective clients Never let an artists imagination run wild The artist will always come up with the biggest and brightest idea. In this instance though, the clients were kind enough to let me indulge my fantasy Make sure that the commission fits where it is supposed to It sounds obvious, but many a commission fails at this point. If in doubt, make it smaller Small colour sketch The next step was to paint a 15 cm x 18 cm full colour sketch with acrylic gouache. Doing this sketch sorted out a lot of colour and tonal problems giving me a good reference to check on the site to make sure the final painting would stand out but would not overpower and clash with the palms etc., in the indoor garden atrium area. The sketch also gave the clients a detailed visual example of the finished painting, which in turn gave me a sound base for proceeding successfully to the larger work. I also had the option of framing the sketch and presenting it to the clients along with the finished larger work. This would be particularly beneficial if the larger work were to be cut in half. A sort of before and after look at things Check the clients colour response or preferences Another interesting point was raised at this time. One of the clients was colour blind should say, had colourdeficient vision. Approximately ten percent of all men but only 36 percent of all women have colour deficient vision. True colour blindness is extremely rare, involving less than 0025 percent of the population. A person with colour deficient vision may have very acute judgement in other colour areas. In my case, the client saw red as varying shades of brown instead of red, but blue, yellowgreen and especially yellow had very acute spectral response. This colour deficient vision came up when we were talking about career paths. The client started his professional career as an electrical engineer and while in the field on a large installation, mixed up some red and brown wires much to the dismay of an electrified electrician He thought at this time a career change would be a good healthy choice both for himself and his fellow work mates. He subsequently changed from electrical engineering to civil engineering. I subsequently made minor adjustments to the reds on the parrots in the sketch. I changed the base colour to orangered with lights extending to yellow and white. For darker reds, I used Napthol Crimson therefore keeping the colour on the blue side. This was successful, much to the delight of the client. This proves the value of a full colour sketch. Isnt it easier to work out any individual colour perceptions on a small scale rather than on a larger finished work How do you perceive colour Colour theory for artists is a controversial area. Many painters frequently confuse Colour Theory with the Theory of Colour Harmony. Colour theory being a scientific objective analysis with physical and optical phenomenon of colours as electromagnetic vibrations, i.e. colour physics. Theory of Colour Harmony is a subjective perception of colour and is individual to every human being, i.e. we all respond to colours differently and individually. My harmonious colour combinations may be totally different to yours. They may be cooler, warmer, intensely pure in chroma, more subtle in hue, lighter or darker etc. Professor Johannes Itten has extensive documentation gathered from his students demonstrating each students own private conception of subjective colour harmony. He was constantly astonished at the diversity and complexity of the students response to colour, revealing their character or mode of thought or feelings. They were sometimes guarded about showing their inner self. This reaffirms that if a client wants something special and cannot select something from your portfolio or choose a subject similar to something that you have previously done, then a full colour sketch is compulsory Starting the final painting At this stage I drew the painting out on a 1000 mm x 1200 mm x 5 mm piece of medium density fine line customwood that had been primed with five coats of gesso using a paint roller. I airbrushed my diluted gloss medium acrylic varnish over the pencil sketch to fix the drawing. I basically worked all over the painting establishing dark, light, cool, warm relationships keeping in mind the clients blue, yellowgreen and yellow optical response being careful not to overdo it The painting still had to look normal. But then, what is normal Red 800650 nanometers, Yellow 580550 nanometers, lets paint by numbers Oh, how boring Remember, colour is relative to the colour next to it. Your painting is the total sum of all the individual colour harmonies. Its all individual. Its all up to you Go for it Part 2 Painting the Poet Within byJenniMitchell In the early portraits in my Australian Poets Series I had difficulties balancing the poets self image, which is often different from their public image or persona. One of the important lessons I learned was to make it clear to the sitters that I needed to paint them honestly as I saw them. I learned this from an early portrait not in the Poets Series which was begun with the sitter wearing glasses and I felt I had achieved an excellent start. She was unhappy, her self image was not satisfied. I had painted her warts and all, and she asked me to paint her without her glasses, and a little more elegantly, in accordance with her self perception. This was an interesting request. It was not just a simple question of taking off the glasses as in real life. It meant major changes to the painting. I obliged in this case, but lost real momentum and enthusiasm for the painting. She was finally pleased with the portrait but I felt the portrait did not reveal her inner self. This is the difference between what I now believe to be a commissioned ego satisfying portrait and what I am trying to express the real person, glasses, and slightly untidy looks, the poet within Since that portrait I ask permission to have total freedom, or I would not be able to paint the portrait. The artist I most admire in Australia for portraiture is Albert Tucker. He did not try to paint pretty, beautiful portraits. He painted with colour, strength and bold strokes, often using photographs to prompt his work. I find it necessary to work from the live subject, and interact with the subject to inspire the development of the painting. A lot of portraits are painted to look like the person, and indeed are very good likenesses, but have no inner life, they are boring they are dead inside. If you want a lookalike portrait a good photograph, in my opinion, can achieve these ends more effectively. It has been argued that shape and tone are the only important aspects. My aim is to make the poet come alive and talk to the viewer. I leave some of the portraits as sketches, as it seems appropriate in some cases, however, other paintings are more finished. In my early days of portrait painting I was asked the question, How long will it take I naively suggested four sittings. At the end of the second sitting I felt I had done enough, in fact, the painting flowed so spontaneously that I only worked for about half an hour on the second sitting. I did not have enough confidence at that point to say that I felt the painting was finished."

        "text": "Orchid Medicine Story and photos by Cheryll Williams Renowned for their remarkable variations in shape, colour and form orchids continue to intrigue photographers, botanists, florists and the general public, but rarely has anyone turned their attention to the less obvious attributes that they possess their medicinal qualities. photo caption The orchid family is the largest of the plant kingdom, with more than 30,000 species in over 750 genera. The wonderful Dracula species, the highly decorative Cattleya, Cymbidium, Paphiopedilum, Phalaenopsis or Vanda orchids are the most wellknown in the horticultural trade, and they provide an incredible collection for the eye to feast on. Cosmopolitan in character, orchids prefer the cooler tropics and occupy a wide habitat range which includes terrestrial land loving, saprophytic living on plant litter and epiphytic growing on another plant. Many rely closely on special insects for fertilisation as well as having symbiotic relationships with specific fungi which reflects in the ease or difficulty of their propagation. As a result many still cannot be cultivated and we need to learn more. The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew london recently instituted the Sainsburys Orchid Project in continuing the work of conservation. Much pioneering work using fungi to promote orchid growth was done by Mark Clements in Australia who had success cultivating a rare donkey orchid Diuris fragrantissima. Undertaking further research at Kew another 20 species of orchid were matched with their fungal companions. The integral role of fungi in orchid growth has remained relatively unknown until recently and now has enormous implications for orchid cultivation and conservation. So specialised are numerous species that they can be found nowhere else but in the specific habitats where they have evolved and it is this endemic character of orchids which places them in a perilous position as their environments are being progressively destroyed. One humorous incident recounted in Tan Bark, the Newsletter of the Toowoomba Orchid Society, aptly illustrates this specificity of orchid species. New Zealand botanists had spent years searching for an orchid thought to be extinct when After four days of wallowing in a peat bog in search of the tiny native Corymbas carseii, the demoralised conservation department botanists paused for a lunchbreak and found they were sitting on it. This little orchid blooms for just two days each year. Saving species from extinction has now become an international objective for many governments and organisations, with the resultant list of most orchids in cites Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora in an attempt to limit exploitation of endangered species. Tapping orchid power It has been assumed by many that the only commercially useful orchid aside from horticultural varieties has been Vanilla. However the emphasis here is on commercial and if we look beyond this definition we find unique orchid uses emerging from farflung corners of the world. From the Amazon to the Orient, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, orchids have served diverse purposes, some of which are completely unexpected, ranging from icecream in Turkey to the provision of hot tonic drinks on the streets of London. Orchid tubers primarily of the Orchis species have been used to prepare a drink called salep. Most of the tubers are starchfilled, which the herbalist Maude Grieve called Bassorin, describing it as having a sweetish taste with a faint somewhat unpleasant smell. She wrote that salep is very nutritive and demulcent, for which properties it has been used from time immemorial. It forms a diet of especial value to convalescents and children, being boiled with milk or water, flavoured and prepared in the same way as arrowroot. A decoction flavoured with sugar and spice, or wine, is an agreeable drink for invalids. Sassafras chips were sometimes added, or cloves, cinnamon and ginger. In Greece and Turkey salep sweetened with honey was an early morning pickmeup, and for centuries Turkey and Persia exported it for preparing nourishing drinks. Before the advent of coffee salep was sold at stalls on the streets of London, popular for those reputed tonic and soothing actions. The best English salep originated in Oxfordshire but demand was so great that tubers were imported from Asia minor, Germany and other European countries. Over 2,000 years ago salep was familiar to Dioscorides and the Arabian physicians, as well as later herbalists of the middle ages. Its medicinal use included prevention of rotting sores, mouth ulcers and inflammatory problems. From the Indian bazaars salep misri from a species of Eulophia was renowned for its excellent quality and, as a result, commanded high prices. Its tubers contain almost 50 per cent mucilage, some natural sugar, potassium and calcium. These were blanched in boiling water to remove the bitter taste, the skin removed and then sun dried after which they could be ground into a yellow powder for dispensing. saleps reputation was so well accepted as a tonic that it was even considered essential for long voyages and ships included it in their stores as an ounce, dissolved in two quarts of boiling water, being considered sufficient subsistence for each man per photo day, should provisions run short. The salep mucilage readily forms a jelly, used medicinally to ease gastrointestinal problems. Powdered salep mixed with boiling water was given to infants and invalids, particularly those suffering from recurrent diarrhoea or fevers. It even gained official acceptance in the German pharmacopoeia. Whats sex got to do with it It will come as a surprise to some to find out the origin of the name orchid. Dioscorides loosely applied the Greek word Orchis meaning testicle to what would later become known as the Orchid family, his choice of term inspired by the ovalshaped tubers of some European species, particularly those which came in pairs He described the swollen bulbous roots as having one which was full and solid, while the other was wrinkled and soft, mentioning the folk tale that men should eat the full one to beget sons and women the soft one to conceive daughters Local names often reflect this sexual connection i.e. Dog Stones, Goat Stones, Fox Stones etc. Therefore it was quite logical that beliefs relating to fertility evolved around these plants and all manner of rumours abounded. It was certainly a profitable idea for suppliers of the tuber to encourage. In the 17th Century the herbalist Gerard published a classification according to these stones and noted the flowers of some orchids had interesting natural associations, resembling butterlies, bees, wasps and flies. Goat stones gained their reputation from their stinking and loathesome smell, and the name Serapias Stones is particularly illuminating as sundry of them bring forth flowers resembling flies and such like fruitful and lascivious insects, as taking their name from Serapias, the god of the citizens of Alexandria in Egypt, who has a most famous temple at Canopus, where he was worshipped with all kinds of lascivious wantonnesse, songs and dances dotted line Sounds interesting. Obviously some quite remarkable and fanciful associations developed in orchid lore. The issue became even more confused when orchids used were known not only as promoters of sexual activity but were believed to be anaphrodisiac as well Witches, of course, used the tubers in their concoctions, the fresh tuber being given to promote true love, and the withered one to check wrong passions. Of course it is left to conjecture what wrong passions actually constituted However their virtues did not stop here and Culpepper tells us of other practical applications as in crushed and applied to the place they heal the Kings evil scrofula which was swelling of the lymphatic glands. The herbalist Gerard named one Orchis species Orchis maculata Female Satyrion, as orchids of his time were known as Satyrions. Legend reinforced the reputed sexual enhancing benefits of orchids recounting that they were the food of the satyrs, inciting them to carnal excesses. Mythology related that Orchis was the son of a satyr and a nymph, and was killed by the wineloving Bacchanalians for insulting their priestess. The devout prayers of his father were answered in a fashion when he was transformed into the flower that bears his name. Perhaps the most well known of all the orchids is the unusual climbing epiphyte, vanilla Vanilla planifolia with its lovely green flowers. When fertilised they produce the five to ten inch pods from whence vanilla comes. Over the ages their delicious scent has been used in the making of perfumes and, as long ago as the Aztec empire, was prized as a spice for chocolate drinks. The familiar fragrance from the chemical vanilline is only produced from fermented vanillapods, there is no aroma from the fresh pod. Vanilla has been widely utilised for its aromatic properties and also has a reputation medicinally as a stimulant, digestive aid and choleretic when prepared as a syrup or tincture. Vanilla was also rumoured to have magical benefits similar to other orchids and when used in love sachets was thought to incite lust or when placed in a bowl of sugar would impart loving vibrations. The sugar could then be used to sweeten love potions. caption Endangered species Another famous orchid remedy of the 19th Century unfortunately still used in some herbal preparations today is the striking Ladys Slipper Orchid Cypripedium pubescens known as Nerve Root or American Valerian. In the British Herbal Pharmacopoeia of 1983 its action is noted as being sedative, mild hypnotic, spasmolytic and thymoleptic indicated in treatment of insomnia, hysteria, emotional tension and general anxiety states. Once widely used it enjoyed a remarkable reputation, famous for being one of the most valuable of vegetable medicines. Its operation upon the system appears to be in harmony with the laws of animal life, giving tone to the nervous system and is, therefore, used in all cases of nervous irritability, hysterical affections, spasms, fits and all derangements of the functions of the brain such as madness, delerium etc. Its properties are sedative and antispasmodic. It has a pungent smell, somewhat nauseous. It contains extractive, gum, fecula and a small portion of essential oil. Its beneficial effects are produced by allaying pain, quieting the nerves and promoting sleep. It has good effects also in nervous headache, epilepsy, tremors, etc. Its use is preferable to Opium since it has no narcotic efects. The America Botanist, Goode, in The Family Flora, 1845 So great was its popularity, overcollection resulted in shortages of the wild plant and it is now endangered almost everywhere it grows so if any preparations have this herb in it, dont buy them. It was thought to have magical affiliations and was used in protective sachets to guard against all forms of evil intent including spells and the evil eye It was once official in the United States Pharmacopoeia usp and also found extensive use in treating the joint pains following scarlet fever. Tragically, in England its destruction was so extensive that now only two wild plants survive in a secret guarded reserve while researchers desperately try to save it from extinction. There are other striking species of Slipper Orchids, distinguished by their slippershaped lip and many are prized for their incredible variety of shape and size in the horticulture trade, for example Cypripedium formosanum and various Paphiopedilum species. We know even less about their medicinal potential. Orchids in Chinese medicine Chinese culture has long revered flowers in their art, poetry and literature. Indeed the orchid is the emblem for those of worthy character, particularly historical figures known for their virtue. Symbolising love, beauty and elegance it has a special place in Chinese beliefs representing trustworthy friendships photo caption photo caption as well as privacy. The Chinese word for orchid is lan, which generally refers to the prolific Cymbidium species. However, there are over 1,000 species of orchids native to China and various species have medicinal applications. Originally the word lan referred to aromatic plants believed to ward off evil spirits, and as Chinese orchids are renowned for their fragrance their eventual adoption of this word was a logical development from about the 13th Century onwards. Chinese treatment employs various orchid medicines, one of the most popular being Blettia striata called Bai Ji which is used as a haemostatic, to stop bleeding in the lung and stomach."

        "text": "Chapter 3 Methodology The objective of this study is to quantify and to interpret the pattern of net migration flows throughout Australia both at the smallest geographic level and at the regional level. The focus of the study is nonmetropolitan Australia other studies recently commissioned by the Bureau of Immigration Research examine intraurban migration patterns within capital cities. Population Growth Ranking database Coopers Lybrand Consultants CLC is a firm of management consultants providing strategy advice mostly to privatesector clients. In response to perceived client demand CLC developed a simple but effective database to measure the level and direction of total population growth in Australia at the municipal level Population Growth Ranking in Australia. Many businesses and government departments which maintain national distribution networks are constantly seeking to manage these networks and to identify and to prioritise expansion opportunities and requirements. Businesses in the private sector using this information include representatives of the retail, oil, motor car and financial services industries. The report, Population Growth Ranking in Australia Coopers Lybrand 1991, provides these businesses with a reference tool in strategic locational decisionmaking. The PGR database comprises data extracted from the Estimated Resident Population series produced annually by the ABS. Data are published separately by each state and territory and are released at different times throughout the year. CLC brought together the data from these publications, including intercensal revisions of estimates and final estimates as opposed to preliminary estimates, and assembled a database of population levels for each of the 850 LGAs or SLAs in Australia. The population estimates apply to a specific point for each year 30 June and include the following years 1976,1981,1986,1987,1988,1989 and The current series of Estimated Resident Population prepared by the ABS was initiated in 1976 before this date the definitional basis of the estimate was different. Accordingly, it is only possible to assemble a time series for the data on a consistent basis of the definition of estimated resident population for the period since The PGR database comprises a total of 850 LGAsSLAs in Australia at 30 June In other words the whole of the Australian continent can be disaggregated into 850 subregions for which an annual estimate of the population is available. The total number of LGAsSLAs actually varies from year to year as new municipalities are created eg Roxby Downs, 1986 and as others are amalgamated with adjacent municipalities e.g. Koroit was amalgamated with the Shire of Warrnambool in 1985. In addition, the geographic boundaries of some LGAsSLAs are occasionally changed. This is an important issue and is the subject of a separate discussion in appendix Where a boundary change occurs, the ABS usually recalculates the estimated resident population back to the previous census. Such changes are not extensive of the 850 LGAsSLAs currently defined as comprising Australia, we have identified ninetyeight in which there has been some change to the geographic definition of the boundary. The precise timing and effect of each boundary change is noted by the ABS in each state and territory edition of the Estimated Resident Population. Of the ninetyeight LGAsSLAs recording a boundary change since 1976, and which involve a populated area, some are contained wholly within capital cities e.g. Broadmeadows and Essendon, 1979. Other changes are reciprocal the loss of population from one municipality often has the effect of increasing the population of another municipality by precisely the same amount. Where the ABS recalculation of population levels for municipalities only extends back to the census in 1986 or in 1981, an assessment has been made by CLC to extend the adjusted population figure back to previous census dates was firstly to derive the rate of population growth for the whole municipality on the old boundaries between census years, and then to apply that rate to the new adjusted estimate for either 1981 or 1986, working back to an appropriate estimate for the earlier census year either 1976 or 1981. A further complication to the establishment and maintenance of the PGR database is the occasional change in names of specific municipalities. All municipalities are described on the basis of their current names, even though the time series extends back to a period when the municipality may have been otherwise named e.g. Shire of Portland became the Shire of Heywood in 1988. The database so established contains the basis to the calculation of net population growth for each of the 850 LGAsSLAs for each of the reference periods from June The reference periods are 197681, 198186, 198687, 198788, l98889 and 1989 The PGR database is thus manipulated to identify those municipalities in Australia recording most absolute population growth and decline over a specific period. It is this information which is most effectively used by businesses in order to identify areas for possible network expansion and to prioritise expansion opportunities. Estimated net migration database The total level of population growth for each LGASLA in Australia has been further refined in this study by the extraction of the component of natural increase from net growth Net growth births deaths net migration where natural increase is the excess of births over deaths. The ABS maintains a database on the number of births and deaths in each LGASLA in Australia for the whole period since the Estimated Resident Population series has been released since before 1976. Births and deaths data are published by each state and territory office of the ABS. Some offices publish the data by municipality, others by statistical division. The problems of name and boundary changes of municipalities apply equally to the database on births and deaths and to that for the estimated resident population. CLC approached the Geostats Group in the Electronic Dissemination Division of the ABS to extract births and deaths data from the ABS central demographics database. The ABS encountered several difficulties in retrieving this information, namely bullet the geographic coding of municipalities and SLAs has changed three times since 1976, and so different retrieval codes were required to extract data for each municipality over the whole period bullet the data retrieval was only possible on a calendar year basis bullet births and deaths data tend to lag behind estimates of the population whereas estimated resident population data is available to June 1990, births and deaths data is only available to December The first of these difficulties simply extended the data assembly process. The second has necessitated some estimates of data splits between calendar and financial years in order to match up with the estimate of the population at the end of each financial year. In the consideration of estimated net migration flows for the whole of the period between 1976 and 1989, these estimates apply to bullet the proportion of births and deaths in the second half of 1976 from data provided for the whole of 1977 50 per cent bullet the proportion of births and deaths in the first half of 1989 from data provided for the whole of 1989 50 per cent. The same estimating procedure has been employed for reference years between 1976 and 1989 and which are 19761981, 198186, 198687, 198788 and 1988 In this study, the yearbyyear fluctuations of the total estimated net migration flow is provided as an indication of net migration movements which are often associated with specific events. The Geostats data retrieval by calendar year was necessary to avoid an additional, detailed step of adjustments of data within years. The ABS demographics database records births and deaths for a singularly defined geographic area any name or boundary change within a year requires a separately defined area to be entered. The Geostats retrieval by calendar year provides an actual andor estimated figure for births and deaths for a whole calendar year. If data were extracted from the demographics database, then the following adjustments would have been necessary adjustment to an annual figure for areas with a boundary or name change within a year adjustment of annual figures to ensure consistency between years. Completion of both of the above tasks would have required a significant increase in the volume of data adjustment, and is likely not to have yielded a significant improvement in the accuracy of the overall netmigration flows between June 1976 and June The adjustment of births and deaths data between years in which there was a boundary change was completed by applying the crude birthdeath rate per 1000 population for the whole municipality, and apportioning births and deaths to the component of the population either added or lost to the municipality. The result of this process is the establishment of several linked databases containing data for each of the 850 LGAsSLAs in Australia for all reference years between 1976 and These databases are shown in figure It is the final database 6 in figure 1 which has formed the basis of much of this report and which is reproduced in full in table A Geographic classification In addition to the actual estimates of net migration, the final database includes several bases for the geographic analysis of component data. These bases are as follows bullet LGASLA by current name as at 30 June 1990 bullet stateterritory bullet population region as defined by the ABS i.e. statistical divisions bullet DPIE region classification which defines rural, remote and metropolitan regions based on remoteness and categorises LGAsSLAs to one of the following bullet Metropolitan Capital city Nonmetropolitan bullet Nonmetropolitan Rural major rural centre or other rural area Remote major remote centre or other remote area. A detailed description of the classification system employed by the DPIE is provided in appendix Some municipalities actually straddle population regions or statistical divisions and DPIE regions. Based on 1986 Census data, these include the split parts of municipalities on the edges of Melbourne e.g. Cranbourne, Brisbane e.g. Albert and Hobart e.g. Kingborough. The DPIE classification used in this report uses boundaries applying to 1986 Census data. Since work on this report commenced, revisions to the classification have been made by DPIE in order to make the classification more useful for nationallevel analysis and to take account of various shortcomings evident in earlier drafts. The database thus assembled provides the RPPU with a truly unique analytical tool. For what we believe to be the first time in Australia, a national longterm assessment can be made of the scale and direction of net migration flows over the period between June 1976 and June 1989, which is some fifteen years before this report was written. Because of the RPPUs concerns for rural and remote Australia, the individual components of the database relating to capital cities have been collapsed into a single aggregate figure for each state and territory. These include the capital city statistical divisions as defined by the ABS. Some Other Metropolitan centres as defined by the DPIE do not match up precisely with the ABSdefined statistical districts which comprise our largest provincial cities. These differences need to be explained and are discussed as follows bullet The DPIE regional classification nominates the municipalities of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie as Other Metropolitan but excludes the municipalities of Port Stephens, Cessnock and Maitland which are defined by the ABS to be included with the Newcastle Statistical District. bullet Other Metropolitan areas which are also defined on a basis not consistent with the ABS definition of a statistical district include Geelong and Gold Coast. Wollongong is defined by both the ABS and the DPIE as an Other Metropolitan area comprising Wollongong, Kiama and Shellharbour. The geographic basis of the net migration and migration flow data is the Local Government Area or the Statistical Local Area. This is the smallest geographic unit for which ABS provides annual estimates of the population. Births and deaths are reported at the LGASLA level, as are a range of indicators used by the ABS to estimate the migration component of net population growth or decline i.e. building approvals are registered with the local councils. Interpretation of the net migration trends at the LGASLA level requires an understanding of how boundaries surround different population areas."

        "text": "Introduction This handbook is for employers. It sets out to explain the apprenticeship system in NSW, answer the questions most frequently asked by employers and refer you, the employer, to people and work areas that can help you and your apprentices. The apprenticeship is the traditional training system by which people learn a trade or craft. Additionally, apprenticeships play an important role in improving the long term employment prospects for young people and consolidating the national skills base. The apprenticeship training system in NSW is regulated by the Industrial and Commercial Training Act 1989, which is administered by the NSW Department of Industrial Relations, Employment, Training and Further Education. As an employer of apprentices you will have dealings with the NSW Department of Industrial Relations, Employment, Training and Further Education DIRETFE. In particular, you will have contact with a Departmental Training Officer and the Vocational Training Registry. They provide the services of the former Apprenticeship Directorate. For more detailed information and guidance on specific problems and the supply of the various forms mentioned in this handbook, you should contact the Vocational Training Branch of the Department. For those employers who have not already made contact with a Training Officer in their area, addresses and telephone numbers are located in Attachment A.

Dont forget school students who did work experience with your company and people who have already contacted you looking for apprenticeships. They have already demonstrated they are keen. Careers advisors at local schools also know of students interested in particular trades. Keep your options open. The right person for the job might not be the boy next door. Have you thought about hiring an older person A woman Or a person with a disability In addition to being highly motivated employees, people from disadvantaged groups may attract some additional Government subsidies. Disadvantaged groups may include persons with a physical or mental disability, Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders, persons from nonEnglish speaking culturesbackgrounds, longterm unemployed and sole supporting parents. How much will it cost me Apprentices receive wages according to what type of industry they are working in and how far they are through their apprenticeship. Wages and conditions are regulated by industrial awards. If you have any award enquiries, contact State Awards 02 266 0688 Federal Awards 02 286 0888 What paperwork do I have to fill out to get started The important one is the AD5 Application for Approval to EstablishAssign an Apprenticeship, which has to be completed within 14 days of hiring your apprentice See Section 2 All about Apprenticeships and Attachment B. The indenture is completed after the probationary period. See Section 2 All About Apprenticeships and Attachment C. CRAFT subsidy forms should also be filled out at this time. See Section 6 Financial Assistance. If you have hired a trainee apprentice, only possible in some trades the Vocational Training Registry will send you a progress card to complete and return. See Section 2 All about Apprenticeships and Attachment D. The Registry will send this card back to you every six months throughout the apprenticeship to verify your apprentices employment and satisfactory progress. How much money will I get from the Government Details of subsidies available from both the Commonwealth and NSW Governments can be found in Section 6 Financial Assistance. The majority of subsidies are available through the Commonwealth Governments CRAFT program. Your apprentice must be registered with DIRETFEs Vocational Training Registry before any payments under this program will be made to you. You should also check with your local Training Officer to find out about new or shortterm incentive schemes that may be offered from time to time. Is there any financial help for apprentices Details of assistance available from the Commonwealth and NSW Governments can be found in Section 6 Financial Assistance. These include the Vocational Training Assistance Scheme VTAS, which provides financial assistance towards accommodation and travel expenses for apprentices who need to travel more than 120 kilometres round trip to attend block or day release training courses. Do all employees under the age of 21 who do trade work have to be apprentices Yes, or they must have completed an apprenticeship. This applies even to employees who only spend a small percentage of their time doing trade work. If I take on someone who has already done part of an apprenticeship, do they have to start again If an apprentice is transferred or assigned from one employer to another, your apprentice will take up where she or he was up to with a previous employer, both on and off the job. Essentially it is a continuation of the same apprenticeship, with a new employer. There is no new probationary period. If you take on an outoftrade apprentice, whose indenture has been cancelled, a new probationary period will apply, followed by the shortened term necessary to complete the apprenticeship. A new AD5 form needs to be completed. See Section 2 All about Apprenticeships for further details. Do they have to go to tech, or can they work for me five days a week The offthejob part of an apprenticeship is just as important as the onthejob work. Generally, your apprentice will go to college one day each week, for 36 weeks, though some apprentices in country areas do offthejob training in blocks of between three days and three weeks. Outside college terms, apprentices work five days a week. Your apprentice is entitled to holidays and sick leave, like any other employee. See Section 5 Conditions of Employment. Can I sack them That might not be necessary If youve invested time, training and money in an employee it makes sense to try and keep them. If you and your apprentice are having problems that you cant resolve, contact your local training officer, in the first instance. Of course, sometimes it just doesnt work out. The procedure for terminating apprenticeships can be found in Section 2 All about Apprenticeships. What if I havent got enough work to keep my apprentice A group scheme could be the solution. Group training companies have been set up in some geographical areas and industries to assist small andor specialised employers. Again, in the first instance, talk to your local training officer. What things do I have to teach my apprentice This will vary, according to the trade. Onthejob training should take account of what your apprentice is learning at college. Remember, the aim of an apprenticeship is to produce a qualified tradesperson. As an employer you probably know what makes a good tradesperson. Australia is moving towards CompetencyBased Training CBT, which is all about reaching and demonstrating competence, rather than completing a fixed term of training. Industrys input in identifying skills and knowledge needed for the various trades and the standards required will be essential to CBTs development. See Section 9 CompetencyBased Training for more information. How do I know when theyve learnt what Ive taught them With a lot of skills youll see your apprentices progress as she or he works for you. With other skills you may need to arrange tests and talk to the people providing your apprentices offthejob training. CompetencyBased Training will make assessing your apprentices ability easier. SECTION 1 Obligations of Employers Apprentices Employers Under the Industrial and Commercial Training Act, 1989 you are required, within 14 days of employing an apprentice, to lodge an Application for Approval to EstablishAssign an Apprenticeship Form AD5 with The Vocational Training Registry, Department of Industrial Relations, Employment, Training Further Education, PO Box 848, DARLINGHURST NSW 2010 A sample of the form can be found in Attachment B. As an employer you are obliged to provide your apprentice with arrow1every opportunity to learn the skills of the trade arrow1time off, with pay, to attend college training arrow1a safe working environment and conditions which contribute to the learning of the trade arrow1a work environment free from sexual or any other form of harassment. Your local Training Officer can assist you in understanding and meeting your obligations. Any problems that arise may be referred to the Vocational Training Board. Apprentices Your apprentice is obliged to arrow1learn and work to attain the skills of the trade arrow1study the college course prescribed under the appropriate apprenticeship Vocational Training Order arrow1accept all instruction and training arrow1obey any lawful instruction given by you or your representatives. If your apprentice fails to meet these obligations you should, in the first instance, contact your local Training Officer for assistance. SECTION 2 All about Apprenticeships Definitions An apprenticeship is a job which usually combines college study with onthejob training, to learn a trade or craft. There are over 300 trades. A list of the most popular trades and those in which apprenticeships are currently available can be found in Attachment F. Qualified tradespeople generally begin by completing an apprenticeship. Currently most apprenticeships take four years to complete, although some trades take a shorter time. With the advent of CompetencyBased Training CBT all apprenticeships can be of a shorter duration. Indentured Apprenticeship Apprentices who are indentured sign an indenture which is a written contract of training between an employer and apprentice. In the contract you agree to teach your apprentice a particular trade and allow time off with pay to attend technical college classes as required under the relevant Vocational Training Order. In return, your apprentice agrees to become skilled in all aspects of the trade. Trainee Apprenticeship This type of apprenticeship is not available in all trades. It is similar to an indentured apprenticeship except that there is no written contract and the employment may be terminated by either party by giving the prescribed notice. Trainee apprentices get slightly higher wages to make up for this lack of security. There are no other differences between a trainee apprentice and an indentured apprentice. Both receive the same training, both on and off the job, and receive the same certificate on completion. If a trainee apprentice moves from one employer to another, the new employer is required to apply to the Vocational Training Registry to reestablish the apprenticeship on an AD5 application form within fourteen days of commencement with the new employer."

        "text": "Death knell muffled THE results of Britains local council elections are at least fairly heartening for the Prime Minister, Mrs Thatcher. The elections were touted by the Labour Party as a de facto referendum on the recently introduced poll tax and opinion polls pointed to a supposedly instructive defeat for Mrs Thatchers Conservative Party. While Mrs Thatcher will be far from ecstatic over the results, they are better than the polls indicated. They should encourage her to maintain her stance of taking the hard decisions necessary to govern Britain. Last night, with results in from 160 of 201 local councils at stake in England, Wales and Scotland, the Conservatives had lost 268 seats and gained 71 while Labour had 340 gains and 39 losses. Opinion polls had pointed to the Conservatives losing to Labour up to 400 of the 1500 seats they were defending. In light of the violent antipoll tax riots that shattered central London only a month ago, the result must be seen as a victory for those in favour of reform of Britains council rating system if not necessarily the poll tax itself which sees local council rates levied on every adult living in a council area, rather than only on property owners. Councils in Britain control education, police, fire brigades, and lowincome housing, in addition to planning, roads and rubbish collection. Bigspending councils create heavy financial burdens for ratepayers. All residents ratepayers or not have had the right to vote in council elections. In some highspending areas nonratepayers, in the past, have elected councils that have imposed crippling rates on property owners. As some of these councils failed to curb their reckless spending with the advent of the poll tax, their residents generally poorer families are being levied a tax up to four times as high as that asked of richer residents of lowspending councils. Much attention during the campaign was focused on the socalled flagship Conservative councils, where a low poll tax had been imposed and a Labour victory would have been especially damaging to Mrs Thatchers standing. In these areas, however, the Conservatives appear with one exception in the Midlands city of Bradford to have held or increased their support. As might have been expected, the Conservatives did worst in those areas where few residents have ever paid council rates. The results suggest that radical Thatcherite policies still hold a potent attraction for British voters. The opinion polls that show Labour would win an absolute majority in Parliament should a general election be held now may not be an accurate reflection of voters intentions. Clearly, Mrs Thatcher is like Mark Twain reports of her political death are an exaggeration. Were the victims of our trueblue virtues PROFESSOR Heinz Arndt from the Australian National University makes a pertinent point when he looks beyond the graphs, charts and tables of the economist and nominates our culture as an obstacle to economic reform. The aim of restructuring is to make industry flexible, efficient and strong, so it can compete in difficult international markets. Yet the aim sits uneasily with our relaxed, and very pleasant, style of living and working. We are victims of our virtues. We are an easygoing nation with a long, happy tradition of social egalitarianism, of not taking ourselves, or anything else, too seriously. The vernacular which is so much a part of our consciousness Shell be right No worries betrays this aspect of our character. The institution of the smoko, the very notion of wanting everyone to have a fair go, the sacredness of the long weekend, our belief that a person really is entitled to the job she or he holds rather than to a job are all signs that ours is not a Prussian approach to life. We can look to history for the causes of this our convict beginnings in which work was a punishment and something to be avoided the strong Celtic strain in our make up the unaccustomed heat of our climate for early settlers here. Whatever the causes, however, there is no doubt that elements of our culture militate against sharp economic performance. The link between culture and economic performance is too little studied and understood. An understanding of Australian culture, of the depth of our attachment to many customs which economists would describe as restrictive work practices, is essential if we are to wrestle with funding longlasting solutions to our economic problems. The link has been recognised before. Not so long ago, a semiofficial advertising campaign told us that near enough was no longer good enough. But it requires something more than a marketing exercise to alter such deeply ingrained attitudes and, it is to be hoped, something less than a long and harsh recession. Yet it is essential we recognise that unless we choose to give up some treasured aspects of our workstyle we risk having the sacrifice imposed on us. If we do not pursue microeconomic reform we will lose much that we value in our culture. If we remain uncompetitive we risk gradual impoverishment. We risk then things more important than smokos and long weekends. High levels of home ownership, good quality health care and decent retirement incomes simply would be beyond our means. Moreover, the longstanding sense of social solidarity would suffer if we became substantially poorer. Nations which experience severe economic decline almost always become nastier, meaner societies. Yet there is no need to sacrifice everything which we find agreeable in the Australian character in the pursuit of economic efficiency. As Professor Arndt says, the easy, friendly nature of our lifestyle is very attractive. Certainly the tradition of social egalitarianism need not be inimical to the formation of a true meritocracy. Holding that all Australians are equally deserving of courtesy and social acceptance does not mean that they must all get the same rewards for differing effort and talent. Social egalitarianism can be the engine of an economic meritocracy, as historically was the case in the United States. Similarly, our sympathy for the underdog is a manifestation of instincts of compassion. All social systems need to be tempered by compassion. None the less, it is clear changes in the way we live and work, and ultimately in the way we think about the world, are necessary. To stay true blue we will need to become not only smarter, but much more hardworking, and some cherished customs will have to disappear. TV government by ideological heritage THE first commandment of communications policy is thou shalt not have foreign ownership. So the Federal Government is planning to limit further foreign ownership of television stations without feeling the need to explain the rationale for the move. The historical fact that opposition to foreign control is a venerable part of Labours ideological baggage is not, on its own, a sound basis for the formulation of public policy. When Cabinet considers the foreign ownership rules in the next few days, its first task is to ask itself why it is doing so. If it supports the plan by the Minister for Communications, Mr Beazley, to impose a foreign ownership limit of up to 30 per cent of the shareholding, its next task is to spell out its assumptions. There may be good reasons why foreign ownership should be limited to 20 or 30 percent of the shareholding. But no one in the Government has yet bothered to explain what they are. The debate on the level of foreign ownership of TV stations is based on the belief that it is bad for Australia. The clear, but unstated, suggestion is that foreign ownership would destroy our culture or give foreign owners unwelcome power over our lives. But is this the case There is evidence that Australians are watching TV less than they did in the past and that this turning off is at least in part a reflection of the quality of programming. The cosy assumption that our commercial TV is better than that overseas because we can choose from the best of Australian, American and British shows may not be correct. If our commercial television diet is to be dominated by variablequality sitcoms, overblown miniseries and mindless soaps, does it make any difference whether it is supplied by Australian or foreign owners What we see on commercial TV is determined by the popularity of various programs the great god ratings, the message of which is interpreted by professional programmers of whatever nationality they happen to be not the whim of any shareholder. This is more than ever the case now, as many commercial operators are struggling to meet the bills on their borrowings. The pressure to maximise advertising revenue by maximising ratings is intense. Foreign ownership would not make programming any worse, from this standpoint. It is at least conceivable that by easing financial pressures a little, foreign ownership could make the position marginally better. In any case, the owners are subject to close regulation and scrutiny. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has close to absolute power over commercial television. It decides who is a fit and proper person to hold a licence it has rules on the level of Australian content, what type of shows can be shown at what hours, and what sort of advertising can be broadcast. The commercial television owners apparently meek acceptance of Mr Beazleys proposals can be greeted with a grain of cynicism. While attention is focused on foreign ownership of broadcast TV, the Government comes under less pressure to introduce userpays cable television. TVs future may well be in that medium. The optic fibre cables now being laid through our big cities would allow the introduction of a dozen or more specialised channels showing everything from firstrun movies to 24hour news or sport. That would introduce true competition, with all its potential for improvements in program quality. This is not to say that there should be no debate on ownership levels. On the contrary TV plays an important part in most peoples lives, so the question of its control is an important public issue. But in the interests of debate, as opposed to the Government simply laying down the law, it is incumbent on Mr Beazley to go back to first principles and justify the controls. Hurting Gorbachev may help crush the system INABILITY to pay for Australian wool is the least of the Soviet Unions troubles. Its heartland is merely chronically disaffected its periphery is more or less in open rebellion. Its people are hungry, soldiers confused and workers on the verge of general strike. Its leaders are torn between an unpalatable dictatorial past and a scarcely conceivable democratic future. The Wests essential task is not to relieve the immediate misery of the Soviet people, still less to support the crumbling power base of President Gorbachev, but to ensure that communism never recovers. It is, after all, the legacy of communism that impoverishes ordinary Soviet citizens, threatens to crush Lithuanian freedom and imperils Mr Gorbachevs position. Yesterday, Mr Gorbachev appealed to the West not to make political capital out of his difficulties. In response, the United States President, Mr Bush, pointed out that Soviet procrastination on allowing the emigration of Soviet Jews and the selfdetermination of the Baltic Dtates hindered good relations. Still, he declared repeatedly, he did not want to exacerbate Mr Gorbachevs problems. To many in the West, Mr Gorbachev is the hero who made possible the end of the Cold War, the liberation of Eastern Europe and the advent of parliamentary democracy in the Soviet Union. To his own people, however, he has promised a sort of freedom but delivered economic anarchy. It is not surprising, therefore, that some Western leaders want to save Mr Gorbachev from the wrath of his own people so that he can continue to make the Soviet Union less threatening. But Mr Gorbachev did not spend 30 years climbing the party apparatus to preside over its dissolution not, at any event, when he first came to power. And if he now seems embarked on a stepbystep dismantling of the old system it is only because he has no choice."

        "text": "MINISTERIAL REPORT The SydneyCanberra corridor is a 300 km long stretch of land which links Sydney and Canberra. The corridor forms the main transport, communication and service route between these two capital cities. The landuse consists mainly of agricultural and forested areas with towns and villages situated along transport routes. Natural attributes of the corridor include its scenic national parks and forests, productive farmlands, mines and quarries and several townships with heritage significance. Four key issues of major importance in the future development of the corridor are urban growth, water resources, air quality and transport. The corridor represents one of the two outlets northwest vs southwest for Sydneys urban sprawl as residential land within the Sydney basin approaches its capacity. Population growth in Sydney and policies towards urban consolidation will greatly affect the rate and spatial pattern of urban development in the corridor. Water resources represent perhaps the most limiting factor for corridor growth. Deteriorating water quality within the Warragamba catchment which supplies about 4 million people is of major concern. Declining air quality in Sydneys southwest also required careful consideration in policies towards urban growth patterns. Transport networks are likely to continue to be a major determinant of corridor development. The economic feasability and environmental impacts of the very fast train and tilt train proposals require further investigation. My recommendations for the corridor would be for consolidated urban settlements retained in rural settings, with growth being encouraged in the central and southern corridor. Higher density urban growth would facilitate a greater reliance on public transport. Upgrading of both rail and bus transport is essential to improve accessibility and to reduce the polluting effects of high motor vehicle use. Rapid growth at the northern end of the corridor needs to be discouraged at present to avoid exacerbation of the serious water and air pollution problems. Landuse planning, technology and conservation measures are essential to alleviate this environmental deterioration. Coordinated planning between the various levels of government and agencies involved is perhaps the most important factor in promoting environmentally sustainable use of the corridors resources. INTRODUCTION The four key issues which I regard as most important in relation to the SydneyCanberra corridor are urban growth, water resources, air quality and transport. These four issues were chosen as they all have major impacts on the social and economic circumstances as well as the environmental quality of life of residents both within the corridor and in the urban centres of Sydney and Canberra. The SydneyCanberra corridor is a zone of urbanisation stretching 300 km from Sydney, the N.S.W. capital in the northeast, to Canberra, the national capital in the southwest. It forms a transport, communications and services route between these two capitals. The population of the corridor is almost 4 million including the two capital cities. Within the corridor itself however, there is a low population density with a total population of about 200,Most of the corridor remains in nonurban landuse such as agriculture, forestry, mining, nature conservation and recreation Purdon 1993. The urban settlements are located mainly along the transport routes Map 1. The corridor contains many attractive features, such as historical buildings and villages, scenic national parks, state forests, nature reserves, wetlands and farms. The corridor is managed in a rather piecemeal fashion at present by local councils and the N.S.W., A.C.T. and Federal governments. URBAN GROWTH Urban expansion of Sydney is now limited mainly to the northwest and southwest, so the northern end of the corridor represents one possible route for new urban development. The growth of Canberra is similarly limited in the south and west, so that urban expansion here may also eventually be directed northwards into the corridor. Large scale urban development however may change the nature of the corridor from one of scenic rural towns to what could be seen as an extension of the urban sprawl. It is essential therefore that development of the corridor is planned to accommodate population growth while maintaining the rural atmosphere and minimising environmental impacts. Despite Sydneys declining growth rate, there is still likely to be a net increase in population of approximatesign40,000 people each year Dept. of Planning 1993a. Planning policies for future growth have emphasised the need for more central consolidation in Sydney, especially along existing public transport routes with reduced development on the urban fringe Ibid. However there is a limit Map 1 Key Location diagram Caption to the degree of consolidation physically possible, and population pressure from Sydney will probably be the most significant influence on the rate and pattern of urban settlement in the corridor. Other local factors such as land and house prices, employment opportunities, competing land uses, commuting distances from major centres, retirement facilities, lifestyle preferences, industrial and commercial enterprises and transport availability will also direct the pattern of urban growth. At present, the rate of growth within the corridor is highest at the northern and southern ends where commuting to Sydney and Canberra is viable Table 1. With the growth of Parramatta and Liverpool as commercial centres in Sydney, more jobs are closer to the residents of the corridor Purdon 1993 p.6. Wollondilly and Wingecarribee Shires accounted for almost half of the corridor population increase 19861991 Table 1. The high rate of growth in the Wollondilly Shire can be regarded as direct expansion of the Sydney fringe. The Shire has so far maintained its rural village atmosphere, although there is concern that it will be engulfed in the urban sprawl Lewis 1993. Growth within the Wingecarribee Shire has been due mainly to migration from Sydney, especially retirees and professional people. Local government in this shire is similarly reluctant to encourage rapid urban development which may destroy the rural atmosphere. The rural towns in the central and southern corridor have lower growth rates Dept. of Planning 1992a especially Goulburn where the population is decreasing, mainly due to decline in primary production. CanberraQueanbeyan has been a rapidly growing area and eventually land in New South Wales will be required to accommodate urban expansion from Canberra Tomlins 1993. Table 2 shows possible future urban trends for the various local government areas within the corridor. Current patterns of urban growth are likely to continue, at least in the near future Department of Planning, 1990a. Greatest expansion is expected in the Wollondilly Shire where land is still reasonably priced and within commuting distance from Sydney. Demand is also likely to continue for the relatively high priced land in the Wingecarribee Shire due to its scenic beauty and proximity to Sydney. Population projections for 1991 2016 by the Department of Planning 1990b suggest that growth rates in the other rural centres such as Yass, Goulburn and Gunning will continue to be low. This will depend, however, on the productivity of the rural sector, commercial and industrial Caption Table 1 Sources Key Caption Table 2 Source developments and any changes to the transport system. Queanbeyan, Yarrowlumla and Canberra itself are expected to continue growth at moderate rates Dept. of Planning 1990b. The most attractive and environmentally sustainable urban development pattern within the corridor in the future would perhaps be mediumhigh density expansion of existing urban settlements surrounded by rural or natural areas. The Australian residential ideal is the single dwelling on a large block of land, typical of urban fringe housing Maher 1993. More research and market appraisel is required in designing medium density dwellings attractive to large numbers of the population. For example, medium density clusters of 1030 dwellings such as villas or townhouses designed to allow both privacy and a community atmosphere. This would minimise resource use and costs, e.g. land, energy and water and reduce the sense of isolation felt by many homeowners in new urban areas. Compact, public transportoriented urban growth is essential in the northern corridor where rapid growth is already exacerbating environmental problems. The central and southern urban settlements such as Goulburn and Yass appear more receptive to urban development Glover 1993 Turner 1993. Growth in these towns offers many advantages compared to continued urban sprawl on the fringes of Sydney and Canberra. For example, residential, commercial and industrial land is ralatively cheap and improvement in transport services may reduce accessibility problems. However, there are limits to the capacity of these settlements to sustain urban growth, for example water supplies, infrastructure costs and employment opportunities. The government may eventually be pressured into releasing large areas of residential land close to Sydney at some time in the next 515 years. For example, a housing boom may occur following recovery from the present recession. The most economical option in this case would perhaps be the development of an area such as Macarthur South Map 2. This is the only area in the corridor where large scale urban development has been proposed projected ultimate population 250,000Water Board 1992. Whether technological advances could reduce environmental impacts to acceptable levels needs careful assessment. Development strategies for Macarthur South and the other areas proposed for new urban development Map 2 are currently being revised Dept. of Planning 1991 and 1992b. Map 2 Caption WATER RESOURCES Most of the SydneyCanberra corridor falls within the HawkesburyNepean Catchment Map 3. The Shoalhaven Catchment supplies the southeast section of the corridor, while Canberra, Queanbeyan and Yass are supplied by tributaries of the Murrumbidgee River. The HawkesburyNepean river system has a catchment area of 22,000 sq.km. and supplies 97 of Sydneys drinking water 75 billion litres per day Water Board 1993a. The catchment also provides water for agricultural, industrial and recreational use, and contains several sites for sand and gravel extraction. The population within the catchment area is about 500,000 but is expected to increase to approximatesign800,000 by the year 2000 Dept. of Planning 1989. The major concerns for both future water supply and water quality are in the northern corridor. This is due to the very large population 4 million dependent on the HawkesburyNepean system and the serious water pollution problems already emerging in the catchment. Water is also a limiting growth factor in the southern corridor. For example, Canberras water supply will be inadequate by 2001 if current trends continue, but the problems here are of a much smaller magnitude. Water Supply Sydney has the largest per capita water storage capacity of all the major cities in the world, and consumption is correspondingly high at approximatesign500 litres per day average Water Board Annual Report 199192. The main storage reservoir is Warragamba Dam capacity approximatesign2 M megalitres with additional storage in the Cordeaux, Cataract, Nepean, Avon and Wingecarribee Dams Map 3. There are no more water catchment areas outside national parks within easy reach of Sydney. If current usage rates and population growth rates continue, the water supply will be inadequate by about 2005 Water Board 1993b, Although the rate of population growth has slowed, an increase of about one million people is expected in the Sydney region in the next 1530 years Dept. of Planning 1993a. Reduced consumption and other water conservation measures will be required to maintain an adequate supply in the long term. The proposed Welcome Reef Dam on the Shoalhaven River is one option for supplying Sydneys water requirements in the future. The dam could also supply local communities in the Shoalhaven and possibly Canberra, Queanbeyan and Yass. The capacity of the dam would be 7 M megalitres. However, there are a number of disadvantages to the dams construction environmental impacts at the site and on the catchment system and the large capital cost involved Map 3 Caption 300 M. Water Board 1993c. No decision regarding Welcome Reef Dam will be made until 199798 during which time the Water Board will review water supply and environmental issues Ibid. Water Quality In recent years there has been increasing concern that the aquatic ecosystems and water quality within the HawkesburyNepean catchment have been deteriorating. Water quality in the reservoirs has been maintained in the past by excluding any type of human activity from a wide area around the catchments. However, growth of urban centres and agricultural activities in the Wollondilly and Wingecarribee shires has resulted in wastes and sewage being disposed of into the tributaries upstream of the dams. Major pollution problems are present downstream of the dams where large volumes of urban runoff and effluent from 23 sewerage treatment plants enter the river system Water Board 1992"

        "text": "Lethal cocktail of party and drugs By WAYNE MILLER and GLENN CONNLEY A WINTER afternoon, the start of the school holidays.Teenagers with two weeks to themselves look forward to starting the break with a Saturday night out. It probably was party time for thousands of young people across the state. But for one group, it was the road to disaster. THREE girls, barely into their teens, gathered to discuss a friends birthday party later in the evening. Another teenager, a boy on the verge of manhood, was out chatting with friends at neighborhood shops. Young couples attracted to more affordable housing in the rapidlygrowing city were preparing to put their babies and toddlers to bed. Others were watching the evening news, dominated by the new casino and a minor fire scare there. It was such an ordinary Saturday evening in Melton, the satellite city to Melbournes northwest that is home to 39,000 people. But a lifeordeath gamble was unfolding as 17yearold Nyjel Smith slipped back into his familys home and took the keys to his fathers car from their regular place in the kitchen. Police suspect Nyjel had taken his father Gregs car a number of times before, joyriding with friends through local streets. Meanwhile, with the school holidays approaching, Rebekah Peake, 14, Tracey Kelly, 13, and Sarah Bhushan, also 13, were preparing for a night out. First there was a policerun Blue Light disco which had been organised in Melton High Schools recreation hall. But it was a slumber party to celebrate the 14th birthday of a friend, Lee Hall, that the closelyknit teenage trio were most excited about. At 5pm Rebekahs best friend, Kristie Vernon, 14, met her at the home of Tracey Kelly, 13, after watching friends play netball at a nearby school. We went into the garage to talk about what we were going to do that night, listen to some music and have a bit of a laugh, Kristie said yesterday. Then Nyjel dropped around. He wasnt sure if hed go to the Blue Light. About 30 pm, Nyjel Smith left his Lavarack St home on foot. He told his family he was just going out, which police say was nothing out of the ordinary. He was the type of kid who had started to stay out all night and stretch his freedom, said Insp. Noel Ashby, of the accident investigation section. Nyjel walked to shops at the corner of Station Rd and the Western Highway to meet friends, arriving about 7 pm. Insp. Ashby says a convenience store there is a real hangout for the local kids, with up to 30 often sitting around outside. Kristie Vernon, Rebekah Peake, Tracey Kelly and Sarah Bhushan went to the Blue Light Disco, which began about 7 pm. About 8pm, police say, Nyjel went home, took his fathers car and drove to a convenience store where he met Tracey Kellys boyfriend Travis Wilson, also The two boys drove to Lerderderg Gorge, about 30 minutes away. Around the same time, Lee Halls birthday party began at her house in Bridgeford Cres. Lees mother Kristine picked the girls up from the disco at 15pm. Nyjel Smith and Travis Wilson turned up at the birthday party in the car, and offered to take the girls for a spin. Ms Hall was to say later she was unaware of any drugs or alcohol at the party, and that the first she knew of the teenagers venturing out was when police knocked on her door about 6 am on Sunday. I feel guilty because it happened at my house but dotted line there is only so long you can keep an eye on kids at a slumber party without running it for them, she said. Kristie, Sarah, Rebekah, Tracey, Nyjel and Travis piled into the Smith car to go down to High St and pick up something to eat, just after midnight. During their trip, Nyjel dropped in at the Mobil Service Station on High St and bought two tubes of gas lighter refill. Kristie said that for the next 40 minutes the five sat in the front room of Lees house, inhaling the lighter gas and drinking bourbon and Coke. It was mainly Nyjel doing the stuff lighter gas. We all had a bit of a try. We all had a bit of a drink, Kristie said. Just before 2 am Nyjel and Travis went for another spin, this time to Keilor. They werent away for long, said Kristie. Nyjel, Travis, Rebekah, Tracey and Sarah decided to go for another drive about 30am. Kristie was also going this time. I was almost in the car. I went to go with them but just jumped back out again. I didnt want to overload the car and I had a bad feeling about it, she said. I said to Bekky Ill see you soon, but I had a feeling I wouldnt. Kristie said Sarah Bhushan wasnt keen to go either, but was convinced by her older friends. In the seconds before they left, Kristie pleaded with Nyjel not to drive. She said she could see he had drunk too much bourbon. At 55am on Sunday, the car careered out of control on the Western Freeway, just east of Bacchus Marsh Rd, and slammed into a steel pylon supporting overhead signs. The car split in two, with its engine being thrown 45m further on. Nyjel Smith, Travey Kelly, Sarah Bhushan and Rebekah Peake were killed. Travis Wilson was catapulted out of the car, still strapped to his seat, and landed about 15m from the point of impact. He was flown to the Alfred Hospital for extensive surgery, where he was still in a critical but stable condition last night. Insp. Ashby said the driver had lost control and gone on to one side of the road, corrected or attempted to correct and just collided with the pylon in the process. At 45am, Kristie Vernon heard a knock on the door. She says she knew it was not her friends returning.She had heard the police helicopter while lying in her sleeping bag and felt sick in the stomach. I heard the police come. I heard them say accident and somebody said four were dead. I hoped it wasnt Bekky, but I knew it was. Asthma woman dies GRIEF IN BED CHASE By HELEN CARTER, medical reporter THE wife of a senior Australian sport official has died after a search of Melbourne hospitals for an intensive care bed. Mrs June Long was admitted to the Alfred Hospital at 7pm after an asthma attack, but died next morning. Her husband, former president of the Australian Cycling Council, Mr Bill Long, said that not even having top health insurance could ensure his wife, 70, had an intensive care bed. The situation needs to be really looked at by the Government, not fiddled about with, he said. If we can just save somebody else. It is much better to have too many beds than not enough. Mr Long contacted the Herald Sun after an exclusive report yesterday revealed a beds crisis at the Alfred. It said one patient waited 48 hours on a trolley before getting a bed.Surgery for some cancer and heart patients was also cancelled to free emergency beds. The State Government yesterday denied problems at the Alfred represented a crisis in the hospital system. But it was revealed that at least one other major public hospital, Monash Medical Centre in Clayton, had difficulties in emergency. Speaking last night after his wifes funeral, Mr Long said his wife had gone to the Alfred last Tuesday evening. He had left late at night, because he thought his wife was stable and would be transferred to a bed. Those staff were working themselves to death. They were pushing people around in beds trying to find a bed, he said. She was on a trolley and they were trying to find a bed. The ambulance crew were here as quick as a flash and Im not suggesting they or the staff at the Alfred were at fault because they worked hard. With the conditions they were working under, they ought to be given gold medals. Mr Long said that when he phoned on Wednesday staff told him his wife had had a bad night and that they were trying to find her an intensive care bed. Two hours later he was told his wife had died. The Alfreds director of medical services, Dr Peter Eisen, said Mrs Long was admitted at 7 pm. She was went into a ward at 1 am but her condition deteriorated. Dr Eisen said staff searched every intensive care ward in Melbourne but no bed was free. Eventually one was found but just before Mrs Long was transferred by ambulance she stopped breathing and could not be resuscitated. Dr Eisen could not say whether Mrs Long would have lived had an intensive care bed been available sooner. But it was fair to say her chances would have been better. He said it was indicative of the overall situation and pressure on beds. Dr Eisen said that on one night last week there were no spare intensive care beds, even in private hospitals. The Alfreds director of emergency services, Dr Linas Dziukas, said conditions in the emergency department were just not acceptable. He said the problem had been so bad recently that 40 patients were squashed into cubicles designed for Patients line the corridors on trolleys wherever we can find room, he said. The Acting Health Minister, Mr Rob Knowles, said the Alfred had coped well with a 30 per cent rise in emergency patients in May. Mr Knowles said all patients had been provided with the appropriate level of care. There may have been some temporary arrangements while a bed was found but in fact the hospital coped extraodinarily well, he said. The Opposition health spokesman, Mr John Thwaites, attacked the Governments casemix funding formula and health budget cuts. Mr Twaites said noninpatient services, including accident and emergency, had been cut by 7 per cent this year. A Government spokesman said upgrading the Alfreds emergency department was being considered. Poachers reap abalone fortune By MIKE EDMONDS HITECH criminals use fast boats, radio scanners and militarystyle night vision goggles to poach 150 million of abalone a year, the State Government says. The Natural Resources Minister, Mr Geoff Coleman, says as much abalone is poached as is legally caught. The shellfish is sold to unscrupulous restaurants and on the lucrative Asian market where it can fetch more than 100 a kilo, enforcement officers said. Mr Coleman, who will launch an antipoaching offensive tomorrow, said abalone was the states most profitable fishing industry. In Japan, a single meal of illegally imported Victorian abalone can cost up to A Authorities believe abalone meat is being smuggled out of Victoria through a substitution racket. Department of Conservation and Natural Resources officers have uncovered single shipments of up to 500 kg of illegal abalone. Last weekend an officer was assaulted and more than 200kg of meat seized in a raid on a home and garage which had been fitted out with freezers. Mr Coleman said some of the wellorganised poaching syndicates had set up canning facilities to process the abalone. Licenced abalone divers presently get about 38 a kilogram, but earlier this year the price was about In Asia, Australian abalone can fetch more than 100 a kilo. There are 78 divers in Victoria, and they are each allowed to take 20 tonnes of abalone each year. The divers each pay a 28,000 annual fee and the licences are transferable. A licence was recently sold for 9 million. We have issued licences to the level which we believe will allow the industry to sustain itself, Mr Coleman said. As a rule of thumb however, we believe there is just as much taken illegally as legally, and there are local processors and restaurateurs who are not picky about who they buy from."

        "text": "TWENTYFOUR STORMS White came to think politics were in his blood because his grandfather Honest Frank had taken himself into the Parliament of New South Wales. But Frank was dead long before his grandson was born, and the boy was raised in a house where politics were hardly discussed. The Victor Whites were happy so long as Labor was out of power. Their friends were not politicians but representatives of the continuing interests of old money in Australia. Their son absorbed their loyalties. Though he wondered for a while if Europe might be better off for a Communist or Christian revolution after the war, and sided in Greece with Republican nationalists agains the royalists, he returned home as if none of this had any application in Australia. At each election he cast his vote for the conservative LiberalCountry Party coalition of Bob Menzies which had been in power since late l My political convictions do not burn, White admitted in his first decade home. He had little grasp of economics and the mechanics of political power bored him. He worried that politics were a threat to art, and maintained that those races like the Greeks who could not detach themselves from politics could not be artists. Art is art, and politics is politics I am afraid, he told Peggy Garland at the time of her enthusiasm for the new China of Mao Tsetung. I am trying to think who has brought them together convincingly, and I cannot I am sure Picassos Guernica will turn out to be the least satisfactory Picasso.1 White had opinions and expressed some of them in magisterial letters to the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald. He saw Russias hand behind most international crises he was elated by Israels triumphs over the Arabs he sided with the Greeks over Cyprus he condemned South Africa as a police state and he feared Australia becoming a colony of the United States.2 This suspicion of America was one of the few clear political convictions he absorbed from his parents and it turned out to be important. At Lulworth the decline of Britain was felt as a blow to the family of which they were part. America was certainly friendly, but this was the rise of another empire and another family to which rich Australia had little connection. The Whites and their friends voiced something of this anxiety in the amused distaste they had for American vulgarity, but Patrick could also remember his parents in the early l930s pressing on people copies of a tract called Honour or Dollars which argued the need for Britain to be forgiven the immense war debts it owed the United States. This was the Victor Whites only political enthusiasm and their son was impressed. Thirtyfive years later the transformation of this private conservative into a public radical began with his initially cautious and later vociferous disapproval of Americas role in Vietnam. Australia had begun sending troops to Saigon in 1962 and fed its war machine by conscripting a few thousand young men each year, drawing their birthdays out of a barrel in a lottery where the prize was two years in the army. Despite this, the war was a popular cause in Australia and a new conservative Prime Minister, Harold Holt, faced general elections in November 1966 confident of victory. His Labor opponent That imbecile White called him was a workingclass, antiCommunist Irishman with a voice like a cement mixer.3 Labor was divided about the war. White was unworried. A few weeks before the elction Geoffrey Dutton sent White a copy of the Vietnam Primer published by the radical American Ramparts magazine. He was sceptical before he began but convinced by what he read. The Primer told him a lot he did not know, especially about the origins of the war. The firsthand testimony of those who had fought in Vietnam struck him as sincere. In reply to Dutton he wrote, I dotted line see I have been wrong, chiefly through ignorance. I am writing to Ramparts for more copies. Nevertheless, a few days later White contributed his vote to Harold Holts handsome victory at the polls.4 Marshall Best tried to persuade White that the Ramparts crowd were irresponsible, men and women disgruntled because they have not quite made it with the Establishment. White was not impressed and when a bundle of copies of the Primer eventually arrived at Martin Road, he sent copies to friends, churchmen and to the Prime Minister. I have always voted Liberal, he told Holt, but cant go along with the warinVietnam policy, nor can I stomach the invasion of Australia by the United States, although I have nothing against Americans in their own milieu.5 Canberra took some trouble with its reply to Patrick White. Officers of the Prime Ministers Department and External Affairs worked on the draft. But when it came to be signed, Holt was away in the United States assuring President Lyndon Johnson that Australia would go All the way with LBJ in the war. Holts deputy, John Black Jack McEwen, pencilled on the draft I dont see any need to acknowledge the letter. Holt only signed and posted it on his return in June l6 Of course each side is right and each side is wrong and only God will decide, White remarked to Margery Williams. But I who am not God cant help feeling that the Americans are more immoral than the Communists for resurrecting fascism how could they help it theyre so Germanic to combat Communism. Democracy is everyday more firmly nailed in its coffin. Whites mind was finally made up when he read newspaper reports of Holts behaviour at a barbecue in California urging the Americans to keep bombing North Vietnam. It is all very gloomy. White wrote to Dutton. Not the least gloomy part is the impression that awful little Holt makes the minute he is let out of Australia. Hes definitely not for export. Never again shall I vote for him if hes foolish enough to expect us to.7 Holt drowned swimming in the Melbourne surf and his place was taken by John Gorton, a grapefruit farmer and former air ace who called fresh elections in the spring of lLabor was now led by a middleclass lawyer, Gough Whitlam, but White was unimpressed. Still, he felt he had no choice I shall have to vote for Whitlam whom I dont like much more than Gorton.8 Labor lost. Sometime soon after those elections White agreed to help the Committee in Defiance of the National Service Act. Already ll5 of the committees recruits had been convicted of breaching the Crimes Act by calling on young men not to register for conscription. White was to be the star of a new, distinguished cast of protesters whose call to disobedience would provoke the government into action. One can pay a fine, he told OHea. But I think that would be pointless help the cause not at all and from another point of view a term in jail might be quite a useful experience. She replied by return post urging him to think of his health.9 On the late afternoon of 9 December l969, fortyfour writers, actors, politicians and academics had gathered in Chifley Square. A dozen faint hearts failed to appear. This was the first sight the Australian public had had of White for seven or eight years. He signed three forms the statement of defiance, an expression of willingness to be prosecuted and an instruction to a firm of solicitors to enter a guilty plea. He was photographed and said a few words to reporters I am ready to go to jail because it is useless saying the same things over and over about a war I believe to be futile and immoral. Anyone who has been in a war, and who thinks, will know that it has been the most horrifying and wasteful period of thier lives.10 The campaign failed in its immediate aim the government remained resolutely inert no more fines were levied, those already fined were never jailed, and the courts were closed to the protesters but a point of political importance was established in Chifley Square. The governments incessant rhetoric of law and order was seen for what it was not an appeal to the evenhandedness of the law, but a euphemism for the machinery that sent young men to fight. Only those who refused to go into the army were now pursued, fined and imprisoned. For the size of its forces in Vietnam Australia was suffering high casualties four hundred men had been killed so far and another hundred were to die. The Eye of the Storm was working in Whites mind all this time. There was never a novel he knew so much about before he put it on paper. Even as Ruth lay in Rutland House six years before, he knew he would write about her death, attended by acolytes and besieged by heirs who wished this opulent convalescence would end, either with death or a bare room at the Blue Nuns. He saw that the core of the novel would be the struggle between himself and that almost senile woman of immense will. He might have called it Death and Corruption or perhaps Darker Purposes. The novel tends to stress the darker purposes in the lives of the main characters, one of whom is an actor who has failed as Lear, like most actors, and who returns to Australia with his sister to persuade their aged mother to die.11 He began to write on the Australia Day weekend at the end of January, to give myself a kind of excuse for not going to the Premiers party. This time no firstdraft attacks of asthma interrupted the flow, and the words poured out almost effortlessly for months. The cast began to grow Elizabeth Hunter dying in her great house on Centennial Park, her son Sir Basil the London actor, and daughter Dorothy de Lascabanes surviving the wreck of her marriage to Hubert de Lascabanes by clinging to a few jewels and a title. There were nurses and their lovers, the housekeeper and her crowded past, the lawyer and his family, the tenants past and present of the property Kudjeri. The number of characters was giving him trouble by June when he told Ronald Waters, While I am involved with one in particular, I have to leave the others for long stretches, then work myself back into the right frame of mind when I return to them. I imagine Esmeacute Berenger must have felt something the same when she played all the parts in Hamlet.12 Had White been able to act, he might not have written a word. He still dreamed of his Lear, his Hedda and the vaudeville routines he would perform if he had the knack. His imagination was essentially theatrical, and the best of Whites characters are not only astonishing inventions but great performances. At his desk he acted all the roles. When he spoke of the creative process, he used the language of the theatre. Characters wandered across the state of his imagination for years the spinster, the artist, the dame, the boy, the laundress but not until a couple of them came face to face and began to speak did a novel begin. They put on costume the air smelt of hot lights and greasepaint. There are moments when you have no control over it, it takes control of you. Ones characters are part of ones unconscious but they do take control and you havent much say in the matter.13 His writing life was dotted with complaints of his characters keeping him awake at night. When he could not stop their dialogues, it was time to put them down on paper. The performance continued until the last words were written, with White as cast, director and audience in this theatre of the mind. In Basil Hunter, White came close to laying bare his own creative machinery. Hunter is not stuffed with theories and taste but builds his roles from flashes of intuition."

        "text": "12 Employer associations and industrial reactivity David Plowman Introduction There is a general consensus that employer associations are essentially reactive organisations. After reviewing the relevant literature touching upon this reactivity, this paper attempts to explain the reasons for such reactivity in the Australian context. It also seeks to suggest those situations which may induce a proactive approach on the part of employer associations. Industrial reactivity Employer associations are generally held to be reactive institutions. On first impression this view may appear to conflict with that developed in some of the literature and which posits that employer associations have been a major influence in determining the structure of collective bargaining for example, Flanders 1968, 1974 Fox 1967, 1975 Beaumont Gregory 1980 Ulman 1974 Clegg 1976, 1979 Donovan Commission 1967 Jackson 1977 Phelps Brown 1959 Adams 1981 Sisson 1986. The two views, however are not necessarily in conflict. Associations may be very active in developing a benign bargaining system, in neutralising the socialist objectives of unions, and in placing and maintaining parameters around that system. Within the confines of the system which has been developed, however, they may play a reactive role, leaving it to unions to initiate claims. Paradoxically, even when associations play a most active role in seeking to maintain, or to change in their favour, the existing bargaining structures or power relationships, they appear in a reactive light. For example, activities designed to maintain managerial prerogatives may be seen to be as reactive as the general lack of activity on, say, the wages front. Thus Shirom 1984, 299 has noted that employer associations tend to be reactive organisations, accommodating to the external changes confronting them they tend to be particularly reactive to the structure and distribution of political power in society. Reactive activity designed to maintain existing power relationships and bargaining structures is not essentially different from those activities which helped bring into existence those relationships and structures. Since the role of employer associations in determining bargaining structures in the Australian industrial relations system has been the topic of a separate paper Plowman 1988, activities on this front are briefly outlined in the next section of the paper. The major concern of this paper is to focus on employer association activity, or inactivity, within the established framework for determining employment conditions. It is necessary to define the way in which the terms reactive and proactive are used in this paper. By the first term is commonly meant activity in response to some stimulus for example, unions seek a wage increase, employers react by opposing such a wage increase. The term connotes not merely the fact that employer association activities may be responsive to external stimuli, but also that the response is passive and negatively defensive. Proactivity connotes three possible situations those in which employer associations take the initiative when confronted with external stimuli those in which they respond to union claims in a creative manner which enables them to wrest the initiative and those in which associations anticipate potential future contingencies and provide a mechanism for controlling the direction of change. Examples may help clarify the way in which the concept is used. An employer association approach at a National Wage Case of no way, no time, no how would be classified as reactive. It is not only responsive to union claims, but also negative and not constructive. A response, or an initiative, offering wage gains or other employment benefits in return for changed work practices or some other concession employers consider important, could be considered proactive. As evidenced below, the area of industrial democracy is one in which employers anticipated possible unionlegislative action and moved to provide terms of reference which suited their own ideology and needs a form of proactivity. The use of the terms in the above fashion does not mean that a consideration of employer associations as reactive institutions necessarily casts unions as proactive institutions. It is possible, indeed often probable, that both sets of institutions act in a reactive fashion. Thus both union activities designed to maintain real wages, and employer opposition to such activities, could be classified as reactive. Bargaining structures and bargaining processes The role of employer associations in determining bargaining structures may be examined under four headings their role in initiating or bringing into being bargaining relationships their role in shaping bargaining structures that is, in determining procedural rules their role in determining the level of bargaining enterprise, industry, nationwide and their role in limiting the range of issues the substantive rules over which bargaining may take place. Elsewhere it has been argued that dotted line the evidence suggests that Australian employer associations have had, at best, a negative influence upon bargaining structures dotted line They have influenced the nature and character of compulsory arbitration and arbitrationbargaining, not by setting out to shape these processes to their own ends, but rather by their reactive policy of legislation and litigation. The metamorphosis of compulsory arbitration into arbitrationbargaining has been, for the most part, the result of union initiatives and association reactivity. Plowman 1988 It has also been argued that the very existence of compulsory arbitration owes much to employer opposition and reactivity. In an environment in which Labor Parties had become a part of the legislative machinery, the refusal of employers to recognise the defeated unions, and their refusal to utilise voluntary arbitration machinery, drove parliaments to enforce union recognition and bargaining upon employers by way of compulsory arbitration. Thus, it is argued that the employers role in initiating bargaining structures in Australia has been minimal. It is contended that this generalisation is as true of manufacturing as of nonmanufacturing employers. Manufacturers initial support for New Protection gave way to opposition to arbitration once they discovered that protection could be obtained without any social welfare regime being attached to it. The High Court action which scuttled the New Protection legislation was undertaken on behalf of manufacturers. The evidence also suggests that on the second score, that of shaping bargaining structures, employer associations have played a minimal and largely negative role. At the federal level that negative role attempted to restrict as much as possible the scope of federal tribunal regulation Plowman Smith 1986. At the state level it was to restrict the powers of tribunal personnel and to seek the imposition of a legislative framework which, as far as was possible in the new regime of statutory unionism, replicated market forces Plowman 1988. It is argued that Labor governments were to the fore in shaping bargaining relationships and establishing new procedural rules in the preSecond World War period, and that the union movement and perhaps individual employers were to the fore in the postwar period. There is a body of literature see references in previous section which suggests that in other countries employer associations have been instrumental in determining the level of bargaining. In some countries Sweden being the most cited example associations have not only forced industrywide bargaining upon unions, but have also forced them to restructure craft unions into industry unions. In Australia, employers have not been successful in either forcing unions into an industry or an enterprise mould, nor in having the state impose singleunit bargaining. The evidence as to whether or not they ever tried to force occupationally based unions into either of these moulds is, at best, ambiguous.1 As in other areas of the bargaining relationship, Australian employers have, for the most part, reacted to their bargaining partners rather than attempted to modify them. This has resulted in a plethora of awards based on the occupations covered by competing unions. Some of these awards are federal, some state or regional, others enterprisebased. It is argued below that unions have had an overriding influence in determining the level of bargaining. Having been forced to accept unions and tribunal regulation, employers have been active, and successful, in ensuring that the arbitration machinery does replicate the classic bargaining compromise found in other countries union recognition in return for managements right to manage Sisson 1987, 1113. The evidence suggests that though associations appear to have been less concerned with, or able to influence, the structure and level of bargaining than their counterparts in other countries, they have been vitally concerned with restricting the scope of bargaining and preserving managerial prerogativesPlowman 1988. In summary, it is contended that contrary to Cleggs 1976 hypothesis and the European developments instanced by Adams 1981, Australian employer associations, having been forced to recognise unions, did not wrest the initiative and become the principal architects of bargaining structures. They have been responsive and reactive, rather than proactive, in shaping the bargaining structures within which employment conditions are determined. There is a high degree of unanimity within the industrial relations literature that, within established bargaining frameworks, employer associations are essentially reactive and adaptive institutions. The view of Armstrong are shared by other writers A commonly voiced but largely unheeded criticism of employers associations behaviour dotted line is that the bosses unions tend to react rather than act. By this is meant that an employers association waits to see what the unions will do. The association reacts when the unions have presented a wage claim. This lack of initiative by the employers associations may have the value of averting a sense of prior commitment which would prove embarrassing to some firms, but it also stultifies the shaping of bold imaginative policies on, for example, the establishment of a new wages structure for the industry, a framework productivity agreement, ambitious plans for a vastly improved disputes procedure and machinery for joint consultation. Armstrong 1984,65. Employer associations, in short, are not only a reaction to the emergence of unions and the employers need to come to some sort of accommodative arrangements with these organisations, but are essentially passive parties within the established framework of those accommodative arrangements. Clegg is one who places qualifications on such a view. He writes It is widely assumed, especially within employers associations themselves, that these associations were founded to protect their members from the growing power of the unions and because they could not get rid of unions, they were gradually forced to enter into dealing with them as a means of avoiding industrial conflict. The evidence would suggest, claims Clegg, that the hypothesis that employers associations developed as a reaction to the unions is partly, but only partly, correct. For one thing, dealing with labour problems is not the only motive for combination among employers. They also come together on commercial issues for example to fix prices and that cannot be excused as a response to trade union action Clegg 1979, 623. This line of argument is pursued by J.M. Farley, who, at the time of writing, was the Executive Director of the Printing and Allied Trades Employers Federation in New South Wales. Even those quite familiar with employer organisations, he writes, often harbour misconceptions about their nature which carries dotted line with it misleading implications that such organisations are negative and defensive in the very basis of their existence. He adds The misconception I have in mind is that employer organisations are purely reactionary bodies formed to counter the rising strength of unionism. Such belief is widespread yet has little basis in fact. Traders and manufacturers have been meeting together for purposes of their common good since time immemorable sic and the modern day associations in which they are now formed are the natural development of the guilds of former times. True, the growth of unionism has provided a spur to their growth and led many of them to emphasise industrial relations in their activities, but there is no more justification for saying that unionism gave birth to employer organisations than for arguing that cooperative action between the two developments has certainly taken place but the real truth of the matter is that both movements are part of the growing fabric of the industrial, economic, social and technological community in which we live. Farley 1967,12 Neither Clegg nor Farley would appear to have a strong basis for argument if one differentiates between employer associations and trade associations.2 Clegg appears to ackowledge this, but attempts to rescue the situation by pointing out that many employer associations also perform trade association functions. The dichotomy between the trade and industrial activities of employer organisations may provide a partial explanation for industrial reactivity the latter may be compensated by initiatives and activities on the trade front. However, Cleggs line of argument provides little explanation as to why some trade associations diversify into industrial relations and why, in certain industries, trade associations have chosen not to diversify and brought into being new organisations with a specifically industrial relations role. Nor does it explain why permanent, rather than evanescent, employer associations were formed. Thus, writing of employer associations in the British cotton industry, Turner notes It seems doubtful that the early employers combinations possessed sufficient cohesion to endure for long without the cementing pressure of union aggression. There is, in fact, much to suggest that conflicts of interests between different groups and firms prevented their associations attaining any stability Turner 1962, 371. Carpenters work on the rise of employer associations in New York City following the TaftHartley legislation is one of the few works which examines the responses of trade associations to changed bargaining relationships. Though some trade associations chose to take on employer association functions, there were many factors causing others to avoid doing so. His general findings are supportive of the reactive hypothesis Carpenter 1950, 2547 see also Shirom 1984, 301. In the Australian context employers have been seen as merely adopting a negative stance with respect to the demands of unions Dabscheck 1980, 216. Commenting on the findings of a major employer survey in Australia, I concluded that Few employer associations have clearly articulated industrial relations policies. Some associations claim to have no policies at all. In many others ad hoc policies are formulated to meet contingencies as they arise. Stability and harmounious relation and the maintaining of wage costs within economic capacity or productivity are the most frequently cited policies. Other policies include peace at all costs maintaining the status quo support for arbitration, indexation and moderate unions and good communications. For the most part industrial policies would appear to be defensive, reactive, poorly articulated and lacking in innovation. Explanations of association reactivity The reactive nature of employer associations is often taken as given, rather than as something which ought be explained. Two lines of explanation are posited in this paper that which sees employers able to compensate for union activities outside the formal industrial relations system, and that which identifies a number of features of the arbitration systems as predisposing associations to a reactive role."

        "text": "section A Q3 Pinochets model of socioeconomic change was based on free market ideology, which resulted in greater concentration of wealth in the upper classes and a decrease in living standards for the majority. Combined with continued repression these factors led to an increase in social opposition groups activity during the 1980s culminating in the 1990 election. The Reagan administration who had initially supported Pinochets rule, supported the election on the basis of their perception of Pinochets loss of control over Chilean society. The military coup of 1973 overthrew, Allende who was concerned with social reform. The coup was supported and assisted by the United States usgovernment, who continued to support Pinochet. The coup was brutal and a high level of terror was used for both political and economic reasons. Allende had encouraged popular participation which the military regime wanted to destroy to achieve a disciplined and weak work force as a prerequisite for their economic development model. The military regimes principal advisors were civilians and from the right. The major influence over their educators came from us educated economists known as the Chicago Boys who espoused free markets policies. The economic progress of Chile during Pinochets rule can be broken up into three periods. The first period of 197375 consisted of implementing free market policies and overturning Allendes social reform policies. Wages were frozen, constraints on investment were removed to encourage an increase in foreign investment, price subsidies were removed, there was an increase in privatisation, tariffs on imports were removed, compensation was paid to us companies whose copper interests had been expropriated among other measures. This period did not result in economic growth but lead to a recession in 1975, with an increase in unemployment and decreased industrial production. This period was unsuccessful even with substantial us government and international agency aid of us6 billion, however copper prices were low and oil prices were high from the oil shocks which contributed to failure. The second period from mid1975 to early 1980 consisted of the same policy approach but implemented at a more rigorous pace or shock treatment. This approach also failed, primarily because of limited foreign investment, domestic elites purchasing luxury goods instead of productive capital and an increased dependence on cash crops for export at a time of global recession. Pinochet borrowed from private banks which sent Chiles foreign debt rising. Wealth became increasingly concentrated at the upper levels. The lower middle and middle classes were adversely affected by these policies, small businesses were going bankrupt. It was this middle class which had been instrumental in the success of the coup. From 1984 to 1990 there was six years of sustained positive growth of 56 per annum. This was primarily the result of an increase in copper prices, a decrease in oil prices and an increases in the export of cash crops. However, with this growth the main beneficiaries were domestic and foreign capital. Poverty increased and income distribution worsened so by 1988, the richest 20 of Chile received 60 share of the national income while the poorest 20 received 4. 50 of Chiles population was living below the poverty line. So with this increased concentration of wealth and increased poverty during the 1980s and continued military repression and brutality, popular discontent grew. Even though Pinochet had outlawed left wing political parties in the 1980 constitution they continued to exist, usually underground. The broadbased opposition sprung from a number of groups who opposed the regime. The trade unions were the strongest, leading a number of strikes during the 1980s. The political parties consisted of the socialist party comprising of a moderate group and a more militant group, the Communist Party who had become militant and the Christian Democrats who were moderate. There were also community organisations primarily in the urban areas assisting the poor and there was the Catholic Church who opposed human rights abuses by the regime. These groups became increasingly active and hostile against the regime. By 1986 the right and centre split with the left and approached the regime to negotiate a political settlement. This grouped formed the Democratic Alliance ad whose leader by 1987 was Alywin. The us supported a transition to civilian rule as they saw an increasing economic crisis and social unrest which Pinochet didnt seem to be able to control. They wanted a negotiated agreement that was managed so they could secure the dominant classes or a party they could influence in power, and marginalise the left. They managed to achieve this, Alywin was from the right of ad. Pinochet managed to consolidate his power further on top of the powers he had secured in the 1980 constition. By 1990 there was much continuity in civilian rule due to the dominant position Pinochet managed to maintain. Economic policies continued, the military retained a three seat majority in the senate enabling it to influence civilian government policy. The military still has significant influence over all spheres of Chiles society. section c Q1 The 1979 revolution in Nicaragua occurred after an 18 month civil war that had left the economy in tatters. The Sandanista government had to contend with a weak economy, a world recession which they were vulnerable to, based on their agricultural economy, and us hostility. The Sandanistas were concerned with reconstructing the economy which meant a focus on increasing productivity as well as redistribution. It managed to achieve substantial social reforms in the early 1980s, as well as providing substantial incentives to the capital class which they saw as vital to restoring the economy. They were constrained by having to divert scarce resources into defence to fight a contrawar funded by the us. The contra war affected all their efforts as it targeted the economy to destabilise the government. The contrawar contributed significantly to the Sandanistas electoral defeat in The Sandanista government were primarily concerned to revitalise an economy which had suffered massive physical infrastructure damage and economic decline during the civil war. Somozas looting before he left the country also left the Treasury bankrupt. Sandanistas implemented moderate policies, they mainly expropriated property that had belonged to Somoza and his family, they left foreign capital alone, They installed moderate economic ministers into their cabinet. All these measures served to allay us fears. Carters policy was flexible and he felt the us could affect Nicaraguan policy through aid which is what the Sandanistas desparately needed. However, us policy changed with Reagan appointment in 1981, who was concerned with the uss decline as a world power. Reagan cut off aid to Nicaragua, the us convinced the international banks not to lend, they imposed trade embargos and funded a covert war from Honduras against the Sandanistas. These policies were detrimental to the Sandinistas but diff didnt bite until the the mid 1980s. From 1981 to 84 the Sandanistas managed to achieve significant social reforms in education, health and employment. They implemented significant land reforms from 1981 which benefited the rural landless. From 1985 the economy declined because they had difficulty in getting new loans, domestic investors who the Sandanistas had provided incentives to to invest remained hostile, refusing to invest and initiating slowdowns in factories. us hostility took affect, the economic blockade and the contra war created a situation where schools and clinics which were destroyed by the contras were unable to be rebuilt. The popular base of support for the Sandanistas was beginning to get worn down by the continuing. A major part of the Sandanistas funding had to go into defence which meant it operated on a war budget of austerity which led to a decrease in living standards for much of the population. Supporters became dissatisfied with government subsidies to the capitalist class while they suffered hardships. They also felt that the hardship was not evenly distributed perceiving the political leaders to be in a better position. It seems though that the population was primarily war weary and they didnt believe the Sandanistas could resolve Nicaraguas conflict with the us. The Sandanistas thought that the invasion of Grenada may help their prospects for the 1990 election which resulted from a peace process initiated by the Central American governments. However, many saw that the us was prepared to use force to maintain its interests in the region. So the population saw us policy as a principal cause of their plight but they felt that us policy would not change if the Sandanistas remained in power. If the opposition won the election people believed us policy would change because the us supported the opposition coalition uno, led by Mrs Chommorro. The reagan administration fo provided us26 million to the Chommorro campaign. In the context of a depressed economy and us hostile policy which further targeted an already weak economy to undermine the Sandanistas, us policy had a significant effect on the outcome of the 1990 election managing to override and subvert the Sandanistas development approach. Sandanista supporters were sufficiently impoverished and desiring of peace by 1990 that they voted for uno as the means to change us policy which they saw as the cause of their problems. The Sandanistas had sought a moderate approach to keep the us on side but this was rejected by the us. section D Q2 The 1959 Cuban Revolution, overthrew the repressive and corrupt Batista regime. It inherited an economy which was sugar dependent and us dependent and a society that was polarised. It mon Castros government managed to achieve significant and rapid social reform in the context of a hostile us reaction, which had far reaching consequences, during the 1960s. It encountered some serious setbacks during this period. From 1959 to 1961 there was rapid transformation and growth based on underutilised land, capital and labour. The policy was one of extensive nationalisation and redistribution of wealth and power to the working class. The government waged an major offensive against foreign ownership which was mainly us. By the beginning of 1962 the government needed new capital for further growth. us policy sufficiently hindered this, they tried to block Cubas access to funds, and they imposed a trade embargo on Cubas sugar. In 196263 the Cubans decided to shift the economy from one based on agriculture to industry. They perceived Cubas dependence on sugar as unhealthy. This industrialisation attempt failed because they could not get machinery from the us which meant they had to turn to the Soviet Union. Soviet Union machinery was inferior, expensive to transport to Cuba and also involved time delays. Also, Cuba needed to import this machinery, needing capital to do so. Its primary source of capital was sugar exports which had declined because Castro had decreased sugar production earlier. From 1964 on, the Cubans reverted back to an agricultural based economy of sugar. They were able to convince the Cuban population to do this due to their earlier redistributive successes. Looking at Castros achievements can be divided into two levels. The socioeconomic level can be considered to have been very successful. By implementing wide ranging land reforms which included government investment in roads and machinery the government managed to curb rural to urban migration, creating a stable rural environment and a decline in city slums. The Castros governments education policy made education available to everyone and changed the curriculum to one more suitable to an agricultural based economy. In health general practitioners increased over specialists and there was a significant turn around in this area which had the profoundest urbanrural inequality. During the 1950s 90 of Cubas doctors resided in the capital Havana. The Castro government managed to transform the general urbanrural inequality that had existed in Cuba. 2nd level overall econ perf The problems involved in their development program during the 1960s were numerous. The government lacked skilled personnel as managers and industrialists. The disaffected middle class had abandoned Cuba, leaving a gap, Castro hoped they could fill by training a new generation, without losing popular support. In these early years key posts went to loyal revolutionaries who were not necessarily skilled."

        "text": "THIRTYFOUR It was on. For real this time. The same arguments, over and over, day after day. It was long and vicious and exhausting. We drank heavily. We screamed at each other. We were two stray dogs, battling it out to the death over the bones of love. Cynthia was the aggressor. She fought it hard and fast and with increasing creativity and desperation. The drinking spurred her on. Between the cortisone and the alcohol, she was uncontrollable. She screamed, cried, attacked me with her fists, knives, scissors. She meant to keep me or finish me off for ever. My only goal was survival. I didnt ask her to leave. I didnt have the power or the will for it. Id made my one and only move. All I could do was ride the attack out and wait for her to tire. Vass looked at me strangely in the hallways. It was entertaining times for the old men. From time to time I took the car and fled for a few hours. I didnt know where to go. I didnt want to see Leo or Molly. Maree and Frank had their own difficulties. And Sophie was out of the question. I had only vague memories of what had happened at the party. It had the substance of a dream, a bad one. Where had all the hatred come from But at least I finally understood one part of the situation. And fucking had nothing to do with it. In the end I went and saw Rachel. She was good to me. I talked and she listened. You have to make Cynthia leave, she said. Make the break. Youre only making it worse for the both of you. It was sound advice. Useless advice. Rachel knew it. She had her own worries too. Shed started things up with a man and then hed shot through to Sydney. People were making a mess of things everywhere I looked. I went back to Cynthia. She was waiting. Where did you go I went and saw Rachel. Did you fuck her I dont want to fuck anyone. Im not going to let you do this, Gordon. You dont have the right. It was true, I didnt have the right. But this time I had the patience, and Cynthia was slowing down. Another week passed. We werent fucking, but we still slept side by side in the bed. There was nowhere else in the flat, only the couch, and it was too hard, too cold. It was worse for Cynthia. I had friends I could escape to, but there was no one for her. She called up some of her old people from Melbourne and Sydney, but they were a long way away. They couldnt understand. They didnt even know who I was. We went out drinking on Sunday afternoon with Frank. He was depressed. It was over between him and Maree. I suppose I should be happy, he said. I should feel like a butterfly thats just emerged from a fouryear cocoon. But I dont. I feel like a moth. I keep flying blindly into light bulbs. When the pub closed we caught a cab and had it drive by Franks place. He was staying at his parents house. It was his first night away from Maree. He got out. Cynthia looked at me. Im going with Frank, she said. Okay, I said. She got out. Frank looked at her. The cab took me away. I arrived back at the flat. I was alone. The house was quiet. I went to bed. Cynthia woke me up about midday. She was stroking my hair. Ive been watching you sleep, she said. Youre still beautiful when youre asleep. I can imagine that you still love me. I curled up around her hips. She was warm. Howd it go with Frank It was good. Do you feel any better A little. I feel sad. I think Ill always feel sad. We sat there. For the next three days it was good. The anger had run out. We were tired. It was over. And the love was still left there. Not enough, but some. Then a letter arrived for Cynthia. It was from the Tax Department. It was her refund. It was four or five months late. Four hundred dollars. I asked her, Whatll we do with it Cynthia looked at the cheque. She said, I guess Ill get a plane ticket. THIRTYFIVE Id won. THIRTYSIX Next day Cynthia rang around the airlines and booked herself on a standby ticket. It was due in two weeks. She was flying to Darwin. To her parents place Why not Sydney, I said, or Melbourne Its where all your friends are. I dont want friends. I just want somewhere where I havent got to worry about living, where someone will look after me. All I want is sleep. I dont want to work, I dont want to see anyone. Im tired, Gordon. I know. Im sorry. Its been terrible. Youre not sorry enough. Youll never be sorry enough. The two weeks went by. Cynthia quit work. She called her parents. She went through all her clothes, sorting out the warm stuff. She wouldnt need it in Darwin. Darwin was never cold. If I leave some of this stuff here, will you look after it Can you do that I said I could. What if I come back, Gordon I know you think its over, but its not over for me. I still love you. I said nothing. God, she said, whos going to look after you Whos going to pick your blackheads Youll get sick. Youll get ugly. She was crying. Her flight was on a Tuesday. On our last Saturday night together we went out to see some bands that were playing at Easts Leagues Club. Wed spent the day trying to track down some acid. We wanted a big finish. One last time. No one had any acid. Instead, we arrived at Easts early and concentrated on drinking. Drinking could be almost as good sometimes, if you did it right. The support band started up. Cynthia lost herself in the crowd. I wandered around and drank and occasionally ran into people I knew. Suddenly there was Darren. His face was red and sweating and smiling. Hey man, he said. Youre tripping. Yep dotted line Whered you get it Theres a guy here, selling. Is he still around I dont know. Look, Ive got one tab left. Ive already had four. Four I know. Im losing it. Ill sell you the last one. The thing is I need two. One for Cynthia. Ive only go the one. Just take it yourself. She wont even know. Shed know. I couldnt. Wow. Thats dedication. Its caution. She wouldnt do the same for you. Shed take it. Maybe. I cant, though. Well, Ill look around for the guy, okay If I see him Ill come get you. Okay. Thanks. Very much. He made off. Four tabs. He looked like he was about to die. I wandered on, found a table down near the back and sat on it, watching the crowd. Cynthia was in there somewhere, up the front. For a support, the band didnt seem too bad. Fifteen or twenty minutes later they were finished and Cynthia came back through the crowd. She saw me, came over. I just saw Darren up the front. she said. Yeah He offered me a tab. Twenty bucks. Whatd you say I said yes please. What else would I say But then he said no, he wouldnt give it to me. He said I should talk to you. I think he was just trying to prove a point. She looked at me. I didnt explain. Ten minutes later Darren showed up with the dealer. We bought our tabs and settled into the night. The acid was good, and so was the music. Loud and hard and purging. Cynthia disappeared up the front again for most of the night. I prowled around the back, getting off on the crowd, watching them sway. I could understand their movements, I could grasp the mass consciousness that drove them. But I wasnt part of it. I was elated and alone. I would always be alone. Then the band wrapped it up, the crowd screamed and the lights came on. Cynthia fought her way back. Her eyes were wild, she was wet with communal sweat. Whys it over she yelled at me. Why is it fucking over I am only one man, Cynthia, I said. I have no say in this. She was pure hatred. Get away from me And she was off again, darting across the floor. She was crazy. I went after her. We caught a bus home. There were no seats. Cynthia and I stood in the aisle and raved at each other. She was angry, I was angry, we werent even hearing each other. The acid was peaking. Looking out the window I couldnt see where we were. Cynthia screamed, This bus is taking us to HELL People looked at her. This bus is full of SHITHEADS People looked away. Cynthia was genuinely scared. Where are we, Gordon On our way home. Dont lose me, okay. I wont. You know what you are she said, profoundly. What You are a mild person. Is that good or bad Its nice. Youre nice. That is bad. No. She sounded weary. In the end, nice is all you want. We got off in the Valley and walked home along Brunswick Street. We stopped off in a bistro for coffee, then hamburgers and chips and coke. We hadnt eaten for what seemed a long time. Leo and Molly were waiting for us in the flat. They were drinking and smoking. Molly came up and looked in my eyes. You guys are tripping Yes, but its no good without alcohol. Fortunately we had plenty. Around five a.m. Leo and Molly got tired and set up a bed on the carpet. Cynthia and I went to our own bed. We werent tired, the acid probably wouldnt let us sleep for hours yet. We sat on the bed. Cynthia attached my zip and got my penis out. I was listening. Theyre fucking in there, I said Cynthia listened too. Are you two fucking in there she yelled. It sounds like youre fucking There was no answer. The noises stopped. We looked at my penis. Her hand was playing with it, it was growing. Itd been a good night. It was no time to bring it all up again. It wasnt worth the pain. And Cynthia would only be with me for three more nights dotted line Okay, I said, jump on. Lets do it. She started tugging off my jeans. We made it noisy. We threw everything into it. All the hatred and sorrow. All the violence we had left. And it was good. We knew what to do. We fell out of the bed, fucked on the floor, pumped and squeezed and pounded eachother, contorted, climbed back into bed, bit, strangled dotted line and in the end, I was on top. Her legs were up around my shoulders. I love you, Cynthia screamed, God I fucking love you. I came. I collapsed over her. I didnt say anything. I couldnt say anything. I bit into her neck. We held each other there. My prick shrunk away. Pulled out. I rolled off. Did you hear that Cynthia yelled, for Leo and Molly. Even the mild one can make more noise than you Keep it down, Cynthia. But she was laughing. The mild one, I called you the mild one, didnt I. Mild One, I think I love you. She kept on laughing. We both laughed. It was true. Leo cried out from the next room. Will you shut the fuck up. But we couldnt. Not yet. THIRTYSEVEN The next afternoon was bad. I woke up to asthma and vomiting."

        "text": "PLANNING AHEAD PREPARATION AND PLANNINGIt sounds easy decide on a destination and just go. However, by being impulsive some of the enjoyment of a tour, as well as time to iron out any problems, will be missed were talking about the planning stage. For a long trek, planning will begin months before the trip itself maps and brochures will be spread out, destinations marked, lists made, full of possibilities. The shorter tours in this book, all based on capital cities, need less planning. However, the principles of fourwheel drive touring remain the same, and the first consideration is the condition of the road or track you want to use. Obviously there is no point planning a trip on a road under metres of snow or water or recently ravaged by bushfire. Even if your aim is to turn straight to the treks around Australia, you need to know that what you want to achieve is possible. Read the trip notes carefully. Estimate the journey, short or long, on a large map of Australia, or use our road maps. Taking into consideration the degree of difficulty and the distances to be travelled, estimate an average speed and check that each section of the trip is possible within a realistic time frame for you. Being pushed for time over distance could mean inappropriate speeding and possible trouble. Join your state motoring body and obtain relevant numbers for interstate affiliates in case of emergency breakdowns. Members have reciprocal rights with interstate organisations around Australia. Supplement our route directions by using the following contacts to obtain uptodate background information about the chosen trip and state tourist bureau, motoring organisation and fourwheel drive association are detailed. Bear in mind that there are regional tourist offices, as well as local, more specialised fourwheel drive clubs, so ask for the specific information you require when contacting central office. PERMITS AND REGULATIONSKeep in mind as you travel that even the most desolatelooking land is under someones care. This may mean that permits andor permissions need to be obtained before you can camp or fish. If you plan to stay in or travel through national or state park areas check our introductions to the trip notes as well as with the controlling body in question. General rules, regulations and restrictions apply within these parks covering fourwheel drive access, camping, water, wood collection, fires, pets, hunting and fishing. Equally, if you plan on trekking across designated Aboriginal Land you must obtain permission. In Queensland, notification of a route, time of travel and preferred campsite to the appropriate local Aboriginal council as you travel is all that is required but Aboriginal councils in other states issue a permit for a specific journey. It is best to telephone before taking to the road to find out exact requirements for these states. Permits can take up to 6 weeks to process, so preplanning here will prevent frustration or disappointment. The following list contains the addresses of the national parks controlling body in each state ask for specific regional information if you already know where you would like to go. Also listed are the contacts for Aboriginal Land permits where relevant. WHEN TO GOWeather conditions if making a short tour out of a capital city or the seasons if you are setting out on a longer trek are the next consideration. For example, Australias north should not be attempted in the wet season NovemberMay. Remember too that heavy rain will raise creek and stream levels and may render them impassable snow in highland areas makes roads and tracks unsuitable and very hot weather gives a good reason to bypass the deserts. You must take weather and seasons into account when planning. Local media provide precise forecasts, often up to 4 days in advance. However, you can phone recorded information services for weather checks outside your area. The weather on a trip of any length will help you decided what you must take. Cold weather requires more gear than warm weather, as bulky sleeping bags and extra clothing are needed. This must not mean that recovery gear is jettisoned. WHAT TO SEEThis is an absolutely personal piece of planning, to be linked with the where and when to go, as well as who is travelling with you. Set your trip limits not necessarily distance, but what the journey will entail in time and anticipated enjoyment to fit your available time and money there is no point in deciding its Melbourne to Cape York and back in three weeks. Another consideration is what you may find happening along your route. Depending upon your interests, your local contacts may give information about shows, events and competitions in your area of enjoyment. However, most towns and regions throughout Australia hold sporting competitions, regattas and rodeos, arts and craft and trade exhibitions, agricultural and flower shows, music festivals and such events annually. Details are available from tourism outlets in each state. Refer back to the beginning of this chapter and write to or telephone the tourist office of your destination state as well as check through the trip notes of the journey you plan on taking, to ask for advice to be forwarded about what there is to see on the way and nearby, both natural and manmade attractions. MAPS AND NAVIGATIONMaps and guides are an essential part of fourwheel drive touring. Pack them so that they are easily accessible during a driving day in a waterproof, preferably clear plastic cover, with pencil, notebook, ruler and possibly a pocket calculator. In the routes we refer to the road maps at the end of this book, and our simple sketch maps will get you to the start and end points of trips. However, you should supplement these with the suggested local guides and, most importantly, topographic maps. We have listed national parks office addresses they will help with specific maps and information for parks under their control. Tourism offices will usually post brochures and touring maps on request. Check that information is current the date it is printed and this applies to maps also. Dont discount general stores, newsagents and pubs as sources of uptodate information when you are travelling through an area. Fourwheel drive tracks are notoriously subject to change. Topographic maps, which show largely unchanging geographic features, are helpful navigation aids. We strongly recommend them for outback and remote areas the larger the scale the better. Australia is now covered by the Auslig 1250 000 and 1100 000 series, in printed maps and compilation sheets, and there is an excellent index sheet showing the areas covered by each map. State mapping authorities also publish maps on a larger scale which are useful for the shorter tours and will add to your fun by pointing up physical features. Australian Geographic magazine produces excellent maps available through retail outlets. For enquiries write to P.O. Box 321, Terry Hills, NSW Spend some time reading and interpreting the information on your maps before you venture into a remote area like the Simpson Desert, or even onto a winding forest track closer to home. Note both natural features, such as hills, mountains, rivers, forests, and also constructed landmarks such as roads, towns and railways crossings. Also, by understanding contours, which show the shape of the ground, you will be able to read your topographic maps and understand the immediate landscape much better. You should also be able to read grid references in case you need to let others know where you are. Topographic maps have directions for plotting a point on the margin. We strongly recommend you invest in an inexpensive guide like Gregorys Four Wheel Drive Handbook, for detailed instructions on map reading before setting out. If you have around 2000, you can purchase your own personal, handheld navigation tool to determine the latitude, longitude and altitude of wherever you are. It utilises the Global Positioning System, a 24satellite system encircling the earth. Signals from the four nearest satellites help to determine your position. The tiny instrument fits comfortably in the palm of a hand and it doesnt need fitting the antenna however should be mounted on the car roof. There is a 12volt power supply included, and there are now several brands available. Enquire at electrical retailers and communications specialists. A TRIAL RUNAlthough it is exciting to plan a wonderful trip, especially a longer trek, the journey will entail a complete lifestyle change. Lets face it, a fourwheel drive home for an extended time means compromise, so how much compromise How does it all fit together If you are not yet committed to a vehicle, consider renting a vehicle similar to that which you are considering buying. You will never be able to set it up, prepare it and be as certain of its maintenance as you would be with your own vehicle, but it is an ideal stepping stone into the experience of fourwheel driving and to understanding the needs of your travelling companions. A trial short tour for, say, a weekend before setting out on anything longer, is certain to sort out many queries, including whether you will be tenting the whole way, taking a trailercamper or even a fullsized caravan with you. See the section on towing for more discussion about these options. TRAVELLING WITH CHILDRENChildren, whether infants, toddlers or schoolage, need special consideration. If it is to be a long trek, schooling must be weighed up. For primary school children the first step is to talk to the childs teacher and principal, who may well advise that each child make a daily journal of the trip. Into a scrapbook will go weather reports, admission tickets, pressed flowers, photos, postcards or drawings plus a little description of the days events. Be careful not to edit, it needs to be the childs experiences. For older children, further discussion may be needed regarding correspondence schooling or taking along work. Most children are good travellers, and consider every trip an adventure. Remember that this will be a highlight of your childs life. They will be overexcited and, as the long car trips add up, could get bored. Again, planning will save the day by easing the strain on all. Before setting out make a list of dos and donts for the children and explain seriously why their cooperation is necessary. Make it quite clear that these are safety issues and you expect them to observe the rules at all times. Reinforce this message at the time of departure. Your list will be your own, but here are a few points to get the ball rolling. arrow Do not fight or yell loudly while the car is moving as it distracts the driver. This could cause a collision and bring the holiday to an abrupt end. arrow Do not play with door handles or locks. Set childproof locks on rear doors before departure. arrow Do not lean out of windows ever. Head, hands and arms are to be kept inside the car. arrow Do not unbuckle seat belts or restraints while the car is in motion. Although your main concern will be to keep the children happy during the car trip, it is also important to take along some games, such as Snakes and Ladders, Monopoly, Pictionary or Scrabble and a pack or two of cards, to keep everyone amused around the camp fire, in the tent or caravan. Older children may work on their diaries and younger ones will love a rubber ball and skipping rope to play outdoors without annoying everyone else in the campsite. PETSFourlegged friends need to be found a reliable, comfortable homeawayfromhome while you are travelling. That is, unless you are prepared to be turned away from a large percentage of caravan parks and national parks. Dogs and cats chase native birds and wildlife. Check with friends for good kennels and catteries and take time to visit the shortlist to check the facilities then book your pet in for the holiday of their life."

        "text": "Video CASSETTE recorders table table We put the cheapies to the test and found they all performed well and one of the very cheapest is among the best. Video cassette recorders are fast becoming as ubiquitous as television sets. According to our market research, more than half of Australian households already own a VCR and use it for an average of six hours a week. The technology and design of VCRs are developing rapidly, which means the major brands update and supersede their models about once every 12 months. Whats on the market The market for VCRs is divided into three distinct segments. At the top of the range, priced 900 and up, are the fourhead longplay models with extra features such as hifi, with a true stereo tuner and digital effects. More basic fourhead models are in the middle of the range, available for around 800The advantage of a fourhead machine is that you can record twice as much material as on a twohead VCR, using the same amount of tape, but at the expense of picture quality. The 14 models we tested were all from the lower end of the market basic twohead models with remote control, priced less than 700 except the panasonic, which has three video heads the third head makes no difference to record and playback quality, only to the quality of effects such as still frame. All the brands with models in this market segment available at the time of testing were included. How we tested Each model was put through a range of technical and comparative tests, and assessed on its audio and video performance, radio frequency RF sensitivity, and how easy it is to use. To test the sound and picture quality, we compared material recorded on a highquality tape from an offair TV broadcast to the same material received directly through a TV set. All models performed adequately. The panasonic produced the best picture quality, but was only slightly ahead of the akai and sanyo units. All three gave a good copy of the original material with little noticeable noise or graininess. We also measured the minimum RF signal strength necessary at the aerial input to produce a good picture. This is an important factor if you live in a poor reception area where signal strength is generally low. All models produced acceptable results. The panasonic came out the worst, but this would only be a problem if you lived in an area with poor reception. To assess how easy each VCR was to use, we looked at the front panel controls, the remote control unit, some of the features and the instructions. Except for some minor problems, all models were relatively easy to use. The sanyos instruction booklet was a bit confusing in places, while the akai, panasonic and the sharp achieved the highest score in this area. The akai and the sharp offered the greatest range of features overall see Features table on page Apart from the panasonic, which had a particularly easy programming feature, all models were equally easy to program. As well as normal programming from the control panel or the remote, the panasonic uses a barcode scanner built into its remote control. It comes with a chart listing barcodes for start and stop times, TV channels, the days of the week, and month and year, allowing you to program this information without having to press a lot of buttons you simply run the scanner lightly over the right code. Some TV guides now list the barcodes photo caption table photo for some programs. We found programming from these guides to be not as easy as from the card supplied by panasonic. Also, if you use these guides, its possible that the little hole on the tip of the scanner will get clogged with newspaper particles, preventing the scanner from reading the information. This problem is easily fixed just clean out the hole with a little paintbrush. If the problem recurs, you are probably rubbing the scanner across the codes harder than you need to. Its not even necessary to touch the paper just flick the scanner over the code from left to right. New technology Of the 14 models we tested, none performed poorly and six are recommended. The other eight are rated acceptable. The basic differences between the recommended and the acceptable models is one of refinement. Those rated acceptable seem to be essentially the same as models that were on the market a few years ago, with only cosmetic differences such as a new chassis style or a differentlooking front panel. The models that are recommended, on the other hand, have been improved in terms of technology and design, and new or more advanced features have been incorporated. features If youre in the market for a video there are plenty of models that will give you good performance. So how do you choose between them Along with price, one way is on the basis of the features they offer. What features will actually be useful to you will depend on how you use the VCR. Some people do a lot of recording taping latenight movies to watch at a more civilised hour, or The Bill when the spouse insists on watching Murder, she wrote. If this sounds like you, good programming and indexing features will make your VCR easier to use. If you think youll be watching the films borrowed from the video shop these features will be less important than, say, auto tracking see below. Still vertical adjustment All the models we tested allow you to pause the tape and freeze the picture. Some also have a preset control that allows you to adjust the vertical shudder sometimes associated with video still frames. Usually it will only need to be set once, to adjust the compatibility of the VCR with your TV set. Still frame advance All models except the videopro allow you to advance the picture one frame at a time. This feature can also be used to eliminate the noise bars sometimes associated with video stills. Slow motion play Allows you to play back in slow motion. Of the models that have this feature, only the panasonic has variable speed the others are at a fixed speed. Auto tracking This feature automatically adjusts the tracking to the optimum level every time you play a video. This means aligning the recorded magnetic table information on the tape with the heads of the VCR, like fine tuning. Tracking is sometimes a problem when youre playing tapes not recorded on your own VCR. Without this feature you would adjust the track manually. Index search Some models have an indexing feature that places markers on the tape when you begin recording. This is a useful feature if you record several programs on the one tape. You can then quickly find the start of each program by using the index search to go directly to these markers. The models with this feature see Table 3 also have a feature called intro scan, which fastwinds to the first index mark and plays a few seconds of tape so you can see whats on it, then fastwinds to the next mark and repeats the process. It will do this for all the index marks on the tape till you find what youre looking for. Channel skip Channel skip lets you move directly between preset channel positions with the updown buttons, skipping over unused channel positions. This would be a useful feature if you didnt have a numeric keypad on your remote control for direct channel access. It should be useful even if you do, particularly if you do a lot of flipping between channels. Counter type All models have a counter that counts either elapsed time or an arbitrary unit tape length. Both types are easy to use, but a time counter could be more useful as it would show you how much time you have left on you tape when recording. Timer scan This feature works with elapsedtime counters and allows you to select a particular time on the counter and fastwind to it. Its another way of finding a particular section of tape quickly. Number of timer programs and advance program time All models can be preprogrammed to record at specific times, but differ in the number of events that can be programmed between four and eight and the length of time you can program in advance, which varies from 14 days to a year. Quick program This feature allows you to program the VCR to record something within the next 24 hours without having to enter all the usual program details day, month and so onyou just enter the time and channel. All the models we tested have this feature, but on some it is limited to stop time only. On these models you would have to start the recording manually and then use the quick program feature to enter the stop time useful, for example, if you wanted to go out or to bed before the program you were watching finished. Even more useful are the other models, where the quick program feature allows you to enter a start time within the next 24 hours and a program length. Remote control features The remote control with the most features is not necessarily the most useful one to you. Again, this will depend on how you use your VCR. The features included in the table are the ones we considered would be useful to most people. Direct channel access Most models have a numeric keypad on the remote, so you can access a channel by pushing the right numbered button. Without this feature you have to use the updown arrows to move between channels. Remote program Allows you to program the VCR on the remote control unit. All models with this feature have pushbutton programming, and the panasonic also has a barcode scanner see How we tested on page 50 for more details. LCD display Some models have a liquid crystal screen on the remote control unit which displays programming information. making it easier to enter and check the information youve programmed. Other features not included in Table 2 A great variety of features is available too great to fit in our table. The following are some additional features which might interest you. RF test signal The akai, panasonic, videopro and sharp models provide a radio frequency test signal, which is convenient when you first tune the TV set into the video channel. It allows you to tune without having to play back a prerecorded tape. Fast transport search All the models we tested allow you to fast forward and rewind while viewing the tape, to locate a particular scene or part of a program. Most models have one speed only, except the akai, necs and teacs, which provide variable speeds. Autoplay and autorewind All models automatically rewind the tape when it finishes playing. All but the toshibas, teacs and the videopro start playing automatically when you insert a tape with the record tab removed. Auto power on On older VCRs you had to switch from standby to power on before you used them. On all the models we tested this time, this happens automatically when you insert a tape. Child lock The akai and the sharp models have a feature that enables the control settings to be locked so they cant be changed accidentally. On the akai, the child lock only operates when the VCR is in play mode. Zero return On all models except the akai you can automatically rewind to the zero count position by using the zero return feature. This can be useful if you set the counter to zero at the start of a recording. Display features All models have a lit panel display, including a digital clock showing real time, channel number, tape count, programming information and transport status. On the two toshiba VCRs the transport status display was limited to play, record and pause."

        "text": "35 Weeroona Ave Elanora 2101 94 The Chairman, Trade Practices Commission, 77 Castlereagh Street SYDNEY 2000 re NRMA advertising use of the words FREE SHARES Dear Sir, I note with satisfaction yesterdays report of your success in action against the NRMA for misleading advertising. However the outcome is probably too late for many members who would have already voted under the mistaken belief that a Yes vote was necessary to be eligible for shares if the proposal received majority support. There is another, more serious breach which is central to the whole issue the carrot dangled by NRMA Holdings to have their proposal passed. That is the false statement repeated again again in the prospectus advertising that the shares are free. The Concise Oxford Dictionary provides the definition of free copy attached. Reference No. 3 appears to be the appropriate one which gives what would be the understanding of the word in trade commerce in normal everyday usage is therefore relevant to the circumstances. Free is defined by the Concise Oxford as spontaneous,unforced, unearned, gratuitous, willing free gift the appropriate example is given as not in requital requite make return for give in return. Willing defined as not reluctant, cheerfully ready could not be regarded as relevant in this case may be discarded. We must look to page 12 of the Prospectus under legal steps to discover the true transaction for which members are asked to vote. It appears to be the only reference does not appear under the heading The Proposal where it aught to be. On page 12 it states that members other than NRMA Holdings agree to give up their membership of the Association NRMA Insurance on condition that FREE SHARES are offered by NRMA Holdings the underlining is mine A consideration C.Oxford in return for is thus required for the shares the use of the words free shares is erroneous should be replaced by words such as shares without further cost or conditions The further use of the word free as a prefix to the word shares wherever it appears in the prospectus advertising is therefore grossly misleading seems deliberately so. To give up their membership in return for shares is a very real cost endows the remaining shareholder, NRMA Holdings if an association can remain a legal entity with one member with all the vast wealth of the Association, comprising assets including substantial amounts of cash the business goodwill of the Association its subsidiaries. In the minds of members the cash is particularly real, being available to be returned to members without tax by way of lower fees premiums. Additional costs also involved would be money lost to the Government in taxes to which members were not previously subject, particularly capital gains tax on the sale of shares. This is perhaps a side issue so far as misleading advertising is concerned by still an important one. The prospectus has a duty to report highlight the situation as it exists not as it may wish it to be. Until guaranteed assurance is received from both Government the Senate that tax relief will be given, the highlighting of TAX A FAVOURABLE OUTCOME Prospectus page 13 again appears to constitute misleading advertising. Returning to the definition of free we must ask whether the issue of shares in NRMA Holdings to members of the Association is spontaneous, unforced, unearned or gratuitous. The answer to each is No Unless the members agree in a majority to surrender their membership consequently their association with all its wealth to NRMA Holdings no shares will be issued to them. The shares are therefore not free or freely issued but issued only in return for the fulfilment of a prearranged condition. The Prospectus is therefore false misleading as is the advertising, particularly when used out of context. I believe that the advertising should cease immediately that the Prospectus should be withdrawn as being an illegal document. Your urgent attention to this critical matter would be appreciated. Yours faithfully, Keith Groves E.K.GROVES Copy to Australian Securities Commission 35 Weeroona Ave Elanora 2101 94 The Chairman, Australian Securities Commission Level 18, 610 OConnell Street Sydney 2000 re NRMA Holdings Ltd Prospectus Dear SirMadam, I refer to my letter of The bias misrepresentation of the Prospectus is now being exacerbated by what is surely false advertising. The advertising, continually urging members to reply immediately before open debate opposition can emerge with a yes vote in return for free shares is making a mockery of the process of due consideration decision. We are being railroaded into acceptance. The shares in NRMA Holdings are of course not free. They will be only issued subject to the condition that the members will pay compensation by giving up the vast assets business goodwill of their association its subsidiaries. Fair advertising should prompt the members to consider the proposal options to have replies lodged by 12th October as shown for meeting all deadlines. However, I believe the situation has now developed too far to be corrected. Too many members have already been influenced by the misrepresentation bias many have already voted. I believe that there is now no alternative but to void the present process until the members are properly fully informed a new balanced Prospectus is prepared, presenting all the facts preferably with input from others with opposing views. Yours faithfully, Keith Groves E.K.GROVES Copy to Trade Practices Commission 35 Weeroona Ave ELANORA NSW 2101 15th September, 1994 The Chairman, Australian Securities Commission, Level 18 610 OConnell Street SYDNEY NSW 2000 re NRMA Holdings Ltd Prospectus Dear SirMadam, I have today received a copy of the NRMA Holdings Ltd Prospectus. Also received today is a leaflet issued by Save Our Motorists Organisation Group, Inc, copy attached. As a matter of urgency would you please reexamine the suitability of the Prospectus. It appears to be unsatisfactory in the following areas 1 Referring to the shares as free is grossly misleading. The members of the NRMA are presently the owners of their Association. This is reflected in the anticipated tax treatment of the cost base of each FREE SHARE prospectus page 87. The true situation is that the members of the NRMA are being asked to sell their wholly owned Association complete with assets to NRMA Holdings Ltd in exchange for cash or shares and this essential fact is not made clear by the Prospectus. 2 The treatment of other options Prospectus page 11 is glossed over. There is little substance in the statements made, no supporting information for conclusions reached and less than one page out of 100 devoted to this most important of all considerations in deciding whether to sell the Association. None of the very real dangers and disadvantages are addressed and by their omission the Prospectus is open to a charge of dishonesty and deception. 3 The reference to NRMA takeover Prospectus page 15 also seems to have a hidden and unexplained agenda. Why do the Articles of NRMA Holdings prohibit the owning of 5 or more of shares only up to 1st January, 2000 Why not indefinitely The reference appears designed to alleviate any fears of future takeover when in fact it should be disclosing the opposite possibility. Overall the Prospectus appears to be an attempt to tell only part of the truth and even then to mislead. In emphasizing the deception of free shares and not giving fair and proper treatment to the other options there appears to be an attempt to coerce the members into a rash decision to sell without disclosing the full truth. It is a shabby treatment of the members and your urgent and diligent action to review and rectify the matter would be appreciated together with an early reply. Yours faithfully, Keith Groves E.K. GROVES P.S. Also of concern is the future proposal Prospectus page 91 to give interest free loans to the staff of NRMA Holdings for the purchase of shares, the loans being repaid out of dividends. This represents a continuous share price support of approximately 46,000,000 and perhaps creating a continuous demand for shares. Copies to The Premier of NSW The Leader of the Opposition The Attorney General Media various 35 Weeroona Ave ELANORA 2101 Attn ACA The NRMA Takeover by NRMA Holdings Ltd A Thought for Future Generations Through the forsight of a band of motorists at the beginning of the age of motoring we have inherited a successful, wellfunded Association which operates for the common good of all motorists is open to anyone who wishes to pay the nominal fee join. Indeed, it takes a brave or foolish motorist not to be a member most are. A number of generations have been wellserved by the Association. But now the current Board of Directors proposes a coup in which this generation seizes the lot for ourselves We steal the family silver. Future generations of motorists will the have to pay a premium to us for their road service, insurance or other services provided by our company. If we chose we may sell our shares to the highest bidder whoever it may be We auction the family silver. The Board is asking us to take this selfish action, which is morally wrong more than sufficient reason for refusing their direction, even without the other sound commercial reasons. Would we allow our Councils to divyup our Botanic Gardens, our domain, our parks or our beaches in the same way The Association is not ours to confiscate dispose of as we please. It belongs to the past, present future generations of motorists. Keith Groves E.K.GROVES 35 Weeroona Ave ELANORA 2101 95 The Secretary, NRMA Limited Dear Ms Conway, Thank you for forwarding a copy of the Independent Experts Report on Proposed Demutualisation. I would have been happier if the terms of reference included a specific request to consider what changes could be made to the mutual organisation or its articles of association to overcome any perceived problems in its current or future operations. The report states that the NRMA Group is run as a business enterprise has been for many years. Management the board focus on profit as well as service. It is a very successful business enterprise. As such would it not be preferable to ask what adjustments, if any, need to be made to maintain the success, without slaying the goose. We would then be able to compare a best possible mutual not merely the status quo with an alternative corporate organisation. This shortcoming is further exacerbated when primary arguments for retaining a mutual are summarily dismissed as in the case of it has been announced that premium rebate arrangements will terminate whether or not NRMA Insurance is demutualised and Increases in membership subscriptions dotted line These increases are expected whether or not the NRMA Group is converted to a listed company. I realise that these matters are more fully discussed later in the Report but it is undesirable that conclusions could be influenced by such announcements further debate perhaps inhibited. In regard to the membership subscriptions, the statement that increases are required to return the Association to break even or modest profit page 5 contradicts the advice on the previous page that as expenses exceed the income this would create a net tax deduction for the NRMA Group ie as a corporation. Would there not also be a possibility that a modest profit from the road service monopoly in the hands of a corporation might change to a reasonable profit, or even an appropriate or realistic one There would be few members courageous enough to desert the road service would still serve as an introduction to insurance other services which could be expected to bear userpay fees. I believe that most members regard the NRMA as a conservative organisation looking to the long term interests of its members, both present future."

        "text": "1 My name is Tristan Smith. I was born in Chemin Rouge in Efica which is to say as much to you, I bet, as if I declared I was from the moon. And yet if you are going to make much sense of me, you have to know a little of my country, a country so unimportant that you are already confusing the name with Ithaca or Africa, a name so unmemorable it could only have been born of a committee, although it remains, nonetheless, the home of nearly three million of the earths people, and they, like you, have no small opinion of themselves, have artists and poets who are pleased to criticize its shortcomings and celebrate its charms, who return home to the eighteen little islands between the tropic of Capricorn and the 30th parallel, convinced that their windswept coastline is the most beautiful on earth. Like 98 per cent of the planets population, we Eficans may be justly accused of being provincial, parochial, and these qualities are sometimes magnified by your habit of hearing Ithaca when we say Efica. If I say Voorstand to you, that is a different story entirely. You are a citizen of Voorstand. You hold the red passport with the phases of the moon embossed in gold. You stand with your hand over your heart when the Great Song is played, you daily watch new images of your armies in the vids and zines. How can I make you know what it is like to be from Efica abandoned, selfdoubting, yet so wilful that if you visit Chemin Rouge tomorrow morning we will tell you that the year is 426footnote marker and you must write your cheques accordingly. If you were my students I would direct you to read Efica from penal colony to welfare state,footnote marker The Caves of Democracy,footnote marker and Volume 3 of Wilburs The Dyers Cauldron.footnote marker But you are not my students and I have no choice but to juggle and tapdance before you, begging you please sit in your seats while I have you understand exactly why my heart is breaking. 2 My maman was one of you. She was born in Voorstand. She was able to trace her family back to the Settlers Free of the Great Song. Had things been different I might have been a Voorstander, like you, and then there would have been no trouble. But when my maman was eighteen she came to Chemin Rouge to be a model in a fashion advertisement. She became famous, within Efica, for her role in a local soap opera, and then she was notorious as a founder of the Feu Folletfootnote marker Collective, a small radical theatre group which was always in trouble with our local authorities for its opposition to the country of her birth. Let us say it straight Felicity Smith was very critical of her own people. It was because of this, she changed her name from Smutts to Smith she did not want to be a Voorstander. She was outraged at the way Voorstand manipulated our elections, meddled with our currency, threaded all that shining cable we never understood, miles of it, great loops of it, through the dry granite caves which honeycombed our southern provinces. She did not like the way your country used us. If this is offensive, I am sorry, but it was her belief. It was honestly held. Indeed, it was passionately held. She was not reasonable or balanced or fair. Yet for all the passion she expanded, for all the ceaseless paranoia, for all the very real Efican government agents who came snooping round the theatre, their electronic pencils dancing like fireflies in the dark, it is hard to see how the Feu Follet Collective was a threat to anyone it was a small, dirty, uncomfortable theatre at the back of that warren of bachelor flats, stables and dressage rings which had once housed the Ducrow Circus School.footnote marker My maman sometimes said that if it had not been for the spies, who after all paid full price for their tickets, they would have long ago gone out of business. That, of course, was a joke. The unfunny truth was that the Feu Follet would never have survived if it had not been for its circus matineacutees and Shakespeare productions, the latter chosen to coincide with the selection of that years highschool syllabuses. I was born in the Scottish Play, at the end of a full rehearsal. There was no great rush of fluids, but there was no mistaking what was happening when her waters broke and my maman quietly excused herself and walked out of the Feu Follet without telling anyone where she was going. When she came down the brick ramp in Gazette Street, things started happening faster than she had expected. Oxytocin entered her bloodstream like a tenton truck and all the pretty soft striped muscles of her womb turned hostile, contracting on me like they planned to crush my bones. I was caught in a rip. I was dumped. I was shoved into the birth canal, head first, my arm still pinned behind my back. My ear got folded like an envelope. My head was held so hard it felt, I swear it, like the end of life and not its glorious beginning. My maman had never had a child before. She did not understand the urgency. She walked straight past the line of empty red and silver cabs whose Sikh taximen, unaware of the emergency taking place underneath their noses, continued to talk to each other from behind their steering wheels, via the radio. As she crossed the Boulevard des Indiennes to the river she already felt distinctly uncomfortable, as if she were holding back a pumpkin, and yet she would not abandon her plan, i.e. to walk quietly, by herself, along the river to the Mater Hospital. She had long ago decided on this and she was a woman who always carried out her plans. It was a Sunday morning in January and the syrupy air smelled of dried fish, sulphur and diesel fuel. The year was 371 by our calendar. My maman was thirtytwo years old, tall, finely boned. No one watching her walk along the grey sandy path beside the river bed would have guessed at what her body was experiencing. She was an actress of the most physical type, and for the first half of her journey her walk was a triumph of will. She wore a long bright blue skirt, black tights. On her back she carried a black tote bag containing an extra shirt, another pair of tights, four pairs of pants, a pack of menstrual pads and a life of Stanislavsky she had always imagined she would read between contractions. This last thing the book is a good example of the sort of thing that irritated people, even members of her own company who loved her. They sensed in her this expectation of herself, that she could, for Christs sake, read Stanislavsky while she had a baby. She had a rude shock coming to her. They did not say that, hardly had the courage to think it in the quiet, secret part of their minds, but it was there, in their eyes, fighting with their sympathy. She had obsessed so long about this birth, not publicly, or noisily, but she had done the things that sometimes annoy the unpregnant eaten yeast and wheat germ, chanted in the mornings. No one from the Feu Follet saw her walk across the Boulevard des Indiennes. Had they done so, they might have been tempted to see it as evidence of her will, even her pride, her belief that she could walk while a lesser woman would be in an ambulance calling for the anaesthetic, but Felicity was someone who like to celebrate the milestones of her life birthdays particularly and she had imagined this moment, this walk beside the river, for too long to abandon it. My maman was a foreigner, but she loved Chemin Rouge with a passion barely imaginable to the native born. She believed it was this provincial city in this unimportant country that had saved her life, and if she had believed in God it was here she would have kneeled on the grey shellgrit path beside the river. If she had had parents it was here she would have brought them to show them what she had become. She had no God, no parents, but still she celebrated she brought me here instead. She had been a resident for fourteen years. She had been a citizen for ten. She had her own theatre company. She was going to give birth. It was so far from where she had been born. All these sights this ultramarine sky, these white knobbly river rocks, the sixfoottall feathered grasses which brushed her shoulders were unimaginable to anyone in the great foreign metropolis of Saarlim, and they were, for her, at once exotic but also as familiar as her own milky Hollandse Maagd skin. This small, slightly rancid port city was her home. And her feelings for the Eficans, those laconic, belligerent, selfdoubting inhabitants of the abandoned French and English colonies, descendants of convicts and dyers who, being conscripted by Louis Quatorze, were as good as convicts, grandchildren of displaced crofters and potatoblight Irish, were protective and critical, admiring and impatient. It was no small thing to her that I should be an Efican, and she betrayed her foreign birth in the way in which her ambitions for each of us, the country and the child, were not humble. Although the theatre was appreciated for its rough colloquial Shakespeare, she and the actors also devised a sort of agitprop, part circus, part soapbox, in which they attacked our countrys craven relationship with yours. There were people who valued the Shakespeare but found the agitprop unrewarding, and others who never set foot inside the Feu Follet who imagined the famous actormanager to be both strident and humourless. It was half true she was capable of being both of these things occasionally, but she was also a softly spoken woman with warm eyes. No son was ever so cherished by a mother as I was by her. The hospital where she had planned that I would be born was half a mile to the south of the theatre. It was built on the banks of the Nabangarifootnote marker river which, being wide and blue on the maps, was usually a disappointment to visitors, who were likely to find it empty, dry, full of blinding white round stones, with no sign of the waters whose crop gave the Central Business District of Chemin Rouge its controversial smell. When the famous river flowed into the port it raged not blue, but clayyellow, filled with grinding boulders and native pine logs which drifted out into the harbour where they floated just beneath the surface, earning themselves the name of widow makers with the pilots of the sea planes to Nez Noir. Every four or five years the Nabangari broke its banks and more than once filled the basement of the Mater Hospital, and then the front page of the Chemin Rouge Zine would carry a large photograph of a hospital administrator netting perch on the steps of the boiler room. Felicity had a striking face. She had long tousled copper hair, a straight nose, a fine English complexion, but as she came to the bend of the river where she should be able to see the hospital, her mouth tightened. What lay between her and the hospital was a Voorstand Sirkus in the process of construction, more different from our own indigenous circus than the different spelling might suggest.footnote marker The giant vid screen was already in place and highdefinition images of white women with shining thighs and pearlescent guitars had already established their flickering presence 640x200 pixels, beamed by satellite from Voorstand itself shining, brighter than daylight, through the immobile yellow leaves of the slender trees."

        "text": "photo Penguins on parade Their numbers progressively depleted by human interference, penguins are thriving again at selected nest sites along the eastern Australian seaboard, aided and abetted by more positive human interference, writes Bob Beale. Sit for a while on any of the famous white sand beaches of Jervis Bay, about 200 km south of Sydney, and it soon becomes apparent why the clear waters and the pristine bushland of its shimmering southern side have just been declared Australias newest national park. Aside from the stunning coastal cliffs and the rich marine, animal and plant life, the areas birds alone make it a joy. The waters of the bay have food aplenty for predators able to get beneath the surface, and many birds have figured out ways of doing just that. Some patrol from the sky, suddenly folding back their wings and plummeting 10 metres or more in a brainjarring dive for small fish. Cormorants have opted for an even more artful approach they have adapted their bodies in ways that have sacrificed elegance in flight for more effective underwater swimming, enabling them to fly to their fishing grounds then pursue their prey in its element by propelling themselves with their powerful feet. Bellies full, theyll retire to some quiet perch to hang out their wings to dry in the sun. One of the bays birds, though, has renounced the power of flight altogether. The little, or fairy, penguin has forsaken the sky for the sea. Its body is so modified that its wings now serve as powerful flippers, its feathers as waterrepellent insulating material, its shape is streamlined like a submarine. An observer in the right place at the right time will have a ringside view of schools of small fish darting this way and that, or leaping in unison from the water, frantically trying to avoid the powerful beaks of these remarkable birds which appear to fly underwater. The penguins must swim to their fishing grounds, mainly within 15 to 20 km of the coast. But they are capable of covering some extraordinarily long distances, and individuals tagged at one colony have been found hundreds of kilometres away at another. One juvenile penguin tagged at Jervis Bay by Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service ANPWS researcher Martin Fortescue was found washed ashore at Tea Tree Crossing in South Australia, a record straightline distance of 1,012 km. Once it reaches its feeding site, the penguin is unmatched in its diving power Victorian researchers have recorded penguin dives of 60 metres to the very bottom of Bass Strait. That swimming ability enables them to feast on small surface schools of fish , such as pilchards, anchovies and garfish, and to dive deep after squid and krill. Their mysterious directionfinding ability enables them to return to their own tiny burrows on land. Bowen Island, which sits at the mouth of Jervis Bay, is rich in modern and ancient photo photo caption human history. But now its 51 hectares is a scene of a remarkable revival of the little penguin. In the mid 70s, only about 1,500 pairs bred on the island. Today, more than 5,000 pairs breed there. That population surge bucks a trend in which little penguin numbers overall are declining. Noone knows for sure why that photo caption is or, for that matter, how many little penguins there are in Australia. The best estimate is more that 100,000 and fewer than a million. As predators near the top of the food chain that spend most of their time in nearcoastal waters, penguins are obvious subjects for research into the effects of human activity on the sea, especially pollution. One of the seas smallest warmblooded animals, penguins daily confront water contaminated by sewage, plastics, photo excerpt pesticides, chemicals and silt. They must also compete with commercial fishermen and amateur anglers for food, and when they return to land to rest, nest and moult, they have to contend with human encroachment on their nesting sites and with predatory cats, dogs and foxes. The little penguins range in Australia coincides with the areas most heavily populated or accessible to people south along the coastline from the QueenslandNSW border to a point just south of Perth. Apart from New Zealand, it is not found anywhere else in the world. It does not venture south into the subAntartic or the Antartic, where vast colonies of other penguin species thrive. A sign of the little penguins resilience is that two small colonies hang on within cooee of Australias two biggest cities. The exact locations are closely guarded by those involved with their protection and care, but an apparently stable and healthy colony of about 600 penguins survives only kilometres from Sydney, and another smaller one can be found on Melbournes doorstep, at St Kilda. Says one researcher studying them, Theyre tough little buggers, and it takes a lot to damage them. They also know when and where to bite you and, believe me, it hurts. Ttheir recent success at Bowen Island owes much to a major, and costly, conservation effort to preserve and restore the habitat. A photograph of the area in 1956 shows it to be virtually denuded of trees, overrun by kikuyu grass and dotted with small holiday houses right in the middle of what today is prime penguinnesting habitat. The combined pressure of manmade structures, introduced weeds and bamboo, rabbits, pheasants and other wildlife had, by the late 1980s, left the future of the penguin colony in doubt. Martin Fortescue, who lived on the island for three years as rangerinresidence in the late 1980s, looks at the restoration with pride. During a tour of the island, he stops at a stand of vigorous young banksia trees. This was all bamboo here at one stage, he says sweeping his hand over the area in front of us. It was bloody murder digging it all out. I lost a lot of sweat on it. Weve replanted it with seedlings grown from that big old banksia over there. The old tree had somehow been spared fires and axes. Although the same species grows nearby on the mainland, seed from this particular tree had been collected for replanting to ensure that whatever genetic peculiarities it possessed were preserved. The seedlings were planted near the parent tree to simulate a roughly natural seeding pattern. The same process had been followed for other individual trees. And other native plants had sprung from the ground of their own accord since it was incorporated in the former Jervis Bay Nature Reserve. Dormant seeds sprouted, underground tubers sent up fresh shoots and, little by little, the islands natural balance was restored. Martin Fortescues painstaking research has shown that Bowen Island is now one of the best places a little penguin pair can choose to breed. The health of the island and the abundance of local food means that many penguins manage to raise two chicks at a time in their burrows, and to breed twice in a season. The very success of the colony, however, brings its own dangers. Tourism already attracts more than a million visitors a year to Jervis Bay and, increasingly, they want to visit Bowen to see the colony. Tourists, who require permission to visit Bowen, are also affecting water quality and fish stocks in the area, through amateur angling, increased demand for local seafood and, of course, more of the usual effects of sewage, silting, boating and so on. In turn, local conservationists feel protective towards the colony, having put in so much time, effort and expense to restore it. ANPWS officers in the area are among those concerned that even the modest tourist exploitation of the penguins so far may affect the colonys breeding success, or that the effects are too unpredictable to be able to sanction any expansion of tourism. These issues have yet to be resolved in an imminent management plan for the new park. Meanwhile, on Montague Island, 200 km south of Jervis Bay and home to another major little penguin colony, the photo excerpt NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service NPWS gave the go ahead last October for a lowkey tourism operation. Montague Island, famous for its centuryold lighthouse, is a massive granite outcrop about 5 km offshore from Narooma. It has at least 6,000 breeding pairs photo photo of penguins, as well as a major nesting site for a rare species of shearwater and a small resting site for male fur seals. It, too, has been ravaged by goats, rabbits and especially kikuyu grass released on to it in the past, so that it remains as treeless and degraded as Bowen Island was not so long ago. Only four trees grow there, and at least three are exotics planted by former lighthouse keepers. As well, the island sometimes finds itself in the path of ocean currents bringing sewage south from the NewcastleSydneyWollongong urban belt. Under contract to the NPWS, charter operators bring boatloads of about 40 people at a time to the island, allowing them to land and observe the penguins under existing dim lighting to which the birds have become accustomed. This provides a small but muchneeded income for the NPWSs southeastern region, which in addition to the management of the island itself has in the past few years acquired responsibility for conserving the historic buildings on the island. Nowhere are all the conflicting pulls and pushes on the little penguin better exemplified than at Australias most famous breeding colony, on Victorias Phillip Island. Tourism began there in the 1920s, with people visiting with blankets caption and lamps to watch the penguins come ashore. At the time, the colony was said to have numbered 70,000 breeding pairs, although that estimate is questioned today. Human pressure on the colony gradually became so severe especially when a bridge to the island allowed cars to cross that its future seemed in doubt until, in the early 1980s, the area was declared a nature reserve. Penguin numbers have plunged, to perhaps 10,000 pairs, and encroaching holiday houses, domestic pets, feral animals and tourism were taking a heavy toll on the colony. Under a radical program adopted by the Victorian Government, about half the 776 holiday houses in the immediate Summerland Peninsula area have been bought and demolished, cars which used to kill several hundred wandering penguins a year have been excluded, and the enormously popular tourism operation based on the penguins has been formalised and controlled. Today, an independent committee, reporting to the Government, oversees the management of the area. Anyone who doubts the touristpulling power of penguins needs only look at the staging of the islands Penguin Parade now Australias premier wildlife attraction. Some 500,000 people. many of them foreign tourists, visit Phillip Island each year, generating 44 million for the Victorian economy and providing 36 fulltime , 33 permanent parttime and 40 seasonal jobs. Up to 4,000 tourists at a time come to stand on elevated boardwalks at sunset, watching the carefully lit beach as penguins waddle out from the surf, up the sand, beneath the boardwalks and into their burrows. Its a bit like a zoo in reverse, says ranger Julie Thomas. The penguins are unimpeded in their progress and the people are locked in. The money the tourists spend helps to finance a habitat restoration program, a penguin hospital, a research team, a feral animal eradication program, a visitor centre and the maintenance of tourist facilities. This commercial bonanza helps explain why the Government won support for its tough and costly protection program. Moneystarved conservation agencies elsewhere enviously eye the Phillip Island operation and compare it with the handsoff approach being followed in places such as Bowen and Montague. Michael Cullen , professor of Zoology at Monash University, says that Phillip Islands commercial success would not be easy to repeat. The people who see the bonanza side of it dont see how slowly it was built up, he says. The site itself allows easy access and people management. One of the key problems in protecting the little penguin and promoting penguin tourism is the gross inadequacy of human knowledge about the animals."

        "text": "Westpac board faces reality THE share market obviously approved of the decision by Sir Eric Neal and four other Westpac directors to resign. The banks shares rose on the news. Of course, the entire board must take responsibility for the banks most recent misfortunes. And the list of departing directors does not include the names of all those directors who were on the board before 1987 when most of the bad investment decisions were made. Indeed, of those who have resigned, only Sir Eric and Mr James Scully joined the board before But Sir Eric and his fellow directors have acknowledged the basic issue of the boards responsibility, and the bank has taken an important step towards winning back the confidence of both its shareholders and the wider sharemarket. Thats the point of it all. The share market certainly was not lusting for revenge it was looking for evidence that Westpac was on top of its problems. It was hardly reassured by the sight of an almost undisturbed Westpac board and management, or by the assurances by Sir Eric in January that the worst was over just four months before the huge provisions for bad and doubtful debts and the announcement of a 6 billion halfyear loss. The result is a distinct lack of confidence that, even now, the worst is over for Westpac and its shareholders, and a reluctance to subscribe to Westpacs rights issue. Westpac is heavily exposed to the deeply depressed commercial property market. If the bank suffers more heavy losses, it could be forced to seek more capital to satisfy the Reserve Banks prudential requirements. Why pay 3 for Westpac stock now if Westpac is likely to be back in the market with another, cheaper rights issue in another 12 months Of course, there were other reasons for the spectacular failure of the Westpac rights issue circumstances beyond the control of Westpac. But Westpac was accused of bungling the timing of the rights issue it took four months to complete which, it is claimed, was twice as long as necessary, so that it was overtaken by the general decline in share prices. In any event, the result was a record 883 million shortfall of the 2 billion rights issue and a spectacular vote of no confidence in Westpacs board and management. Last week, four of Westpacs 15 largest institutional shareholders were reported to have indicated their support for a spill of all the positions on the Westpac board. Sir Eric and his fellow directors had to act to recapture the initiative. The question now is whether the market will remain satisfied with the changes to Westpacs board and management. The market will assume that the changes in the board will be followed by further changes in Westpacs senior management. Many of the senior executives responsible for the banks mistakes are still in their jobs. Mr Frank Conroy, the recentlyappointed managing director, has restructured the banks management and tightened control of its activities. Undoubtedly, the share market will want to see further evidence of the strengthening of Westpac management in the months ahead. Few will derive any pleasure from yesterdays resignations. But the Westpac board has to be seen to take its share of the heavy responsibility for the past, disastrous errors of judgment. Only then would investors be confident that Westpac had both fully accounted for and learnt from those errors. Sir Eric and the four other directors had to go for Westpac to go forward. Vietnam Lest we forget TODAYS dedication of the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial in Canberra is not just another step in this countrys acceptance of Vietnam veterans. This is the point at which the Vietnam War as experienced by the Australian men and women who were sent there, and the Vietnam War as experienced by the rest of us, begin to merge into a common memory. How that memory takes shape will have a crucial impact on the lives of veterans and their families. It will help determine the public understanding, not only of what the Vietnam War was about, but of what war in general is about. And, over time, it will affect the meaning and the significance of important national symbols such as the Anzac legend and its central hero the Digger. The fact that 20 years separates the beginning of this process and the returning home of the last Australian troops from Vietnam suggests how difficult the merger is. No soldier returning from war can expect to be completely understood by those who stayed behind. But at least those who fought in World War II enjoyed the continued support of those back home, saw the overall war effort in much the same terms as those back home, and returned home to a welcome befitting victors. That helped the two experiences of the war to merge quickly and smoothly. Not so with Vietnam. Especially in the last few years of Australias involvement, public opinion was sharply divided over the wisdom and the morality of the war. Moreover, as support for the war effort turned to a sense of failure and even guilt, it was all too easy to project those feelings onto those who had to do the fighting. For many years after the war, the experiences of those who served in Vietnam and those who didnt grew more, not less, divergent. Many Vietnam veterans claimed that the nature of the war they fought left them with special needs that other returned servicemen may not have known. And at the same time, the publics perception of the Vietnam veteran was being influenced by exaggerated American stereotypes of the antisocial, angry and alienated personality who could not readjust to society. For both reasons, Australian veterans commonly felt a sense of embarrassment about admitting to their military service in Vietnam. There is still a good deal of pain and incomprehension stemming from Australias involvement in Vietnam. But the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial is proof that there is a degree of shared understanding as well. Importantly, this is not a memorial that glorifies the war effort. Indeed, noone who reflected on the memorial could disagree that war involves a tragic loss of life and that even when that loss is deemed the lesser of two evils, war remains mankinds supreme folly. But even such a folly allows for individual acts of courage, sacrifice and service. Whatever judgements we make about the nature of the conflict in Vietnam, or about Australias involvement in it, should not get tangled up in judgements about those who fought there. Australian men and women who were sent to Vietnam fulfilled their duty to their country and did so with valour. They deserve that recognition. If we honour those who served, suffered and died in Vietnam, we may be less likely to diminish the importance of their stories, rewrite the history of the war to suit latterday purposes, or forget what a painful time it was for all of us. Getting it wrong in East Timor THE newlyinstalled Governor of East Timor, Mr Abilio Soares, says he has a plan to end years of strife and bloodshed in the territory. He wants to set up a voluntary resettlement program to move families to sparsely populated parts of East Timor with rich farming potential. The idea is to develop East Timors agricultural sector and so generate work and raise living standards generally for East Timorese. Thats not all. Mr Abilio says the program to be administered with the help of the Indonesian Army will help teach East Timorese some muchneeded discipline. And together with a course on the virtues of integration in the schools, jobs and discipline will end opposition to Indonesian rule. That is precisely the peace plan that East Timor doesnt need. There is no doubt that a lack of work and economic opportunity in East Timor fuels resentment to Indonesian rule, especially among the urban underclass in the capital, Dili. But it is hardly the source of that resentment. East Timorese have never been given a say in whether or not they want to be part of Indonesia. Ignore that and youre never going to understand their feelings. Nor have the East Timorese been given any reason to believe that their distinct culture and traditions will survive integration. Instead, the Indonesian authorities have discouraged the use of the local Tetum language and of Portuguese, promoted Islam as an alternative to the local Catholic religion, and assisted Indonesian settlers to pour into the territory with little regard for its local inhabitants. Mr Abilios program promises more of the same. East Timorese have a strong attachment to their land even many converts to Catholicism retain some animist beliefs that place great store in natural objects and the physical surroundings. Anything that even looks like threatening their hereditary land claims will provoke further conflict. Moving people around inside East Timor and inviting in outsiders will also undermine traditional communities and breakdown village structures. As for the other ingredients of Mr Abilios peace formals a dose of discipline and a pinch of proIndonesian propaganda noone in their right mind would believe that they are going to help solve the problem. And thats the real rub in this whole proposal. No governor of East Timor is ever going to have too much room for independent action until a settlement acceptable to all sides in this dispute is firmly in place. But the local governor can act as a bridge for the Indonesian authorities and the East Timorese by helping to reduce misunderstandings between the two and perhaps even pushing a genuine settlement along. To do so, he must enjoy Jakartas confidence and the respect of the East Timorese. Mr Abilios predecessor, Mr Mario Carrascalao, was able to strike just such a balance. But on his onesided, proJakarta performance since taking office last month. Mr Abilio has little hope of doing the same. Mr Abilios plan has not yet been approved by Jakarta which is not to say that it didnt originate there and the Indonesian authorities would do well to leave it that way. The plan will only anger East Timorese by reminding them of how little control they have over their own lives and aggravate tensions in the territory. A wiser course would be to put the transmigration program to East Timor on hold, accelerate the quite useful development programs undertaken by Indonesia in the territory, and search for a form of authority that allows the East Timorese to have a stake in Indonesia without being impaled on it. A question of Question Time AN implied benefit from the televising of Question Time in the Federal Parliament was the likelihood that its quality would improve with the new public scrutiny. That likelihood has not unfortunately eventuated. In fact, as the personal animosity between the Prime Minister, Mr Paul Keating, and the Opposition Leader, Dr John Hewson, has intensified, Question Time has become the political equivalent of feeding time at the zoo, with the parliamentary animals ripping into each other as if they were chunks of raw meat. The Opposition, with Mr Jim Carlton filling in the details, has now promised to make substantial changes in the way the House of Representatives runs. These changes include Lower House committees to examine legislation in detail committees to monitor the performance of departments and reforms to Question Time. The first two changes should be easy to introduce. They have, also, a great deal of merit in that they will help swing the balance of power back a little to the legislature from the domination of the executive. Reforms to Question Time have merit, too, but it is a fanciful notion that these will come about by telling ministers not to adopt past behaviour. The problem with this approach is that the tendency towards confrontation by the Opposition, namecalling by MPs from both sides of the House of Representatives, and the tedious prepared answers from ministers designed to soak up the time available for questions, seems to be ingrained."

        "text": "RELICT SURFACESOIL FEATURES IN SEMIARID MULGA ACACIA ANEURA WOODLANDS J.C.Noble CSIRO Division of Wildlife and Ecology, National Rangelands Program, P.O. Box 84, Lyneham, A.C.T.,2602 Abstract The physical dimensions and locations of two forms of circular surfacesoil features, believed to be constructed by animals now locally extinct, are described for a 200 ha site and its environs in a semiarid mulga Acacia aneura woodland in northwestern New South Wales. The most common were 48 circular c. 10 m diameter features, some with welldefined central depressions carrying vigorous grass tussocks.Soil chemical analysis indicated the relatively high fertility of these central depressions. Surface pebbles were analysed for comparison with similar lithological data in the literature. The evidence suggests that the malleefowl Leipoa ocellata is the most likely agent responsible for building these features. While only four of the larger features c. 30 m diameter were located in the study site, they were particularly conspicuous on higher ridges in adjoining paddocks because of the abundance of highly reflective, calcrete fragments visible on the surface of subcircular mounds. It is postulated that they were constructed by the burrowing bettong Bettongia lesueur. Introduction One of the fundamental characteristics of Australian rangelands is the high degree of surfacesoil heterogeneity found in most communities Foran et al. 1990, Stafford Smith and Morton 1990. Patchiness can be recognised at several scales within a region, decreasing from catchment e.g. source and sink areas Pickup 1985, through land system e.g. dunefields and sandplains and land unit e.g. groves and intergroves, down to topographical changes at scales ranging from 1 to 10 m e.g. gilgais and soil hummocks Tongway et al. 1989. Much of the smallscale patchiness can be attributed directly to biologically mediated processes comprising past or present activities of either soilinhabiting or soilnesting animals such as termites Noble et al.1989. Whilst some of these animals may still be active, others may be locally extinct although the results of their past activities are clearly imprinted on the landscape. Such activity within the surface soil can have significant, and often longterm, ecological ramifications. The xylophagous termites Amitermes spp., for example, facilitate the decomposition of fallen timber in arid landscapes. Their activity contributes to the development of substantial soil hummocks around the fallen timber. These hummock islands are considerably more fertile than the surrounding soil Noble and Tongway 1988, Tongway et al. 1989, supporting productive herbage and diverse faunal communities. Accordingly, longterm productivity in most arid rangelands is dependent on management systems that recognise the importance of such patches by promoting the maintenance, and if necessary, the restoration of surface heterogeneity Tongway 1990. In 1987, a research site was established at Lake Mere Station, 35 km north of Louth, New South Wales 30degree16S, 144degree53E. Locations of the various sites and regions referred to throughout this paper are shown in Fig. The Lake Mere site, encompassing an area of 200 ha, was initially characterised through systematic observations of vegetation patterns, soil and surface hydrology Tongway and Ludwig 1990. A similar survey of the distributions of pavements formed by the harvester termite Drepanotermes perniger Froggatt and loghummock feeding sites was also undertaken Noble et al. 1989. Because there was minimal vegetative cover at the time through drought, other surface soil features were also conspicuous. Of particular interest were 48 circular features around 10 m in diameter characterised by a relatively high density of surface pebbles, particularly around the outer perimeter zone Fig. 2a. Some were distinguished by a clearly defined central depression 1520 cm deep with a surrounding annular mound. Others were nearly flat, presumably the result of erosion of older structures yet the higher density and circular disposition of the surface pebbles were still obvious Fig. 2b. Other quite distinctive features were also visible, even at some distance. These four, generally circular features were characterised by their wider diameter c 30 m and deeper excavation, usually to at least one metre Fig. 3a. Excavation had resulted in the extensive deposition of white rock fragments around the perimeter in a subcircular, or horseshoeshaped, mound. A subsurface calcified layer, 3050 cm thick, was usually exposed over a wide area in hard red massive red earth sites. This layer is subsequently referred to as calcrete, based on the original definition of the term by Lamplugh 1902 who used it to refer to places where dottedlinelimestonedebris enters largely into the composition of the superficial deposits, the sandandgravel beds are often cemented sporadically into hard masses by solution and redeposition of lime through the agency of infiltrating waters. The larger surfacesoil features were not as widespread in the study site, being commonly found on the highest points, usually stony ridges, of adjoining paddocks. Here, there was often at least one entrance below the calcrete being used by rabbits Oryctolagus cuniculus L. Fig. 3b. Similar relic features have also been observed in lighter textured soils of other land systems, although their surface morphology is generally more subdued, presumably through surface soil accumulation. The clear radial symmetry suggested biotic origins for both these features. This paper describes their general morphology, distribution and possible evolution. The soil characteristics of the smaller features are also discussed in relation to vegetation and landscape elements based on chemical analysis of soils and mechanical analysis of pebbles. Finally, these data are discussed in relation to animal species likely to be responsible for their construction. Methods A systematic survey of the smaller features was undertaken in October 1987 using transects established for earlier surveys Noble et al. 1989, Tongway and Ludwig 1990. The vegetation on the site is characterised by alternating mulga groves and intergroves with three vegetation types woolybutt Eragrostis eriopoda Benth. savanna on runoff slopes bandicoot grass Monachather paradoxa Steud savanna at the base of these slopes and mulga Acacia aneura F.Muell. ex Benth. woodland, either in groves or along extensive drainage lines. The groves have soils containing higher levels of organic carbon and exchangeable nutrients than soils in the intergroves Tongway and Ludwig 1990. Each of the smaller features was classified according to its surface morphology. The position of each was recorded by measuring distance coordinates to the nearest fences. Similar positions were also recorded whenever the larger features were encountered. The smaller features were classified as follows I dash welldefined annular ring of height gt15 cm with a distinct central depression II dash clear annular pattern of 1015 cm but still with a shallow central depression III dash eroded with surface stones more widely spread and a very shallow lt10cm central depression IV dash uniform circular lag material, only slightly elevated above the surrounding ground surface with no discernible depression. The mean diameter of all features located during the survey was recorded. Height profiles of two Class I features were surveyed by dumpy level to within plusminus1 cm in vertical height at 30 cm intervals along 14 m transects aligned through their centres to characterise the microtopography. Similar transects c. 30 m were also surveyed across two of the larger features. Duplicate soil samples were taken from four smaller features selected at random three Class III and one Class II. A trench 30 cm wide and 50 cm deep was excavated commencing in the centre of each and extending radially to a point approximately 1 m outside the perimeter. Samples were taken from trench walls at three depths 03, 15 and 30 cm and at three points along the transect centre, perimeter annulus and external zone. Residual detritus such as old wood or roots was also sought to determine whether trees may have been present in the past. Soil samples bulked duplicates were first airdried in a glasshouse before sieving 2 mm before analysing for available nitrogen Gianello and Bremner 1986 and organic carbon Colwell 1969. Duplicate samples 1 m2 quadrats of surface pebbles were taken at random from the perimeter annuli of three smaller features before subjecting them to mechanical analysis sieve size ranging from lt36 to gt5 mm. Surface pebbles were similarly sampled from the surrounding zone within a 10 m radius of each surface feature. The weights and volumes of a range of pebble sizes were also measured by balance and water displacement respectively for comparison with similar pebble data in the literature. Calcrete samples were also taken from several larger features for detailed geological examination, including xray diffraction analysis Azaroff 1968, in order to characterise their geochemistry. Results Fortyeight of the smaller features were found throughout the 100 ha site giving an overall density of 1 mound to 2 ha however, their distribution was far from uniform Fig. 4 with none being found in either the mulga groves or drainage lines. The most common was the Class IV type 56, whilst only 6 were Class I features Fig. 5a. One third of the smaller features studied had a diameter of 4 to 6 m while 27 fell within the 8 to 10 m diameter range Fig. 5b. The distinctive horizontal profile of Class I features is shown in Fig. The weights, volume displacements and specific gravities of a range of surface pebble sizes are shown in Table The size distributions of pebbles taken from the surface of smaller features, and adjacent control sites, were both highly skewed towards the finer fractions less than36 mm although the large pebble component gt2 mm in the control zones Table 2 contributed more than twice the proportion recorded for these features 6 and 3 respectively. Chemical analysis of soil samples taken along the radial transects revealed a significant gradient in surface 03 cm soil fertility, particularly soil nitrogen Fig. 7. Available nitrogen in the surface soil of the central depression was more than twice that recorded from 15 and 30 cm depths. Although surface soil nitrogen fell by nearly 70 outside this central zone, it was still substantially higher than the levels recorded in the subsoil. Similar, but less pronounced, trends were observed for soil organic carbon with the highest carbon content being recorded in the central surface soil. The horizontal profiles of the larger features differed considerably in their scale of construction when compared with the smaller features Fig. 8. The geology of the calcrete exposed in these features is based on combined sediments of bleached, highly weathered clay and silt stones cemented by calcium carbonate, probably of Cretaceous origin M. Goodman, pers. comm.. The pedogenetic carbonate in the calcrete is very common in arid areas of high evaporation and derives over time from atmospheric carbon dioxide while the calcium is of aeolian origin J. Chappell, pers. comm.. Xray diffraction analysis of a calcrete sample taken from a large surfacesoil feature on Glenora identified the calcareous induration to consist primarily of calcite with some quartz present J. Kamprad, pers. comm.. The blocks of finegrained material contained within the calcrete matrix were composed principally of quartz with traces of calcite, kaolinite and possibly montmorillonite mixed layer clays. Discussion Smaller features Several hypotheses can be advanced to explain the possible origin of these soil features. Circular rock weathering has been observed in certain situations D.J. Tongway, pers. comm. but there is no evidence that such abiotic factors were involved in the genesis of these features on the scale and pattern observed at Lake Mere. Shrinkswell forces have been mooted as maintaining stones at, or near, the surface of arid stony tableland soils by upward sorting, due to the presence of montmorillonite clays which expand on wetting and contract on drying Jessup 1960, Mabbutt 1979, Chartres 1982. However, the massive red earths at Lake Mere have a relatively low clay content Tongway and Ludwig 1990 and do not display typical gilgai microrelief. Construction by biotic agents on the other hand, is considered to be the most plausible explanation for these phenomena. Circular depressions have been known to occur following death of large trees but the lack of any tree residues, either surface or subterranean, negates this hypothesis. Similarly, there is no anthropological or historical evidence indicating either Aborigines or European miners were involved in their construction. Whilst radial symmetry is not exclusively biotic in origin, it is a fundamental charactersitic of many animal nests when viewed in plan. Such symmetry is clearly visible in the soil surface features described in this paper. The question then arises as to what animals, or groups of animals, might have been responsible for their construction"

        "text": "Construction Project A Multifunction Fluoro Light The title of this project doesnt do it justice. What do you call in three words a project that includes an efficient 12V inverter to operate a range of fluorescent tubes at full brilliance, an onboard regulator to charge the 12V battery from a solar cell, an ultrasonic movement detector and a FET power switch to flash an emergency light And theres lots moredotted line by PETER PHILLIPS This project comes from the design team at Oatley Electronics, and is aimed at those who want a versatile project at the best possible price. It started out as an allnew 12V fluorescent lamp inverter, which by itself will be popular with constructors. But, as regular readers know, fluorescent lamp inverters have been described before, so the team decided to extend things a bit. Well, more than just a bitdotted line The most important part of this project is the inverter itself, designed by Conrad Marder. Ideally, an inverter should have a high efficiency and be able to drive a range of tubes to full brilliance. This one has all this it has an efficiency better than 90 and can power fluorescent tubes ranging from 6W to 20W, to almost the same light output as if theyre operated from the mains. For instance, a 20W tube takes 4A at 12V 17W of input power, with a light output of around 16W, or about 80 of its normal rated output. Because the tube is operating at slightly less than its full rated output, the tube life is extended, and you wont really notice the difference in the light output. However, if you want more light output, simply change a resistor value. To give a range of options on how to turn the light on and off, the design team included a digital interface. This part of the circuit allows the light to be switched on by any device that delivers a pulse. Theres also a timer in the circuit that can be disabled wit a link, so a pulse input can turn on the light for three minutes or so. You can also add an LDR light dependent resistor, so the light is automatically disabled during daylight. There are two inputs one that accepts a positive pulse and the other a negative pulse. This way, you can operate the light from a PIR detector, a pushbutton, an infrared or RF remote control anything that gives either a positive or a negativegoing pulse. To make the project attractive to as many people as possible, the designers also included a regulator to allow the 12V battery to be charged from a solar panel. The regulator prevents the battery from overcharging, but is only for use with a solar panel. If you want to trickle charge the battery from the mains, you simply leave out the regulator section and add your own battery charger. All of the sections described so far are on the one PCB which by the way, is a professionally made, silkscreened board. However, because the cost of a PCB is not directly related to its size, Oatley Electronics decided to add two more sections. The first is an ultrasonic movement detector. This part was presented as a project in April 1990, page 80 and the circuit here is identical. However, the PCB section has been redesigned to suit the rest of the board. As an incentive, the basic kit for this project includes the ultrasonic transmitter and receiver, so if you have all the other bits, you get this section for free. This PCB section is electrically independent of the main PCB, so it can be either left attached or separated, as desired. You can use the detector to trigger the light, so if you need a light that comes on if someone enters a room, here it is. The ultrasonic detector section can be placed away from the light to suit, or left attached to give an integrated unit. The last part is a FET power switch with an onboard lowfrequency oscillator. This section can be used as an electronic onoff switch for a light, or to flash a light, such as a beacon or a warning light on a boat. Like the ultrasonic movement detector, the power switch section of the PCB is independent, and the parts for this section are not included in the basic kit. So, as you can see, this is a very versatile project. It caters for those who already have a stock of components, but who cant make their own boards, as well as for constructors who want to adapt the project to a special need. In short, its the ideal hobbyist project cheap and very versatile. The project will be sold as a kit, and for 39 you get everything shown in Fig.Add an extra 16, and you get all the extra components to complete the two extra PCBs. See the end of the article for further details. The inverter The circuit on the main PCB is shown in Fig.There are three sections to the circuit the inverter around Q3, the digital interface around IC1 and the solar regulator section around Q1. The inverter is basically a blocking oscillator. When Q2 is on, base current is supplied to Q3 via R14 R17 and the feedback winding of TThis turns Q3 on, and current starts to flow in the primary winding of TThe current will quickly increase, inducing a voltage in the feedback winding that makes Q3 turn on even harder. Eventually the current will reach its maximum value, causing the induced voltage in the feedback winding to fall. The reduced base voltage to Q3 will make Q3 start to turn off,reducing the current flowing in the transformer. The effect is cumulative or regenerative and Q3 is quickly turned off as the feedback voltage falls even further. The cycle then repeats. The waveforms for the inverter are shown in Fig.Notice that the transistor is on for about 25 of the whole cycle, and that the voltage across the tube is virtually zero until the transistor is on. In other words, energy is transferred to the tube while Q3 is on. The maximum voltage across the tube is around 60V for an 8W tube. The frequency of the oscillator is about 40kHz, mainly determined by the values of C6 and RAs the waveforms show, capacitor C6 is charged with a negative voltage when Q3 is switched off, and has to discharge before Q3 can switch on again. The values of R14 and R15 also affect the frequency, and more importantly, the collector current in QThese resistors therefore determine the amount of power transferred to the tube. The value of R15 is selected to suit the power rating of the tube and the recommended values for R15 for various tubes are shown in Table These values have been determined to give a power output of about 80 of the tubes rating. This gives the best operating life, and a power input to the inverter equal to the rated power of the tube. Increasing the value of R15 will reduce the light output and the current consumption. However, this also reduces the life of the tube, as the tube filaments wont heat because of the low value of tube current. Although the filaments are not heated directly as in some designs, they will heat if the tube current is sufficient. Digital interface The inverter is switched on and off by QIf you wanted nothing else but the inverter, Q2 could be removed and a switch connected in place of the emitter and collector terminals. Another way to directly switch the inverter on and off is to connect a switch in place of link Or, if link 3 is connected, the onoff switch could be in series with the 12V supply. The digital interface provides an even greater range of switching options. When the interface is being used, link 3 is deleted and link 2 is connected. There are three inputs to the circuit, although one of these is used as a connection for an LDR. The other two accept a pulse, perhaps from the ultrasonic movement detector or any similar device. As the circuit shows, a negative pulse is applied to R1 and a positive pulse to RIf R1 is momentarily connected to ground, the output of IC1a will switch to a high. This makes the output of IC1b switch low, which is passed to the input of IC1c via CIf link 2 is connected, the low at the output of IC1b will switch Q2 on, allowing the inverter to operate. The output of IC1c will now be high, which then holds the input of IC1b high, with its output low. The circuit is then held in this state regardless of the input condition to R However, the positive side of C3 is connected to the supply via RBecause its negative end is now connected to a low, C3 will charge towards 12V. When C3 has charged sufficiently, the input to IC1c will be a logic 1, causing its output to switch low. This makes the output of IC1b switch high, turning off the inverter and returning the timer to its stable state. The circuit around IC1b and IC1c is therefore a monostable, with a time delay determined by the values of C3 and RThe time delay is around three minutes which can be altered by changing the value of either C3 or RIf link 1 is connected, the delay is reduced to virtually zero, as R9 is then in parallel with RThis link is connected if you want to use the inputs to switch the light on and off without having a delay for the turnoff time. Applying a positive input to R3 has the same effect as a negative input to RThis pulse is applied directly via isolating diode D2 to IC1b as it is the right polarity to trigger the timer. If an LDR is connected as shown in the circuit diagram, both trigger inputs are disabled if the LDR resistance is low. This happens under normal daylight conditions, but in darkness, the LDR resistance will be over 1M ohm, allowing the circuit to respond to a pulse at either input. Incidentally, you can connect a pushbutton to either input. For example, connecting a pushbutton between the negative input at R1 to ground will give a negative input pulse when the button is pressed. Or the pushbutton could be connected between the positive pulse input at R3 and the 12V supply. Another method is to use a switch, connected as described for the pushbutton. In this case, IC1d takes over and holds the timer on. For example, if the input end of R1 is connected to ground, a logic 1 will be applied to the input of IC1d, giving a low at its output. This will forward bias D5 and pull the input of IC1c low, regardless of the state of CThe timer is then held permanently in this condition, with the output of IC1b low. Therefore, the inverter is switched on as long as the switch is closed. If link 1 is not connected, there will be the usual time delay when the switch is turned off. Connecting link 1 eliminates the delay. Solar regulator This section is a shunt regulator and connects across the battery. As already explained, the regulator is only for use with a solar panel. Without the regulator, its possible to overcharge a battery from a solar panel, as the output voltage of the panel will rise as the load current falls. The opencircuit voltage of a solar panel designed to charge a 12V battery can be over 20V, and the regulator simply bypasses the charge current when the voltage across it is higher than 14V or so. The circuit has two zener diodes, connected in series to give a total zener voltage of 1V"

        "text": "TEST REPORT COMPUTER PRINTERS Inkjet, thermal fusion or dot matrix We compare the technologies and 18 different printers. FOR THIS REPORT we tested inkjet, thermal fusion and 24pin dot matrix printers priced at less than This included generalpurpose desktop machines and some small, portable models for use with notebook computers. The range encompasses printers designed for people with quite different needs, so weve split our recommendations into groups, taking different user requirements into account see What to buy on page 30. Our overall score was based on print quality, speed, noise and the ease of using the front panel controls and instructions. It didnt take paper handling options and how easy they are to use into account, as this depends very much on the users particular needs. The table lists which options are available so you can rule out any printer which doesnt have those you need and the profiles include a brief description and assessment of the paper handling capabilities of each model. We also discuss the pros and cons of the different technologies, to help you decide which type would be best for you. COMPARING TECHNOLOGIES boxDot matrix An older technology, the impact dot matrix printer is probably still the most common type in general consumer use today. It works in a similar way to a typewriter, using a printhead which consists of very small pins or hammers and an inked ribbon. The impact of different configurations of pins hitting the ribbon transfers the ink onto the page behind, forming the shapes of the characters and images. Dot matrix machines are usually cheap to buy and run and, because they use impact, can print carbon copies and multiplepart forms. Theyre generally considered good workhorse printers and usually have versatile paper handling options. On the downside, theyre quite noisy and the quality of their print is not as high as you get from thermal fusion or inkjet machines. This is often particularly noticeable when printing graphics, where they cant produce an image with the same sharpness and detail as the other types. However, the print quality of all the 24pin dot matrix printers we tested is better than that of ninepin printers, and for many purposes is more than adequate, particularly for text. boxInkjet Marketed as either bubble inkjet or thermal inkjet, this type of technology uses cartridges consisting of a supply of ink and a printhead with tiny nozzles, or jets, arranged in it. Each jet has a small heating element embedded in it. When it heats up bubbles are formed in the ink and, as they expand, ink is forced through the jet onto the page as it passes over the printhead. Different arrangements of jets work together to form different characters and shapes. They are quieter than dot matrix printers, and produce much betterquality print. However, when you run out of ink you have to replace the whole cartridge and currently these are quite expensive. This makes inkjet more expensive to run than dotmatrix machines. Also, because theyre not impact printers you cant use them to print carbon copies or multipart forms. boxThermal fusion This type of printer is a fairly new entry on the consumer market. Like dot matrix printers, they use inked ribbons, but the ink is transferred to the page using heat rather than the impact of pins. An array of tiny heating elements on the printhead selectively melts portions of the ink compound, which stick to the page as the printhead passes over it, forming shapes and images. Like the inkjet, this form of printing produces highquality print and, as it doesnt use impact to transfer the ink to the page, is generally very quiet but cant print carbon copies. The technology it uses allows the printhead to be very small, so suitable for portable printers. At the moment it has two main drawbacks its slow printing speed and the price of the special ribbons it requires, but this price may change if these printers capture a larger market share. PAPER HANDLING FEATURES As well as their very different technologies, the printers we tested varied greatly in their paper handling capability. The features for feeding paper that are built into a printer depend on the use for which it was designed. The two types of paper these printers can handle are cut sheet andor continuous forms. Cut sheet refers to single sheets of paper, like those used for typing and photocopying. Some printers come with a cut sheet feeder, which holds a stock of sheets and feeds them into the printer one at a time as needed. On others, you can buy one as an optional extra. Without a cut sheet feeder, youd have to feed sheet paper into the printer a sheet at a time very tedious if you have to print long documents. Continuous forms are stacks of joined paper perforated at each page so sheets can be separated easily. Holes in tearoff sections on each side of the page fit over spikes on the wheels of a tractor mechanism on the printer as the wheels turn the paper is either pushed or pulled continuously through the printer. The advantages of push vs pull feeding are discussed on page A continuous forms tractor allows you to load a whole box of paper at once. This kind of paper is cheaper, so is good for anyone who prints out many drafts. With a tractor, you can also print labels and multipart forms. If youre short of desk space it may matter to you whether the paper loads from top or bottom, front or rear the printer profiles detail this. PITCH AND TYPEFACE SETTINGS Most printers have a selection of different typefaces the number available on each printer we tested is listed in the table. Each typeface can usually be printed in a wide range of sizes, known as pitches. The standard pitch is 10 characters per inch cpi, and most typefaces can be printed in a variety of sizes from 10 to 20 cpi and a variety of proportional sizes. We didnt rate the printers in our test on the range of typefaces and sizes available, as the value of these depends on the individual needs of the user. If you need a particular typeface on your printer, check with the dealer before you buy. Some printers allow you to buy extra typefaces in the form of cartridges, which you plug in. With many modern computer software programs for example Microsoft Windows the range of typefaces available depends on the software, rather than those supplied with the printer. You can increase the number of typefaces available by downloading them into the printers memory. This means the shape of the letters is controlled by software, and you can either buy a typeface software program offtheshelf, or design and program the shapes yourself. Again, if youre interested in these, check with the dealer before buying. Which type and model of printer is best depends on what you want to do with it. You need to work out which factors matter most to you do you want really good text print quality, a fast printer, or one that does greatquality graphics While the very small ones look appealing, they can be inconvenient to use so would be unsuitable for people who wanted to print large documents or lots of copies, for example. Weve worked out our recommendations for three different scenarios. If none of them matches your requirements you can use the information in the table to find the best printer for you. For people who are short of space, the dimensions of each printer are included in its profile. box If you want a highquality cut sheet printer to print letters on letterhead paper, reports or newsletters, where good presentation is important, for example you would probably want a printer with dashHigh print quality, particularly in text mode but reasonably good also for graphics. dashHighcapacity cut sheet feeder, preferably built in. Using these criteria, the following printers are recommended Brandmodel in rank order Price HEWLETT PACKARD DJ 500 550639 BROTHER HJ1001 565920 equal CANON BJ10ex 565850 OLIVETTI JP 150 595650 EPSON LQ100 399599 The HEWLETT PACKARD achieved the best overall score in our test, and comes with a cut sheet feeder. The CANON, BROTHER and OLIVETTI, all inkjet printers, have good print quality but you would need to purchase the optional cut sheet feeder to make printing larger print runs convenient otherwise the only option is feeding single sheets by hand The EPSON LQ100s print quality was not as good as the other four especially for graphics, but its the best of the dot matrix printers for text mode and comes with a builtin cut sheet feeder. Given its low running costs, it may be a good choice for some people with these needs. boxFor general home or small business use, most people would probably want a printer that dashHas versatile paper handling options tractor for continuous forms, and cut sheet feeder. dashIs reasonably fast, particularly in draft mode. dashIs cheap to run.

All the other models have a builtin tractor feeder, with a cut sheet feeder as an optional extra. box If you need portability, and may need to use the printer when you dont have access to mains power, you would need a printer that dashCan run on battery power. dashIs small and lightweight. Based on these criteria the following are recommended Brandmodel in rank order Price BROTHER HJ1001 565920 equal CANON BJ10ex 565850 CITIZEN PN48 499595 While five of the printers tested could be batteryoperated and were reasonably portable, the CANON BJ10ex and the BROTHER HJ1001 which are technically identical machines were clearly the best of them. The CITIZEN is a lot smaller and lighter, but much slower over 1 12 minutes to print a page and the CANONs and BROTHERs running costs are lower. The SEIKOSHA LT20 and TANDY DMP310 are also able to be batteryoperated. They are virtually identical, with builtin cut sheet feeders, but are large and heavy compared with the other three. Their print quality is lower, and they are quite noisy when in use they also had the two lowest overall scores yet were similarly priced to the other three. On the other hand, the cut sheet feeder is only an optional extra with the CANON, BROTHER and CITIZEN. The SEIKOSHA LT20 was the only printer we tested that came with a rechargeable battery pack. You can buy one as an optional extra for the other three. THE RIGHT DRIVER SOFTWARE PACKAGES are generally linked to printers via a printer driver. This is a program which acts as interpreter, enabling computers to tell printers what to do. Many software producers put out a whole range of special drivers for particular printers, so check when youre buying a printer whether your software has the right driver. In some cases, a printer will be compatible with more than one driver, but will achieve the best results with the driver designed particularly for it. The two EPSON models we tested are an example of this. Both can be used with any EPSON driver, but also support a new control language called ESC PThis is an enhancement of the older driver used by EPSON printers and includes a different graphics mode, enables these printers to implement scalable fonts and has other additional features. We didnt test the EPSON models using the ESC P2 driver because, as its only recently been developed, its only available on the latest versions of popular software packages. However, it should be pointed out that if these two printers are used with ESC P2 some enhanced features become available and the quality of the print in graphics mode is claimed to be improved. PROFILES Models listed in the three What to buy lists are profiled here in overall rank order."

        "text": "The ecological impact of Phytophthora cinnamomi in the Stirling Range National Park, Western Australia R.T. WILLS Department of Conservation and Land Management, Science and Information Division, WA Herbarium, PO Box 104, Como, WA 6152, Australia Abstract An assessment of the impact of the soilborne pathogenic fungus, Phytophthora cinnamomi Oomycetes, Peronosporales, on the plant communities of the Stirling Range National Park was carried out between December 1988 and April A total of 541 plant species were collected, with the Proteaceae and the Myrtaceae the two largest families in the study region. Of the 330 species assessed for susceptibility to P. cinnamomi, 118 36 were recorded as having at least some individuals in a population judged to have been killed by the fungus and 33 10 were highly sensitive to the pathogen more than 80 of plants in a population killed. Several families had large numbers of susceptible species, while others were apparently unaffected by the pathogen. Notably, 85 of proteaceous species assessed were rated as susceptible to P. cinnamomi. Proteaceous elements had a mean projective foliage cover of 40 in healthy plant communities, but had a mean cover of only 10 at sites that had a long history of infestation with the fungus. In contrast, some species with low levels of susceptibility to the pathogen, such as some monocotyledons, were found to be more abundant at oldinfested sites than at healthy sites. Growth form may also influence susceptibility, with herbaceous perennials, annuals and geophytes assessed in this survey apparently unaffected by the fungus whereas 48 of woody perennials surveyed were susceptible. Changes in the floristic structure of plant communities may influence the composition of associated animal communities. In particular, vertebrate flower visitors may be vulnerable since 59 of the species with vertebratepollinated flowers were found to be susceptible to the pathogen. This research highlights the serious ecological impact of P. cinnamomi on native plant communities and suggests that significant components of the flora and associated fauna of the southwest of Western Australia are endangered by this virulent pathogen. INTRODUCTION The degradation of plant communities by the soilborne pathogenic fungus, Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands Oomycetes, Peronosporales, is a serious problem in the southwest of Western Australia. Many plant species are susceptible to the pathogen, and important families include a large number of susceptible species. In 1980, P. cinnamomi had been isolated from 967 plant species worldwide, with nearly half of these records from Australia Zentmyer 1980. In Western Australia, most species known to be susceptible to this exotic invader are in the Proteaceae, Papilionaceae, Mimosaceae, and Epacridaceae Malajczuk Glenn 1981 Shearer Tippett 1989 Hill 1990. Monocotyledons have rarely been recorded as hosts Zentmyer 1980 and, except for a few highly susceptible species Podger 1972,Kennedy Weste 1986 Podger Brown 1989, have usually been regarded as resistant to the pathogen. However the fungus is exceedingly invasive and is capable of infecting many of the socalled resistant species so that even these species will act as hosts Cahill et al. 1989. For example, the primary symptom of infection formation of necrotic lesions in the root is frequently observed in monocotyledons, but rapid root regeneration, usually by lateral root growth behind the zone of infection, contributes to the survival of those species Phillips Weste 1984. Thus, in the case of P. cinnamomi, the term resistant has been applied to many species that, in the field, show no obvious secondary symptoms of the disease chlorosis, canopy dieback, andor death, but which may suffer a decrease in productivity Weste Marks 1987 Cahill et al. 1989. Only a few species have been found which can completely inhibit fungal growth from the point of inoculation Tippett et al. 1985, and only these can be regarded as truly resistant to the pathogen. As the fungus invades the conducting elements of the plant, killing the phloem and cambium, and causing the failure of root conductance Weste Marks 1987, species that are killed by the fungus die largely as a result of drought. Further information on the biology of P. cinnamomi can be found in three recently published reviews Weste Marks 1987 Dell Malajczuk 1989 Shearer Tippett 1989. In Western Australia, canopy dieback in jarrah Eucalyptus marginata caused by P. cinnamomi can result in loss of productivity and may lead to the death of extensive areas of jarrah Podger et al. 1965 Shearer Shea 1987. Thus, the pathogen is commonly named jarrah dieback, even though many species in the understorey may be killed several years before the first symptoms are apparent in individual jarrah trees. Investigations into the impact of the fungus have been conducted mainly in areas of State Forest and have only examined a few key species Malajczuk Glenn 1981 Shearer Hill 1989 Shearer Tippett 1989. Consequently, little is known of the susceptibility of many native plant species to infection by P. cinnamomi Shearer et al. 1988, particularly species of the kwongan communities of the Northern and Southern Sandplains. These regions have long been recognized for their floristic richness and high degree of endemism Hooker 1859 Diels 1906 Gardner 1944 Speck 1958 Hopper 1979. Much of the richness and endemism is centred on two nodes of diversity in the Mt LesueurEneabba region of the Northern Sandplain and the Stirling RangeFitzgerald River region in the Southern Sandplain George et al. 1979 Hopper 1979 Griffin et al. 1983, 1990 Hopkins et al. 1983 Lamont et al. 1984. The Stirling Range National Park, an area already severely infested, was selected for preliminary studies to assess the possible impacts of P. cinnamomi on the wider range of kwongan communities of the Southern Sandplain. Information on files of the now defunct National Parks Authority and the Forest Department, held by the Department of Conservation and Land Management at the Como State Operations Headquarters and the Manjimup Research Centre, Western Australia, record that P. cinnamomi was found throughout the Stirling Range by the 1970s. CSIRO researchers isolated P. cinnamomi from the Stirling Range National Park before May 1974 and noted that there were dottedlinefour large, distinct areas of dieback in the Park dottedlineand many smaller areas dottedline. Photographs of fire research plots at the eastern end of the Park taken in October 1973 show a floristic structure characteristic of the oldinfested plant communities observed in the present study see later. This would suggest that the pathogen had already infested these communities for many years. It seems probable that the construction of management tracks in the mid or late 1960s before the establishment of disease hygiene practices was a major cause of the widespread dispersal of the fungus. It is not possible to determine if the pathogen was introduced or already present at the time of road construction. The objectives of this research were to investigate the distribution and abundance of the flora of the Stirling Range National Park, assess the susceptibility of plant species to P. cinnamomi in a range of plant community types, and examine the ecological impact of the pathogen. METHODS Study area The Stirling Range is a high, rugged chain of mountains of metamorphosed sandstone and shale with a local relief of about 900 m. The tallest peak Bluff Knoll is 1096 m above sea level Muhling Brakel 1985. There is little soil development on the steep slopes, although pockets of shallow, acid peatysands are found Hopkins et al. 1983. Colluvium consisting of sand, silt and clay is found on the lower slopes and valleys with heavier sandy loams deposited in water courses in the deep valleys Muhling Brakel 1985. Laterites are also to be found, generally on the surrounding plains and pediments, the highly weathered soil profiles with massive and pisolitic laterite including both in situ and clastic types interbedded with sandstone Muhling Brakel 1985. The region encompassing the Stirling Range has a true Mediterranean climate sensu Aschmann 1973. It has an annual rainfall between 275 and 900 mm, with over 65 falling in six winter months wettest months MayOctober, and with one month having a mean temperature below 15degreeC MayOctober. The Stirling Range is on the boundary of three botanical districts Avon, Roe, and Eyre. Kwongan is the predominant type of vegetation, although woodland, open woodland and samphire and sedge communities are also important in the region Beard 1979. Presently, almost 1000 species of vascular plants have been recorded from the Stirling Range with about 60 endemic species Keighery 1985. Floristic data Collections of plant species were made between December 1988 and April 1989 at 56 sites, selected to represent all vegetation types of Beard 1979 and land surfaces Muhling Brakel 1985 throughout the Stirling Range. Collections were made in an area of about 50 x 50 m in both healthy and diseaseaffected plant communities. The primary native pollinator of all species was determined by opportunistic observation of pollinator visitations in the field and inference from floral morphology, and confirmed by information from the literature when available. Voucher specimens are held at the WA Herbarium, Department of Conservation and Land Management. Nomenclature follows that of Green 1985. It should be noted that, due to substantial falls of rain, some tracks remained muddy during the study and, to avoid the risk of spreading the fungus, were not surveyed. During the survey, seven peaks Bluff Knoll, Donnelly Peak, Moir Hill, Mt Hassell, Mt Trio, Toll Peak, Toolbrunup Peak were visited. The locations of sites with plants diagnosed as dying i.e. highly chlorotic or recently killed i.e. retaining chlorotic leaves by P. cinnamomi were mapped. Soil and root tissue samples were taken from plants at selected sites diagnosed as infested with the pathogen. Soil samples were baited with Eucalyptus sieberi cotyledons Marks Kassaby 1974 and roots were plated onto selective Tsao Guy 1977 halfstrength potatodextrose agar, incubated for 2 days at 24degreeC, and examined for the presence of P. cinnamomi. Additional observations of the distribution of the fungus as indicated by dead or dying plants were made during an aerial survey. Two observers were flown for 3 h at a height of 500 m in two circuits around the main body of the Stirling Range and within the body of the range following Stirling Range Drive west of Hostellers Hills. In this way, many of the foothills surrounding the peaks of the Stirling Range within the boundary of the National Park were surveyed by air. The approximate location of an area of plant deaths was estimated from geographic features and plotted on a 1100 000 scale topographic map of the Stirling Range National Park. Species susceptibility to P. cinnamomi The field susceptibility of plant species to P. cinnamomi was quantified by observation during the ground survey. Whenever deaths were observed, an estimate of the proportion of a population killed at a diseased site was recorded, and used to rate plant susceptibility to the fungus on a scale of 112 and divided into four categories of susceptibility field resistant no secondary symptoms chlorosis, canopy dieback, andor death apparent low susceptibility generally less than20 killed at any location, andor other secondary symptoms observed variable susceptibility 2080 killed varying with location and high susceptibility generally gt80 killed Table 1. The method applies the same number of categories as the rating system of McCredie et al. 1985 and parallels Podger and Brown 1989, but incorporates a rating of reliability of the evidence used in assessing species susceptibility. A good evidence rating for a species is based on several observations of the presenceabsence of secondary symptoms in plants at diseaseaffected sites. A limited evidence rating is based on only one observation of disease symptoms in plants at diseaseaffected sites in addition to that inferred an inferred evidence rating is an estimate of susceptibility based on consistent trends in susceptibility of other species from the same genera, or derived from the conspicuous absence of species in diseased areas when compared with nearby healthy plots. The lowest rating was assigned to plants known to be field resistant, and the highest rating to plants known to be most susceptible. Impact of P.cinnamomi on floristic structure Nineteen of the 56 sites examined in the ground survey were selected as representative of the range of plant communities and used to compare the floristic structure at i healthy sites ii newinfested sites those with dying and recently killed species but no old deaths present infestation probably in previous year and iii oldinfested sites located in areas known from records to have been infected sice the mid 1970s."

        "text": "8th February, 1993 FILE NO PP1 Mr Mrs A E Palmer 83 Carlton Parade PUNCHBOWLNSW2196 Dear Jean, Attached please find our updated quarterly report on the investments you hold. As an additional service, I have included a summary of our views on the economic climate and key investment sectors. THE ECONOMY Australias economic fortunes over the next few months will depend largely on the outcomes of the economies of Europe, Japan and the US. Western Europe, led by Germany and Japan which comprise over 40 of the worlds economic activity are now into recessionary mode, while the US which makes up around 30 of world economic activity is showing a glimmer of recovery. Australias aspirations for quick economic growth are unlikely to be fulfilled unless stimulus is received from other countries that demand our products. In previous reports, I foreshadowed that a weak US recovery would be hard pressed to pull the world into rapid growth. This event is now unfolding. 1993 therefore looks to be a year where global economic activity may slow further in the first half and then start to recover in the second half when the US consumer demand starts to get stronger and provides a boost to the manufacturing and exporting industry of Europe and Japan. Global growth will then gather momentum and strengthen into On the Australian front, uncertainty over the timing and possible result of the election continues to sway investor sentiment. Activity remains muted while investors sit on the fence, and markets show wide fluctuations in value on small trading in the lead up to the election. An economic recovery in Australia against the global trend will result in higher imports as we demand more goods and services, but it will also mean lower exports and lower prices for our exports as world demand remains stifled. This will lead to a worsening of our balance of payments position and put pressure on the Australian dollar, which appears risky, even thought it has already weakened by around 10 last year against our major trading partners and could weaken over the short term. Over an 8 month to one year horizon however, commodity prices could start to increase and support our currency causing it to strengthen. While we are not exactly out of the woods yet, definite signals are coming through that the much awaited world economic recovery is likely to occur around late 1993 or early Share markets generally act in advance so while the next two to three months may provide mixed signals, we can expect the share market to begin strengthening from the late first quarter to the middle of 1993 in anticipation of better times ahead. Market timing is rarely successful, so assets should start to be placed now and positioned to capture rises in share markets and possibly in bond markets as well. Bonds will benefit because inflation will stay low and capital inflows may occur from overseas to capture gains from a strengthening Australian dollar. This could result in capital gains for bonds. INVESTMENT SECTORS Australian Shares Continued low inflation, significantly improved productivity and low interest rates are beginning to result in higher corporate profits and hence improve share prices. These trends are expected to continue as the recovery develops momentum. Stock selection is becoming increasingly important. With substantial provisioning for bad debts by major banks having been announced, a lot of the bad news is now out and prospects from here are better. However, confidence will remain unsettled until clear signals of global economic recovery are seen. Now seems a good time to invest in this sector as prices are fairly depressed, and fine tuning the timing of your entry into the market is fraught with risk. Australian Dollar After falling significantly in response to weaker commodity prices, rising foreign debt and a deteriorating trade balance, the Australian dollar appears to be stabilising. As the world economy recovers and demand for Australian commodities strengthens, the Australian dollar could strengthen particularly against European currencies. However on a fundamental basis, weakness against the US dollar is possible. INVESTMENT PRODUCT UPDATE Capital Stable Funds We continue to expect these to outperform capital guaranteed funds over the next two years by 23 each year. You may have noticed that small negative returns appear in these funds from time to time. This occurs when the different markets weaken sharply. While short term volatility may increase in the lead up to the Federal Election, these fluctuations should not overly concern you as Capital Stable funds are designed with the objective of providing stability and positive returns over periods of one year and beyond. Balanced and Growth Funds These funds have assets spread over the major asset sectors property, shares and fixed interest. As a result of their higher weighting in shares, we continue to expect that they will outperform other investment alternatives over the next 23 years at least. You should take a longer term view at least 5 years when investing in these funds. Property Trusts RetireInvest is constantly reviewing all Property Trusts, and currently recommends retention of these investments for the time being. Income distributions, on average have been attractive over the last 12 months. These may not be sustainable, although we believe they will still be better than cash investments. Growth Equities Mutual have again revalued the Collins Street Trust since your last review. The current downturn in the Melbourne office property market has led to a further decrease in the value of the Trusts property assets. Growth Equities believes that the value will be restored once the economy and the property market stabilises. Social Security Changes Affecting Pensioners A LARGE BLACK DOT Increase in Age Pension The age pension increased by 00 per fortnight for single pensioners, and 00 per fortnight for a married couple. This increase was effective from 28 January A LARGE BLACK DOT Fringe Benefits now available to all pensioners The special Income and Assets Test for fringe benefits for pensioners will be abolished from 1 April This means that from April, all pensioners will be eligible for Fringe Benefits, regardless of whether they receive a part, or full pension. Other Matters Over the last year or so, there have been many changes in the investment world as well as a multitude of changes to taxation and social security guidelines. I have enclosed a Review Information form which, when completed will allow us to update our records and enable us to prepare your portfolio reviews as well as possibly alerting us to any problems or opportunities that may be relevant to your situation. If you have any questions about this review, please contact my assistant Lyn who will be happy to help you. Please quote your file number which is located at the top of page 1 under the date. If she is unable to help she will let me know if you wish to alter your investment strategy or discuss any aspect further. Yours sincerely, Mike. MICHAEL MANT MANAGER Authorised Representative RETIREINVEST PTY LTD mmlf Disclaimer Whilst every effort has been made to ensure that the information contained in your report and this letter is correct, because of frequent changes in economic conditions, legislation, and your personal requirements, I caution you not to take any investment action without checking the proposed action with me. 14th May 1993 FILE NO PP1 Mr Mrs A E Palmer 83 Carlton Parade PUNCHBOWLNSW 2196 Dear Jean, Attached please find our updated quarterly report on the investments you hold. As an additional service, I have included a summary of our views on the economic climate and key investment sectors. THE ECONOMY The reelected Labor government is giving priority to attempts to kickstartkickstart the economy. A mildly expansionary 199394 Federal Budget is expected. To gain maximum impact from the expected spending initiatives of the Budget the government is considering bringing the Budget forward to the first half of the calendar year rather than the traditional August Budget. The governments emphasis on growth at all costs is being perceived as irresponsible and is unsettling financial markets particularly the bond and currency market. The government must formulate plans that will encourage local savings so that our dependence on foreign capital is reduced. Tough measures to contain government spending over the next 35 years are required for confidence in currency and bond markets to return. The benefits of low inflation which result in stable prices, a firm dollar and competitive industries can then flow into the marketplace. The March Balance of Payments figures came in at a disappointing 132 billion seasonally adjusted. Imports jumped up by 16 on a seasonally adjusted basis from last month, while exports declined and the trade balance went into a 709 million deficit from a 389 million surplus in the previous month. This is expected to rule out any interest rate cut in the near future. In reaction to the balance of payments figures, the Australian dollar fell to US World economic growth is expected to resume in a concerted manner from late 1993 or early This will support Australias economy and the profitability of our businesses. As sharemarkets generally act in advance we can expect further strengthening in the sharemarket during Overseas investors are now returning to the Australian sharemarket as some major US brokers are recommending the purchase of Australian shares in preference to shares in a number of other sharemarkets. INVESTMENT SECTORS Australian Shares Continued low inflation, significantly improved productivity and low interest rates are beginning to result in higher corporate profits and hence improved share prices. These trends are expected to continue as the recovery develops momentum. Stock selection is becoming increasingly important Tax initiatives by the government and increasing overseas support could result in a stronger sharemarket. Now seems a good time to invest in this sector for the long term as fine tuning the timing of your entry into the market is fraught with risk. Property With the economy forecast to grow by only a modest 5 per cent over 199293 and to pick up only gradually from there, there will not be sufficient growth in employment to reduce the excess supply of CBD office buildings for several years. Moreover, the latest valuations suggest that office buildings particularly in Sydney are continuing to decline in value. Specific sectors such as industrial property and regional shopping centres may benefit from any improvement in consumer and investor sentiment. Diversification and buying below replacement cost will be the key to successful investment in property in the 1990s. Australian Dollar After strengthening in the first quarter of 1993 the Australian dollar is again weakening due to concerns over the size of the budget deficit and Australias low rate of domestic savings. However, as the world economy recovers later in 199394 and demand for Australian commodities strengthens, the Australian dollar could strengthen particularly against European currencies. However on a fundamental basis, further weakness against the US dollar and Japanese Yen is possible. INVESTMENT PRODUCT UPDATE Property Trusts Growth Equities Mutual The Grosvenor Trust holds a 30 interest in the Grosvenor Place Building, George Street, Sydney and has been recently listed on the Stock Exchange. You should now hold units in a listed property trust and you have the option of selling your units on the share market, if you require liquidity. Please contact me before you sell. A unitholder meeting for both the Growth Equities Mutual 580 George Street Trust and Collins Street Trust held on 27 January 1993 approved numerous restructuring proposals. The 580 George Street Trust which comprises the Coopers and Lybrand Tower, 580 George Street, Sydney has been renamed the GEM Commercial Property Trust. This trust will be expanded by additional buildings being added to the trust and this larger trust will be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Your manager of the Collins Street Trust will redevelopredevelop and amalgamate the existing properties. Your trust will be structured into a suitable vehicle that can be listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. Listing is not expected to occur in the near future."

        "text": "cover story The Underclass Australias social time bomb Australias spreading pool of poverty was not an issue in the election campaign, but its one of the first problems the new government must face. There are beggars in our city streets, and chronically deprived people in suburban and rural areas. Poverty and disadvantage are being passed to a new generation, creating a breed of outlaw children who reject all help. Lyndall Crisp details the issue no party has faceddotted line The Underclass is Australias permanent poor, but it is much more than that. Apart from the urban street kids who get publicity, the Underclass today is very different from 20 years ago. The numbers are certainly bigger but more importantly, our society safety net seems unable to protect the newest recruits the middleaged unemployed family man, single mothers and those isolated in the badlyserviced outer suburbs of modern sprawling cities. The Underclass includes the socially disadvantaged, from the Aboriginals and the handicapped to the abused, the homeless and the mentally disturbed who have been left adrift in the community by state governments concerned with saving money. They are the single mothers isolated in inaccessible, sterile public housing suburbs or high rise flats, and the migrants who cannot speak English or find a permanent job. Dislocated and lonely, many fail to call on established public support systems. They do not know the systems exist, or feel too intimidated or hostile to make the approach. At least the Department of Housing, recognising that the cost of a decent house is nothing compared with the cost of supporting a dysfunctional family for perhaps 30 or 40 years, is reversing a long tradition of building public housing ghettoes where such social problems propagate. But for many, the hardships they endure are passed from one generation to the next. It is not just a matter of being poor their values and behaviour can be askew. Alcoholism is not uncommon, health is neglected and truancy runs unchecked. Too often, the abused becomes the abuser, the dole cheque is familiar to both father and son, the single mother watches her single teenage daughter playing with her new baby. What is intriguing, and even more worrying, is the gradual emergence of a new substratum a breed of young people who expect society to provide them with the lifestyle of their choice without their giving anything back.They feel no obligation to work and thumb their noses at most traditional social structures they are a problem for society but not for themselves. These are the kids who are prepared to live on the street, to exist on petty crime, to sleep rough, sell their bodies, play with drugs. They reject any notion of accountability and embrace daytoday existence which often means premature death. Their numbers are less than has been suggested by some social commentators, but they are increasing, particularly in the Kings Cross area of Sydney. It seems only a matter of time before they emerge in other cities, as they have in Britain and the US. In the worst cases they resort to a type of crime now not uncommon a mutilation murder, for example, that is so horrific it defies the imagination. Youth counsellors working with street kids talk about them hurtling from day to day, kids who are totally feraldotted lineand, something scary happening out there. A number of these kids profess to be happy, they neither want our sympathy and help, nor do they hanker for a more stable, comfortable lifestyle. If it turns out this unique section of The Underclass is the natural progression, the end result, of the other, familiar stratas, then what is the answer With the chronic lack of affordable housing, fewer and fewer unskilled jobs, cuts in social welfare support systems and an everincreasing cost of living, the Federal and photo caption state governments seem to be encouraging membership of The Underclass rather than inhibiting it. Bob Hawke rang the warning bells as long ago as In his Boyer lecture, The Resolution of Conflict, he said There is an insidious tendency to identify the unemployed as the architects of their own misfortune to attribute to them some intrinsic inferiority either of character or intensity of purposedotted lineMore and more of our people, especially the young and underprivileged, will be increasingly susceptibledotted lineif we do not provide them with employment or security with a sense of fulfilment. If we do no do this we have no right to demand or expect their adherence to the values of a free society. The former president of the Australian Council of Social Services, Julian Disney, says the main differences between todays socalled Underclass and that of the 70s is the blowout in the number of sole parents and the number of unemployed heads of family. In the early 80s, the number of children dependent on unemployed parents increased by at least 50. A major factor in all this is drugs. The major blowout in crime was drugs and the major cause of drug use is unhappiness and dissatisfaction, and family breakdown. Were putting more pressure on the basic family unit than ever before in recorded history. We have totally unrealistic expectations of couples and couples are being left on their own without an extended family around them Its the single greatest cause in the breakdown of human relations and therefore people have no great incentive or enthusiasm. What weve got to do, over the next 10 years, is strengthen the family unit. Families where there are two incomes are now established. Weve got to move to what I call the threequarter income family, where one works full time, the other part time and then swap around so couples have more time for their kids and each other. Disney says yuppie twoincome families drive up housing prices which in turn increases the pressure on lowincome families. He thinks middle Australia has ridiculous expectations of life and unnecessary luxuries. It angers me greatly when I hear people complaining about the lowering of living standards. The test is not to study disposable income trends but sales of microwaves, VCRs and second car sales. Were an affluent country. Another problem, says Disney, is that Australia is one of the few developed countries with such an imbalance in population distribution. There should be a higher proportion of Australians living outside Sydney and Melbourne and we must develop more provincial towns, like Newcastle and Wollongong, if we want to keep generous home property areas, low density cities and housing prices down. Brian Howe, who has held the Social Security portfolio for six years, says he is resisting a sense of hopelessness. I dont see it like that. When you start writing off groups of people, thats a theory of poverty which is to do with culture. It suggests theres some culture which prevents people getting opportunities. Its not so much a culture as, for example, very bad housing policies where you put such people together. That does make it hopeless because its a multideficit situation where there are so many negatives that its very difficult to create positives. If we have ghettoes well create a sense of hopelessness. Many of Australias social problems, says Howe, are related to the extremely high levels of unemployment during the 80s and the fact that people outside the mainstream did not have access to jobs when they did become available. Part of the answer is to put together a package of services, such as better transport and childcare centres, so these people, especially sole parents, can get to jobs and training courses. Services should be relevant and situated where they are most needed they should get to people before their problems reach crisis stage. The Commonwealth could help people to know what is available, and educate them to use the facilities and that its normal to feel stressed living in the framework of a big city, says Howe. A lot of the publicity about poverty tends to be a bit romantic, people talk about it as if its exciting in some way. Whereas the problem of poverty is the grinding normality of being stuck out in these ordinary suburbs without the most basic facilities and without people being able to participate. Its not that theyre horrible, terrible places theyre normal, leafy streets in which everything looks hunky dory. But behind the curtains youve got a lot of tension and difficulties. Those street kids When it comes to the homeless and street kids some questionable statistics are bandied about. A popular figure in the media late last year for kids living on Sydneys Kings Cross streets where the greatest concentration has always been was 12, In February 1989, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commissions inquiry into homeless children that is, children whose lifestyle includes insecurity and transiency of shelter said its independent consultant, Dr Rodney Fopp, found that at the very least there were, nationally, 8500 homeless 12to15 year olds and 3500 16 and 17yearolds, over any twelve month period. Given that, according to 1987 statistics, more than 9000 Australian households 26,790 people live in improvised dwellings and another 93,641 households almost 200,000 live in caravans and other temporary shelter, Fopp put the total number of homeless children, including children at risk of being homeless, at somewhere between 50,000 and 70,The Inquiry considered the estimates to be extremely conservative. Government welfare agency staff and community workers are puzzled by the numbers, much quoted by the media. They ask who is doing the head count How are they doing it Where are these hordes of kids hanging out Common sense alone would suggest that an area as small as Kings Cross could not support 12,000 freeranging children. Annie Crowe and Ian Hood, who have worked with kids in Kings Cross for more than 10 years, say the figure for the inner city area is closer to The number fluctuates because the kids move around and the plethora of religious, volunteer, council and government aid agencies it has become a growth industry since the spread of AIDS became a significant concern in 1985 are often counting the same heads. Its a wonder were not battering each other to death to get the last one, says Crowe. A youth worker tells of the time he approached a distressed teenage boy at Sydneys Central Railway Station late one evening. The boy said he had seen a television program about thousands of street kids and had come to town to join them. But after wandering around all day, he had not been able to find one. Much has been written about street kid. Their stories are often tragic and should never be demeaned, but many are wildly exaggerated for the benefit of the media. At the Cross, the kids even have a fee scale for interviews. Any TV crew looking for talent has to fight off the volunteers, each experienced in what constitutes a sensational grab and how to cough, wheeze, weep photo or sigh whatever is appropriate on cue. It is a joke among the youth workers. Last December, a minister of the Uniting Church, Bill Crews, wrote a letter to a prominent newspaper in which he said many of these kids are totally feral. They restlessly wander all night because they are afraid to sleep in the dark. Theyd rather travel to our refuge via the roofs and drains of Sydneydotted linethan use the front door. These kids are getting progressively more violent. The Bulletin asked to meet these feral kids but it was not to be. One meeting was arranged at a refuge, a derelict house between a vacant allotment and a car park, but no one showed. Crews later explained that, unfortunately, all the kids he had lined up had that very morning been nabbed by the police for armed robbery. On February 9 the same newspaper ran a big picture on its front page of a bunch of street kids sleeping under the Sydney Town Hall steps. The picture looked suspiciously posed, with one child grinning. The story failed to make mention that it was supplied by Crews and while supposed to illustrate the news that the numbers had swelled alarmingly since Christmas, was in fact taken last year. Be that as it may, the problem exists and cannot be swept under the carpet. What youth workers Crowe and Hood emphasise, and what is probably most frightening, is that while some of these kids have not had an even break since the day they were born, others come from average, middleclass families where there is no hint of violence or abuse."

        "text": "Courage They spell it C.A.T.S Flag path plotted in field of desire By GLENN MCFARLANE GEELONG buried the fragile image when it shoved Carlton out of the premiership race with a 33point victory at Waverley yesterday. In one of the most courageous finals wins in memory, the Cats won after losing three stars before the start of yesterdays semifinal. Those who arrived at the ground early yesterday gave the Cats little chance of staying in the race for its first flag in 31 years. For it was early that the whispers were out OUT dotted line Brownlow Medal fancy Garry Hocking, captain Mark Bairstow and 1989 Brownlow Medallist Paul Couch. Into the team came veteran Tim Darcy, onegame rookie Aaron Lord and fringe player Sean Simpson. Geelong fans would have been excused for packing their bags and heading home before the first bounce. But most of them, and the rest of the 53,000 there hadnt reckoned on sheer mental and physical desire coupled with outstanding play. And all plotted by a match committee courageous enough not to risk injured players. The result was that the Cats surprised everyone and controlled the match all day. Victory and the possible return of the three stars next week lifted them into a preliminary final showdown against North Melbourne. For Carlton, it was the end of 1994 a shattering conclusion to a year that promised so much, but delivered even less than last year. Geelong showed desire, speed and spirit to outpoint Carlton. Its courage was everywhere, right down to two players on the interchange bench injured during the game. Strong contributors Peter Riccardi and Grant Tanner were forced to watch the emphatic last quarter from the sidelines. Tanner set the early initiative for Geelong with a blistering opening quarter in the middle. He took on and beat Adrian Gleeson, winning 11 possessions in the first quarter. Tanners influence was later dampened by Andrew McKay before he was injured in the third quarter. But the two men who stood defiant and dominant were John Barnes and Liam Pickering both rejects from other clubs. Ruckman Barnes played another slashing finals match to eclipse big man Justin Madden and rookie Matthew Allan. He beat allcomers in ruck duels and around the ground. Barnes, rated 10outof10 by Sunday Herald Sun expert Neil Roberts, was understandably exhausted on the final siren. Pickering was no less busy. Assigned the task of playing on one of the competitions best Greg Williams Pickering outpointed Williams in the first half to give Geelong a great start. Williams fought hard to get back in the match after halftime and after being reported for disputing an umpires decision just before halftime. But Pickering was not just content to keep an eye on Williams. He was so outstanding in overall matchplay that in the end his possession tally was only a few short of his decorated opponent. Gary Ablett, who captained his Cats yesterday, kicked six goals in another display worthy of high praise. His majors were crucial to Geelong, especially two late in the third quarter. As Carlton made a secondhalf charge at Geelong, Ablett stood firm with two strong marks in attack. His task was made easier by the absence of Steve Silvagni, who injured his ankle late in the first quarter and eventually came off early in the second. But Ablett had plenty of help in attack the everimproving David Mensch, Adrian Hickmott and last weeks hero, Bill Brownless. Brownless had good duels with Michael Sexton and Earl Spalding. The Blues had to rely on whatever they could get out of Williams to give them drive from the middle. Stephen Kernahan tried his hardest, but managed only a limited return. He almost got them back in the game before the Cats defence tightened again. Andrew McKay was important and probably Carltons best, along with the evertrying Matthew Hogg. Geelong took the match by the throat in the first quarter with a fourgoal blitz against the wind. Its 15point quartertime lead didnt look like diminishing early in the second. Aaron Lord gave Geelong speed and the forwards continued to get on top of the reputed rock steady Carlton defence. At halftime the margin was out to 28 points. Tanner was stretchered from the ground early in the third, forcing Geelongs first interchange move, while Carlton got the margin back to just 15 points midway through the quarter. But Geelong, through Ablett, burst the margin out to 26 at the last change. The Cats turned defensive in the last quarter, clinging desperately to the advantage, which they blew out to 33 points. It was fitting that Brownless held the ball as the siren rang. He was the man who kicked the winning goal after the siren last week against Footscray. Yesterday his kick went into the stands as he celebrated another important Geelong finals win. With the possibility of regaining the three missing players plus outstanding onballer Michael Mansfield next weekend, Geelong will go into the match against North Melbourne brimming with confidence that finally, it can break its long premiership drought. EAGLES SET PACE By MARK HARDING MICK Malthouse does not know if he will stay with West Coast beyond 1995 but with him or without him the Eagles seem set to power through the 90s with the brand of dour, tough, relentless football he has taught them. One of the features of the Eagles in their three Grand Final appearances has been the ability to keep the same group of inform players together 15 of the side that decimated Geelong yesterday took part in the 1992 flag victory. And if Malthouse has doubts about his own willingnes to continue beyond his current contract which expires at the end of next season, he has no such doubts about the ability of his men to keep going. Only fullback Michael Brennan, who has been there since the AFL created the monster Malcolm Blights words in 1987 and is the club games record holder, has expressed any doubts about continuing. And with just two 30yearolds Peter Wilson and David Hart in the side the bulk should be around for years to come. This was the Grand Final every Victorian at the MCG yesterday dreaded not so much the West Coast victory, because they left no doubt they were the worthiest of flag winners. More, it was the confirmation that Geelong had played its Grand Final before it even stepped on to the turf. Coach Malcolm Blight refused to admit that several of his stars, including Gary Ablett, went into the Grand Final well down on fitness. Instead he said the task of winning four finals was too tough. I think you always think that you can beat history, he said. But as he explained, no side had ever been able to do what was asked of the Cats and to ask it against such a professional side as the Eagles was almost ludicrous. For a while Geelong, which has been more responsible than any team for a superb finals series, kept rolling and fighting on the spirit that had taken them to two afterthesiren victories. After being jumped by the Eagles they fought back to grab a quarter time lead but from there, with Garry Hocking injured and the rest of the midfield down, they were outbussled, outtackled and outran. Malthouse tried hard to absolve himself of any responsibility for an awesome performance he praised his men for their thoroughness and dedication, sympathised with Blight and Geelong and avoided questions about his own emotions. When pressed he admitted fear of failure was still his driving force and said he was not worried by the image Victorians had of him as a dour, humorless man who did not enjoy his football. I will enjoy it with my family and friends, he said smiling. Continued Page 44 Eagles the benchmark FROM Page 43 I love watching the boys enjoy the spoils of their discipline and dedication, Malthouse said. I get a bigger kick out of the players celebrating I feel happy for them. Malthouse began his postmatch press conference by criticising pressmen who bagged him for cutting short last weeks conference to attend a basketball game. He explained his daughter was playing in her first basketball final nothing ever takes precedence over that, he said. Malthouse spoke of his family again when he said yesterdays win would not sway him in any decision he made about his future. After 1995 he will assess what is best for his family before deciding whether to come back to Victoria or seek another term with the Eagles. While nothing is permanent in footy, he could expect to have the job for as long as he wants it. The former Richmond defender has instilled an evenness and discipline in the Eagles that might not always make for attractive football, but is mighty effective on the scoreboard. Im not interested in goals for, it is goals against that worry me, he said revealing his philosophy. Ironically yesterdays tally went against the norm. The Eagles kicked 20 goals for only the second time this season and powered to their highest score for the season. In contrast Geelongs score was its lowest for the year. What tells you even more about the Eagles style of play is that they were able to kick such a massive score with their fullforward Peter Sumich badly beaten and their only other tall forward, Jason Ball, a spirited, but far from the most significant contributor. The Premiers goals came from swoopers Heady, Kemp, Wilson, Evans, Bond, Lewis and Waterman. When the Eagles won in 92, they were characterised as a group of anonymous runners every one knows who they are now, but they are still a side driven by team discipline rather than individual brilliance. Malthouse summed up the attitude when asked to pay a tribute to Norm Smith Medal winner Dean Kemp. I thought he played well, but I thought he had a lot of friends though, the coach said. Kemp indeed had friends everywhere. Probably only Michael Mansfield and Bill Brownless could claim individual victories for the Cats. The rest simply were outmuscled by a team Victorians will say had the premiership handed to them on a plate by the AFL. The reality, though, is that the best team of 1994 won the premiership. Their banner before the match declared Watch out were back. Theyll be back next year too. Rafter ready for Kiwi WIMBLEDON doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde yesterday gave Australia a 21 lead in the Davis Cup qualifying tie over New Zealand at King Edward Barracks. The world No. 2 team destroyed Kiwi parttimers Kelly Evernden and Brett Steven 63, 64, 61 in 81 scintillating minutes before a stunned capacity crowd. The victory put the tie in Australias favor and left new captain John Newcombe on the brink of his first tie success. I was confident before the match that Mark and Todd could do the job and they did, Newcombe said. They played exceptionally well, but the match was a little tighter than the score would suggest. Todd played as well as Ive ever seen him and Mark played pretty well too. The Australians, beaten in the US Open final two weeks ago and vanquished in their past two Davis Cup encounters, ruthlessly punished the Kiwis after a tense opening. Woodbridge, now unquestionably in the best form of his career, was the dominant player in a wonderful display of returning and volleying. The pair directed most of their attacks at semiactive Evernden, 33, and the plan paid immediate dividends for the first break of serve in the seventh game of the first set. At one stage, with Evernden desperately attempting to leave Cup competition on a winning note, the Australians won nine of 10 games. They just buried us, said plucky Evernden. They have such a variety of shots and tactics that its almost impossible to match them. I was hoping for better, obviously. But I cant change anything now nor would I want to. We were beaten by a far better team. Woodbridge and Woodforde endured a second set revival by the Kiwis before surging to victory. The pair saw a 51 lead dry up before Steven, unusually vulnerable on serve, again dropped his delivery against the fierce Australian returning in the 10th game."

        "text": "A Change in the Lighting bulletVIII bullet Routine was a frail net stretched over emptiness, ensuring survival, if nothing more. Pam came in for coffee on Monday morning. Ella changed the day for Ninas lesson to Tuesday, to shorten the gap which stretched to Thursday evening, when David and Martha came to dinner, bringing fish and chips and cheerful conversation. On Sunday afternoons Max and Caroline came bringing Becky. Sophie seemed to bear her burden of hatred lightly, joking with David, playing with Becky, and spending Friday nights absorbed in working on the film script with Rob. After two meals from the Small Palace Garden, Ella began to make dinner for the filmmakers. She could tolerate fish and chips once a week, but would go no further along that path. Besides, cooking filled in time, of which there was an excess. She did not admit to herself how much she wanted Robs approval. The script had now left the spiderkeeping daughter for the mother, who was obsessed by an album full of photographs, images of a divinely happy past. Mother was manipulative, brooding over the album, involving the daughter in an illusion of lost happiness so leading to hatred and funnelwebs. The photographs came to life as she talked. This was called a voiceover. They were supposed to have all the gloss and the false authority of a soft drink commercial. Ella, who listened intently, measuring herself against the mother, looking for clues to her own failure, asked, How will the audience know it isnt true Ella, my love, you have reached the nub. I sometimes wish I was William and could just tell people what I want them to know. William doesnt find it so easy, objected Sophie. I suppose not. The other media always seem so much easier than ones own. Well, people get things on different levels. Im aiming at an audience which despises soft drink commercials, I suppose. So much detail, thought Ella, like working away at some enormous jigsaw, but Sophie remained enthralled. Ella listened for the next nasty revelation of Mothers character, the next evidence of her own innocence. Rob read dialogue onto tape Darling, here we are with Daddy on the beach at Ulladulla. What a lovely holiday that was. You wouldnt remember it, you were only three. You dropped the icecream, I remember, just after I took the photo. You started to cry, but Daddy took you back to the kiosk to buy another. Rob abandoned her plaintive dreamtone to ask, How fast does a threeyearold walk Ill time Becky. Shes three. Shell be here on Sunday. Can you get me a video I think so. Max wont mind. Hes crazy about photography. Great. Leave it this week, then. Ill bring a tape next week. She paused, embarrassed but amused, being after all sure of her welcome. That is, if youll put up with me next week again, Ella. Of course. Say from your garden gate to the next corner, then pick her up and mime getting the icecream. There wont be any miming about it, if I know Becky. One icecream, to incidental expenses. Note it down. Ill contribute the icecream, said Ella, feeling quite ridiculously proud of the contribution. Right. Thats it for tonight, then. Ill be off. Shes a bright spot, thought Ella, watching her depart. Im going to be really sorry when the script is finished. bulletIX bullet After their dinner of fish and chips on Thursday night, Martha and Sophie withdrew tactfully to the kitchen sink, leaving Ella alone with David, on the pretext of an extra cup of coffee, to give them the chance to talk privately. Ella hadnt as yet taken advantage of the privacy to talk about the subject in her mind, but since the bank account was sinking dangerously, she was forced to mention money. David. He came to attention. Mum He smiled at her. Come on, spit it out. It isnt easy, talking about money, but I have to. Its about Sophie. Shes been paying full board since he left. She insisted, its just a couple of fortnights, of course, and I accepted it, though I didnt want to. I didnt want to make a fuss, but I havent spent it, Ive gone on banking it for her. We did that for you and Caroline, remember, and gave it to you when you married. But its got to the point I cant really keep the house on what hes putting in the account unless I do use Sophies money and I dont think its right. I hate worrying you about this, but if hed offer maintenance for Sophie, it would show he cared about her. I dont want her to hate her father. It isnt right. Its terrible to hear the way she talks about him. She sounds bright enough. Sobered as he was, he smiled over Sophies brightness. That makes it worse, that she can hate him and not worry about it. It seems so hardhearted. But he isnt helping. Have you written to him about it Yes, but he answered that hed made allowance for that already. He doesnt understand how much it costs to keep a house. I suppose its expensive, living in a motel and eating in restaurants and thats all he has to spare, but even if he cut into capitaldotted linehe cant want her to despise him. Dad isnt living in a motel. He hasnt been since that first week. He moved in with her but of course that wouldnt do. It was just a bachelor pad. Now shes managed to sublet it and theyve moved into a bigger unit. I had dinner there last week. Alone. Martha isnt in to doordarkening yet. Were debating the issue. I think Martha has to support me. Why am I blathering on like this Shock. Shock. I never expected this of Dad. You knew know, do you She was terrified by her anger. It was like a tall, black wave rearing, threatening herdotted lineshe could lose her footing, drown in it, and she never knew where it might be waiting to rise. Well, Max is right, after all, David was saying. He keeps on about getting a solicitor. Theres a woman he knows whos good and isnt expensive. Mary Duckworth. What do you say, Mum Shall I make an appointment with her It would take some of the weight off you. Ill talk to Dad about Sophie, too. He must want to do the same for her as he did for us. He always cared for your welfare. He never grudged you anything you needed. That orthodoncy had cost hundreds of dollars. Youre a Trojan, Mum. You wouldnt say that if you could see into my mind. You wouldnt want to know me that disgusting face coming and going like an advertising sign and not even doing its job no discharge of rage any longer. If I found myself in the same room with that lying bastard Id take an axe to him. Credit where its due, she said briefly. Its Sophie Im worried about, not your father. Some women would be trying to turn Sophie against him. He added bitterly, This business of the money its not him, its her. Id swear to that. Shes got him hypnotised. Oh, Im never going to understand it. Remembering the tone of that ones communications, Ella doubted that he was under hypnosis, but if thinking so made it easier for David, he was welcome to the idea. I dont like asking you to do this. Who else Caroline, she thought. She would have expected Caroline to show responsibility, David to slide away with an amiable, apologetic grin. No doubt, Maxs relationship with that onedotted linebeing a colleague, made it difficult for Caroline, but she had never let personal considerations stand in the way of duty till now. And Max was clearly sympathetic to her cause. People were mysterious, even ones own children. bullet X bullet Pam knocked at the open door and walked into the kitchen, where Ella was carving fine slices from a piece of raw beef. She looked up astonished and said, Friday Its slow at the moment. Enids going to ring if she needs me. Time for coffee, then I could do with a break. Thanks. Pam sat in her accustomed chair at the kitchen table while Ella set down the knife and filled the kettle. I thought Id better warn you. The news is out. Official. Ursula Rodd was in last night looking for a semiformal for one of her charity dinners. Sometimes I wonder about charity. She asked after you and I thought it was timedotted linesix weeks, isnt it It must be. To Ellas changed expression she answered, Well, time flies, as they say. No, it doesnt. Times a great heavy wheel that doesnt move at all unless you turn it by hand, with effort. Her change of expression had been caused by a different, ugly thought. I told her thered been a marriage breakup. Oh, theyve separated, you know, I said, as if it was tired old news. I was crouching at the time, pinning up the hem of a midnightblue crepe. She said, sharply, mind you, I hope this doesnt mean shell be giving up her charity work, then on and on about the difficulty of finding reliable workers and the burden falling on the few. I was trying to play it down, but I neednt have bothered. I felt like sticking a pin into her fat ankle. Six weeks. Six weeks and a couple of days. That was right. Pam said angrily, Not a thought for your feelings. I dont want her to think about my feelings. Id rather she didnt know I had any. Anyone who went about for six weeks with a face a hideous face like a great pink and purple orchid with two bulging eyes blossoming and fading, blossoming and fading, like an advertising sign running in her head such a person was mad. Are you going to Do what Give up on the charity work I should have made a wax image. Then I could have thrown it away. Like giving a baby a dummy. Mum saying, when David was a baby, You cant throw a thumb away, you know. Its ladyofthemanor stuff, love, and youre not the lady of the manor any more. Ella set down a cup of coffee with unnecessary force, so that the liquid slopped into the saucer. Sorry. She set down an ashtray with controlled gentleness. Pam said, in a subdued tone, Youve never seen yourself as the lady of the manor. Not for a minute. Nobody could think it. You think too little of yourself, if anything. I only meant, you have yourself to think of now, cant go devoting yourself to noble causes. She couldnt tell Pam, to whom she could confide most things. You could say, I have a bit of a headache, but you couldnt say, I have a touch of madness. Perhaps there were other people walking about with madness in their heads, just as much alone with it as she was. She set down her coffee. Pam had lit a cigarette and was smoking in silence. She looked for refuge at the pile of sliced beef. Kids coming tonight Sophie and her boss. This is a regular thing now till they finish their film script. Im minding Becky this afternoon, so Im getting dinner ready early. Truly, said Pam, I meant no offence. It was Ursula Rodd put the words into my head. There I was crouching at her feet like a labouring peasant while she talked about the burden of noblesse oblige. You arent in the least like her. I never thought so for a minute. Ella was suddenly aware of Pams distress. Oh, thats all right. I was thinking about something else, sorry. Maybe youd better give up crouching. They both laughed, then Ella smiled at Pams cigarette. I used to go about emptying the ashtray and squirting airfreshener and opening windows after youd been here."

        "text": "Daikyo stops 800m projects Overreaction, says Goss JAP FREEZE ON QUEENSLAND GIANT Japanese resort and development company Daikyo has halted all its new projects worth 800 million on the Gold Coast and Cairns. The company said the shock move was made because of uncertainty caused by a Trades Practices Commission inquiry into its Cairns hotel holdings. The stopwork decision involving thousands of jobs comes at a time when tourism in Queensland is experiencing a major downturn and the Cairns construction industry is on its knees. Daikyo chief executive, Sir Sydney Schubert, yesterday described the freeze as a considered move in a tricky economic climate. He strongly rejected a claim by the Premier, Mr Goss, that the company had overreacted. Mr Goss described the companys move as quite unnecessary. But Sir Sydney said Theres no use going ahead with a project until the condition is clarified. To carry on spending money on design fees and basic construction costs which might be wasted no company could afford that. Its not a petulant move to put on any pressure, its simply stating the actual position of our company. Its been well considered. Sir Sydney, speaking as he teed off at the Royal Queensland Golf Club, refused to say whether he though racist motives lay behind the TPC inquiry. He did not want to say anything that could inflame the situation, he said, but defended the freeze on new projects. In the private sector, when youre spending money which could be wasted, I dont think its an overreaction, he said. The bottom line is profit and with the present state of the tourism industry and hotels not exactly booming, you have to watch the bottom line. Daikyos shock announcement comes amid reports that another major Pacific rim trading company is set to pull out of Queensland and transfer operations to Hong Kong. There is also a question mark over 600 million worth of resort developments planned by Koshin Co for the Gold Coast after the company president was arrested in Japan for allegedly manipulating share prices. The projects Daikyo has halted include BulletA 400 million resort at Palm Cove, 26km north of Cairns, which was to have begun next week and would have employed 1800 people during construction BulletA Cairns city office tower BulletAnd the 300 million Gold Coast International Resort in the heart of Surfers Paradise. DAIKYO is by far the largest Japanese investor in Queensland and has concentrated on leisurebased investments and worldstandard golf courses. It already has a 1 billion stake in the Sunshine State, including the Brisbane Sheraton Hotel, Gold Coast International Hotel, Cairns Four Seasons, plus 50 percent of the Cairns Hilton and Cairns International, and 25 percent of Jupiters Casino and the Conrad International on the Gold Coast. Mr Goss said the Daikyo freeze was quite unnecessary and the TPC inquiry had nothing to do with the State Government. We didnt initiate it, we have got no control over it, he said. The Government had no problems with the Palm Cove project because it proposed to add something to north Queenslands tourist infrastructure, he said. However the Four Seasons deal, which the Government had opposed, would have increased Daikyos market share without adding any value to the State economy. I think that there is a clear distinction between Palm Cove and Four Seasons, Mr Goss said. Palm Cove is new, with Daikyo constructing new facilities and providing new employment, whereas Four Seasons was an existing operation. Mr Goss said he had not contacted Federal Treasurer Paul Keating about the Daikyo action but would be in touch with the Japanese company tomorrow to find out what their concerns are. A Daikyo corporate spokesman said the company was greatly concerned about the investment uncertainty caused by the TPC inquiry and the State Governments stand on foreign ownership. He said the freeze was a serious economic move a hard business decision. The freeze will stay until the situation is clearly sorted out once and for all. We will not launch into such a huge expenditure when there is a chance that the Trade Practices Commission inquiry could stop it proceeding. The commission is working in relatively uncharted waters. Previously it has looked at situations like BHP taking over a like company and dominating the market. But is it now going to look at a company like AMP perhaps, dominating suburban shopping centres Even the hotel industry itself hasnt sorted out what a twostar, threestar, or fivestar hotel in Australia is. And yet the TPC is examining Daikyos Cairns hotel holdings to see if it is in a dominant role. If the industry is uncertain what hotel star ratings represent, where does that leave the TPC The TPCs regional director, Mr Alan Ducret, said he believed a decision on the inquiry could be delivered in the next two weeks. The question of domination came up and it was up to us to look into it. If they have frozen work on their projects as a result, that would be quite a pity, he said. The Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, said the inquiry had been initiated by conlcerned businesses in Cairns. Gold Coast mayor, Ald Lex Bell, is concerned that the hold on Daikyos plans will leave another unsightly vacant bloc, in the heart of Surfers Paradise. The Gold Coast International Resort site is one of 42 undeveloped blocks concerning the council. We would not like to see another construction site remain empty. We have got quite enough that are empty now, Ald Bell said. The council has been pressing the Foreign Investment Review board to force overseas developers to build on land within the time frame set out in the regional purchase approval. The FIRB has relaxed time limits for development of Gold Coast sites owned by foreigners because of the economic downturn. On Friday, Gold Coast Council aldermen decided to put pressure on the Treasurer, Mr Keating, to use legislation to make developers begin their projects. Ald Bell said, it was sad to see buildings in the heart of Surfers Paradise pulled down and nothing put up in their place. We are writing to Mr Keating to say that the present situation is just not satisfactory, he said. We dont believe that the time development rules should be relaxed. It has got quite out of hand. Mr Keating should do something. It is not as though we want him to change the rules after the fact. We want the rules that are there enforced. He said Daikyo had helped the council. They are giving us some land from the site to enable us to widen the Gold Coast Highway. That has not been transferred yet so I hope this situation does not change that. GOSS TORPEDOED PREMIERS FRONT By political reporter TESS LIVINGSTONE THE Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, torpedoed a plan by all other premiers to confront Treasurer Keating with a give us a better deal or well all raise state taxes ultimatum. Parliament House sources in Canberra said the move was discussed in on Thursday night and Friday morning, with the South Australian Premier, Mr Bannon, playing a leading part. Even New South Wales Liberal Premier Mr Greiner was prepared to line up with his Labor counterparts with the threat of higher taxes and only Mr Goss, bound by an election promise of no new taxes, prevented a united front. Mr Goss was reluctant to discuss the planned ultimatum yesterday, but said with a grin Well, Queenslanders are always difficult. He also said Mr Keating was not the type of character to be moved by such a stance, especially given the fiscal restraint the Commonwealth had imposed on itself. Mr Goss returned to Queensland yesterday ready to take the pruning sheers to existing state programs in the leadup to his first Budget. Its tough on all the states and Queensland is looking at a 500 million shortfall over the next three years. Mr Goss said. He said he and the State Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, would put the options to Cabinet bluntly tomorrow the shortfall could be made up by imposing a fuel tax or financial institutions duty, or by cuts in existing government programs. Mr Goss said tax increases would be avoided, and high budget areas such as Primary Industries, Transport and Land Management had already been identified as areas where savings could be made in capital and recurrent spending. This could see cuts in the rail electrification program, mapping, surveying, land management and soil conservation and primary industries subsidies. The Premier said programs that had been operating for a number of years would be examined to see if they still deserved the priority they were being given. He said the Government was on target to honour its promise of a Seniors Card with concessions for Queenslanders over 70, but this could have to be trimmed. Mr Goss rejected claims by the Liberal Leader, Mr. Beanland, that Queenslands free hospital system was in jeopardy. He said Queensland had received a 4 percent increase in base hospital funding, compared with a national average of 3 percent. Mr Beanland said Mr Goss was planning to take the axe to primary producers. Mr Beanland said the reduction of farm truck registration concessions would cost primary producers more than 8 million. He said Mr Goss could talk tough about spending cuts but he had to find an extra 350 million to fund new expenditure. The Opposition Leader, Mr Cooper, said Queenslanders would have to ask themselves and the Government where is the money coming from every time a Minister announced a new initiative. Every dollar in spending that is announced and is not matched by a cut somewhere else will be carrying Queenslanders closer to increased taxes following the tough result at the premiers conference Mr Cooper said. It is one thing to achieve efficiencies and savings. It is another to decimate budgets in a bid to implement extra programs. What you can so easily end up with is programs that do not work because they are underfunded. Queenslanders may be much better off if there was simply a moratorium on new Government services and programs until the economy picks up. TAXI SEX CLUE IN MURDER RIDDLE By GUY KER THE sexual escapades of some Bundaberg taxi drivers could explain one of the most baffling murders ever committed in the State. Detectives investigating the unsolved slaying of cabbie Bryan Hodgkinson nearly three years ago now believe he may have been killed by a jealous husband possibly one of the citys leading citizens. Inquiries have so far failed to pinpoint a suspect, but details of the crime suggest an intriguing link to the pattern of nocturnal dalliance that has since come to light among taxi drivers plying their trade in the sugar city. A number of cabbies have confessed in recent interviews to conducting illicit affairs with customers, adding weight to the revenge theory given credence by the symbolism of the execution. Popular with colleagues and customers alike, 48yearold Mr Hodgkinson was found on September 10, 1987, stabbed and bludgeoned to death on a remote roadside about 25 km from town. A number of opportune places for murder along the highway had been overlooked in favour of the site chosen the entrance to a Uniting Church home for wayward boys. The suave, debonair cabbie had been frogmarched from his cab, hit about the head and then forced to walk a few metres further to the spot where he was finished off, his jugular vein severed by a 15cm blade. Placed neatly beside his outstretched right hand were his hankerchief, watch and false teeth. The murderer then drove the cab back to town, wiped it free of fingerprints and dumped it in a suburban street. The possibility that the murder was a warning to small town Lotharios milking their profession of its sexual fringe benefits is increasingly favoured by Det Sgt Tim Roche, the 45yearold investigator in charge of the case. When we started asking questions among the cabbies people came forward and said This is confidential, but Im having an affair with so and so for goodness sake dont tell my wife, said Sgt Roche last week."

        "text": "a favourite EVERY YEAR Since the age of 14, John Patterson has worked with horses. He now has a regular lead role in Australias most popular race, the fabulous Melbourne Cup For nearly a quarter of a century, a short, lovable character named John Patterson, better known as Paddo from one end of the country to the other, has been at the centre of one of the alltime great moments in sport. Amidst the roar of the huge crowd and before an estimated viewing audience of 350 million people, John escorts the winner of one of the worlds great horse races, Fosters Melbourne Cup. John is a clerk of the course at Melbournes Flemington Racecourse, one of three who officiate at the Fosters Melbourne Cup. All expert horsemen, they are the minders of the race, ready to rush in if there is any emergency. John has been at Flemington probably 35 or 36 years. With his present job comes the traditional finery black hunters cap, pink jacket said to be named for its designer, an Englishman, Mr Pink, long boots and breeches. Barring two occasions, one when he was in hospital and another when there was a fall during the race, he has led every winner since 1969, when Rainlover, the horse he nominates as the best ever. won the Cup. I suppose there have been better times run, says John, but he was a very good twomiler. He rates Roy Higgins a one of the great jockeys and adds, But I suppose Id have to say the greatest jockey of them all was the Aborigine, Darby McCarthy. He had beautiful balance and a wonderful pair of hands not only was he a very good rider, he was also a very good horseman. In the racing industry, the top trainers are like royalty, rarely rubbing shoulders with any of the little people, as John describes himself. But for his money, Bart Cummings and T.J. Smith are two of the very best horse trainers Australia has ever produced. John describes the atmosphere on Cup day as electrifying especially when youre at the centre of it as he is. Their adrenalin is still pumping pretty hard just after theyve won, he says. The jockeys more than the horses. The jockey has taken out one of the greatest races in the world. Hes emotionally exhausted he doesnt comprehend what youre asking him to do. The three of us clerks of the course, usually stop near the mile and a quarter and see them go past after the winning post, in case anybodys in distress. Then you go back to the winning post and the jockey turns around and he comes back and I pick him up. I lead him up the roses which line each side of the track, towards the clock tower. The steward puts a lead on the horse for the winning owners who meet the horse at the mountingyard gate, just near the clock tower and they lead it from there. I escort the horse to the winners stalls. Even an old hand like John feels the extra pressure on Cup day because of the crowd. But I take it all in my stride, he adds with a grin. No use panicking thats the worst thing you can do. Unexpected incidents on Cup day have been few. A year or two ago, some blokes dressed in a bloody camel suit got over the fence and started running up the roses towards the topweight which I was leading out, he relates. It didnt look too good for a couple of seconds. Then last year, after the Cup, the strapper of the winner, Vintage Crop, and the trainers son, I think it was, both Irishmen, were so elated they raced out onto the course and wanted to pat the horse and the jockey. Well, thats just not done if they touch the jockey before he weighs in, he can be disqualified I had a job convincing them they couldnt. John, whose father was a shearer in Hamilton in Victorias Western District, came to live in Flemington when he was It was an innocent era. Flemington was like a country town in the middle of the city, its streets often filled with cattle and sheep waiting to go to the now defunct Newmarket saleyards. A hard mans town, there was little polish. There were plenty of blues, says John, but you blued and that was it. The best man won and and then you walked to the pub and got drunk. He and his family still live in Flemington. The backyard, where they run a horsebreaking business, has 28 stables, the same stables he was apprenticed to as a jockey at the age of Married for 29 years to Glenys, whom he met through her parents riding school, he is the father of three grown children, all excellent riders. Their eldest, Shane, 28, first competed at the age of one year and four days. I had a mate, a trick rider who had a baby and bragged his was the best kid in the world, jumping through fiery hoops and who knows what. But I got Shane to the show before he got his there. As a race official, John cannot place any bets on the Cup. But the rest of Australia wagered an amazing 4 million with the TAB last Cup day. I always get calls for tips and Ive picked a few winners, but not a lot, says John. Ive never been a gambler. The best of all good things get beat, but without the punter Id be without a job. On the other hand, Ive never seen a skinny bookmaker theyve always got a good suit, a good pair of shoes and a nice motor car dotted line CAROL GEORGE NIGHTMARE BIRTH, dream baby Former television star Lisa Patrick and her artist husband longed for a natural birth for their first baby, but fate had something else in mind Early last year, Lisa Patricks whirlwind romance took everyone by surprise. After meeting and falling madly in love with an attractive Spaniard, she left friends, family and a TV career to go to the US to marry him, all within two months. Now, more in love than ever, Lisa, 28, and her husband, awardwinning writer and renowned artist Gines SerranPagan, 44, are celebrating the birth of their first child. And thanking their lucky stars that all is well after complications that endangered the lives of Lisa and their beautiful boy, Francisco, delivered after the former host of Australias Funniest Home Video Show underwent emergency surgery in June. This was nothing like the birth his parents had planned. Kindred souls who share a love of the sea, nature and solitude, Lisa and Gines had decided on a tranquil underwater birth and made arrangements for a special pool to be installed in their cosy New York loft. I have never seen a woman put more energy into a pregnancy, said Gines proudly. She was incredible. She exercised, followed the right diet, read the books and went to all the classes. She was dedicated to having a natural birth but, in the end, nature played games and we just had to surrender to it. Lisa expressed her thanks for the technology that safely delivered her first child. After Francisco was born, someone, one of the midwives, I think, said I might feel grief because I couldnt have the baby the way I had planned, Lisa recounted, but I havent, I feel great. The first complication occurred about a month before the birth, when the baby was found to be an incomplete breech partly upsidedown.When Gines and Lisa decided to move to Santa Barbara, near LA, they consulted a different doctor who turned the baby in less than a minute, with a minimum of discomfort to Lisa, and at this stage, the couple was still very committed to the idea of a water birth. One of Gines aunts, who lives in Santa Barbara, had a guest house in the grounds of her home where Lisa and Gines stayed. Outside it, in the gardens, they installed a pool where the water was kept at a special temperature in preparation for the birth. We researched it well, said Gines. A water birth, attended by someone medically qualified, is quite safe and is said to reduce pain by 25 to 30 per cent. Two midwives attended once Lisa went into labour, but complications set in. It was very scary, said Gines. The contractions were very long, with only four or five minutes between them. Then the babys heartbeat dropped. He couldnt get enough oxygen. We rushed to the hospital. At one point, both the babys life and Lisas were in question. Lisas recollection is hazy. Once the contractions start, a lot happens, she said. When you go into labour, youre in another space. I was aware of the panic with the heart rate dropping, but I kept very calm and strong and talked to the baby. I could see Gines face was white with concern and worry, but for me ... it was like being in a dream. At Santa Barbara Cottage Hospital, obstetrician Dr Duncan Turner, after examining Lisa and detecting a degree of foetal distress, said a caesarean section had to be done immediately. Lisa accepted his decision calmly. Then, more complications. During the operation, Dr Turner discovered Lisa had a second uterus. Because this could complicate future pregnancies, it was removed once the baby was delivered. Gines calls me superwoman, Lisa said, laughing. I was so surprised. Ive had examinations over the years and nothings ever come up about it. Dr Turner said that the abnormality of the uterus, combined with the shape of Lisas pelvis, probably contributed to a diminished blood supply to the placenta, and therefore the foetus. Lisas devotion to health and fitness, which continued until she went into labour, helped her make a rapid recovery. In fact, her recovery from surgery was so fast that she left hospital a day and a half later. Ive never seen a patient recover like this before, said Dr Turner. This is the first son for Gines, who has two grownup daughters by a previous marriage. A new life ... it is wonderful, he said. He is very beautiful. Even the nurses were impressed with him. Francisco Gines, who weighed in at a healthy 6kg, will be baptised in an adobe church run by Franciscan monks, in Carmel, California. Francisco is a favourite name in Gines family because it is the name of the patron saint of animals and means free man. Lisa became known nationally after hosting. Australias Funniest Home Video Show on the Nine Network but, in many ways, that woman has gone. In her place is someone with very different focuses. Theres the relationship with Gines that grows deeper and more special every day. And that with her baby. Of motherhood, Lisa says, Its like a new love, one Ive never felt before. Its incredible, such a complete love. You cant take your eyes off the little one. I just want to hold him. Im totally absorbed by him. CAROLE GEORGE mixed and matched Three couples disclose how love and understanding have overcome differences in their cultures Lucy and Hiro When East met West at the Sydney Japanese School three years ago, it was the start of an enriching relationship for Australianborn Lucy Howard and Hiro Shibuya. Lucy, 26, teaches English to migrants Hiro, 30, is a graphic designer. They had two wedding ceremonies, one in a Sydney church and the second in a Shinto temple in Tokyo. Lucy I was attracted to Hiro because of the person he is, not because he is Japanese. Becoming involved with another culture was a bonus. There is so much to be gained from learning about other customs. What attracted me was his calming personality and incredible honesty. Theres also his sense of humour."

Also, the English alphabet can be broken into 26 letters reinforcing the appearance that speech is simple. However, speech is not just letters joined into words. When we speak, much more is conveyed besides a words literal content, such as the type of speaker, expression, connotations, emotions and the other information contained in what they are saying. By looking at the utterances of a single word by different speakers it can be seen that although the utterance is the same, the sound appears different over time. Differences also occur when the word is placed in sequence amongst other words and not as a single utterance. Appendix 1 However, humans can still understand these utterances even when they are spoken in different accents or distorted by background noise and other unnatural variables such as attenuation and psychoacoustic effects. Regardless of variabilities, there must be something in a speech signal that remains unchanged because we as humans can interpret its meaning. The human ear is a complex speech recognisor.Appendix 2. Sound is funnelled from the outer ear to the eardrum. The vibrations on the eardrum are transmitted to the inner ear the cochlea via three small bones the last which is fixed to a small membrane. The auditory transducer that converts sound energy into nerve stimuli is the Organ of Corti which is attached to the basilar membrane at the beginning of the cochlea. It contains specialised and complex hair cells which form the transduction process between the mechanical vibrations of the basilar membrane and nerve impulses transmitted through the brain. Not as much is known about the ear as the human voice production tools and there are many operations of the ear that are not clear.6 As a result, speech recognition by a computer is not a simple decoding problem but a highly complex one. The method by which humans produce speech is also a highly involved process. The sounds of speech are the acoustic consequences of air flowing through the vocal tract. Air is forced from the lungs and flows through the larynx. Appropriate tension in the vocal chords causes them to oscillate, in turn exciting the acoustic resonances of the nasal and oral passages to form vowel, vowellike sounds and consonants. The articulators of sound are the tongue, velum, teeth, jaw, lips and nasal tract. Plosives are formed by closing off the vocal tract by the lips, tongue or teeth and then releasing the sound energy in a burst. Appendix 2 Although the vocal tract is capable of producing an infinite number of distinct sounds, at the linguistic level the basic perceptual unit of speech is the phoneme which depends on the word being produced and the position of the phoneme within the utterance. The English language consists of 44 phonemes. The concept of a talking machine has been around many years. The first speech synthesiser existed as early as 1791 where air from bellows was used to excite a resonant cavity to produce vowels and consonants. The first electrical version appeared in 1939, where the VODER voice operated demonstrator utilised a keyboard to generate vowel and consonantlike sounds and control articulation. A modern speech synthesiser is based on the same principles but uses a digital computer and special digital signal processing DSP hardware. The modern devices synthesise speech automatically from text. The ultimate speech synthesiser will read aloud from any text form in a clear, natural sounding voice. However present technology does not quite perform this function. For many years speech was considered to be composed of linear sequences of the elemental speech particles, the phoneme, put together rather like a string of beads. This incorrectly led people to believe that speech could be recognised by just decoding the individual phonemes as they appeared through time. Consequently, it appeared that synthetic speech could be produced by storing each of the phonemes of the language and sticking them together to create a word. Unfortunately, this proved not to be the case. While it is convenient to picture speech as a set of discrete symbols real linguistic information is not encoded in discrete packets of time as imagined by this model. Despite theses limitations, speech output by computers has generally been achieved by generating messages from stored speech fragments. These messages require recording by a speaker and although a natural sounding voice output is achieved, large amounts of data storage are required thus speech coding is essential. Also, if messages have to be altered, total rerecording is required if the original speaker is not available. Many applications would require regular changing of messages so the only efficient solution is a full text to speech system.8 Speech synthesis can be of two forms. Speech can be generated from artificial sounds to mimic the human utterances or by constructing the voice from the elemental components of a persons prerecorded speech. The later system produces a more natural sounding voice but the first is more suited to large and varied responses. Printed text consists of alphanumeric characters, blank spaces and punctuation marks. These characters are a symbolic representation of a language, not a language itself. The real meaning of the language is not indicated explicitly in the text. Not all words have equal importance and phrase structure or focus is not obvious. Also symbols such as numbers and abbreviations must be interpreted correctly. Text analysis converts the printed text into linguistic structures that establishes phrasal hierarchy. Without word hierarchy, sentences would lack focal centres resulting in unnatural speech. Phrasal structure is conveyed by intonation and duration variation, phrases are assigned different tone levels and marked by pauses and prepausal lengthening of words. Tone also indicate sentence type, ie question or statement. To perform proper text analysis a text understanding system is necessary. Present day technology is limited therefore, the above process is broken into three components of text normalisation, parsing and intonation and letter to phoneme rules. bulletText Normalisation involves the deciphering of non alphabet symbols such as numbers, special symbols, abbreviations and acronyms. The preprocessor also assigns parts of speech to each word in the input. This is important for obtaining phrase focus and correct pronunciation of words. To improve text preprocessing, large amounts of text must be synthesised, and algorithms changed to correct for preprocessing errors. bulletParsing and Intonation establishes the phrasal hierarchy of the text. When the sentence structure is clear the sentence can be parsed into proper phrases. If it is not clear a more neutral intonation is used. Letter to Phoneme Conversion is utilised in giving the computer correct pronounciation of each word. A large dictionary of stored words can be used and when the word is matched the pronunciation and stress is obtained directly. If there is no match, words may be constructed from single words in the dictionary or through phonemic transcription. The pronunciation of the synthesiser can be improved by synthesising large amounts of text and adding or correcting the rules that contribute to the mispronunciation. Where rules fail, words or proper names can be added to the dictionary. Speech coding is the process of converting speech into digital bit strings for the efficient storage andor transmission over band limited channels. Speech coders for particular applications are selected according to a tradeoff between coding complexity, bit rate and signal quality. Coders are usually classified into the following three types bulletWaveform coding where the aim is to reproduce the original waveform as accurately as possible. These coders are not speech specific however they can deal with nonspeech signals such as background noise, music and multiple speakers without difficulty. The cost of this fidelity is a relatively high bit rate. bulletVocoders make no attempt to reproduce the original waveform instead deriving a set a parameters at the encoder that are transmitted and used to control a speech production model at the receiver. Speech quality, although intelligible, tends to be synthetic and variable between speakers, hence vocoding is not used for telephone network applications. bulletHybrid contains the features of both waveform and vocoders to provide good quality, efficient speech coding. Rates are between 16kbitss and 4kbitss and good quality coding is achieved by analysis through synthesis techniques. Speech coders are in demand for systems where there is a need to make efficient use of precious radio spectrum, in the case of aeronautical telephony via satellite and digital cordless systems. Also when cost of storage is a major factor speech coding is used. Applications include interactive network based voice messaging, private network, public switched telephone network PSDN and integrated services digital network ISDN videophone applications. Achieving machine generated speech is somewhat of a challenge designing machines which can fully comprehend speech is even more daunting. This is why this area of speech technology still poses the greatest task and has researchers throughout the world striving to create the most accurate speech recognisor. This thesis focuses on speech recognition due to the many challenges that are still evident in the speech recognition field. When people normally interact with computers they use instruments such as keyboards, mousedriven menus, touch screens or tonepads. These methods are artificial and as a result deter many people from interacting with computers. If a speech recognisor could be devised that was 100 accurate the possible applications are endless. Then again, this would require machines to be more accurate than humans, as humans cannot be considered 100 accurate in recognising speech, especially in situations where there is a strong accent or noise interference. Speech recognition is fundamentally a pattern classification task. The aim is to take the input pattern, the speech signal, and to classify it as a sequence of stored patterns that have previously been learned. The stored patterns are phonemes or words. One of the earliest speech recognisors,designed in 1916, was named Flowers Appendix 3. It consisted of a set of filters electromagnetic resonators that responded to the strongest frequency in the particular utterance. The design shows that there was an assumption that each letter of the alphabet was characterised uniquely by a single dominant frequency. This is not the case, but it was the separation of the task of speech recognition into components by feature extraction fundamental to frequency analysis and classification based on a best match that remains a characteristic of modern speech recognisors. The next major development was the Davis, Biddulph and Balashek machine.Appendix 4. Speech was filtered into two frequency bands and the zero crossing rates within each band used as primary features. The advent of the digital computer made this form of speech recognisor viable in the 1960s as only digital technology provided the memory which was necessary. In this process the unknown sequence of spectral components was aligned in turn against each known sequence in a template library. The best fit was considered the correct example. The problem with these machines was that only very simple processing could only be used at almost every stage and that the sequence of operation was slow. The operation was slow due to the requirement that the speech was collected until silence was detected, then normalised, matched and finally reported. As a result there was a slow response time between when the speech was uttered to when the result was reported. This post utterance delay was later eliminated by a new technique of dynamic programming. Dynamic programming overcame a majority of the theoretical problems but not all of the practical computational problems. Instead of waiting for the complete utterance, the distance of every spectral frame in the input from every frame in every template was calculated as it arrived and the accumulated difference along the best path maintained.Appendix 5. The advantages were that matching could take place as the signal arrived, recognition was complete as soon as the word was finished. Connected word recognition was possible along with word spotting and the very best time alignment was possible between the unknown signal and the known template."

        "text": "Sounds Fishy Sonic records show that growls, grunts, clicks and croaks are just some of the sounds produced by fish as a means of communication For many people the sound of waves is the only sound they will ever hear the ocean make. The contribution of whales and dolphins is also well known, though they were thought to be mute due to a lack of obvious vocal apparatus. A perceptive scuba diver might add the clicking of shrimps, the noise of an occasional motorboat, the hissing sound of each inhalation and the rattle of exhaled bubbles, to this list of underwater noises. The oceans are, however, far noisier than most people appreciate. In fact, they are rarely quiet. Text by Russell Graham caption photo Photographs by Geoff Longford and Russell Graham caption photo Until the 1940s the oceans were generally thought of as noiseless. The widespread use of hydrophones underwater microphones and World War Two changed this concept of silent seas for ever. Hydrophone had been invented during the latter part of World War One, but interest in their development and use waned with the ending of hostilities. However, World War Two prompted a revival of interest in the use of hydrophones to detect submarines, which had become more sophisticated, numerous and deadly efficient between the wars. Hydrophones were fitted to ships and deployed around strategic harbours to take advantage of the fact that ships and submarines cannot travel silently and that sound travels about four times faster and farther in water than it does in air. Hydrophones were meant to provide early warning in case enemy submarines attempted to attack. Those whose task it was to monitor the oceans for the sound of motors and propellers were soon perplexed by the odd noises they were hearing. One story, probably apocryphal, has it that upon hearing these noises the harbours defences were brought out nightly to repel an attack that never came, though night after night strange noises were heard emanating from the ocean. Initially these were thought to be due to faulty equipment, but before long it was realised that the sounds had biological origins. Numerous research projects were initiated to catalogue the natural sounds so that the unnatural, manmade sounds could be discerned from the chaotic and everpresent ambient sea noise. On the other hand, submarines learned techniques of disguising their activities by hiding their mechanical noises among the profusion of confused natural sounds. Later they learned to associate certain types of ambient sound with specific depths and bottom terrain. Thus, the sea noises became an aid to submarine navigation. Underwater sounds are ubiquitous. Only the very loudest can be easily heard by scuba divers, but listening with a hydrophone reveals a multitude of distinctive clicks, pops, grunts, chirps, moans, rumbles and scrapes, superimposed over an incessant crackle. The creatures responsible for this cacophony are much harder to discern that the sounds they make because of their diminutive size, secretive habits, rarity and the peculiar soundcarrying properties of water. Water can carry a sound well away from its point of origin and make it extremely difficult to locate the source without electronic listening aids. Some of the sounds heard are purposive, such as the growl of an affronted frogfish Batrachomoeus dubius or the courting chirp of male Humbugs Dascyllus spp. Others are merely incidental to an animals normal activities, like the crunch and clatter of feeding or the hydrodynamic water movement sound produced when a fastmoving school of fish suddenly changes direction. photo photo photo caption caption caption photo caption caption photo The colour patterns of a variety of fishes, particularly those of a tropical reef, are familiar to most people, divers and nondivers alike. Most of these fish have been named for the way they look or behave clownfish, angelfish, damselfish and stonefish for example. That many of them also produce sounds is less well known. These sounds can be as important as colour signals in helping them to obtain mates, reproduce, establish dominance, defend territory or to signal their aggressive intentions. For some species, sound replaces colouration in achieving these aims. For many fish, making the right noise at the right time is crucial to their pairing, a fact well known to the residents of Sausilito, California. People living on the water there are kept awake every June by the mating sound of the toadfish Porychthys notatus. The noise they produce is apparently more like a squadron of planes than a serenade, and can penetrate a concrete boat hull. Sounds are also produced by fish to help them swim in a school and to navigate. It is, though, not clear whether the sounds made by schooling fish result from the movements of muscles and bones within the fish or are the result of water movements produced by the moving school. Sonic records of certain fish noises have revealed a pattern of regular repetition. Some researchers have interpreted these repeat sounds as echoes from the seabed. It is possible that the fish are employing a form of echo location to navigate the ocean depths. The sounds produced, though lacking the complexity of language, are used to communicate information about a fishs internal state to the members of its own and other species. Although the type of sounds any species of fish can produce is limited, many of them can vary the length or intensity of the sound and the interval between sounds and so gain a repertoire of possible messages. Scientists tried to decipher the language of dolphins and for many years attempted to communicate with them without notable success. Interpreting the messages of fish is practically impossible, except in the most general terms. These messages cannot be considered a language in the way we normally use the word. photo caption A large number of fish and invertebrate species employ an intriguing array of vocal apparatus to overcome their lack of voicebox. Soundproducing structures are modified from, or make use of, anatomical equipment with quite unrelated functions. The most common methods involve the use of the swim bladder a fishs buoyancy organ, the rubbing together of hard parts such as teeth and bones, or a combination of the two. Some fish deliberately use hydrodynamic sounds. Larger species like grouper have been observed to warn off divers by rapidly closing their gill covers to produce a loud clap. Grey Nurse sharks may display a behaviour known as cracking when they are agitated. Swimming towards an intruder, a shark will quickly change direction with a whiplike motion of its tail, producing a loud hydrodynamic crack. Some species of fish produce sound by beating or rubbing the skin over the swim bladder with their pectoral fins as though theyre playing a drum or rubbing a balloon. A number of fish produce sounds by the action of bodywall muscles adjacent to an unmodified swim bladder. At the other extreme are fish which possess multichambered swim bladders with internal muscles, or muscles attaching their swim bladders to the skull or backbone. The sole purpose of these muscles is to play the swim bladder for the production of sound, rather like plucking a guitar string. photo caption The possession of specialised muscles or a modified swim bladder enables a fish to produce a variety of different sounds. In its simplest form, a single contraction of a muscle joining the skull or vertebral column with the surface of the swim bladder results in a single pulse of sound, like a single drumbeat. When produced in a rapid series the individual pulses become indistinguishable and a whine, trumpet, or croak is heard. Pitch varies with swim bladder volume and the frequency of muscle contractions. Variations in the length of the sound, the interval between sounds and the number of sounds in a sequence, further increases the potential repertoire. Typical swim bladder sounds are low frequency and harmonic. In the waters around Sydney the fishes that produce this type of sound include the trumpeter Pelates quadrilineatus, Eastern Frogfish Batrachomoeus dubius, Turretfish Trioris reipublicae, Mado Atypichthys strigatus and Bullseye Pempheris compressus, among others. Stridulatory sounds, those made by rubbing together hard parts, form the major proportion of background noise in the sea. The feeding sounds of fish and invertebrates, such as sea urchins and shrimps, can be very loud and continuous. This is, however, purely coincidental, though some species do rub their teeth or bones together deliberately. Pistolshrimps Alpheus spp make a noise loud enough to stun small fish by the concussion generated when their larger claw is closed rapidly. Oldwives Enoplosus armatus, toadfish and porcupine fish grind their teeth. Pipefish Stigmatopora spp. and seahorses Hippocampus spp. make a pop or click by snapping their head sharply upwards. In tropical waters Humbugs Dascyleusspp., Whitebanded Damsels Chrysiptera leucopomus and anemone fish Amphiprion spp. rub two adjacent bones together to produce a variety of pops, clicks, chirps and grunts for use in their complex courtship and dominance displays. Many fish that stridulate have their swim bladder positioned in such a way that it amplifies the sound, like the soundbox of a guitar. The sources of many underwater sounds have yet to be reliably identified. Though the fishes responsible are probably known, their soundproducing abilities remain untested, so the question of which sound goes with what species is a continuing puzzle. There is, for example, a fish in the Atlantic Ocean that makes a noise like a morse code signal. The sources of countless other underwater sounds have also yet to be reliably identified beyond a general definition, such as swim bladder sounds, stridulatory sounds and whale song. Some quite distinctive sounds resist categorisation and their origins, which may not be biological, remain a mystery. We know only a fraction of what goes on under the water and much more effort should be put into marine research. Sadly, the day when we can understand this song of the sea is a very long way off. Currently, nobody can be certain about the identity of the singers. caption photo Fungi friends of the forest Text and photographs Gerhard Saueracker Lochman Transparencies photo caption diagram photo caption Winter is a beautiful season in the bush. With the dust of summer washed away, leaves gleam when lit by sunlight and fresh, clean bark decorates once dowdy tree trunks. Beneath our feet, and in the logs around us, unseen threads of fungi are making their way to the surface where they will burst forth to spread their spores on the wet winter earth. The first fungi that most of us notice are those growing on fallen timber. At my favourite bush trail I dont even have to leave my car to see them, as logs that display a variety of fungi border the parking area. The most common is Stereum hirsutum which forms thin leathery photo photo brackets projecting up to 20 mm from the log. Its old growth is light brown, but fresh growth on the outer edge is a much more obvious yellow. Another yellow fungus also grows on these logs. Named Tremella mesenterica, it has a number of common names. In Australia we call it jelly or brain fungus, and in Britain and North America it is known as witches butter. When I see these two species, I know that my walk will be rewarded by the sight of many more fungi sprouting from logs. I may see more leathery fungi related to Stereum hirsutum, or stout bracket fungi, or delicate little fungi with the classical umbrella shape of mushrooms and toadstools. All of them contribute to the welfare of the forest, a recycling role that fungi caption caption photo photo photo photo has filled for hundreds of millions of years. When trees grow, they accumulate nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. Once a tree dies it must decompose before these nutrients again become available to other plants. While tiny bacteria contribute to decay, fungi are more important to the forest for, only they can degrade lignin, the most durable component of wood. A threedimensional polymer, lignin is the material that gives wood its strength. It comprises three subunits joined by a variety of chemical linkages and is therefore complex to dismantle. Certain fungi, particularly bracket fungi, are designed to do this job and once they start the process other fungi will follow."

        "text": "A lesson for the teachers OUR report into education standards in NSW provides alarming figures of student dissatisfaction. In many cases, students are voting with their feet at a critical stage of their schooling. Two cases cited in todays Sunday Telegraph report show how serious the problem has become. In one example, a school in southern NSW lost seven pupils a week at the height of a crisis over teacher behaviour and in a primary school in eastern Sydney, student numbers fell from 29 to 13 in the first three months of one class. The reasons for dissatisfaction are varied, including issues of discipline, class arrangements and principals attitude. The answer until now has been to transfer students to another school but this did not address the problem and only disrupts children at a vital learning stage. These figures highlight an education problem too alarming to ignore. The NSW Education Department, and its teachers, must pay closer attention to the problems within the classroom. If such complaints are not resolved, then the overall education system will begin to break down. The department cannot ignore this student exodus it must pay attention to this lesson and improve its performance. The Midas touch WHAT a magnificent sight greeted us from Victoria Canada yesterday Australian athletes with the Midas touch competing for glory against the finest sportsmen and women in the Commonwealth. Years of training and sacrifice were rewarded as members of the Aussie team led the charge with a superb result of nine gold medals on day one. Those at home shared the winning smiles of our athletes who did us so proud. No one epitomised the spirit of Australia more yesterday than 20year old silver medallist Karen Van Wirdum who seized her medal opportunity to propose to boyfriend Robert Dunne from an international stage. Dunnes reply sums up the nations feelings for all our athletes I love the girl, all Australia loves her. Shes such a determined, wonderful girl. A political party bent on suicide Roy Miller, editor THE Liberal Party of Australia is dead and buried. They can kiss goodbye any aspirations of leading this country in the years to come. The squabbles between the leader, Alexander Downer, and the former leader, John Hewson, which culminated in Hewsons sudden dismissal from the shadow Cabinet have left the Liberals in a state of disarray never before seen in Australian politics. Both men have their faults. Dr Hewsons mistake was his failure to step down immediately after losing the unlosable election in March He then had to endure the destabilising and embarrassing leadership contest three months ago. There is little doubt Mr Downer wanted Hewson out of his shadow Cabinet in fact, hed never wanted to include him in the first place. Mr Downer took a hard line when he refused to give Hewson the key Treasury portfolio which he wanted. Instead he allocated him the secondary portfolio of Commerce and Industry, with stern demands that Hewson not buckle against his leadership. The signs were clear in May that the new leader was always going to be on a collision course with his predecessor and that Downer was waiting for the earliest opportunity to punish Hewson. Late on Friday he did so in a paltry attempt to assert his authority. Mr Downer failed. Though there is never a right time to sack a colleague, Mr Downers timing was appalling. He showed not strength but insecurity. The issue Mr Downer should be addressing is the Liberal partys social policy, not knifing individuals who have highlighted its flaws. Dr Hewson will continue to be a thorn in the partys side now that he is free to speak on any issue from the back bench. Alexander Downer now faces a battle to protect his own position, with a leadership rift likely to come as early as tomorrow. Next Wednesday marks the 100day anniversary of Mr Downers leadership. It will not be a cause for celebration. Mr Downer has suffered a significant and damning slide in popularity since his leadership coup. His honeymoon period ended abruptly after his performance during a oneweek tour of Western Australia which exposed his ignorance of land rights and contradictory behaviour. The sacking of Dr Hewson has not helped his cause. As Hewson explained so succinctly Mr Downer, you will not heal the wounds of the Liberal party by turning the knife. His one vengeful act has torn the Liberal Party asunder. The deep divisions which now characterise the party will not be mended easily. There are very few options left for the Liberals. They either keep their present leader or face another bloody leadership spill. Would Peter Costello, the present deputy, make it as leader Or do they bring back the tried and true John Howard Whatever happens, the Liberal Party is a shambles and has no way of regrouping in order to become a formidable opponent in the 1996 election. Our political structure demands strong opposition the existing Liberal party cannot meet this demand and has very little to offer Australia. A better way to spend 150m PRIME Minister Paul Keating has every right to give his views on Sydney and in particular, the Cahill Expressway. Not only is he PM, but he is also a Sydney boy, born and bred in Bankstown. Last week he was taken to task for saying the Cahill expressway is an eyesore which should be demolished. Although most Sydneysiders would agree that it is an ugly concrete structure spoiling our beautiful harbour, many thought Mr Keating should keep quiet on the Cahill Expressways future. Silence does not suit Mr Keating but he must learn lessons in timing. His 150 million pledge to NSW Premier John Fahey to tear down the Cahill was a badly timed, insensitive promise. Only 48 hours earlier, Agriculture Minister Ian Causley announced the news our rural community was dreading that 83 per cent of this State is now suffering the cruel plight of severe drought. The 150 million which Mr Keating was so keen to distribute would have been better spent if earmarked to help our struggling farmers. Farmers are enduring enormous hardship and need more than Government sympathy they need financial assistance. It is up to the Federal Government to recognise the severity of this drought and step in to help farmers as much as possible. For a major city such as Sydney, it takes more than a premier, or local council, to have planning vision. In fact, we should be pleased that the Australian Prime Minister has taken such an interest in our city. But Mr Keating, surely there are better ways to spend any loose change the Government has Namely our foreign debt, our farmers, our unemployed. In July, Mr Fahey was offered between 50 and 60 million by Mr Keating to beautify Circular Quay, less than two months later this figure has almost trebled. Mr Keating should hang on to those extra dollars and donate them to a true, needy cause the heartland of this country. But dont give up on Sydney because this city still needs vision.Breretons action not tough enough TODAY more than 100 ships are lying idle off the coast of Australia at a cost of up to 15 million a day. Why Because of the bloodyminded attitude of one particular union, desperate to preserve its livelihood in the face of generational changes to the makeup of the Australian waterfront. Central to the fears of the Maritime Union is last weeks decision by Industrial Relations Minister Laurie Brereton to sell the Governments stake in Australian Stevedores, which was held by Governmentowned ANL. Tied to the future of ANL is the future of the union and right now, theyre running scared. Mr Breretons defiant selloff against union opposition showed them whos boss but, as the costs of this dispute escalate, it is not tough enough. What made financial sense last week will cost many more dollars if the unions continue this fight. Mr Brereton should have continued to act tough and begun settlement talks with the union immediately. Mr Brereton should not have waited until tomorrow for his showdown with the unions. His inaction will cost this country millions, and not only in shortterm export earnings. The greatest damage will be to our international reputation which has suffered yet another savage blow with this latest blight on our international trading record. The 15 million daily bill will be chicken feed in the washup from this dispute. What we suffer in the eyes of international competitors and trading partners will be measured on a much larger scale. Get to work Mr Brereton and get our waterfront and export business working again. Big task for Fahey TWELVE months ago, the future for John Fahey was bright and full of promise. Today as his Government prepares to hand down its final Budget before they face the polls in March 1995, the outlook is not so bright. For Premier Fahey, it has been a steady decline during the past seven months, a disappointing followon from the elation of our Olympic bid success and his heroic tackle on Prince Charless attacker in January. Since then he and his Government have gone from bad to worse. The most telling blow came last week when opinion polls showed his Government had fallen behind the Opposition for the first time since he became Premier in June The task ahead for Mr Fahey is not an easy one. When Parliament resumes this week it will be the beginning of a demanding session which will test his resolve and political skills. The hurdles ahead include the sale of the State Bank, the inquiry into former police minister Terry Griffiths, theCasino controversy and the royal commission into corruption within the NSW police force. So Mr Fahey is heading into battle wellprepared with a good news Budget. It appears Mr Fahey has finally identified what counts. He must now hope the voters return the favour. Lets share the farmers burden THE sight of Prime Minister Paul Keating treading the parched red earth of droughtstricken Queensland last week brought relief to many worried Australians. There was relief that finally the nations highest office recognised the disastrous impact of this drought. And there was hope. While Mr Keating was criticised for waiting too long before he inspected the impact of the drought firsthand, his visit brought inspiration to struggling farmers. There was no promise of immediate cash but he gave farmers hope of muchneeded Federal Government assistance. Mr Keating recognised the severity of the drought and the need for the Government to act quickly. I said that we would never leave the unemployed behind dotted line let me say in the same terms we wont leave the country people of this nation behind. We dont forget them. After commenting just five weeks ago that drought was a normal part of farming life, Mr Keatings words of compassion wont be forgotten. Nor will the tales of hardship and survival which characterise life on the land today. The stories behind yesterdays Women of the Land gathering in Gunnedah give the true picture of families enduring the States worst drought in 60 years. Life in the bush is pretty difficult because of low commodity prices and high interest rates now with the drought its practically impossible, says one farming wife. But no matter how tough it gets our farmers will not give up easily. Its an instinctive thing. said Leonie Studdy, of Gunnedah. I grew up on the land and Ive spent my life on the land. As my father used to say, Who is going to produce all those necessary things if people like us dont stay here in this environment This weeks Cabinet meeting to decide a new rural assistance strategy is critical to the future of our rural environment. It is likely to recommend exempting droughtstricken farmers from asset tests on key measures, enabling greater welfare assistance. Another suggestion worthy of consideration is the introduction of a drought levy on Australias eight million fulltime income earners."

The chronology of relevant events as far as this office is concerned is as follows You originally telephoned our office at 25 a.m. on the 13th December, 1993, when the writer was unavailable and left a message to return your call Your call was returned at 15 a.m. when you were not in and a message was left on your answering machine The writer discussed the matter with you late morning on the 13th and agreed to speak to Ms Surname 2 solicitor with respect to the matter Your facsimile was then received at our office at approximately 50 p.m. when the writer was absent from the office The matter was discussed with Ms Surname 2 solicitor at approximately 15 p.m. upon the writers return to the office The writer was then engaged with clients and out of the office for the balance of the afternoon A reply to your facsimile was dictated on the morning of the 14th December, prior to your attending our office without an appointment We were unable to forward our facsimile to you due to the fact that your facsimile machine was not receiving. ... 2 Further at the time you attended at our office the writer was engaged in preparing an Agreement which was urgently required to be completed. The simple fact of the matter is that work is prioritized in accordance with urgency and appointments made. Requests to interrupt such matters for a few minutes in the writers experience invariably turn into 20 or 30 minutes if not longer. Further if such a request is agreed to for one client, then it should be agreed to for all which makes it impossible to satisfactorily complete any given task. We trust the above clarifies the matter. Of course if you are unhappy with the services rendered by this firm you are free to take your work elsewhere. Yours faithfully, GREER TIMMS LETTERHEAD FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION TO Mr Surname 1 23 November 1994 Dear RE We refer to your letter of the 18th November, We have reviewed our file and note that the facts of the matter are as follows The Contract is dated the 13th May, 1994, and was signed by you without seeking any advices from the writer. The first conversation between Mr Surname 2 and Ms. Surname 3 of our office occurred on the 16th May, 1994, and largely concerned the amount of our professional costs in acting on behalf of the Vendor Company. At no time were we consulted concerning the date for settlement. We conducted a land tax search and received a land tax clearance from the Office of State Revenue which we relied upon in the ordinary way. 4The Office of State Revenue issued the clearance in error. Company Name 1 paid land tax in respect of the land in the previous year and accordingly should have been well aware of its likely liability for land tax in the year in question. There has been no error on the part of this office and your company is and has at all relevant times been liable to pay the land tax. An administrative error on the part of the Office of State Revenue does not change that. ... 2 In the circumstances, we have no intention of paying the land tax as requested by you and we return the land tax assessment. Your company should pay it to avoid penalties and prosecution. Further, in view of the offensive tone of your letter and your dealings generally with this office, Greer Timms is no longer prepared to act for Mr Surname 2, or any of his companies, in any future dealings. Yours faithfully GREER TIMMS LETTERHEAD FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION TO Mr Surname 1 15 November 1993 Dear RE We now act on behalf of Mr Surname 2 in lieu of Messrs. Groves Clark. We have to hand copies of the various documents including a Business Contract, Partnership Agreement and draft Deed of Settlement between the parties. We note that the correspondence from Messrs. Groves Clark indicates that the settlement agreement has been terminated. In any event, we note that your client has unilaterally made alterations to the draft Agreement submitted to it which amendments have not been agreed to by our client. Accordingly, it is quite clear that no concluded settlement agreement was ever in existence between the parties. Accordingly, given that the partnership has been dissolved, our client remains entitled to 50 of the proceeds of sale together with 50 of the profits earned since the lst February, 1993, and the other monies due pursuant to the agreement of the 28th January, In addition, our client remains while the partnership is being wound up, entitled to access to both the premises and the books and records of the premises. We are instructed that your client has wrongfully refused our client access to the premises and has in fact assaulted our clients Aunt when access was sought. We are instructed that the latter matter is in the hands of the Police. On our instructions the business has to date been conducted in total disregard of our clients interest and without proper compliance with various statutory obligations. In particular, we are instructed as follows ... 2 Your client has not complied with the original Agreement of the 28th January, 1993, and has failed not only to make the payments due to our client pursuant to that Agreement, but to produce any statement of affairs or other financial documentation in relation to the business to our client. Your client has stated to various persons that the business has earned in excess of 350,00 profit in the last year. As a 50 partner in the business, one half of that profit ought to have been paid to our client and disclosed in his taxation return. That has obviously not occurred. Accordingly we question exactly what has occurred in relation to the taxation affairs of the business 3To our clients knowledge, various employees of the business are being paid in cash by your client Information provided to our client suggests that income from the business is being used by your client in his other business affairs and to acquire other property. Our client has paid 25,00 into the business and received a negligible return from the business and has been wrongfully excluded from its management and financial affairs by your client. Our client is not prepared to allow that situation to continue. Accordingly, our client requires the following Immediate access to the books, records and accounts including taxation records of the business That the business be immediately listed for sale with such Real Estate agents in Port Douglas as are agreed between the parties and sold as soon as any offer of the agreed minimum of 85,00 or above is received That the takings of the business be paid into a joint account to be opened between our respective clients and that all withdrawals and cheques from the account are to be signed by both of our clients Our client be granted access to the premises at such times as he requires. If those matters are not attended to or agreed within fortyeight 48 hours then we will seek instructions without further notice to you to Apply to the Court for the appointment of a Receiver to conduct the business until it can be sold and the affairs of the partnership wound up and Commence proceedings for an account. In this event we put on notice that our client will be pursuing any property which has been acquired with partnership funds. ... 3 On a without prejudice basis, our client is prepared to resolve all matters of and incidental to the partnership and the partnership business on the following basis Your client assign and transfer all his right, title and interest in the partnership and the partnership business to our client including goodwill, business name, equipment, book debts, and the Lease free of all encumbrances, liabilities, debts and other claims except in relation to accrued employee entitlements for holiday pay, long service leave or wages in respect of any employee whose employment is continued on by our client Your client use his best endeavours and take all steps and execute all documents necessary to obtain and effect an assignment of the Lease from your client to our client Your client agrees not to incur debts except in the ordinary course of the ordinary business of the partnership and not to incur any single debt in excess of 1,00 without our clients written consent between acceptance of the offer and finalisation of any agreement The parties each release the other from all other claims and liabilities whatsoever relating to the partnership business and its conduct or affairs On acceptance of the offer, the takings of the business will be paid into a joint account to be opened between the parties and requiring the signature of both parties to any withdrawals or cheques. Any profit earned between acceptance of this offer and finalisation would be shared equally between the parties Your client would agree after acceptance of the offer, not to sell, encumber or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of the business other than in the ordinary course of its ordinary business The parties would bear their own costs of and incidental to the settlement and our client would pay any stamp duty on the transfer or fees associated with the assignment of the Lease The offer is subject to satisfactory documentation being entered into between the parties The offer is open until 00 p.m. on Wednesday, the 17th November, The offer is calculated on the basis that the parties had agreed that 85,00 was a minimum acceptable sale price for the business. Further, given the level of profit apparently generated by the business, our client considers that his share ... 4 of the profits already accrued and unpaid to him from the 1st February, 1993, would be well in excess of the one half interest in the business which your client would be transferring to him. We look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible. Yours faithfully, GREER TIMMS LETTERHEAD FACSIMILE TRANSMISSION TO 3 November 1994 Dear Sirs, RE We refer to our letter of the 11th October, 1994, and note that we have not received a response. This matter is again dragging on in an unacceptable fashion and we request a response to our letter by return. With relation to the personal records of your client, the assertions with relation to your client not having any personal records relating to advances simply do not make sense. The documentation discovered in relation to the recent financial affairs of the company disclose numerous deposits being made to the companys accounts where the credit listing sheets show the drawer of the cheques being deposited as Obviously your client must have bank statements and cheque butts at the very least in relation to such payments. The use of company funds for your clients own benefit is very much a matter in issue in these proceedings. Accordingly, the cheque butts, bank statements, and any other financial records of your client evidencing the payment of monies to him by the company and the payment by him to the company are relevant and discoverable. The continued piece meal approach of your clients to making proper discovery has lead to unacceptable delays in this matter. If all outstanding documents are not discovered and available for inspection by 00 p.m. on Monday, the 7th November, 1994, we will be seeking instructions to again re ... 2 list this matter seeking orders compelling your clients to make proper discovery. In those circumstances, we will be seeking costs. Yours faithfully, GREER TIMMS"

        "text": "LEADER OF THE PACK Inbreeding has paid off for the bulldog. Macks latest truck, the FleetLiner, marks a return to giving customers what they want choice. Alan Whiting takes one of the pups for a run dotted line Its likely that quite a few of our readers are going to find themselves behind the wheels of Mack FleetLiners our recent road test shows that there are worse places to be. While Mack Trucks Australias parent company has always offered outside engines, transmissions, suspensions and axles, the local arm has been almost entirely allMack. We can think of a few departures, involving Cat and Cummins engines for special customers, but those builds were definitely not the norm. Mack must have walked away from quite a few deals in the past, where customers insisted on sticking with an established fleet policy of, say, Detroit engines, Eaton boxes and Rockwell diffs, but thats all changed and the Mack Select model lets buyers have precisely that choice. The FleetLiner doesnt provide quite so broad a choice of options, excerpt box because the Mack E7 engine is the only powerplant on offer, but the transmission choice is Eaton RT 14710B 10speed or RTLO 14613B 13speed, driving to Eaton DS 451P diffs. Suspension choices are Hendrickson HFS 400 fourspring or HAS 400 air. The Mack E7 engine has been rated at 375hp 280kW at 1800rpm for the FleetLiner, which is a lazy output for an engine that now pumps out 454hp. But in the best Mack tradition, torque is the engines long suit, with no less than 1980Nm 1460 lbft on tap at 1250rpm. A Jake brake is standard equipment. Claimed tare weight of 750kg for the base model FleetLiner pits this truck directly against the 311litre opposition from Kenworth, Western Star, Ford and International which it matches in terms of horsepower and easily outtorques. deep frame The only questionable area is fuel consumption, which only time and some fleet experience will answer. Mack people must be pretty confident about the fuel consumption situation, because theyre talking guaranteed fuel usage to some customers. The FleetLiner is built to a 4320mm wheelbase on a deep 269mm x 8mm rail, mounting Macks standard cab on damped air suspension. Its a CH model, with a short bonnet and mudguard assembly, in contrast to the Select Version, which has the CLs longer nose. Twin 350litre aluminium step tanks are fitted below the doors. A Mack 5tonnerated steel axle is located by 1753mm taper leaf front springs and shock absorbers, and turned through a claimed 9metre circle by a Ross SGP52 power steering box. Standard rolling gear consists of cast spider hubs with detachable rims and Alcoa 10stud aluminium wheels are optional. Steel air tanks and two battery boxes are fitted inside the chassis rails, behind the cab. wide cab The shed vies with Freightliner for the best bonneted cab on the market award and features integrated air conditioning, heated mirrors and an airsuspended KAB seat as standard. The seat carries an integrated seat belt, which we found to be very comfortable to use. The steering column adjusts for reach and height. Although its a short cab, the width is such that theres plenty of space to stow a tool box, esky and all the normal driver life support equipment. Instrumentation is confined to the vitals speed, engine speed, oil pressure, coolant temperature, battery charge, air restriction, air pressure, turbo temperature and fuel level, and all excerpt box but the air restriction indicator are grouped right in front of the driver. Illuminated rocker switches to the left of the instruments look after lights, wipers and washers and the Jake, while cruise control switches sit on top of the dash. The radio mounts in an overhead console right above the drivers head, with ample space for a couple of communications sets as well. A long gear lever pokes up through the floor, in an ideal position for shifting, but without restricting acrosscab walking. The trailer brake lever is mounted on the dashboard and the parking brake and trailer supply controls are those awful red and yellow mushrooms beloved of American photo truck makers. Pedal layout is excellent, with brake and accelerator controls being light to use and wellrelated. The Spicer Easy Pedal clutch worked with very little effort and with an easilyfelt friction point. Our evaluation FleetLiner was supplied with the optional 13speed box, accompanying 71 back end ratio and air suspension. It was coupled to Macks venerable VMac triaxle trailer and loaded to 40 tonnes gross. We chose a northbound run on the NSW Pacific Highway to check out the new Macks suitability for freeway cruising, town driving, cornering and steep hill climbing. We know from experience that anything over 5mpg is good fuel consumption on that challenging route. The FleetLiner is easy to get in and out of, thanks to wide steps on the tanks and generous grab rails. The adjustable seat and steering column will accommodate most shapes in comfort, while vision through the large twopiece screen and west coast mirrors is very good. ample torque The Mack 12litre started readily without the oncefamiliar airstart whistle, a probable victim of noise regulations, and settled into a high idle until warm, when it lowered the tone somewhat. Engine response, clutch action and positive gear selection made traffic driving a breeze. Theres nothing sweeter than an RTLO Eaton. The clutch had been fielded by some fleet demo work before we got our hands on it, so it was prone to shudder if too much was fed into it too early. We found that the Mack six had photo ample clutch engagement torque to handle offthrottle starts in most circumstances where first gear was too high, we selected low. Theres so much torque available that its difficult to find any sweet spot in the FleetLiners rev range. We found that shortshifting at 1600rpm worked well in low range and 1800rpm was quite sufficient for clean upshifts in high range. We ran the engine up to 2100rpm for the best engine braking effect, because theres not much available around cruising revs. The FleetLiners flat power curve plateaus at 1500rpm, giving constant power from there to governed revs. As revs fall back from cruise to grunt mode, torque climbs rapidly from 1700Nm at 1600rpm to nearly 2000Nm at 1250rpm. The effect, as youre climbing a grade, is that revs decay very slowly, so road speed stays up. Most undulations can be handled without even a button downshift in the 13speed. If the driver miscalculates and lets the revs fall below the peak torque speed, theres no dramatic collapse on the wrong side of the curve, which still provides 1900Nm at 1100rpm. throttle response We found it best to downshift two gears in high range when running through steep hills, keeping revs around the 1400rpm mark, for the best combination of torque and power. On less demanding stretches of the Pacific Highway, the Mack FleetLiner cruised at 15501600rpm for a speed limited 100kmh, or 1450rpm for a legal 90kmh on nonfreeway stretches. We think Mack may be a little pessimistic gearing the FleetLiner for a 1600rpm cruising speed, because its got plenty of grunt to cope with a 1450rpm 100kmh cruise. Dropping the revs should help fuel consumption on long hauls. Macks VMac cruise control works very well, with twoswitch control over setting, coasting, resuming and accelerating. The system also brings in the Jake and doesnt drop out when you use the clutch. It does bail out, however, photo when road speed gets down around 60kmh, giving you a fright the first time the fire goes out on a steep hill. Noise levels in the CH short cab are higher than in the sleeper version, but what a noise The engine growls in a most pleasant way and makes a characteristic popping noise when the revs get down around 1300rpm you can hear every power stroke. The Jake isnt obtrusive, inside or out. Handling was excellent, with good steering feel and very little cab sway. Badly broken bitumen made its presence known in the cab, but the ride was never harsh. Cornering was helped by instant throttle response at virtually any revs, straightening out nicely on corner exits. We did the SydneyBrisbane run in two hours less than a Mack Manager, pulling the same trailer. Fuel consumption was slightly higher, 5mpg, but the truck had only 2000km on the clock when we collected it and should be good for at least 6mpg when it gets run in properly. easy checks The Mack FleetLiner is an excellent work station, but it isnt perfect. Mack has countered the hot foot brigades complaints by pouring conditioned air into the footwells, but at the expense of facelevel ventilation. The mirrors give a good view and theyre heated for rapid demist in the morning, but an electric adjustment would be useful on the near side one. They also look a bit oldfashioned bolted on the sides of a streamlined cab. Daily checks shouldnt be a problem, thanks to a bonnet that is an easy oneman lift and walkin access to the mechanicals. Oil and coolant levels can be checked without lifting the lid. Macks new FleetLiner is one of the results of the Australian companys changed philosophy give the customers what they want. HIGH AND MIGHTY photo The new Volvo FH12 and its electronic engine is a leap ahead of the Swedish manufacturer. On a trip down the Hume the package gave Yank iron a run for its money. When Volvo unveiled its FH range of trucks in Sweden back in late 93 there was plenty of comment on the radical streamlined design, but the big surprise was the introduction of a 12 litre engine featuring electronics and an overhead camshaft. The D12A engine is a 1 litre inline six cylinder diesel, turbocharged and intercooled, with a seven bearing crankshaft, one cylinder head, overhead cam and four photo valves per cylinder. It has vertical and centrally located unit injectors and electronic fuel injection control. Three horsepower ratings are available, 340, 380 and 420, with torque figures of 1500Nm, 1700Nm and 1850 from the 420 variant. There has been plenty of interest from operators and drivers here, so Volvo put a cavalcade on the road to reach the people, and on its return an FH12 with a number of kilometres on the clock was made available for a road test. The truck wa powered by the D12A420 engine which puts out 309kW 420 metric horsepower or 414 SAE hp between 1700 and 1800rpm, and 1850Nm 1365 ftlb of torque between 1100 and 1300 revs. The 14speed SR1900 synchromesh transmission fitted is a range change gearbox with crawl and two reverse gears, and splitter section, with top gear direct. caption Down at the rear end the final drive is Volvos CTEV87 tandem with single reduction and diff lock, with a ratio of 07, and the suspension is air bag with eight bellows and four double acting hydraulic shock absorbers. The FH12 had a three metre wheelbase, 7 tonne front axle, twoleaf parabolic spring front suspension, ten stud disc wheels, 29580R5 tyres and two 585 litre fuel tanks. Up in the work area this truck was fitted with a number of options including plush trim and wood dash along with a factory fitted fridge, but this merely complemented the roomy cab with its excellent driving position and visibility. The dashboard is curved with controls for ventilation, engine brake and climate control to the left of the driver, and the instrument panel with its full array of gauges and warning lights,is immediately in front of the driver and easily scanned. safety shed Volvo has spent a lot of money on the development of the ergonomics of the cab as well as its aerodynamic shape, and the result is a comfortable work environment and one of the slipperiest cabovers in the business with the accent on fuel savings. Volvo claims the shape of the new cab offers between six and eleven per cent in fuel savings over the F Series trucks, depending on application, and the air drag has been reduced by about 20 per cent."

        "text": "8 Set down this a conversation had already lapped at Gabriels edges years before. He had paddled in it inattentively, he was just a child, he certainly didnt remember that hed heard it. There are many things people dont know that they know. Once, when I asked Charles why he took photographs so constantly, so obsessively, why he collected other peoples photographs, why he scavenged in secondhand shops and bought, by the shoebox full, old cracked brownandcream records of other peoples pasts, he said So that I will see what Ive seen. Of the Chien hexagram, he said, his ancestor Fu Hsi had this to say Within the Earth there is a Mountain. He smiled, apologetic. Im afraid Fu Hsi had a maddening and elliptical style. Charlie frequently spoke in the maddening elliptical manner of Fu Hsi. He spoke on rice paper in brush stroke that had to be laid down in a ritually specified way. The mountain, as Charlie saw it, was that intractable thing that was always blocking ones view. It was the thing that would not be dislodged. The mountain, according to Charlie, is an obstruction that we partly create, it is the thick solidified lava of the things we know but dont realise we know. Our task, if we want to clamber over or round the mountain, Charlie said, is to observe more sharply, to set everything down, to record the minutiae, to add to the documentation on premonition and coincidence and chance, to know what we know, so that we may inch ourselves toward that place from which everything will be seen and understood. That is why I take photographs, Charlie said. At least to know what we know that would be a start, he said. I think he was right. Consider this recent item in the Sydney Morning Herald a woman was assaulted and robbed late one afternoon on a side street in Darlinghurst. In these days when the quarry seems to dilate and distend itself like a jellyfish in the shallows, when it can pass as invisibly as a virus into the world of order, when the residents of Darlinghurst shelter themselves as from the plague behind high garden walls, no one saw the incident. A black car pulls up these things can only happen in the present tense, they go on and on happening, they never recede, they are always now, the rear door opens, a man leaps out, he holds a knife to the womans throat. After that, confusion. Touching her bruises and cracked ribs, the woman conjectures I think I screamed, I think maybe I struggled, I think I wouldnt let go the strap of my purse, I seem to have been in the back seat of the car, but that cant be right. Pain like a hot poker is all she remembers, and gutter dust in her mouth, and herself as a comma of shock against the kerb. As the car drives off, she stares after it dully. Why does no one come running It happened so fast, she tells the police from a hospital bed. I never saw the driver at all. She seems to have a sharp vision of the cracks on the leather of the back seat, though this cant be right. Of the backseat assailant, however, she recalls with eerie clarity the colour of his eyes, the brown spiky hair sprouting above his head, the freckles, the blister on his lip, the dark hair on his arms, a scar on the third finger of his right hand, the mole at his wrist, and the fact that the knife was a large kitchen knife, the kind used for cubing steak or peeling and chopping pumpkin. Its blade was mottled and old. She remembers having a sharp memory of her grandmother making beef stew and of a long conversation in the kitchen about one of her uncles. And what about the number plate of the car the police ask. The woman is embarrassed and furious with herself. I must have stared at it as the car drove away, she says, frustrated. She remembers what her grandmother was saying about her uncle, but not the number of the car. A police hypnotist is engaged and his lullaby voice cradles her, seduces her, leads her back down the velvet shaft of time to where she lies huddled on the kerb. Can you see the number plate on the car the hypnotist asks. Yes, she says in a sleepers voice. Read the number, the hypnotist commands. And she does. Now you are struggling with your attacker again, the hypnotist says. The woman jackknifes into a selfprotective curve, she throws her hands up in front of her face. The man with the knife cannot harm you, I will not let him harm you, the hypnotist says. Now tell me, can you see the driver of the car I am watching the man with the knife, the woman says, but the driver is in the corner of my eye. Describe the driver, the hypnotist says. Uhh, the woman cries, doubling up again, her hands over her face. He is too close to see, she says. What is the driver doing the hypnotist asks. He is hurting me, the woman sobs. We are in the back seat, he is hurting me. I do not permit him to hurt you, he cannot hurt you, the hypnotist says. Describe the driver, he insists. She describes the driver in detail. Let us suppose, however, that there had been no hypnosis. Remember the woman has told the police that she never saw the driver at all. She is quite certain of this. Let us suppose, however, that the driver of the car had entered her hospital room as a medical orderly. Would she not have recoiled Would she not have felt a violent jolt, an apparently unaccountable and irrational spasm of panic She might tell herself Ive never seen this man before in my life but her body would retain the knowledge of harm. Charlie, an intelligence gatherer himself, a kind of interrogator, a man who had been on both sides of harm, knew that this sort of thing could happen. He knew that it happened all the time. He knew that censors, both hapless and cunning, guard all the doorways of memory. On a different night altogether from the night of the childhood conversation he didnt remember, on a night shortly after he began to work for Charlie, Gabriel was serving at the bar of Charlies Inferno when the judge arrived. I was working, so it must have been a Tuesday or a Wednesday or possibly a Thursday, those were the nights I worked downstairs. Weekends, well, that was upstairs, that was heavy traffic time. It was a Wednesday, I think. My regular table, Charlie the judge asked, and I remember how Gabriel twisted round rather fast from a shelf of spirits at the sound of the voice. I remember that the judge glanced idly, as one does, in the direction of the movement and that the judges hand, which lay lightly on the sleeve of the coat he was handing to Charlie, then registered something the fingers clenched themselves into the palm, and four cords stood up like guy ropes across the back of the judges hand. Then the fingers uncurled and splayed themselves, stretching, and then they relaxed. Gabriel. The judges tone, as always, was cordial and measured. There was a nod of polite but restrained acknowledgment in Gabriels direction, the kind that people with power give to underlings. There was a smile. To me it seemed that the smile implied not only distance and the habit of easy courtesy, but also a warning. Or perhaps I thought so because of the tone of that Gabriel, the civil finality of it, the way it made clear that a passing comment on any matters of shared knowledge was not to be thought of. Although we had met before, in quite other circumstances, the judge and I, he did not seem to be aware of me at all. He turned back to Charlie. My wifes coming separately. And our other guests. Theyre here already, Your Honour, Charlie said, and the way he said it fascinated me, the way the voice seemed like a thing apart from Charlie, a synthetic voice, the voice of a robot, a voice acting the part of a voice. And then the judge moved on quickly unnecessarily quickly, I thought through the small lush atrium corridor, to the restaurant. Charlie was watching Gabriel. What was that all about he asked. Nothing, Gabriel said. Inscrutability is, in fact, a tactical skill, a habit of survival. Charlie had acquired it in childhood. I mastered it quickly, naturally, given the nature of my profession I mean, once I had embarked on my calling. Gabriel, being someone who found truth puzzling, sometimes even painful, but not yet dangerous, was just a learner. Although he tried valiantly to hide it, you could tell he was rattled. Through practice, one can experience shock like a slow wave of sleeping medication one can delay ones reaction for hours or days, even years. I went on making careful notations in the reservations ledger, watching Gabriel and Charlie. After what must have been at least a full minute, Charlie said casually You know the judge Mnh, Gabriel grunted noncommittaly, moving glasses around. Minutes passed. Charlie disappeared through the swing doors into the kitchen. Gabriel mixed two Bloody Marys, placed them on a tray, and took them to the two women at one end of the bar. Charlie came back from the kitchen. Do you Gabriel asked. Do I what Possible elided verbs slid through Charlies mind like stops on a lottery wheel. Know him. Of all possible moments, the one that came back to Charlie with a sick thump so I choose to think now, from this distance, from my vantage point was the two of them in school uniforms himself and the judge going into Changs Grocers Greengrocers on Newmarket Road in Brisbane, and there was Cat, as well as Charlies own parents, behind the counter. But it could as easily have been a picnic at Cedar Creek Falls that he saw, or the railway cutting, how would I know Any splinter had a dangerous edge. Charlie pulled down a shutter. The judge eats here often, he shrugged. Gabriel tapped off two beers for the restaurant and held them out toward Charlie. He smiled. Why dont you read the judges tea leaves, Charlie Charlie said nothing. He was watching Gabriels fingers against the beer glasses, and I was watching Charlie watching Gabriel. His table for eight was the table Judge Robinson Gray always reserved. No doubt his preference stemmed from the habits of a legal mind, from that scrupulous attention to fine points which a judge must cultivate, for he had given standing instructions about many aesthetic details and about placement of the table at the centre of the glasscanopied courtyard. At first this surprised us. Most diners want privacy, intimacy, the romantic, all of which were available off the courtyard, in the ferned enclaves with their glimpses of Rushcutters Bay. Some patrons, however, do not mind being observed. At times His Honour had requested, in his charming way, that an earthenware pot be shifted a little. Its waxy trail of orchids, perhaps, was obscuring another diners view or possibly the showy clusters of bougainvillea were a bother. His Honour would lightly touch the arm of a young waitress who was passing, he would put his hand on her wrist, she would feel constrained to bend close and listen to his whispered request, so that, with their foreheads almost touching, for a moment the two would seem to be lovers. He might even lift the fall of her hair from her cheek and hold it gently aside in a manner both suggestive and dotted line well, judicious, quaintly formal, certainly irreproachable, in order to murmur his order privately."

        "text": "Superficially it may seem that literary works appeal more to the intellect than the emotions given that active participation is required to decipher a piece of literature. Likewise it may appear that films appeal to emotions, especially of with the use of sensationalism and special effects used to grab an audiences attention. However this does not take into account the fl film makers and the authors ability to l manipulate their medium to create a work. The respective skills expertise of the authorfilm maker and the with and creative use of these, is enough the key to reversing this notion. Intellectual appeal is achieved through active participation, exercise of the imagination, the layering of detail and the multiplicity of levels. It cannot be concluded that only literature fall falls under these elements. Nowhere better is there an example of active participation in a film greater than in Greenaways Prosperos Books. The audience is required to combine all the elements and relate to them to some previous cinematic experience to extract meaning. Greenaway asks the audience to exercise imagination both visually aurally. He layers the images in great detail, using every aspect of photography. It is not the conventional means of achieving simultaneous action and it is the lack of convention that works the mind. Similarly he uses unconventional means in sound. Gielguds Prospero has the voice over for all the characters, a suggeslion suggesting that he has the power over the other characters. When this power is relinquished we hear a more natural realistic use of voices. Likewise sound is used to add depth to character, with distortions for Caliban, echoes and unsynchronised voices. In doing so Greenaway gives the narrative a figurative level as well as a literal one. Shakespeares tale of the Tempest is told but Prospero becomes the creator, and the with Shakespearean power over the content. His pen becomes his sword. The mise en scene is detailed and layered a showing multiplicity of themes. From disorder to order, violence to harmony, nature versus art is all visually presented to the audience, in the detailed imagery that parallels a Renaissance painting. Like Shakespeares poetry, the more Greenaways film is viewed the greater depth of meaning is revealed and on subsequent viewing an audience understands more. It is not the a film that is felt or willed but one where the mind is in control. Films cannot be categorised into those that only mostly deal with emotions as literature cannot be categorised into only appealing to the mind. Literature has the ability to evoke and feelings and tantalise senses. McEwans treatment of the Comfort of Strangers shows an authors skill in touching the disturbing the emotions. Simultaneously he draws the reader and repels. In the same way as Mary and Colin are fascinated with the repulsive the Freudian theory of Unheimlich so to is the reader tantalised by something that is quite disturbing. McEwans to emotional hold over the reader is embedded in the discourse. His style is economical and his careful word choice use make everything said, purposeful. There is the use of many wordunclears that express order and rationality along with those express discomfort and lack of control. Juxtaposition too, ps places routine and pattern alongside disorder and disquiet. Just as the reader feels secure in the text plot it they are imbalanced with something disturbing. There is no nominalisation of the setting, a feeling of insecurity and just as the reader is revealed more and becomes familiar with the known, the plot takes away that security. The reader is beholden to McEwans power, as the just as Mary Colin an are momentarily relaxed in Roberts company to be caught in his power. At this point in the story novel, the reader is not exercising the mind to come to grips with the plot. There may be some psychoanalysis of theme and characters at the conclusion, but the overwhelming ws urge is continue. McEwan has achieved a hold over the emotions while tantalising the senses of the reader. It can b almost be paralleled to Marys urge to scratch the mosquito bites, which knowingly worsen if she does. So the reader is urged to continue in a powerless fashion. Greenaways clever example of an intellectual film and McEwans unclear disturbing novel are fine instances of an film maker and author being able to manipulate their medium. If the art form can be worked to suit the purpose of its creator then it can be categorised into intellectual or emotional boxes. To do this is to deny the ability of a skilled artist. Texts and cinematic translations are fundamentally different medias. They have their own unique set of codes and techniques. It is the use of these codes and techniques that an author a film maker suit to their purpose. A reader or audience will adopt a particular attitude by feeling empathy with the creator or feeling confronted with by them. A playwright has the use of words to create images and time. Hi Themes and viewpoints must be embedded in the discourse and revealed through the characters on stage. Shaws play Pygmalion reveals a number of themes important to his notion of portraying realism. These themes are disguised in his comedy, the art of educating through entertainment. The these of comment on socioeconomic bin level class tied to money is expressed through his variety of characters the EynsfordHills have respectability and no money, Higgins treats all classes equally rude. Elizas independence comes with education, she will be able to teach as Higgins does to make her way, for. The theme of technologys effect on humanity is discussed, Eliza is Higgins Pickerings experiment, devoid of humanity and feelings not taken into consideration. Shaws use of comedy, Mrs Higgins athome party as an example, to enables his audience to escape the realism of the class struggle, they suspend their unclear disbelief momentarily in entertainment. By embedding his attitude in genre, style and technique, Shaw educates his audiences, reveals his viewpoint but disguises it in entertainment that allows diverts the audience to be from the immediacy of the world around them. The film maker must use a different set of codes and techniques to reveal point of view. Pascals, 1938, production of Pygmalion adopts a romantic attitude to Shaws play. Unlike Shaws Pygmalion with its nonromantic outlook between the sexes, the aim this film adopts the opposing view. Although it adheres to the text, for the most part, for it is in the conclusion where the film makers true intention lies. The ending is altered significantly, taking the romantic approach, one universally appealing. In addition to the screen play being a significant element so too are the visual images created. Pascals production has a younger physically attractive Higgins, a romantic quality, all making the romantic conclusion more acceptable. Similarly, Eliza is less repulsive, dirty, whose voice doesnt irritate as imagined it should. The realism if the lower class struggle, its poverty, lack of education and means is softened. These subdued images is creates a a fantasy for the audience and a form of escape. The big screen, with its commanding attention is size, proximity and movement may well overwhelm its audience with i unclear the ugliness of realism. The film maker, in addition to screenplay and characters has used sound and all aspects of mise en scene to develop the romantic notion. The music is melodramatic in Pascals Pygmalion and the to lighting and scenery is subdued concealing the true images of London lower class life. The filmmaker is concerned with making the visual aspects significant whilst the playwright making significant visual Robert Richardson Literature the Novel Both must use the codes and techniques of their own medium to develop attitude The playwrit playwright has only words which are revealed through character plot whilst the film maker has visual um immediacy full of detail, which mu The statement provided in the question do assist in analyzing the unclear story The Dead and the film The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith. There are other issues touched on in both of these works, though the conflict between two sets of cultural values is evident in both. In The Dead, the conflict, or conflicts, arise essentially between past and present. The figure of Gabriel, product of a new intellectual order, seemingly happy with Gretta, is pitted against the old ways in the shape of many of the other characters. He is of a cosmopolitan viewpoint or at least a viewpoint encompassing more than Ireland, which is one of the basic tenets of the everymans emerging perception of himself versus the world. The old, insular notions of nonquestioning, nonintellectualism are displayed most of all by Gabriel two old aunts. Their old age is a metaphor for the decrepitude into which their thinking has fallen. This is the dying society of The Dead. One of nonquestioning being replaced by another intellectual one. The evidence is to be found at several points through the story. Firstly, there is the discussion of singers, in which despite even the evidence in front of their ears, as it were, of Mr Bartell Darcy, all the best singers were long ago. The golden age for these people is way back when. When it is suggested that such singers exist in other locales on the Continent, it is dismissed as an irrelevancy. They cannot adapt. Gabriel, in his speech, speaks of preserving the old fashioned honest values of welcome and kindness that Irelands famous for. They are being lost to the new hyperintellectuals. It is certainly a cynical and ironic speech, spoken certainly for the audience, given that he considers his aunts to be ignorant. In his mind even it is possible he knows that their kind is slipping away, and he most likely does not altogether mourn for that. There are surprises for him too, however, that are ironic in light of his new thinking. Upon arriving, his programmed chatting with a girl he has seen grow into a young woman, should by the polite game of conversation in this culture, see her happily and conventionally talking of taking her place in the culture regardless of her personal feelings. Instead her exclamations regarding her true thoughts on men demonstrate a break from the past. The fact that Gabriel is not prepared for this shows him to be a unclear raw product of this dying culture, even if he has attempted to refine himself. His The crow to pluck that Miss Ivors has with him points out an even different restructuring from a simple ignorance to intellectual thought. Miss Ivors, while clearly breaking with tradition in many ways, nonetheless seems to see Ireland and its wellbeing the first duty of any citizen. Her gently prodding of G.C. over his lit reviews seems at first a playful jibe, but her calling him, in public, a West Briton, mainly due to his holiday destination it would seem, show that there is not a onetoone correlation between becoming intellectually aware, and increasing ones horizons. The old society of nonquestioning is dying, but it is being replaced by a multitude of new thoughts, as bef its a critically analytical culture. Finally, the revelations that Gretta provides in terms of Michael Furey reveal how pointless Gabriels intellectual travail has been, how much it appears to have stifled him as a feeling person. It points out that the death of a nonthinking culture is not altogether a good thing if the capacity to feel is lost as well. In the end, it doesnt matter. The blanket of snow falls, death comes regardless of thought, and the struggle of birth becomes an irrelevance. Still, this is the central theme of the story, and is helpful to bear in mind in analyzing it. In The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith, the story is played out against the backdrop of impending federation in Australia. This differs from the dead in that it is only a political realignment, rather than a fundamental cultural emergence."

        "text": "Danger and Context Unsafe Anal Sexual Practice among Homosexual and Bisexual Men in the AIDS Crisis R.W. Connell, J. Crawford, G.W. Dowsett, S. Kippax, V. Sinnott, P Rodden, R. Berg School of Behavioural Sciences Macquarie University D. Baxter AIDS Council of New South Wales L. Watson Department of Government University of Sydney ABSTRACT Exploring the social dimension of sexuality is crucial to prevention strategies for AIDS. New developments in social theories of sexuality can inform empirical research. A survey of 535 gay and bisexual men in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory was designed in the light of practicebased analyses of gender and sexuality. Anal intercourse without condoms ranks high in physical and emotional significance though it is known to be relatively unsafe with regard to transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus. This practice shows few statistical connections to variables describing social structure, but is linked to variables describing gay social milieu attachment, patterns of sexuality, and awareness of the situation created by the AIDS crisis. Potentially dangerous anal practice is more common within established relationships and especially common with men who describe themselves as monogamous. This creates dilemmas for prevention strategy. Connections between social variables and the frequency of unprotected anal intercourse point to the importance of informed social support for safer sex. Prevention strategy needs to emphasise collective action, not just personal change. INTRODUCTION A public health crisis has been created by the recent spread of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV. This is the virus responsible for the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome AIDS in a considerable proportion of those infected by it. Sexual intercourse is the main transmission pathway of the virus, on a world scale mainly heterosexual intercourse in Africa, principally homosexual intercourse among men in many advanced capitalist countries. Other pathways exist, notably via blood transfusion and via needle sharing among injecting drug users the former in decline, the latter on the rise in New York City and southern Europe this has now become the main source of new cases. In Australia the main pathway so far has been sexual intercourse among homosexual men. Since there is no medical cure for AIDS, the responsibility for stopping the epidemic falls on social and educational action. The centrepiece has been the campaign for safe sex conducted by gay mens media, gay communitybased organisations, and the public health system. A detailed account of these programs is given by Dowsett, 1989. Rules for safe sex have been formulated and circulated use condoms, avoid exchange of body fluids, etc. Some recent evidence on the declining rate of new HIV infection suggests these programs are having an effect Burcham et al., 1989. But the continuing spread of the virus demands continued preventive action. Safe sex work still faces many dilemmas. Why does unsafe practice continue In what settings does it occur Should campaigns be targeted on particular groups What kinds of information are most needed What kinds of appeal work best fear altruism solidarity Social, rather than medical, research is required to provide answers to these questions. We think it important that the specific capacities of the social sciences to deal with these issues should be recognised and mobilised. The epidemiological category of a risk group, for instance, can be very misleading when uncritically applied to educational issues. It needs to be replaced by an understanding of the historicallyconstituted pathways of transmission in different social and cultural milieux. There is a strong tendency in research on AIDS to abstract particular behaviours from their contexts in personal and social life. This often renders them unintelligible and gives little guidance for preventive action. A close attention to social context is mandatory for any analysis of sexual behaviour, given what is known about the strength of the social patterning of sexual conduct Gagnon and Simon, 1974 Caplan, 1987. However, the social context is not selfexplanatory. Weak allusions to social context abound in the literature of behavioural medicine studies of health behaviour often include an undifferentiated set of social or demographic descriptor items among their independent variables. Implicitly, the social in such research is understood as a static set of influencesontheindividual. This is profoundly inadequate in the light of modern social theory, which emphasises the active interplay between personal practice and social structure, and especially in the light of contemporary work on gender and sexuality Connell, 1987 Weeks, 1986. Sexuality must be understood as inherently social, not merely as a biologicalphenomenon withasocialcontext. Many social relationships are in considerable part constituted by sexuality, forming networks and institutions which, like all other forms of social structuring, are dynamic in historical time. Such evolving patterns of social relationship form the crucially important contexts of particular sexual practices. Here we are concerned to develop this approach to a key issue in prevention. The group of most concern in Australian preventive work so far is men who have sex with men whether selfidentified as gay or not. The sexual practice which appears in international research to be the main pathway of HIV transmission among gay men Kingsley et al., 1987 is anal intercourse not protected by condoms. Anal intercourse, as it happens, is not just a risky element in a sexual repertoire. It is a practice that has had major historical significance in the social construction of mens homosexuality. It was specifically targeted by religious and criminal sanctions against the abominable crime of buggery and has remained central to hostile stereotypes of homosexual men. Accordingly it became a major issue in attempts at law reform and in the Gay Liberation movements claims for sexual freedom. See for instance Kinsmans 1987 interesting discussion of these themes in Canadian gay history. It is a practice with a heavy load of social meaning. For gay men it is likely to symbolise oppression and freedom even for those who do not find it a significant part of sexual pleasure. Our data on contemporary practice come from a survey of sexuality among homosexual and bisexual men in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. In another report Connell and Kippax, 1990 we have shown that analgenital intercourse is regarded by the respondents in this survey as the most physically satisfying practice in the sexual repertoire, and among the more emotionally satisfying. It is part of a welldefined pattern of anal sex which emerges in a factor analysis of an inventory of sexual practice. Elsewhere Connell et al.,l989 we have shown a marked drop in the reported frequency of this practice and of others believed to be unsafe. In this paper we explore a series of questions. What appraisals are being made of unprotected anal sex by our respondents how risky is it thought to be In what groups and settings is it most often occurring, and where is it relatively rate What light does a study of those contexts throw on the dynamics of the collective response to the HIV epidemic And how can this knowledge be used in the design of prevention work FIELDWORK AND SAMPLE The Social Aspects of Prevention of AIDS SAPA project is a joint undertaking of the communitybased AIDS Council of New South Wales and social scientists from Macquarie University and the University of Sydney. The first stage of a longterm research program was a survey of social and sexual practice among gay and bisexual men. Most AIDS prevention research, in Australia as in the United States, has been confined to metropolitan samples. The SAPA sample was mainly drawn from metropolitan Sydney but was also designed to include men from rural areas and small cities in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory in numbers roughly proportional to population. A nonclinical sample was sought, to complement and move beyond the clinical and epidemiological research currently underway in Sydney Sydney AIDS Study Group, 1984. It was also decided, to maximise the quality of the data and the diversity of the sample, to use face to face interviews rather than the selfadministered questionnaires which are common in United States research, and to do as many interviews as possible in respondents homes rather than at a university or medical facility. This resulted in a very complex and time consuming piece of fieldwork which is described in detail in a report available from the authors Connell et al., 1988. Fieldwork lasted from September 1986 to March Interviewers were mostly gay and bisexual men. All were recruited specifically for this project and were given detailed training which covered the design of the project, technicalities of the questionnaire, AIDS issues generally, and problems of interviewing about sexuality. Respondents were recruited via appeals in mainstream mass media advertising and news items in gay media distribution of cards at clinics, saunas, gay community events, etc. circulars and visits to gay mens groups and organisations and personal networks e.g.snowballing from early respondents. 535 interviews were completed. The interview schedule covered approximately 1,000 items of information and usually took from one and a half to two hours to complete. We defined the population for the study as men who have sex with men , or have had within the last five years, regardless of identity. Eightynine per cent or respondents described themselves as gay, homosexual or camp 8 per cent described themselves as bisexual or heterosexual. Broad social characteristics of the sample are shown under Structure Variables in table A comparison with census and labour force statistics across a range of variables details in Connell et al., 1988 shows that many characteristics of the SAPA sample resemble, to a fair approximation, those of the general population of adult men. Differences emerge in religion, with a high proportion reporting none and in region, where the sample has a concentration in the neighbourhood of Oxford Street, the main centre of gay commercial and social life in Sydney. A difference also emerges in social class, with workingclass men underrepresented. The class bias is unfortunate, but is by no means as marked as in comparable United States research e.g. Research and Decisions Corporation, 1984 Bauman and Siegel, 1987. Given the difficulties of sampling in such fieldwork well discussed by Watters and Biernacki, 1989, the SAPA sample is satisfactorily diverse. THE INVENTORY OF SEXUAL PRACTICES The studys major source of information on sexual conduct was an inventory of items on sexual practices. Pilot interviews for the project used a long undifferentiated list of practices. This was conceptually cumbersome and proved very slow to administer some way of condensing the interview without losing detail was essential. Accordingly, we adapted from Campbell et al. 1986 the device of distinguishing in the layout of the questionnaire general categories of practice from more specific details. For instance the section of the inventory on unprotected anal intercourse with ejaculation looked like this Anal Intercourse Fucking2 without condoms Activegiving Fucking partner and cuming inside Receiving being fucked with partner cuming It was possible to record responses for both general and specific categories. But if a respondent reported, for instance, no experience of the general category, the specific categories were skipped. This shortened the inventory in most interviews sexual athletes excepted. The inventory contained 16 general categories of practice, with 40 specific categories, making 56 items in all. Three of the general categories concerned anal intercourse one without condoms and with ejaculation one without ejaculation and one with condoms this last is not discussed in this paper. In the course of the interview, the interviewer worked through the full inventory up to seven times, with questions of differing orientation. The three which are of most concern here were about sex with men in ones private sex life aExperienceenjoyment. With each one, could you tell me if you have tried it and if you have, how much you enjoyed it 3 point rating scale bFrequency regular partner.

        "text": "Official probe involves former top policeman By ALEX MITCHELL NSW Ombudsman David Landa is investigating a car accident involving the former head of the Drug Enforcement Agency, Assistant Commissioner Eric Strong. Mr Strong took early retirement last month from his job as the States top drugs investigator. His decision to quit the police force after 30 years distinguished service is not connected with Mr Landas investigation. The complaint about Mr Strong was referred to the Ombudsmans Office by a State MP last year. It followed a car accident in the city on a Friday night after work. Mr Strong is believed to have returned to police headquarters shortly after the accident where he was interviewed by police. The Ombudsmans Office has not yet decided whether its investigation warrants a report to Police Minister Ted Pickering. A decision will be taken in the next two or three weeks. Mr Strongs decision to seek early retirement shocked his colleagues who had expected him to stay at the DEA for a full term of at least three years. He was apparently concerned about the proliferation of elite agencies such as the rival State Drug Crime Commission and the National Crime Authority as well as the emergence of the Independent Commission Against Corruption ICAC. In a controversial speech last year, Mr Strong said the answer to law enforcement was not necessarily to have the NSW taxpayer fund additional investigating agencies. Mr Strong took over the newlyformed DEA at the end of 1988 after a period of secondment with the NCA. In its first 11 months the DEA rolled 14 drug syndicates operating in NSW, Mr Strong said recently. His position in the police hierarchy was so powerful that he was also given overall control of the gaming and vice squads. Mr Strong is known to have resented an ICAC hearing in which he figured late last year. He and other four senior officers Assistant Commissioner Tony Lauer, Detective Chief Inspectors Heinz Moeller and Barry Dunn and retired Chief Superintendent Ernie Sheperd were subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by the anticorruption commissioner Mr Ian Temby, QC. The ICAC investigation centred on the 1985 police raid on premises occupied by corrupt Sydney businessman Frank Hakim during which the officers were alleged to have planted heroin. Hakim was convicted in January 1987 of possessing heroin and later sentenced to six and a half years jail, along with the former Corrective Services Minister Rex Jackson over the early release of prisoners. During the inquiry, Mr Strong made an impassioned outburst saying he resented being the subject of an ICAC investigation. Ironically, the five officers brought before the ICAC were all allies of Police Commissioner John Avery and played a leading role in regionalising the old CIB and ridding the force of corrupt officers. Gunman shoots seven By Keith Gosman SEVEN people were wounded yesterday when a crazed gunman opened fire near a surf carnival. Hundreds of spectators fled in terror when the gunman, armed with a .223 automatic rifle and shotgun, sprayed gunfire as crowds left the surf carnival opposite Burleigh Heads Hotel, on the Gold Coast. The gunman, dressed in black with a cartridge belt around his waist, was laughing while he was shooting from the balcony of his secondfloor unit. People fled or took cover behind trees as the gunman left the unit and ran through Burleigh Heads, firing at random. He continued firing for 15 minutes until he was shot in the arm by police sergeant Bob Baker, 38, and overpowered by two security guards. A witness said How a lot of people did not get killed is beyond me. A 78yearold woman was in a serious condition in Southport Hospital last night with stomach and leg wounds. Another victim, a bridesmaid, was hit in the leg when the gunman shot at a passing wedding car. Police were questioning a 26yearold Gold Coast man last night and charges were expected to be laid. Security guard Drew Fisher, 21, said he and partner John Gooch were patrolling the carnival when they heard shots coming from all directions. Mr Fisher said they ran towards the shooting and saw a man carrying an automatic rifle and 12guage shotgun. He was firing at random at cars going past, he said. The guards took cover behind bushes 15 metres from the gunman. The sniper was then shot in the arm by the police sergeant and tackled and disarmed by the guards. A Witness, Merryck Williams, said he saw an old lady slumped next to a car riddled with bullet holes. She was bleeding badly as her husband and friends tried to comfort her. Another old lady was shot in the leg, people were screaming and running in all directions, Mr Williams said. He said he saw the gunman standing on the balcony, laughing and shooting. Gold coast resident Brian Kimmins said he had driven into the bottle shop at the Burleigh Heads Hotel when the shooting began. People started running around the corner from the hotel bar, Mr Kimmins said. Someone said hes coming this way and people started bolting. He went through a hell of a lot of ammunition. How a lot of people did not get killed is beyond me. A neighbour said the gunmans unit was covered in slogans such as Satan and bloodstains marked the walls. Police said the gunman was still laughing after his arrest and when they asked him why he went on the rampage, he replied Because I wanted to. It is believed the shooting followed a row at the Burleigh Heads Hotel. Migrant issue Howards move By BRUCE JONES Political Correspondent AUSTRALIA should be able to have a fullblooded, willing immigration debate without people being bullied into silence through fears that they will be tagged as racists, former Federal Opposition Leader John Howard said yesterday. Mr Howard, whose previous remarks about slowing the pace of Asian immigration created a furore, insisted it was impossible to address manpower policy and the labour market without looking at immigration. Mr Howard has just been appointed shadow Industrial Relations Minister and chairman of the Coalitions new manpower and labour market reform group by Opposition Leader John Hewson. Unfortunately, whenever anybody says anything about immigration in this country those who defend the ethnic bureaucratic status quo say you are a racist and I think that is a great pity, Mr Howard said. Why cant we debate the economics of immigration Why cant we have a debate as to whether its a plus or a minus Nobody in politics is seriously arguing that you dont get migrants from all around the world and you dont try and pick people to a substantial degree on the basis of what contribution they are going to make to the country. But the total volume and the mix between skilled and unskilled migrants are legitimate subjects for debate. The thing only becomes racist if people are discriminated against. Opposition immigration spokesman Philip Ruddock also warned yesterday that a shift away from economic migration, resulting in increased welfare and other costs, could undermine broad community support for immigration. At present, about half Australias immigrants are selected on the basis of skills, employer nominations and business migration with the remainder comprising family reunions and refugees. The Coalition believes that is probably a reasonable balance but senior Liberals are know to be concerned that under the new leftwing Immigration Minister Gerry Hand there could be a shift. Mr Ruddock said that important issues that would be central to the immigration debate included bullet A clear view of what Australias sustainable population should be over both the short and longer term. bulletThe economic and environmental consequences of a target population level. bulletThe criteria for migrant entry and specific economic criteria that may need to be met. bulletAppropriate administrative arrangements for casebycase examination of refugee claims or humanitarian considerations. In other developments, a recent call by Dr Hewson for a rational and mature debate on the level of Australias migrant intake was backed by NSW Opposition Leader Bob Carr. Mr Carr said the national immigration level should be reduced from around 140,000 a year to between 70,000 and 100,000 because of increasing pressure on Sydneys limited resources. Their remarks followed claims by former Finance Minister Peter Walsh that the immigration program was seriously aggravating Australias economic problems in the short term. To maintain a stable level of unemployment, economic growth has to be 1 per cent higher because of the immigration program, Senator Walsh said. It is now well documented that 1 per cent GDP growth translates into 2 or 3 per cent higher imports. Its bleeding investment away from the productive sector because of social infrastructure and its feeding the population growth of Sydney. However, Prime Minister Bob Hawke rejected the view, claiming that Australias immigration intake was about right and not a strain on the economy. Mr Hawke also dismissed those who supported reduced immigration or zero immigration as the Rainbow Alliance a strange group of people spanning the extreme Left through to the extreme Right. Im not by philosophic disposition a low immigration person, Mr Hawke said. I would hope that as we go on that we may be able to look at higher levels of immigration. That would be my propensity. Flood victims to receive 3,000 grant From JOHN SYNNOTT in Dubbo THE battling residents of Nyngan will receive an initial grant of 3,000 per household, Premier Nick Greiner announced yesterday. The Government cash would go towards replacing essential appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators, ovens, and bedding, said Mr Greiner during his second visit in a week to the devastated town. In addition, further incomestested assistance will be available for households suffering losses greater than 3, Later, facing a crowd of worried Nyngan evacuees in Dubbo, he promised they would get the whole truth and no bull about the situation in their isolated northern NSW town. But he said his Government would use its powers to prevent residents returning to the flooded town, now a major health risk. He sought to reassure the 2,300 evacuees who have been told they may not return to Nyngan for at least two weeks. The residents are angry that only an advanced group of 30, chosen on Friday, may return to clean out rotting food from homes and shops. There were reports yesterday of gastroenteritis among some emergency workers in Nyngan and in Dubbo evacuees were being inoculated against tetanus. Nyngan has no water or sewerage and the hot weather has increased health risks for the 100 essential service personnel in the town. The public health situation is beyond argument, said Mr Greiner. Many evacuees are anxious to go home. Robyn Lemon said the worst thing was not knowing how her business and home were. But Mr Greiner said Unless public health is fixed, its perfectly obvious nothing else is going to happen in Nyngan. During the visit he acknowledged many residents would not be covered by insurance for flood damage and said the present arrangement may have to be investigated. After touring Nyngan, which he described as a desolate and sad sight, Mr Greiner said roads, rail and health would be rectified this week. An openair concert organised by the State Government, featuring country singer John Williamson, heartened evacuees in Dubbo yesterday. But the shock and emotion of the weeks events caught up with them. Some wept when Williamson sang True Blue and recited a poem written specially for them. The Department of Family and Community Services and St Vincent de Paul are collecting items at the Sydney Showgrounds sports pavilion for the next 10 days from 9 am to 5 pm. Hundreds of people in cars, trailers, and utes poured into the showground yesterday with stoves, chairs and tables, clothes, toasters and electric jugs. St Vincent executive manager John Moore said it was an absolutely remarkable display of generosity. You can ring the Family and Community Services Departments regional office on 289 8400 tomorrow for ways to help."

        "text": "NINE RETIREMENT, OLD AGE AND EVER AFTER Although most of us dont like to think about retirement, let alone old age or death, it is inevitable and we should therefore plan for its advent. Our ageing population is on the increase and with its seemingly exponential growth comes the fear that one day, not too far away, the government wont be able to look after us. We need to start preparing for our old age while we are still young. SUPERANNUATION GUARANTEE The federal government, realising that it would be unable to support financially an ever increasing number of pensioners, introduced legislation to ensure that employers contribute to their employees superannuation. The legislation is known as the Superannuation Guarantee. Basically, it rules that employers must contribute to their employees superannuation. By now, most of you are probably aware that your employer, if you have one, is so obliged. Your boss had until August 14, 1993 to start making contributions. Most employers began payments when the legislation came into effect in July Do you know if contributions have been made on your behalf and, if so, where that money is invested A survey of the general public revealed a very low awareness of the importance of superannuation. We asked people if their boss put super aside for them and whether they knew how much or where the money was deposited. Unfortunately quite a few people were unsure of their entitlements. Rather than just leaving employer superannuation contributions up to your boss andor the government there are a couple of things worth remembering bullet Its your entitlement and therefore your money, not your bosss. bulletIf your boss didnt start contributing on your behalf until August 1993, they should have backdated the payments to July Some awards started paying super before this. bulletIf contributions have been made on your behalf, the super fund which holds your contributions should send you a financial report at least once every twelve months. Most good funds will send reports more often. bulletIf your boss hasnt made any contributions they should be detected by the Tax Office, asked to make your contributions and to pay a fine. bulletThe amount you get depends on the size of the company you work for. Small businesses with a payroll of 1 million or less currently pay 3 of your gross income increasing to 4 per cent in July 1994 and larger companies pay 5, increasing to 9 for all employees by 1 July One of the potential problems with employersponsored super is that every time you change jobs the super fund to which your new boss contributes will probably change too. To avoid having lots of little super accounts and losing track of your money you should rollover your super fund every time you change jobs. The first time it happens, choose a well managed rollover fund with low up front fees and rollover your super into that fund. Every time you change jobs, roll the money over into that same fund. That way you wont lose track of your money. There are some cases where the boss does not have to pay an employee super, such as bulletemployee paid less than 450 gross per month bulletemployee over 65 bulletemployee under 18 who works 30 hours or less per week bulletemployee paid for domesticprivate work for 30 hours or less per week. So where does that leave you Well firstly, if you have never received a statement from your superannuation fund and are concerned that your boss is not paying your superannuation ask your company accountant or payroll officer if and where your money is deposited. You have a right to know where YOUR money is. If you have any queries regarding employersponsored superannuation call the Superannuation Guarantee Hotline on 13 10 If you have any complaints or concerns regarding your superannuation write or call your local Tax Office. WILL YOU BE ABLE TO LIVE OFF YOUR SUPER The boss making contributions for you sounds all right doesnt it But as Paul Clitheroe said, I can tell you that your payout will be enough to live on, but not at the level you live at now. Pauls company, IPAC Securities, did some calculations for us to find out how much youd have when you retire if you only rely on your employers super contributions. Based on the average wage or 40 per week, someone now aged 30, aiming to retire at 55 on their employer super contributions alone, would end up with a retirement income of around 100 per week. Now look, this is a real problem, says Paul. The old age pension now February 1994 is around 158 per week and thats tough enough. Australian Bureau of Statistics, average wage as at November Retirement income based on inflation of 3, salary growth of 5, investment growth of 6 and a life span of a further 20 years. PLANNING FOR RETIREMENT The main reason we have superannuation funds is to pay for our retirement. After all, once we stop working we dont want to live on government support if we can help it. Hopefully, however, the government will continue to provide for those of us that cant provide for ourselves. Lets have a look and see how our ageing population fares at the moment. Fiftyseven per cent of the Australian population aged 60 to 70 years are not receiving an Age Pension and only one third of those aged 70 and over are not on an Age Pension. The simple moral behind these statistics is most us dont save enough during our working lives to allow for a comfortable retirement. Assuming that the government is not going to be able to afford to pay for the entire ageing population to retire in the style to which they have become accustomed, how much do we need to put into super to look after ourselves Once again we stepped out into the streets and Patrick Lindsay asked some passersby if they had ever thought how much they might need to invest in super to be able to retire in comfort. Maybe five per cent, said one woman. Umm, probably about two per cent, said another. I havent the vaguest idea, said one young man. Its not something I have contemplated terribly often. Well, if you were thinking along the same lines as the people we spoke to, you may be unpleasantly surprised. Lets look at three retirement scenarios using the following assumptions bulletinflation 3 bulletsalary growth 5 bulletinvestment growth 6. To obtain a retirement income equivalent to 75 per cent of her final salary, a 30yearold woman planning to retire at 60 will need to invest almost 207 of her gross wage assuming she is only just starting super contributions. So, if she is on an income of 400, she would need to invest, or have invested on her behalf, 75 a week in super for 30 years. Of course, her employer should be making some compulsory contributions, but only 35 per cent, growing to 9 per cent of her wage by But, remember she needs to put away 7 of her wage to meet her retirement needs, which means that she needs to make a self contribution of 77 of her wage 73, 79. A 25yearold man planning to retire on 75 of his income at age 60, will need to invest 12 of his salary, less employer contributions. The later in life you start the more you need to save.A 50 year old man planning to retire on 75 of his income at age 65 would need to invest 5 of his income, less employer super contributions. Source IPAC Securities Limited This may sound alarming but the reality is that most of us have already joined super funds and therefore dont need to join one. We just need to increase our contributions. Many people also have alternative investments such as houses which can bring in rent, or, if necessary, can be sold. Remember to review your superannuation regularly and whatever you do, dont rely on your employers contributions to see you through your retirement. For further information contact your accountant or financial planner. Department of Social Security SUPERANNUATION RIPOFFS We know that superannuation is a little complicated but by now we all know that it is something we should have. Sadly, in the past, many of us have been the victim of dirty tricks when we have taken out superannuation. The federal government has finally taken action following a 1993 report on superannuation fees, charges and commissions by a select committee of the senate. The government now requires superannuation companies to disclose their commissions and their upfront fees. The government will clamp down on any sales people who use questionable selling techniques. Patrick Lindsay, who, as you will see later, had a bone to pick with one of the super companies, interviewed a former superannuation agent, Bernie Johnson. Bernie had been an agent with one of the largest life insurance companies for fifteen years and used to train other agents in the art of selling. He became disillusioned with commissionbased selling tactics and left the industry. Over a couple of years from 1991 to 1993 the senate select committee investigated various allegations made about the insurance industry. The committee reported on bullethidden fees bulletmidstream charges bulletburied clauses bulletthe lack of a dispute resolution procedure. MONEY One of the most common problems hinges on the sometimes huge upfront fees and high agents commissions made in the first two years of contributions. We hunted around and got a hold of a number of policies which appeared to have very high upfront charges and set about finding out whether or not the policy owners knew about these fees. Philip was one of the policy holders who appeared on our programme. He had hoped to rollover all his past super contributions to his new employers fund. We sat with him while he rang his super company to ask how much was in there. Yes, he said, its had two premium put in and its just about to get another one dotted lineIm considering changing dotted line The bottom line was that Philip had paid in 6,000 over two years, but when he placed the call he found he only had 2,050 to roll over. A massive 3,950 of his contributions had disappeared in fees, commissions and early withdrawal charges. So you take out the charges for the entire life of the policy during the first two years exclaimed Philip in surprise. When he got off the phone he said to Patrick, Thats just totally obliterated my faith. I mean, Im supposed to put my financial future in their hands and these are the people Im trusting, who I think are ripping me off. Patrick Lindsay, like Philip and millions of other Australians, has a super policy. I took it out in 1990 with the AMP, explained Patrick, and since then Ive put in more than 13,But when I checked to see if I could roll it over to the Channel 9 super scheme I found out I would only get 3,Almost 10,000 has gone in agents commissions, administration fees and contribution tax Patrick decided to discuss his policy with Guy Amon, principal consultant for AMP Consulting and Superannuation Services. Patrick took the camera crew with him. How much of that policy is going in agents commission asked Patrick. Mr Amon replied, If you give me your policy here, Id like to take it away and look at it. Im happy then to give you an answer in writing, but Im not prepared to do it dotted line But surely, interrupted Patrick, youve got a situation where 13,000 went in and 3,000 is available, 10,000 has gone somewhere. Im entitled to know how much of that went in agents commission. The AMP has a policy of not disclosing commissions on particular sales, replied Mr Amon. But what have you got to hide asked Patrick. Why cant you explain that Ive got nothing to hide because I dont know what the agents costs are. I could, theoretically, tell you if it wasnt for our policy of not disclosing commissions. I could, theoretically, tell you what the commission was, so thats not the issue."

        "text": "5 Feminism and critique from Marx to Habermas Once the site of some of the most vigorous debates in modern feminist theory, the topic of feminisms relations to Marxism could hardly appear more exhausted than it does today. Contemporary feminism is, of course, not alone in its recent loss of faith and interest in the critical potentialities of Marxism. The reasons for this general crisis of confidence cannot be debated here. What can be discussed, however, is the more specific issue of the significance which contemporary feminism has given to its own turn away from Marxism. The following brief reconstruction of some main episodes in the rise and fall of feminisms interest in the capacities of Marxism as a critique of an alienated modernity is guided by a hermeneutical concern. What does the shifting character of feminisms interest in Marxs theory of alienation suggest about changes in feminisms understanding of its own role as cultural critique The early Marxist feminists had not, generally speaking, looked to Marxs theory of alienation to produce new insights into the lived conditions of women in capitalist society. It was, rather, the apparent capacity of this theory to anchor and to provide ultimate justification for the kinds of critical observations elaborated by feminists themselves that seemed the main attraction. Marxs theory of alienation had seemed to offer an account of our species character from the vantage point of which the lived condition of modern women could be shown as a distortion and a travesty. It is not particularly useful at this juncture to again rehearse the motivations for feminisms collapse in confidence in Marxs theory of alienation. To my mind, the remaining relevant question is what is the fate of the task which this kind of theory had once seemed to perform for feminism once the theory itself no longer seems qualified to perform it Does contemporary feminisms turn from Marxs theory of alienation lead on to a search for new, less problematic, ways of justifying and establishing the rationality of feminisms own critical reflections on the lived conditions of modern women Or is a more radical response called for, one which abandons altogether the demand for ultimate criteria capable of rationally justifying feminisms critical reflections This kind of hermeneutical interest is again the point of view which informs the subsequent, rather longer, discussion of contemporary feminisms relations to Habermas radical endeavours to ground the normative commitments of social and cultural criticism. What does feminism reveal about its own sense of its options and future directions by the nature of its interest in, and the kinds of objections it raises about, Habermas model of sociocultural interpretation and criticism Feminism and Marxs humanism The question of Marxs credentials as a humanist has been debated endlessly and I do not propose to buy into a dispute over the existence of a rupture in his thought which drew him away from early humanist commitments. My interest here is confined to a brief exploration of the efforts made by some early Second Wave feminists to appropriate an interpretation of Marxs humanism. I distinguish three main episodes in feminisms changing estimations of the significance of Marxs humanism. In the first we see the efforts of, for example, Sheila Rowbotham and Zillah Eisenstein to appropriate for feminism an anthropological reading of Marxs theory of alienation.1 This first episode is quickly followed by the elaboration of a critical posture in which a socalled dualsystems theory discovered that Marxs anthropology is based on a gender prejudice that attributes significance to a very narrow range of human activities in modern society.2 This second episode, in which feminism broaches a critique of the gender prejudices embedded in Marxs delineation of a presently alienated human essence , meant a major shift in the use feminism could make of Marxs theory of alienation. By endorsing the conception of a denied human essence which underpinned Marxs theory of alienation, the early feminism of Eisenstein and Rowbotham had been able to look to the categories of Marxism to supply a perspective on the emancipatory potentialities dormant in the life conditions of modern women. The critique of the gender prejudices in the Marxist conception of human essence meant that Marxs theory of alienation was ruined for the dualsystems theorists as an instrument of cultural criticism. Henceforth, the Marxist theory of alienation appeared itself as an object of critique, and as a deficient description of the range of human activities in bourgeois society a deficiency which dualsystems theory sought strenuously to redress. It is, however, the third episode in this narrative which occupies the greatest contemporary interest. This last episode in the discussion suggests that feminism has a vital interest in the attempt to historicise the humanist commitments which underpin Marxs culturecritique intentions. It is said that this historicising interest requires a radical departure from fundamental aspects of Marxs own theory of alienation and points to the necessity for an alternative paradigm of social interpretation. To Seyla Benhabib and others, Habermas theory of communicative action seems to offer a way of retaining the critical potential of the ideals of modern humanism without, at the same time, imposing a formulation of those ideals prejudicial to a recognition of the plurality of needs and aspirations of an increasingly pluralistic womens movement within a highly diverse modernity.3 The early efforts of Second Wave feminism to appropriate some main features of Marxs humanism emphasised two dimensions of the conception of labour in Marxs theory of alienation. Marxs theory of alienated labour refers, as both Eisenstein and Rowbotham pointed out, not only to the experience of the wage worker in capitalist society but presupposes also a philosophical concept of labour as objectification.4 It is specifically the critical potentials of this philosophical concept of labour as objectification which early Marxist feminism sought to appropriate. Marxs concept of labour as objectification refers to the historical creativity of individuals who, through their labour, not only reproduce and enrich the conditions of life but also augment human subjectivity with a wealth of new capacities, needs and potentialities. On this view, the dynamic of social reproduction meant the incessant expansion of human needs and abilities as producers constantly transformed their inherited world and, in so doing, enhanced their own capacities and aspirations. Marxs theory of alienation discovers an antagonism between these historically generated human possibilities both inscribed in the world of material objectifications and subjective needs and the reductionist logic of capitalism which views the individual who labours as a working animal, a mere instrument of production and creator of surplus value. This configuration of realised societal wealth and individual deprivation constitutes, for Marx, the fundamental contradiction of bourgeois society. To Eisenstein, Marxs account of the antagonism between realised societal wealth and individual deprivation provides the basis for a critique of the full range of social relations entrenched in modern capitalist societies. There is, as she sees it, nothing about the theory of alienation which limits it to an understanding of class relations5 From the point of view of this dynamic, creative concept of labourasobjectification which upholds the idea of the species capacity for producing a supposed wealth of abilities and needs through the productive activity of humans, all merely instrumentalising forms of labour stand condemned. On this reading, an imposed gender division of labour means that the lives of modern women, and not just the proletariat, are characterised by an antagonism between their species potential and the impoverished, onesidedness of their existence in bourgeois society. Eisenstein gives a sharply anthropologised reading of Marxs theory of alienation the social and critical potentials of this theory are seen to rest on a bifurcation between human existence and its distortion in a capitalistpatriarchal social system. Marxs revolutionary ontology of social and human existence posits dotted linewithin each individual a dialectic between essence and existence which is manifested as revolutionary consciousness in society. Both the criticism of class existence as alienating and exploitative and the revolutionary ontology of the theory make Marxist analysis critical to developing a feminist theory which incorporates but moves beyond a theory of class consciousness.6 The feminist critics of the type of humanist Marxist feminism which Rowbotham and Eisenstein had been developing throughout the latter part of the 1970s did not typically set their sights on the question of the adequacy of the Marx interpretation being offered. It should be said, however, that, to the extent that Rowbotham and Eisensteins reading of the theory of alienation evokes an ahistorical construction of a thwarted species potential for creative labour, this interpretation suggests a highly selective reading of Marxs own views.7 As we have seen, Eisensteins reading discovers in Marxs theory of alienation a revolutionary ontology of social and human existence which is manifested as revolutionary consciousness in society. 8 When extended to women, this revolutionary ontology suggests that the possibility of freedom exists alongside exploitation and oppression since woman is potentially more than she is9 Eisensteins anthropologised reading of Marxs theory of alienation, understood as the antagonism between human essence and social existence, evokes a clearly essentialising construction of human subjectivity. On this interpretation, autonomy and creativity appear as the presently distorted constituents of the subject rather than as historically developed human possibilities. They appear, that is, in the light of anthropological potentials rather than as a unique and contingent historical development. Thus interpreted, Marxs humanism appeared a rather easy target for the antiessentialising consciousness which increasingly emerged with the development of Second Wave feminism. The philosophical anthropology discovered by Eisenstein and Rowbotham in the theory of alienation was found by its later feminist critics to rest on a repressive universalisation of a gendered social experience. This metaphysics of the subject was shown to necessarily involve the ascription of a normativity to selected aspects of a modern masculine subjectivity. The critique of the feminist implications of an anthropologised interpretation of Marxs theory of alienation was spearheaded by the dualsystems literature which appeared in the early 1980s. On this view, Marxs theory offers an interpretation of social life based on an imposed, unitary model of human activity. The dualsystems model advocated by Mary OBrien and others was, unlike the feminisms of Eisenstein and Rowbotham, not particularly concerned with the task of appropriating for feminism the critical potentials of Marxs account of the antagonism between human essence and social existence. The conception of labour as objectification which is so central to Marxs theory of alienation is almost entirely absent in the Marx interpretation offered by dualsystems theory. Marx had insisted on the antagonism between human essence that species potential for creative labour, in which humans are seen to accumulate through their own historical activity a wealth of manysided abilities and capacities and the distortion of this human essence in the merely instrumentalising forms of labour which characterise contemporary social existence. OBrien and the dualsystems theorists can, however, see no evidence for a contract between two antagonistic constructions of human labour. In the centrality of productive labour to Marxs theory of human essence. OBrien, Hartmann et al. discover only a repressive attempt to universalise a gender specific mode of social existence. Mary OBriens The Politics of Reproduction attempted to overcome the supposed inability of Marxs category of production to take account of many traditional female activities by introducing the complementary category of reproduction. At this time also, Heidi Hartmanns provocative essay on The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism targeted the gender blindness of Marxs category of production. Hartmann attempted to supplement Marxs category of production, seen as the basis for an interpretation of specifically capitalist relations of production, with an interpretation of patriarchy, understood as a relatively independent set of social practices of domination and coercion. Marxs analysis of capitalist relations of production appeared inadequate to an investigation of patriarchy understood as a set of social relations between men, which have a material base, and which, though hierarchical, establish or create interdependence and solidarity among men that enable them to dominate women.10 The humanist Marxist feminism of, for example, Rowbotham and Einstein, had attempted to appropriate Marxs account of labour as objectification as the basis from which to ground a critical perspective on the onesided, merely instrumentalising character of those social relations, forms of conduct and modes of activity in modern society which, they insisted, dominated not only the lives of the proletariat but women as well."

        "text": "X1st The Equalizer From the juvenescent, to the pubescent, to the senescent humans are obsessed with the differences between the sexes. Freud hypothesised that a males appendage is envied by females. Perhaps the siblings cry of shes got more than me is more appropriate when referring to X chromosomes. It seems there is a just evolutionary path which ensures equality between the sexes at least at the level of gene products from the X chromosome. This equalizing effect is known as dosage compensation. In mammals, having dissimilar heteromorphic sex chromosomes, it is achieved by X chromosome inactivation. Xist Xinactive specific transcripts, XIST in humans has recently been discovered. It has unique expression solely from the inactive X chromosome. Complete characterisation of this gene should reveal its role in the still mysterious mechanism of Xinactivation. How to be active or inactive This is the question that has teased the minds of scientists since Mary Lyon proposed her hypothesis to explain the phenomenon in 1961 Lyon, 1992. This essay will review the main features of Xinactivation which have set the stage for the arrival of a new prospective star XIST. This gene has caused a flurry of activity in the study of inactivity. The attached paper by Kay and others 1993 will be assessed for its contribution towards determining the role of Xist in the Xinactivation mechanism. Emphasis is placed on discussion of their predictions and conclusions. Most of the papers published on XIST since its premiere in 1991 are summarised in Appendix one due to the length of this table, including the paper by Kay and others 1993. The main technique they employed is also summarized within Appendix one. First things first what is Xinactivation Males, having only one X chromosome, develop and live with only one dose of X chromosome gene products. Thus females, being endowed with two X chromosomes, have developed a means of preventing an overdose of X linked gene products. In mammals this has been achieved by switching off one X chromosome. To achieve this dosage compensation a decision must be made about which X chromosome to inactivate. Usually this depends on tissue type andor whether the X belongs to a marsupial or a eutherian mammal. In the case of marsupials, the paternal X is always inactivated Johnston and Robinson, 1987. In the extraembryonic membranes of rodents it is also the paternal X Wake et al., 1976, Takagi and Sasaki, 1975. From embryonic tissue to the adult eutherian mammal inactivation is a random choice. Random inactivation is detectable around the time of primitive streak formation, about 55 post insemination in the mouse Kay et al., 1993 see Fig 1B. The degree to which an X is inactivated also varies. Some genes, for example Glucose6phosphate dehydrogenase G6PD in marsupials Cooper et al., 1993 and steroid sulfatase STS in humans Thompson et al., 1991, escape inactivation fig.3. These genes do not necessarily escape inactivation in all tissues or in all species and some have reduced expression from the inactive X Cooper et al., 1993. In mice Xinactivation is complete Hendrich et al., 1993. Mendels laws assume that parental sex has no influence on the behaviour of a gene. Imprinted genes contravene this law. These are genes which have been labelled in some way with the address of the sender. Being labelled maternally or paternally derived can affect the degree to which a gene is expressed. Imprinting is involved in Xinactivation Cattanach and Beechey, 1990. This can be seen by nonrandom patterns of Xinactivation in the case of paternal Xinactivation, mentioned previously, and controlling elements in Inserts REFERENCES for Figure 1 FIGURE ONE A FIGURE 1B FIGURE 1C FIGURE 1C FIGURE TWO FIGURE THREE mice evident from coat colour patterns due to an Xlinked coat colour gene tabby, Ta in mice Johnston and Cattanach, 1981. The most likely genes to bear the parental postmark is the Xinactivation centre XIC region Rastan and Cattanach 1983 cited in Kay et al., 1993. The imprinting and timing of Xinactivation in the mouse is illustrated in Fig. 1B. The nonrandom Xinactivation found in mice is due to an X chromosome controlling element Xce locus. Its alleles, and their effect, are outlined in Fig The alleles at this locus affect the probability that a particular X chromosome will be inactivated Rastan, 1982. The Xce locus has been proposed as the mouse equivalent of the Xinactivation centre XIC in humans Keer et al., 1990. The XIC region is coincident with Xinactivation Leppig et al., 1993. XistXIST maps to this region. A map several X chromosomes is given in Fig. Kay and others 1993 demonstrated the effect of these alleles in interspecific crosses. They found these alleles could modify or reverse the paternally imprinted Xist expression in mouse extraembryonic membranes. Kays team propose that limited production of a putative blocking factor p. 179 binds with differing affinities to the promoters of different XceXist alleles resulting in the chromosome with the blocked Xist promoter remaining active. In mice this can result in stripes in tabby mice suggesting a morphogen, pulsatile, type of blocking action 338 lectures, Pool, 1991. An imprinting effect may result in differences in the size of an embryo. Haig and Westoby cited in Haig and Graham 1991 proposed that expression of paternal genes during development favours increased size of offspring. They propose that imprinting arose as a means of increasing survival chances of a fathers offspring by increasing its share of the mothers resouces. This is based on the assumption that mammalian littermates often have different fathers Haig and Graham, 1991. Figure 4A illustrates nuclear transplantation experiments Surani et al., 1986 which support the Haig and Westoby theory. Figure 4B show the results of Thornhill and Burgoyne 1993 due to X chromosome imprinting. These results reveal that paternal X expression results in the smallest embryos whereas maternal X expression results in the largest embryos. This seems to indicate that X chromosome imprinting may be the inverse of autosomal imprinting andor has evolved separately and operates by a different mechanism. It would be interesting to know the weights of the extraembryonic membranes of these mice, the sex of the control embryo in fig. 4A as well as the Xce alleles of the mice in Fig. 4A. The small size of the XPO is probably due to reduced size of extraembryonic membranes where XP is usually inactive. Borsani and others 1991 detected Xist expression above basal XY level in XPO mouse liver. It would be interesting to look at the Xist levels in XMO mice, if the parental imprint is erased before random X inactivation occurs there should be no difference between Xist expression in XPO and XMO mice. What do we know about XistXIST Much of the work so far, summarized in Appendix one, has been concerned with characterising the gene. It has been sequenced, completely in mice in humans and partially in a handful of other eutherians. The compared sequences reveal a region containing repeats at the 5 end of the gene, along with another region at the 3 end, appear to share the most homology Hendrich et al., 1993. Its expression has been demonstrated in female somatic tissues and at a reduced level in male testis. There is a basal level of expression detected in some male somatic tissues refer to papers in Appendix one. Kay and his colleagues paper, along with Richler and others 1992, Salido and coworkersFigure FourFigure Five intervene here1992 and McCarrey and Dilworths 1992 work has been important in determining the time of onset of Xist expression in the mouse. Their findings have been summarized in Appendix one and are shown in Fig. 1C. The basic structure of the gene is shown in Fig. Although much of the sequence is not highly conserved the basic structure, with two long exons flanking a series of smaller exons, is conserved. No significant open reading frame ORF is conserved and transcripts are confined to the nucleus thus XistXIST is unlikely to encode a protein Brockdorff et al., 1992. Kay and his coworkers make a series of predictions which are listed in Table one. The filfulment of these predictions, they suggest, will implicate Xist transcripts causally in initiation of Xinactivation. Table One intervenes here. Kays team predict Xist should be expressed before X inactivation occurs. Figure 1B illustrates the timing of X inactivation, developmental stages are detailed in Figure 1A. This figure shows that the maternal X is active from fertilization until random Xinactivation takes place in the epiblast. However the status of the paternal X, up until it is found to be inactive in extraembryonic tissues, is not yet clearly established. Studies which measured enzyme activity in 8 cell embryos, morulae and blastocysts found both X chromosomes to be active Adler et al., 1977, Epstein et al., 1978, Monk and Harper, 1979. However these assays cannot determine whether both Xs are active in all cells and are difficult to perform in earlier embryos. Some visible differences between the cells may be apparent even at the 8 cell, totipotent, stage personal communication P.G.Johnston. If, as Monk suggests, Xinactivation and cellular differentiation are linked Monk and Grant, 1990 the paternal X would be inactivated during differentiation. The overt differentiation of trophectoderm, marked as trophoblast in Fig. 1B, Kays team claim, occurs one day after the 8 cell stage. Gossler 1992 Lecture 2 BIOL 338 estimates that compaction is complete after 12 hours and that during compaction changes gradually become apparent Fig. 1A. It may be technically difficult to distinguish 8 cell precompaction embryos from cells undergoing compaction. Perhaps addition of antiuvomorulin antibodies, which prevent compaction Gossler, 1992, to 8 cell embryos would reduce the chances that samples used for RTPCR are not contaminated with cells undergoing compaction and differentiation. If possible in situ hybridisation in 8 cell embryos may confirm their findings. Kay and his colleagues demonstrated Xist expression in one precompaction 8 cell embryo pool p. 173, however expression appears to be less than half the level in the morulae pool, which contain double the number of cells. The only evidence that the paternal X is active after fertilization to the 8 cell stage is the failure to detect a late replicating X chromosome cytogenetically Grant and Chapman,1988. If Xist is involved in maintenance of the inactive state its presence could be anticipated immediately after initiation of inactivation. Its expression would then be expected to increase as inactivation proceeded to spread along the whole chromosome. Xist expression is coincident with Xinactivation in somatic tissues after initiation has occurred Brown et al., 1991, Borsani et al., 1991 which suggests a maintenance role for Xist. Kay and others paper cannot distinguish between initiation and early post initiation maintenance roles for Xist in mouse embryos. The fulfilment of their first prediction can only show an association between expression and initiation. However Xists presence well in advance of inactivation in testes was demonstrated by Kay and his team 1993. Their prediction is well supported by other studies McCarrey and Dilworth, 1992, Richler et al., 1992, Salido et al., 1992 Fig. 1C. If the mechanism of Xinactivation during spermatogenesis and embryogenesis is the same, or at least Xists role in it, the evidence mentioned previously Fig. 1C substantiates Kay and others claim that Xist is involved in initiation of Xinactivation. To utilise the same Xinactivation mechanism in sperm and female somatic cells would seem the soft evolutionary option for simultaneously preventing damage to X and Y chromosomes during meiosis, protecting the male sex determining genes Marshall Graves and Schmidt, 1992 and achieving dosage compensation. Perhaps X chromosome imprinting evolved through the same process, and as previously mentioned, differs from autosomal imprinting. This may explain why the paternal X is inactivated in marsupials. Cooper 1971 cited in Kay et al., 1993 propose that imprinting occurs during male meiosis. Kay and others 1993 model, illustrated on page 179 of their paper, confines the imprinting process to the maternal germ line. They feel that the paternal X is inactivated by default p. 179 and not imprinted as Cooper 1971 cited in Kay et al., 1993 and other researchers believe."

        "text": "In Australia, since the beginning of the 1980s, there has been a general economic swing towards the weakening of the market power of larger monopolies. This has been due to the theoretical belief that monopolies and regulation create inefficiencies and that by increasing competition in the market place the result will be a more efficient situation to benefit the consumer. The weakened monopoly will often take the form of monopolistic competition, that is, many firms each with some degree of monopoly power, or of an oligopoly where there are a few firms with impeded entry. The finance sector was the first major area of deregulation followed by the airlines and more recently our communications network. Due to differing levels of deregulation and economic climate the outcome of the weakening of these monopoly powers has both benefited and deprived the consumer and the efficiency of production to varying degrees. To grasp the theory of the monopoly and the benefits and costs it provides the consumer, a basic model must be discussed. However, the existence of a true monopoly is rare. Often there is a group of firms with differing levels of monopoly power who all face a downward sloping demand curve and therefore can choose output levels and prices to maximise profits. A monopolist has complete control over the level of output as they are the market. As a result, the monopolists Average Revenue AR is the market demand. From Fig it is shown that the monopolist will produce at a level where Marginal Revenue MR equals Marginal Cost MC. In a competitive market ,AR, which represents price, would equal MC. Therefore, in a monopoly, costs are higher and consumers buy less. Lost consumer surplus area AB arises along with deadweight loss area BC. This deadweight loss represents the social cost and the inefficiency of resource allocation of a monopoly. A deadweight loss will always exist unless the firm can perfectly price discriminate. So, by raising prices above equilibrium consumer welfare is reduced. Other inefficiencies that may arise from the existence of a monopoly are the toleration of inefficient work practices due to the weakness of competitive pressure, also the possible excessive expenditure to defend a monopolistic position. Questionable inefficiency that may arise from the sheltering from competition is lack of research and development into more productive or quality producing processes. However, the conflicting arguement is that because the firm is protected it is willing to bear the risks and costs of invention and innovation. So that the consumer does not suffer from excessive charges for goods or services provided by monopolies, price regulation may be introduced, often in the form of government regulation. The intervention of the government is both on a social and economic ground. Price fixing, in the case of utilities such as water and electricity means that access is not limited to those that can afford possible excessive prices. However, this may encourage overconsumption and under investment if the price is set too low or over production and inefficiency when it is set too high. The cost is borne by the general public in the form of higher prices or taxes. Monopolies can take the form naturally or be created. The natural monopoly arises when the market is only large enough for one producer. This form of monopoly cannot have its market power reduced in static conditions. However, a monopoly that has been created and protected due to government or other large bodied regulation can have its market dominance reduced by lifting the regulation practices. Often, the result is monopolistic competition or an oligopoly. Monopolistic competition is the closest real world example of perfect competition. The products produced by each firm are not perfect substitutes but are highly substitutable and there is free entry to the market. As there is free entry, the potential to earn profits will attract many firms to the market. The result is the level of profits will be reduced to zero profit as price will become equal to Average Cost AC. Each firm will still have a downward sloping demand curve as its product is unique. Although monopolistic competition is similar to perfect competition the differences result in a failure to produce a perfectly efficient market where both producer and consumer surplus is as large as possible. Price still exceeds MC so there still exists a deadweight loss. However, depending on the level of competition between the companies, the set price may tend closer to the MC. Under monopolistic competition there exists excess capacity as the output level is less than that which minimises average cost. As the demand curve is downward sloping, zero profits occur to the left of the minimum average cost. However, demand becomes more elastic as competition increases and this excess capacity will be reduced. So, these losses to the consumer will be offset by the existence of a large range of similar products to choose from so that their satisfaction may be maximised. The other form of market that may result from the weakening of the market power of a monopoly is the oligopoly. This exists when there are a few firms due to the existence of barriers to entry. Even after government deregulation there may exist some natural barriers to entry such as the market dominance of a few firms which makes entry to the market highly uneconomic. These can occur in the form of consumer loyalty, predatory pricing by existing members on competitors and the saturation of the market by present members. Collusion may exist between members to set a price and price wars can erupt if a firm dramatically alters its price or level of advertising. The consumer under the oligopoly will benefit in the event of a price war as they will receive the lowest price possible for the good . However, as to be expected if the price falls below average cost in the long run the firms will go out of business. So, the theoretical conclusion from weakening the market power of a monopoly is, that dead weight loss is reduced therefore there is a more efficient allocation of resources. The market is opened to competition therefore the price of the good is reduced and yet again the consumer benefits. To remain in the market the firm must have efficient methods of production and to keep consumer loyalty the quality of the product or service must be maintained. However, by studying the results of recent deregulation in Australia and the United States rarely do all consumers benefit to the same degree, if at all from the weakening of the monopoly power. After the Martin and Campbell Reports of the early 1980s which came to a conclusion in favour of deregulating the Australian financial system, Australia proceeded to transform its banking system from the most controlled to the least controlled banking system in the world. The main arguement for the deregulation was that removal of bank controls would lead to more efficient financial markets, with leaner interest rate margins. The resulting competition would eliminate the possibility of monopolistic superprofitsAnderson 1993 pp57,62.The costs of current regulation of interest rate and lending controls were believed to be the diversion of funds to possibly less efficient intermediaries and the blunting of the competitive and innovative drive of the banks Campbell 1981 p761. All interested parties, that is, the banks, could see only benefits to the deregulation. So from 1980, interest rate ceilings were removed on bank deposits, some term deposit restrictions were removed, quantitative bank lending guidance ceased, the Australian dollar was floated and exchange controls removed, controls on bank deposits withdrawn, invitation to overseas banks to establish in Australia issued and ceilings were removed on home loan interest rates. The result of this dramatic change has been almost the opposite to the idealised predictions. Domestic banks asserted their dominance by mergers and superior infrastructure causing foreign banks to suffer losses and failure. It has been clear that deregulation increased the availability of the range services and products available to the consumer. However, often this has been only available at high interest rates and used for portfolio rather than more direct investment Abbott 1990 p93. The failure of some state banks and Tricontinental was due to the financial institutions choosing more speculative, high risk securities thus putting the deposits of the community at risk and causing a greater cost to the taxpayer in the end. Therefore, the Australian financial sector did not follow the textbook example of increased competition resulting in a more efficient and allocative market but rather resulted in greater inefficiencies and the assertion of dominance of existing oligopolists. Like the financial system in Australia, the United States U.S. airline industry was deregulated in the hope of increased competition leading to a more efficient and innovative system. However all routes have not been exposed to the same level of competition. As a result fares have fallen in the long haul market but their has been little benefit in the short to medium haul market. Similarly, fares are lower in the high density than those in the lower density markets. However, in general the airlines have become more efficient by using the hubandspoke system and more innovative. The real benefit to the consumer has been the increased availability and use of discount fares. This has not been without cost. Some smaller, less profitable services, to smaller communities that were subsidised by the more profitable routes have suffered. Also the increased congestion at main airports and deterioration of cabin service quality has occurred. However, there is no evidence that cost cutting has reduced the safety of flying. The Australian deregulation of the two airline policy has not been as successful as the U.S. example. Deregulation occurred November 1990 and twelve months later, Compass Airlines was in provisional liquidation. Compass Airlines tried to compete in a market that, though officially deregulated held barriers to entry that it could not overcome. The deregulation consisted of the removal of, controls over the importation of aircraft, determination of passenger capacity on trunk routes, setting of airfares for passenger services and constraint on entry of new domestic operators on trunk routes. As a result of Compass entry fares fell on an average by 12 in real terms and service and quality improved. The entry of Compass also provided a stimulus to domestic tourism Trade Practices Commission 1992. Compass failed to estimate the competitive responses of its competitors and even though it matched discount fares it was forced to maintain load factors and cash flows. The profitability of airlines has fallen over the period since deregulation but it is not obvious how much is due to the recession, increases in capacity or fare discounting. The consumer in the end has been the winner with more discount fares being offered and cheaper airfares on capital city routes. However, there still remains two airlines with the possibility of a competitor unlikely due to the oligopoly that exists. In both the banking and airline industries, levels of collusion and merging have resulted in the strength of the oligopolies. This may be due to failure to enforce antitrust laws in Australia unlike the U.S. The success of airline deregulation in the U.S. and of other communication and banking areas is the existence of antitrust laws which prevent the actions that restrain, or are likely to restrain, competition, and by restricting the forms of market structures availablePindyke,Rubenfeld 1992 p363. So as result a fairer and more competitive market exists. Other area that must be mentioned are the communication and media industries. With the introduction of Optus to compete with the former monopoly, Telecom, there has been an improvement in quality of service to the customer but only a very small saving in the cost of telephone calls which could be attributable to competition. Telecom still provides the less profitable remote and emergency services at a cheap rate whilst competing in the mobile and major city communication networks. Also with the relaxation a media ownership laws the result, due to a large number of mergers, is tending towards a larger monopoly than before. In theory, regulation is needed to correct market failure and is intended to serve the public interest. This may be needed so monopolies do not exploit the consumer. However, often deregulation masks inefficiencies, which by promoting competition, can be reduced. Only when true monopolistic competition exists can the theory become practice. The reality is, that in deregulating an existing monopoly that has oligopolistic tendencies the result does not follow a set pattern. Due to economic climate, market dominance of existing monopolies and consumer loyalties the benefit to the consumer and the quality of the service produced will be different each time."

        "text": "AUSTRALIAN CRITICISM IN TRANSITION About a decade ago, Howard Felperin and a few others were pointing out quite correctly that Australian literary scholars had generally ignored modern critical theory. Recently in the Weekend Australian 910 January 1993 Review 7 Imre Salusinszky announced, with breathtaking inaccuracy, that literary studies in this country are dominated by a coterie of the Association for the Study of Australian Literature ASAL which has struggled to keep Australian literary scholarship free and pure of the influence of foreign ideas . In the eight books under discussion there are about 130 essays which were nurtured in the climate of controversy of the 1980s, and which reflect and document the disruptions and reorientations of a decade of critical transition. Already some, even among the best, have a slight smell of last weeks bananas in the school cloakroom rather familiar, a little old, but inescapably present. These essays rehearse and reflect, implicitly or explicitly, again and again, the Great Debate between traditional criticism and modern theory. Many were originally published, or presented as conference papers, between 1978 and The exceptions, in UnCommon Ground, Aspects of Australian Fiction, Reconnoitres and a few in Security of Allusion, are original essays, but are conditioned by the critical climate of the 1980s, and reflect and illustrate the environment of particular literature departments. By far the most outspoken of the traditionalist essayists represented is Dorothy Green, who is often thought of, by writers as well as academics, as a less conservative critic than she really was. This is partly because she was candidly independent, partly because she often chose to put a scythe through tall and Professorial poppies such as Wilkes, Kramer, Hope, Clark. Probably, too, the reverence she showed for Adorno and Althusser has been wrongly translated by some into a respect for modern critical theory. In fact she loathed social semiotics, deconstruction, and linguistic psychoanalysis. Writer Reader Critic, a collection of seven emphatically humanist and ethically committed essays, is her scornful manifesto, a defence of the social and personal responsibilities of the creative reader as self rather than subject, and an attack on modern culture and criticism. Matthew Arnold wert thou living at this hour, she almost seems to say, or even Dr Leavis who, despite an authoritarian narrowness, gains her respect for his attempt to rescue literary criticism from the charge of frivolity . Greens strength is her rhetorical lucidity, her precise yet complex vocabulary, and occasionally, at the best of times her passion. In The Meaning of Love 1984 her insights were often more specific, her attacks more contextually definite, and related to actual works being discussed. In Writer Reader Critic her vague and furious antimodernist and sometimes antifeminist, neoArnoldian perorations lack any relative context, or adequate sense of ordinary practicability. Too often she makes the literary world, or the entire globe, seem like a classroom populated by children who are indolent, naughty, careless or exasperating. There are a few smart cookies, but just one teacher dotted lineNo one so far as I know has thought of the tremendous potential for drama in a character like Sir Matthew Davies, though Micael Cannons The Land Boomers has been out since How careless can you writers get More serious still is Greens refusal to contemplate the legitimacy of any scientific approach to literary study. Making an outofdate equation between objectivism and science, she rejects the deployment of linguistics, and the paraphernalia of computers, since that would give a falsely objective justification to a subjective opinion. This is the kind of jibe she likes to make the computer tells us that Shaw Neilson referred most often to the colour green, a fact which must be obvious to anyone who reads his verse , forgetting here that someone or something has to do the counting, and whether its a machine is immaterial except for the extra accuracy and shorter time it permits. She forgets as well that the computer not only confirms the obvious but also, as J.F.Burrows and Alex Jones show in their studies in Reconnoitres, provides data that a common sense reading might falsely suggest are incredible. Green seems to fear any practical change. The business of literary theory itself, she contends, was appropriated by philosophers and semioticians in the 1970s. She is here merely juggling with chickens and eggs, as it might equally be argued that literary studies appropriated semiotics and philosophy and even that Yale professors of literature appropriated the philosopher Derrida, bodily at least temporarily as well as scripturally. Regrettably Green fails to explore, for the humanist and traditionalist case, the implications of the inescapable conclusion that, like it or not, semiology and semiotics since Saussure have provided unavoidable tools and insights into criticism and into the phenomena of reading and writing. Ironically, by seeking to exclude the scientific from the critical, Green plays into the hands of opponents who want to exclude all subjectivism. The political effect of the conflict of these two powerful, gladiatorially deckedout sides is to preserve and extend what is politically a pretty unruly and destructive schism in literary studies, in Australia and elsewhere, between the traditional and the modern. It is true that both sides hold fundamentally different and sometimes incompatible assumptions but that seems to me a normal and inevitable condition of enquiry itself, and is not a reason for internationalising and politicising the conflict, or rather the construction of the conflict, into the current academic World War. The effect is to obscure affinities between the sides, and to underplay diversity and contrariety within each side. There is, for example, as much that is metaphysical in the Derridaen sense in the unverifiable components of Freudian and Lacanian theory as in liberal humanism, or for that matter in a nonliberal, ethically based criticism. A plea for political pluralism in literary studies for the acceptance, that is, of the practical permissibility of more than one theory or methodology lacks the glamour of a plea for total commitment and a single strong line but pluralism does not entail that anything goes. It is lastly a political arrangement amongst diverse critics to facilitate their coexistence. The emotions, as Lenin didnt say, are not skilled workers , except perhaps in the case of the extraordinarily industrious G.A. Wilkes. Reconnoitres is a collection of essays written by colleagues and former colleagues, to honour one of the most productive and pervasively important of Australian critics, scholars and lexicographers. Whether every single piece literally honours Wilkes is open to question, as several offer almost lunar alternatives to his familiar terrains. But perhaps their implicit tribute is to his kind of pluralism, both within the Department at Sydney University where before becoming Challis Professor he held, in the early 1960s, the first chair in Australian literature, and as editor of Southerly for twentyfour years until The healthy critical pluralism of the book itself might do something to bridge the unnecessarily immense chasm between traditional and modern criticism but no essay addresses this chasm. The editors claim that these essays reflect Wilkes own publications, by falling into one of three categories reassessment of major writers, reappraisal of nineteenthcentury texts, or study of the language of Australian literature. There isnt a vast amount of other ground on which they could fall, though some do. They also reflect Wilkes traditionalism, but there are exceptions, of kind and degree. Stephen Knights commentary on ideology and form in the variant versions of four famous and widely consumed literary representations of crimes, and David Lawtons Naming the Interior Major Mitchells Fight for Place, are in varying ways products of modern semiotic theory while Don Andersons jazz waltz with Baudrillard, in which he looks at Australian samples of mental simulacra of America, and Rosemary Huismans examination of social conventions of genre in recent poetry, also challenge older approaches. Several good chapters are too short for their purposes, perhaps victims of the tyranny of the short essay form. Michael Wildings engaging but peremptory nibble on the modern short story, Webbys important chapter on G.A.Wilkes himself, and the otherwise excellent chapters of Knight, Kiernan, and Vivian Smith the latter on Slessor, symbolisme and modernism are examples. Since this collection will eventually be perceived as a profile or handprint of Australian literary studies at Sydney, two absences should be noted feminist criticism and psychoanalysis. A common prejudice and fallacy in Australian literary studies runs like this 1 there are two kinds of research, one empirical and one theoretically based 2 empiricism mistakes text for fact and is therefore unacceptable 3 theoretically based criticism, and theory, should not and need not concern themselves with documentation, manuscripts, evidence and so forth, as that would be an empiricist undertaking. This strange kind of thinking has led recently to some neglect of documentary research in Australia, where it is especially needed and it also thanklessly stereotypes traditional researchers as unenlightened, plodding pariahs. Instead of recategorising fact as text, some modern opponents of traditional investigation jettison the investigation altogether. They would do well to read Knights essay on His Natural Life, The Chosen Vessel and Waltzing Matilda as a possible brief paradigm. Moreover, the selfreflexive signalling of procedures that are really a traditional feature of many biographies are rarely recognised as, simply, that. Who ever concedes that footnotes and bibliographies are really postmodern apart from, ironically, postmodern novelists like Julian Barnes Instead, many traditional biographers are often falsely stereotyped as purveyors of aesthetic fictional illusions. Kiernans commentary on Australian literary biography deals with some related issues concerning narratology. Aspects of Australian Fiction, edited by Alan Brissenden, is a collection of essays written by former students and colleagues as a tribute to John Colmer, Professor of English at the University of Adelaide from 1964 to Unlike the contributions to Reconnoitres, the essays cannot be said to represent a department today, as only one of twelve is written by a current teacher. Although it is diverse in method and matter, the book is less of a magpies nest than Reconnoitres, and is also more overtly aware now and then of feminism, psychoanalysis, and especially postcolonial theory. The contents fall almost into sections historicist and interpretive critical approaches to older fiction including Furphy and the 1890s, and modern discussion of recent texts most notably Andrew Taylor on Helen Garner, Ken Gelder on David Foster, and Russell McDougall on Stow. Bruce Clunies Ross manages to introduce a discussion of the potential and viability of certain poetic forms by offering a careful reading of Les Murrays verse novel The Boys Who Stole the Funeral. Postcolonial perspectives are well represented in the Webby and Harris collection by Don Andersons discussion of Australian simulacra of America, and Robert Dixonss cogent examination of British and Australian literary othering of Pacific cultures in the Edwardian period. The latter strongly contrasts with Adrian Mitchells rhetorically imperial idealisation of extended Edwardianism in Brissendens book but in essays by Diana Brydon, Russell McDougall and others in the same volume postcolonialism complements feminist or psychoanalythical approaches. The value of postcolonial criticism is that it removes an imposed discourse, and establishes awareness of the needs and of various means to transcend local and national orientations, and avoid cultural marginalisation. Some American, British and European opponents argue that it is redundant, but its explicitness and political viability obviously help to explain its attractiveness within former colonies, an appeal that has been extended and encouraged in Australia by two recent books, The Empire Writes Back and the Dark Side of the Dream. Potentially and methodoligically almost as important is the little known collection UnCommon Ground, twelve essays reflecting the University of Adelaides adoption of a predominantly postcolonial and raceand genderoriented approach to firstyear literature teaching. An unusual and worthwhile feature of this book is that it includes discussion of English and American texts. Although these essays are challenging and useful for teaching purposes, the value of postcolonial theory, of course, is simultaneously its limitation in practice it politically privileges and advertises the interest of former colonies draws attention to geographical, political and national boundaries and institutionalises its own literary empire. Too often it becomes merely a grand opportunity for diverse cricketers to beat the Poms and celebrate the victory. By design, it disadvantages a more catholic enquiry I would argue that especially in a firstyear course, postcolonial studies should supplement rather than replace other approaches in order to demonstrate the diversity of theory and methodology."

        "text": "Australian English as an example of a world phenomenon pluricentric languages Michael Clyne This paper deals with the notion of pluricentric languages and the degree of domination of the less powerful national varietyies by the more powerfuloOnes. A theoretical framework will be presented and some common features of the relationship between varieties will be described. I will draw some parallels between Australian English and Austrian German in relation to policies, attitudes, and export potential. Some attention will be given to the future of pluricentric languages in the changing worldpolitical situation. The term pluricentric languages was first employed by Heinz Kloss in 1978 6667 to describe languages with several interacting centres, each providing a national variety with at least some of its own codified norms. A recent collection of papers Clyne 1992 featured contributions on 17 pluricentric languages, but there are many more. Many such languages form a contiguous or nearly contiguous region. This is the case with German, Korean and Swedish, for example. But others, such as Chinese, English and Portuguese, are dispersed due to imperialism andor emigration, and still others, such as French, Spanish and Tamil, are used over both contiguous and dispersed areas. Some languages developed separate national varieties as a result of the division between the socialist and capitalist blocs e.g. Armenian, Chinese, Korean and, to some extent, German and Spanish. Some of these varieties are already converging. We can differentiate between traditional national varieties with a substratum of another language e.g. Welsh or Scots English, immigrant ones e.g. Australian, American English and nativized colonial and neocolonial ones e.g. Australian, American English and nativized colonial and neocolonial ones e.g. Indian or Singaporean English. Some national varieties of pluricentric languages e.g. Indian or Singaporean English. Some national varieties of pluricentric languages e.g. MalayIndonesianMalaysian, HindiUrdu, to a large extent CroatianSerbian have declared themselves separate languages, developing their own systems of norms. In some of these cases, script is a vital distinguishing feature. Some languages, e.g. Tok Pisin in Papua New Guinea, Solomons Pijin, and Vanuatu Pidgin have the potential to be formed into a pluricentric language. In some cases, there is more than one level of pluricentricity the classic case is Chinese, which has a number of mutually unintelligible spoken fangyan with an almost common written language, and then national varieties of one fangyan, MandarinPutonghua. In all pluricentric languages, there is a tension between a centrifugal and a centripetal effect, because the speaker has a dual identity reflected partly through membership of the wider speech community e.g. English and partly through the national variety e.g. Australian English. This dual identity is felt especially while in countries speaking another language. Pluricentric languages then can be seen to be unifiers and dividers at the same time. National varieties may be distinguished on the basis of lexicon and semantics, communication patterns pragmatic and discourse patterns, phonology, and often morphology and syntax and sometimes script as well. Ammon 1989 differentiates between a codex dictionaries, grammars and models of codification writers, speakers as a basis for a continuum from full exonormativity where all the codices and models are imported via partial exonormativity and partial endonormativity to full endonormativity , where all the codices and models are from within the nation. Australian English can be seen as a national variety in which there is partial and increasing endonormativity. On the whole, Ammons prediction that this is dependent on the size of the population is confirmed. However, there are other factors involved. Why, for instance, has there been more codification of English in Australian than in Canada A clue may be the point of time when the codification has taken place. I shall return to this point later. There is, in most languages, an increasing tolerance for pluricentricity. This is least developed in languages such as French and Arabic where there is a mystic belief in the unity of the language. But even for French, Luumlautdi 1992 argues that a new equilibrium of coherence and pluricentricity is being established. Nevertheless, there are, for almost all languages, recurrent features of the relationship between the dominant nations and the other nations using the language which have occurred in the treatment of the various pluricentric languages Clyne 1992 45960. They can be briefly summed up by the strong terms cultural imperialism and cultural cringe. D dominant, O other The D nations have difficulty in understanding Wardhaughs 198831 point that the distinctive element in grammar and lexis may be quite small it may be more a matter of flavor rather than substance with which people will identify. The D nations tend to confuse national variation with regional variation dialects because some features of the standard form of one national variety will coincide with a dialect of another national variety. This confusion can be found even in dictionaries. The D nations generally regard their national variety as the standard and themselves as custodians of standard norms. They tend to consider standard national varieties of O nations as deviant, nonstandard and exotic, cute, charming, and somewhat archaic. The D nations very seldom describe distinctive features of their own national variety as they regard it as unmarked. Cultural elites in the O nations tend to defer to norms from the D nations. This is related to the more distinctive forms of national varieties being dialectally and sociolectally marked. It is also due to conservative and unrealistic norms. Norms are believed not to be as rigid in O nations as in D nations. This may be why even those codifying the norms of O national varieties often believe that changes in the O national variety and not in both the D and O varieties are responsible for divergences. In international communication situations work teams, conferences, migration, tourism encounters in third countries, convergence tends to be in the direction of the D varieties. D nations have better resources than O nations to export their varieties because of their control of foreign language teaching institutes, publishing, and research institutes. D nations also have the better means of codifying the language as the publishers of dictionaries and grammars tend to be located in these countries. D nations generally believe that diversity is limited to the spoken norm. In some cases, there is complete ignorance in the D nations of some O national varieties or they are not even understood. Where there is more than one D nation employing a pluricentric language e.g. American and British, other national varieties may have a different kind of deferential relationship with each of the D varieties. In order to examine the relation between codification and national identity, let me compare some recent developments in Australian English and Austrian German. There are, of course, substantial differences in the historical basis of nationhood and the national variety in Austria and Australia. Variation between the Austrian and German national varieties of Standard German is due to the separate sociocultural and political development since the establishment of an Austrian state in the late 18th century and the dissolution of the old empire in In the late 19th century, Germany, unified under Prussia, codified North and Central German forms while Austrian norms were developed in Vienna, the centre of a multilingual, multicultural empire. Following the collapse of the AustroHungarian Empire, there was tension between proGerman and proindependence elements in Austria. After the war years as part of Nazi Germany and ten years of division between the occupying powers, Austrian nationalism was revived, within a neutral state. For a time, German appeared as a school subject not as Deutsch but as Unterrichtssprache language of instruction. The consciousness of national identity was heightened during a period of prosperity under Kreisky 197083. In Australia, the codification of Australian English was associated with a loosening of ties with Britain and, in the more recent period, ran parallel with the development of the policy of multiculturalism. In the strengthening of national identity Whitlam played a comparable role to that of his Austrian socialist counterpart. Until the 1940s, most nonacademic discussion of Australian English at least was condemnatory. Through the now famous exchanges in the columns of the ABC Weekly, Mitchell took the initiative of questioning the cultural cringe in relation to Australian English. There are three similarities between Austrian German and Australian English in the role of the national dictionary, in the attitudes towards its codification, and in the recent export of the varieties. In Australia as well as in Austria, dictionaries before about 1980 transmitted exonormative standards. In Australia, the undisputed authority was Oxford. But even the Oxford Dictionary of Australian English depicted the English national variety as unmarked and marked the Australian items. There was an official Austrian dictionary published under the auspices of the Austrian Ministry of Education and the Arts but its norms were almost indistinguishable from those of the West German Duden, which made the concession of marking deviations in the Standard German of Austria and Switzerland the same way as it did regional German dialect features. In 1979, the dictionary was newly conceptualized and the edition that appeared in that year accentuated Austrian distinctiveness, exercising what Dressler and Wodak 1982 described as a solidarizing and separatist function . At least one third of the items in the dictionary could not be found in earlier editions neologisms and characteristically Austrian items. Some of them are dialect expressions employed in Austrian Standard German literature they are marked dialect or regional. More significantly, 120 items are asterisked as being felt to be West German sic . The 1979 edition of the Oumlautsterreichisches Woumlautrterbuch Austrian Dictionary attracted a great deal of controversy. Letters to the editor tended to come from an educated elite and criticized an alleged lowering of standards, e.g Amoral, compiled by illiterates, and calculated to debase the behaviour of the young The official language of Austria is the German language. And nothing else. No distorted babble. Our children have the right to be taught a German no worse than in the rest of the Germanspeaking region. It was also claimed that the dictionary would separate our language from common German dottedline to strengthen the foundations of the dubious concept of the Austrian nation . Moreover, there was a concern about the introduction of Viennese jargon not used in the west of Austria. Academic criticism esp. by Wiesinger 1980 took up the three issues of lowering standards, damaging the unity of the language, and Viennacentricity, and especially the sinister agenda of egalitarianism and Austrian national selfassertiveness. This has to be seen in relation to the rigid class system and the residual German nationalism in Austria. In a more balanced review, Dressler and Wodak 1982 suggest that separatism had been carried too far in the dictionary, overshadowing actual group differences and ignoring the heterogeneity of Austrian German. Reiffenstein 1983 detected two contradictory tendencies in the dictionary the reactionary, anachronistic position of overemphasizing the Austrian part of the lexicon and a welcome attempt at language planning motivated by a progressive social policy . The 1985 edition of the dictionary retreats from some of the reforms, in line with the criticism, and shows a return to conservatism and increased regionalism. The practice of marking German items is continued but fewer items are asterisked, and some of the distinctively Austrian ones are marked colloquial. The 1990 edition continues in the tradition of the 1979 edition in offering a listing of the lexicon of Austrian German, including pronunciation and morphological features of Austrian Standard German. It is more cautious in marking regional and colloquial forms, including grammatical structures. In recent years, there have been strong voices of support for the normative role of the Austrian Dictionary, particularly from the younger generation of Austrian linguists, e.g. Moser and Muhr, and also from some of the older generation, e.g. Pollak 1991, who argues that Austrian German is undermined not only from outside, but especially from within, because of unrealistic norms and different notions of Standard to those in Germany. The Austrian controversy has its parallels in the O nations of other pluricentric languages."

        "text": "What a bundle of Aussie Gold From MARTIN BLAKE in Victoria, Canada AS Barcelona gold medallists Kieren Perkins and Kathy Watt lead the charge, Australia has won nine of 12 gold medals on offer in the first full day of the Commonwealth Games. Shrugging aside the embarrassing gaffe of official Arthur Tunstall, the Australians won four gold medals in the pool, three at the shooting range and two in road cycling. Underlining growing Australian strength in Games events, particularly swimming, the team is tipped to match or even better the 52 gold medals won at the last Commonwealth Games in Auckland. There were sensations in the Australian effort, with the most surprising being the marriage proposal by Australian silver medallist Karen Van Wirdum immediately after the 100m freestyle. Robert Dunne, 26, of Brisbane was sitting in front of the TV in his pyjamas absolutely ecstatic over his girlfriends performance when her poolside marriage proposal from the Commonwealth Games beamed into his living room. I was up on the ceiling somewhere screaming, when all of a sudden she came out with this announcement. It didnt really hit me until 30 minutes later. Then I thought Oh my God. But after a fiveminute transPacific phone call with his girlfriend he accepted, then went out for a few drinks with friends. Overall, the strong showing in Canada bodes well for Australia at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. The days biggest swimming sensation was 20yearold St Ives student Elli Overton, who beat defending Australian champion Hayley Lewis to win gold in the womens 400m individual medley. It was Overtons first major victory. Im stoked, she said. Its not even my event. Im out there thinking what am I doing here. Overton, stunned by her omission from Australias victorious womens 4x200m relay team, put in the performance of her career and clocked a personal best time of 4min 01s. Olympic superstar Perkins added another string to his bow with a victory in the mens 200m freestyle, proving his worth at the shorter distances. Perkinss duel with New Zealanders Trent Bray and Danyon Loader had the crowd going wild in the stands. Disabled swimmer Melissa Carlton, 16, of Newtown, Tasmania, won a gold medal in the womens event over 100m freestyle, although disabled medals will not count in the final tally. Australia also had a stunning day at the shooting range, with three gold medals. Phillip Adams, the ruddyfaced farmer from Forbes, joined with Ben Sandstrom to win the pairs free pistol. Melbourne women Kim Frazer and Sylvia Purdue won the pairs small bore rifle prone, and Annette Woodward, of Melbourne joined Western Australian Christine Trefry to win the pairs sport pistol. The Australian mens road cycling team of Phil Anderson, Damian McDonald, Brett Dennis and Henk Vogels won by more than three minutes over the 97km course. The womens time trial was closer, with the Australian team of Barcelona Ollympic gold medallist Watt, Cathy Reardon, Rachel Victor and Louise Nolan winning by 15 seconds. Were not even warm yet Raiders chilling warning to title contenders By PAUL KENT TIM Sheens gave an ominous warning after Canberras 2612 win over Norths yesterday Were a good side to keep out of the grand final for two weeks. Sheens was talking about the fact that the Raiders now have next weeks major semifinal or, should they lose, the following weeks final to qualify for this years big one. In other words, the Raiders have two bites of the cherry. Id like to think well give it a real good shake this year, he said. But youd have to say that we did a few things that could have quite easily turned the game against us, but Norths turned the ball straight over as well. We can play a lot better. Sheens words came not as a boast, but from a coach who has seen his team play better. And a coach who expects better. Most chillingly, it was echoed by his players. We didnt play real well, said Laurie Daley. But we still came away with a win. In what was at times a scrappy game, Canberras tremendous ability to mug an opponent in quickdraw fashion was all the difference. And it took eight superb minutes. It came late in the first half, after both sides had struggled and at times bumbled their way to a standstill. From a nothing play, Brett Mullins shot clear and looked set to streak in under the posts. Normally, youd put your glasses down with Mullos in the clear, Sheens said. And who had reason to doubt him After all, who runs down Mullins Try Seers. Unbelievably, he stopped, propped and turned before chasing down Mullins over 60m, catching him metres from the line. But the Bears were shot. Canberra were screaming through and hardly a Bear had made it back. When the ball was fired out from dummyhalf, centre Chris Caruana failed to get back onside and knocked down the pass, giving up a penalty and earning a 10minute rest in the bin. From a quick tap the ball went wide to Ricky Stuart, who looked wide, passed wide and allowed Jason Croker to score out wide. The Raiders werent finished however. With Caruana off the field, Stuart worked his side up to halfway and then reversed the ball down the sideline to Daley. The fiveeighth found Noa Nadruku and it was trytime once again, just three minutes after Croker had scored. And soon after that when Ken Negas picked up the ball and ran 60m to score after a bumbled Bears kick 14 points in eight minutes had told the story. After the match, Norths coach Peter Louis was understandably disappointed. But he refused to fly the white flag especially when he had blokes with the courage of Billy Moore, who played despite the death of his mother after a long illness only a few days ago. You cant play a side like Canberra with 12 men, even though I think when Chris was put in the sin bin he had no option, Louis said. But I think the second half holds us in good stead. We didnt play well and it was 12all. There was an overwhelming feeling in the North Sydney dressing room that the Bears had let an opportunity go and that, if the two were to meet again, they would give a better account of themselves. The Raiders, with John Lomax in doubt for next week with a shoulder injury, a burst blood vessel in Stuarts thigh and various minor injuries to Mullins, David Furner and Daley, were feeling much the same. While some concern was shown over Stuart, Sheens believes his playmaker should be okay for next Sundays match against Canterbury. Early in yesterdays game, Stuart dislocated a finger and it refused to go back into place because he would not relax. Mullins left the field in the second half to get a cortisone injection in his hip but, like his teammates, he should be available next week. 50,000 fines on way, jockeys warned MAXIMUM fines for jockeys will be raised from 20,000 to 50,000 from October 1, Sydneys chief steward John Schreck told a delegation of jockeys at Rosehill yesterday. He also warned the jockeys that interference in major races such as the George Main stakes and Epsom Handicap might result in jockeys being fined as well as being suspended. You cannot possibly expect the same sort of penalty to flow from those races Group races as you can expect to flow from a Tuesday at Warwick Farm, he told them. That will certainly be the policy from now on. And there could be the imposition of a suspension as well as a fine. Schreck said each case would be treated on its merits. The meeting was called yesterday so jockeys would not feel stewards were creeping up on them. Jockeys Association president Mark de Montfort was asked to inform his fellow members who were not present at Rosehill of the stewards intentions. Earlier, Schreck signalled the views he would be putting to the jockey delegation when he said after an inquiry into interference in the first race In the big races coming up we will not be handing out suspensions of six or seven days believe me it will be much bigger than that. The inquiry was into a check suffered by Calligraphy Grant Cooksley midway through the first race. The inquiry disclosed that both the winner Snatches Darren Beadman and Blunt Statement Chris Munce had contributed to the trouble and stewards decided to take no action against either rider after taking into account their explanations. open boxCraig Young Rats sacked By GREG GROWDEN FEW would dispute NSW Rugby Union president Peter Crittles claim that David Campese is the worlds greatest footballer after the Test winger masterminded a Randwick firstgrade premiership for the second time in three seasons yesterday. Randwick last night were celebrating their 25th premiership success, primarily through the Campo factor, with his vision and unpredictability being so crucial in the Galloping Greens conclusive 3516 grand final victory over Warringah at Waratah Rugby Stadium. Campeses two unforgettable tries in the 14th and 48th minutes, plus his involvement in two others, saw Warringah leave Concord yet again emptyhanded, when losing their fifth grand final. It was all so reminiscent of the 1992 grand final when Campese, through a marvellous sideline run, succeeded in scoring a fullstretch diving try in the corner which sank Gordon. Campese found himself in the same corner yesterday, again diving full length and again finding the line. This followed another extraordinary Campese moment of magic in the first half, when even though having three Warringah defenders in front of him, Campese evaded all as he cheekily dropped the ball onto his foot, chipped through and regathered. So quick was this motion that some of his Randwick teammates thought he had knocked on rather than scored. And then, just before the end, Campese was again right in the middle of the chaos when he regathered a David Knox bomb and, before being dumped, threw the ball over his left shoulder to replacement centre James Holbeck, who scored. This movement was soundly booed by the Warringah fans, as Campeses pass was appreciably forward. It was missed though by referee Wayne Erickson, enabling Randwick to go to a matchwinning 2816 lead. When Crittle, a former Wallaby forward, was announcing that Campese had won the manofthematch award, he described Australias most capped player as the greatest footballer in the world. And I mean in any code soccer, rugby league, AFL. He is the best ball player in the world, Crittle said. But in the Randwick dressing room, in its traditional ebbtide of champagne and beer slush, Campese was just another of the boys, revelling in the Galloping Greens seventh premiership in eight years. On the other side of the dressing room wall, Warringah players were definitely more attuned to the Campo factor. He Campese was probably the difference, Warringah halfback Mark Catchpole said. Both his tries came at crucial times, and had the effect of halting us. Right up until the 70th minute we thought we were a chance, and then Campo is involved in another one. As usual Campese found it difficult to explain his onfield dominance, only explaining that when you are part of a team youve got to do the job. Another Randwick player deserving of special mention was their secondrower Warwick Waugh who played most of the game with a suspected broken bone in his right wrist. Despite the outright pain, Waugh refused to let up in the scrummaging and lineout work, winning two important jumps in the second half. Waugh was just part of an excellent Randwick forward unit. Warringah coach Steve Lidbury suggested last night that they may not get the proper credit because of Campeses overwhelming impact on the grand final. I think the Randwick forwards make Campo look good because they give him so much space, Lidbury said."

        "text": "33 The Keating coup The recession and the GST got Hawke. Paul Keating, January l992 I Support for the Hawke government collapsed after its l990 election victory, due to public disenchantment, a protracted recession and a leadership struggle. The recession demoralised Labor. It meant that Labors economic policy, judged by its own criterion, had failed. The paradox of Labors fourth term is that Hawke, a four times election winner, fell victim to the recession and that Keating, despite his unpopularity, finally deposed Hawke. The leadership crisis in Labors fourth term was triggered by Hawkes decision to repudiate the l988 Kirribilli agreement and remain as prime minister and Keatings refusal to accept this and his resort to a challenge. Once Hawke told Keating on 3l January 1991 that he was breaking their agreement, a leadership challenge was inevitable. Keating, denied a managed transition, sought the mantle by force. A few months after the election Kim Beazley, a Hawke loyalist, rated a Hawke retirement during the term at a 90 per cent probability a misplaced judgement. Hawke had never completely closed the door on this option in talks with Keating before the 1991 challenge. But ALP national secretary Bob Hogg had a different view I dont think that Hawke had any intention of delivering on the Kirribilli Agreement and leaving.1 Keating had a choice he could submit to Hawke or put the issue before the party through a challenge. The Labor leadership was a likely poisoned chalice with the collapse of Labors fourth term position creating the basis for a coalition win at the next election. But Hawke and Keating, like figures in a Shakespearian tragedy, were compelled by their history and their natures to their battle. Each man had a dual identity Hawke the successful prime minister who refused to recognise the exhaustion of his tenure, and Keating the legitimate successor whose optimum time to become a successful prime minister had passed. Keatings mistake was to belittle Hawke, thereby turning Hawke against his retirement with dignity option. Hawke convinced himself that Keatings claim was illegitimate that he was entitled to defy Keating and dishonour his pledge. As their mutual obsession intensified, Keating decided to challenge Hawke rather than leave politics and Hawke, in turn, decided his responsibility was not to manage a smooth transition but to stay in office. After the 1990 election the Hawke government was changed in power and personality dimensions. Keating became deputy unopposed after Lionel Bowens retirement. The left won three Cabinet posts, for Howe, Hand and Bolkus, and was fully integrated, ready for the strangest political alliance of the Hawke era Hawke and the left against Keating. The right wing emerged stronger but divided. Beazley took the main microreform portfolio, transport and communications Kerin remained in resources and primary industry Crean became a junior minister and Ray and Richardson had senior Cabinet posts. Evans stayed foreign minister and Willis became finance minister. This was a diverse group but in policy terms it was more sympathetic to Hawkes gradualism than to Keatings firmer economic line. Hawke was positioning Crean and Beazley against Keating. At the same time the 1980s era economic ministers the engine room of that government were outflanked Walsh went to the backbench, Button survived on borrowed time, Dawkins was unpopular within the party. This group, which had been Keatings Cabinet base, was no longer the anchor of the Hawke Cabinet. Keatings grip on the Cabinet was slipping and Hawkes was tightening. Hawke, in fact, had wanted a bigger restructuring, and had spoken to Button, Willis and Richardson about their leaving politics. Richardson was shocked when Hawke had sounded him out on a possible retirement and overseas posting he rang Keating at once You wont believe what the bastards just suggested. Yet Richardson himself had told Hawke to dump Button and Willis Hawke wrote a letter to Beazley in April 1990 declaring that Labors fourth term would be judged by its microreforms, and instructing Beazley to pursue this agenda with determination. This went to the core of the case against Hawke that since its May 1988 Economic Statement the government had been drifting and Hawkes shelflife as prime minister had virtually expired. The malaise continued from Labors third term into its fourth by 1990 the government was adrift, devoid of any strategic leadership. Hawke remained a relatively popular leader with an approval rating in the 4045 per cent range, but leadership had ceased largely to be an electoral asset for the Labor Party. Labors support fell to below 35 per cent of the primary vote. After the 1990 election Keating moved to stake his claim to the leadership on policy grounds he threw himself at the microreform agenda and ridiculed Hawkes technique of reform by consensus. The battlefield was telecommunications reform, where Hawke was aligned with Beazley to introduce a competitive duopoly in the local industry while Keating sought to replace Telecoms monopoly with a fully competitive model. It was a bitter, emotional, and symbolic struggle. Keating assumed for himself the crash through or crash mantle of policy leadership. By his actions Keating claimed to be the real leader, replacing Hawke. The irony is that Keatings fury only accentuated the growing Cabinet majority for Hawke. The dramatic moment in the communications battle came when Keating, frustrated beyond endurance, threw his pen on the table and walked out of the Cabinet room complaining, This is a fucking secondrate decision from a secondrate government. Keatings nemesis, Robert Ray, taunted, Go on, spit the dummy. But Keating was being driven by power, not just ideology, in this dispute. Hawke asked himself one question why was Keating trying to become a hero on microreform now Why was Keating calling for airline sales and telecommunication competition now Hawke recalled with bitterness the events of 1988, when Keating had not raised his voice to support Hawke when Hawke himself was under internal assault for his pursuit of airline privatisation. Keatings dilemma during 199091 was to sustain his claim to the prime ministership while explaining away the recession, an immensely difficult task. Keating became agitated, frustrated and prone to selfdestructive actions during 1990 he committed a series of blunders which reinforced the hostility which sections of the public held towards him. In May 1990 Keating made a devastating public assault on Button, breaking Cabinet solidarity to declare a virtual no confidence in his colleague, provoked by Buttons penchant for soliloquy. Then he used a VIP jet to fly to Melbourne with journalists to attend a Collingwood football game, his latest loyalty in the cause of a more knockabout image. This fanned public concern about Keatings elitism and double standards. In September 1990 he attacked the National Australia Banks outgoing chief, Nobby Clark, claiming the bank had been technically insolvent a few years earlier, an extraordinary claim by a treasurer. Keating retreated but Howard hurt him he accused Keating of playing fast and loose with the confidence of ordinary Australians in the stability of the financial system. But Keatings most memorable mistake came on 29 November 1990 with the release of statistics showing that Australia was in a second quarter of negative growth, the technical definition of a recession. Keating had a press statement prepared by his advisers which he read to the media it contained the infamous line, dotted linethis is a recession that Australia had to have. In one blow Keating destroyed two years of promises that Australia could avoid a recession the pledge made by Hawke and Keating at the 1990 election. Keatings comments were a terrible political blunder, a mistake he later conceded. But he was also wrong when he suggested that the worst impact of the recession might have passed. The contrast between Hawke and Keating was sharp Keating was brazen in his reluctance to admit his mistake while Hawke flashed humility and a caring countenance. Within the party there was talk about eliminating Keating as a recession scapegoat but this was too dangerous for Hawke. The key to Labors political crisis during its fourth term was that Hawkes leadership malaise transcended Keatings unpopularity, a considerable achievement. This was because Keating, popular or unpopular, was perceived to be the dominant figure in the government. Most people believed that Keating would replace Hawke as prime minister during the fourth term. Hawkes problem was summarised by NSW Liberal advertising adviser, Greg Daniel, chief of Clemenger Sydney It would seem to me that Australia is in the peculiar position, almost, of having two GovernorsGeneral Hawke and Haden and a Prime Minister Keating who is called the Deputy Prime Minister.2 This perception had been revealed in ANOPs research before the 1990 election, and Rod Cameron said in late 1990 that Keating had as much chance of being an electable Prime Minister as Hawke. Another study by Mackay Research in mid1990 concluded Consistently participants spoke as though it was beyond question that the Prime Minister would retire during his present term. The study found that Keating is consistently described as arrogant, cold, aloof and gratuitously insulting yet there is continuing grudging respect for his performance as Treasurer.3 Hawke and Keating were a study in contrasts. Hawke played more golf, travelled overseas, including a memorable trip to Gallipoli for the 75th anniversary commemoration of the ANZAC landing, and thrived at the Lodge. Keating was burning with frustration, fearful that Hawke would repudiate his Kirribilli pact, yet resentful that if he became prime minister he might inherit only the ashes of an era. It is extraordinary that the two men discussed their agreement again only on 9 October 1990, six months after the election. Hawke told Keating that he wanted to be around for a settlement in South Africa and said he was likely to be honoured with the keys to the city of London for his contribution to the Commonwealth. He said, I want to stay until CHOGM the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Zimbabwe next year. That meeting would be in October 1991, late in the term for a leadership transition. Keating appealed to Hawke he would need time as prime minister to change his image before an election. Keating reminded Hawke that he had given an unconditional pledge to retire in front of witnesses. But Hawke deferred further discussion and Keating left an unhappy man.4 The upshot was that Keating encouraged the two witnesses, Kelty and Abeles, to approach Hawke to seek a reconvening of the Kirribilli meeting. But Hawke was not interested. The equation was set Hawkes resentment of Keatings pressure and Keatings hostility to Hawkes obstinacy. Keating had two powerbases against Hawke the NSW right and the centre left. This time, unlike 1988, the NSW right wanted a leadership change. Its powerbroker, Graham Richardson, had taken this decision before the 1990 election a point few ALP figures had grasped. But Richardsons resentment towards Hawke hardened postelection when Hawke tested if he wanted to quit politics and then gave him social security, a job Richardson disliked. Keating had fought with the NSW right at various stages of his treasurership, but Keating and his base were reuniting the challenge would be rooted in NSW tribal loyalty. Richardson had always known that eventually he would move from Hawke to Keating. Keatings ultimate aspirations were part of NSW Labors tribal culture over the previous twenty years. Richardson knew that Keating would be a great gamble but he also felt that Hawkes leadership was dying that with Labors primary vote sinking below 35 per cent, only a new leader could break the cycle. However, the right wing was divided on the leadership between NSW and Victoria. Victorian right powerbroker, Robert Ray, was Keatings chief critic within the party. The KeatingRay relationship was rooted in a deep and mutual antagonism. Keating had vetoed Hawkes earlier plan to make Ray the finance minister. He called Ray the fat Indian and never concealed his contempt for Rays political judgement. Ray felt that Keating was electoral poison, a man who put his selfinterest before the partys interest and that his unpopularity with the party and the public made absurd the talk about his leadership."

        "text": "There is much debate in the literature about the effects of regular low intensity burning of the landscape has on both plant and animal species. However, through many practical contempory examples we can see that regular burns actually increases the productivity of the environment. Therefore, Aboriginals had sound and very practical reasons to fire the landscape. When Europeans first arrived in Australia the described the environment as being open, with wellspaced trees and clear understories with predominantly grasses. This was undoubtedly due to Aboriginal burning practices. Aboriginals saw several practical uses and consequences for burning the Australian landscape. As mentioned above, it cleared the understory and allowed easier mobility for hunting and gathering. Burning enabled more effective hunting of large and arboreal game. It resulted in recycling of nutrient into the soil and therefore promoted plant regeneration. Firing the bush also inhanced the diversity and occurance of certain edible plant species. Finally, regular bush burning produced more habitats for arboreal animals to live in. Steven Pyne, a scientist who studied Aboriginal burning practices, argued that Aboriginal burning was controlled, planned and directed in a very systematic way. He believes that Aboriginals burnt when the thought the conditions were suitable. Burning generally was undertaken during spring and early summer when there was still enough rain to promote fast regeneration of plants. Pyne argues that Aboriginals controlled the direction of fires by many physical factors including wind humidity and topographic factors such as streams and maintain breaks. Enthological, archaeological and oral evidence has confirmed that Aboriginal burning was carried out in a mosaic fashion burning certain parts of the landscape whilst preserving sensitive areas to increase the productivity of the environment. Aboriginals also practiced controlled burns in the arid zone, but for different reasons than in more fertile areas. Arid zone burns were undertaken by the Aboriginal to reduce the amount of litter building up to ensure that if a fire does occur it would not wipe out all the bioresources available in the area. Firing of the bush obviously has a very direct affect on the plant species present. Some vegetation is more sensitive to fire than others. For example, grasses, scrub, shrubs and sclerophyll vegetation is well adapted to fire and regenerates readily. On the other hand, mixed forests and rainforest contain plants which are less tolerant to fire and take longer to regenerate. These areas are generally wetter and thus less susceptible to firing anyway. Some plants are thus fire tolerant and actually require fire to reproduce. Examples include banksia, some eucalyptus species. Other plants are actually stimulated after fire.Examples include Acacia species, common bracken Pteridium. A study undertaken by Macquarie University students in the ecology reserve at Lane Cove proved that plant diversity is actually increased by fire. One section of the reserve the southern side was control burnt some 25 years ago while the other sections were not. The burnt section contained many more plant species on the ground and shrub species about lm high than did the unburnt section. The unburnt area was dominated by one species Kunzea, Leptosperum which inhibited any other species from growing because it successfully competed for light. There are several edible plant species that are promoted after burning of the bush. For example, bracken Pteridium has edible rhizomes. Often after fires in the Sydney region bracken can be seen to densly cover the understory. Aboriginals were known to exploit the rhizomes of this and other plant species for food, particularly after fire. Aboriginals also ate the highly toxic roots of cynads after careful preparation. These are known to be promoted by firing of the bush. Acacias, which are abundant after fire, were exploited by the Aboriginals who ate their seeds. The occurance, abundance and distribution of many plants in Australia was therefore determined by Aboriginals regularly burning the environment. This point can be highlighted by looking at vegetation associations in Tasmania in the last century. Aboriginals burnt regularily in Tasmania up until lAfter this time, when regular burning ceased, the mixed forests gradually became rainforests, the grasslands became shrublands and the sclerophyll vegetation turned into more forest types. The occurance and abundance of animal populations is also significantly affected by burning. Again, some species are promoted while others reduced by fires. For example, the New Holland Mouse was thought to have become extinct in Australia until recently. It was found in heathland in Newcastle that had recently been burnt. The changed fire regime of European cultures i.e. less fires has resulted in reduced suitable habitats for the mouse and therefore a substantial reduction in its numbers. Another example of the way in which fire affects animal populations is provided by macropods. Initially their populations reduce immediately after fire but quickly increase to maximum capacities l year after fire. Examples are numerous. Pot kangaroos prefer areas that are burnt every 7 years because they live in the thickets of Casuarinas and these are inhanced with fires every 7 yrs. The lyer bird prefers regular burning. Australian plants and animals have evolved with aboriginals for at least 40,000 years. Aboriginals have been burning the bush for at least 38,000 yrs. Therefore, Australian plants and animals have evolved and adapted to regular lowintensty fires. Many are promoted by and some require regular burns. The massive and highly distructive wildfires in Australia in the l920s, l950s and l970s are a direct result of absence of regular burning. These fires have proved to be devestating to the Australian landscape. Aboriginals therefore fired the landscape for many reasons. Primarily it resulted in increased productivity of the bush. Many edible plants and animals are inhanced by burning. Aboriginal burning practices can be seen as highly managed deliberate manipulation of the environment. It has been described as a limited form of cultivation. Question 63N.B. Ab. Aboriginal There are two problems with the statement made by Frith Colby about Aboriginal impact on kangaroos or more broadly Australian Fauna. Firstly, Ab. weapons were not primitive stone tipped spears,barbed spears and spear throwers were efficient highly developed weapons that allowed proficent and effective hunting of large game such as kangaroos. Secondly, they state that there were never a great number of Ab. in the whole continent. This was thought to be correct in l969 but unreadable word since has estimated the pop to be as large as l2 million in the Halocene period. The Holocene period was characterised by stable climate and a growing Aboriginal population. The Australia small tool tradition with its spear tips and barbs arrived mid Holocene about 5000 years ago. This new technology allowed Ab. people to hunt more efficiently than previously. This allowed them to support an increasing population which in turn put demanded more resources. As a population increases it impacts on its environment more more. Work done in QLD by Smith has showed that in order to maintain the kangaroo pop. there no more than l5 of the adult population can be killed each year. If we apply these figures to the holocene then a pop. of 12 million, with 30 hunting kangaroos, would only be able to kill 12 kangaroos each per year without impacting the pop. This is unlikely if a technology is designed specifically for hunting large game then it will be used extensively until it is no longer viable. The dropping out of the tool kit of stone tips and barbs about 2000 years ago suggests they were no longer viable. This suggests a decrease in the game they were used to hunt. The low numbers of kangaroos found around Sydney at 1788 suggests that the Kangaroo pop. had been kept at an unreadable word low level by over hunting by Ab. Thus they did have an impact on the Kangaroo population. As the Ab. population had reached a new higher level supported by kangaroos than when they were reduced in number the Ab. had to diversify their food base to support the population at its new carrying capacity. A shift to greater use of lower trophic resources and smaller animals replaced kangaroos. Fishing was made possible through the development of fish hooks and bone fish spears. In an effort to maximise productivity of plant resources and maintain dwindling kangaroo pop. Ab . increased their use of fire this increased hill slope instability and caused erosion. The silt washed off hill slope deposited in estuaries changing the environments from sandy to muddy. This impacted on the shell fish found there. Thus Ab. people impacted on the shell fish species found in particular areas. Firing also favoured some animal species impacted on their numbers. A species of ground parrot lyre birds favour frequently burnt areas as do some smaller marsupials. With the ceasation of Ab. burning after settlement these animals became rare. Thus Ab. had an impact on the maintance of habitat suitable to support these species. Dugongs seals and the Red Necked Wallaby have not been observed by European s in the Sydney area since settlement and yet they appear in the archaelogical record. It is thought that perhaps these species were over utilized by Ab. thus became extinct locally. The holocene was a period of climate stability and yet there have been a number of changes in the numbers types of particular animals found in some areas of Australia. As climatic change did not cause these changes it has been suggested that Ab. people played a part. The archaelogical record ethnographic observations since settlement provides evidence for Ab. involvement in the changes to fauna. Thus Ab. people can be said to have impacted on the Holocene Fauna. Thus the proposition passed by Frith Colby seems to be incorrect in light of the current evidence. It is doubtful that Ab. people had no direct or long term impacts on the Holocene fauna. This is especially true where the larger fauna are concerned. QUESTION 63 The proposition that the Aboriginal people had no direct or long term impacts on the Holocene Aust. fauna is not a believable one in the light of a further examination of Aboriginal pop densities and changing technologies. Initially it was proposed that the Aboriginal population of Aust. at 1788 the contact time starting with Europeans was at 300, 000 people. This figure suggest in the 1950s was widely accepted until further studies in the 1970s and 1980s gave a much larger estimate. Considering the resources available to exploit for foods and animals, the nos. of fires sighted by the europeans on first arrival of Aust, and other ethnographic and archaelogical evidence, such as the nos. of shell middens, sizes of middens, sites. A population for Australia was estimated at 1 million. A figure which more than doubles the previous estimate. Most conservative historians now believe that 750, 000 people 34s of million would be a minimum level of the popn. for Aust in This estimate of 750, 000 1 million people then rejects the suggestion that Aboriginal groups were never a great number that could impact upon the Aust. Holocene fauna. The notion that Aborigines possessed primitive weapons could not be further from the truth. In fact the Aboriginal pop. had gone through several changes in their technology to reach the one that they used just before european settlement. unreadable word 500 ago, the Core Tool and Scraper tradition was abandoned, and a new technology known as the Small Tool tradition took its place. As the climatic conditions in the Holocene period had become more stabilised, with warmer temps., stable seas level, and more rainfall, Aborigines were finding there was a greater resource base for them to exploit. Thus to exploit this unreadable wider resource base the Small Tool tradition began. The use of barbed spears, pointed stone heads, spear throwers, and edge ground axes allowed the Aborigines to hunt very efficiently. The use of fire also did not go missed, as it could open the area up for the Aborigines, provide more habitats and food resources for large herbivorous game, provide shelter and food for tree dwelling animals birds, and maximize productivity of food plants."

        "text": "Bondi At twentysix, Leigh who is Casss cousin is tired of playing the part of bad girl but the habit is difficult to break. She fell into the role quite naturally at puberty parsons daughters do and played it to the hilt, and now its like a skin she cant shed. The thing is, Cass decides, Leigh knows the ropes of bad girl land, and even though the terrain has become tedious has in fact become as boring as the Sunday afternoon prayer meetings of their childhoods, Leigh feels comfortable there. And safe. Safe In a manner of speaking, safe because Cass, watching Leigh smooth suntan oil on her bare breasts, knows that Leigh wouldnt even count the Hanlon affair. Leigh wouldnt give it any more significance than Cass would give a crunched fender or a smashedup headlight. Annoying, yes. Inconvenient. But shrug these things happen, and besides, every life needs a little excitement, right Nevertheless, it is because of Hanlon that Leigh has called, and because of Hanlon that they are lying towel by towel on Bondi beach, with Deb making sandcastles a few yards off. Not the usual way for Cass to spend a Saturday afternoon these days. Come on, Cass, Leigh had said. Live a little. Well dotted line Cass hears herself again, all tiresome caution. She is torn between maternal anxiety and the pleasant pinpricks of risk. Live a little Being target practice for Hanlon Theres this fingerpainting thingamy at the public library. I was going to take Deb dotted line Leigh already has the stroller out. Deb needs to be outdoors, not in. What kind of an Aussie kid are you raising here But will it be safe Safe as Sunday School. Hanlons so dumb, hell still be watching my flat in Melbourne. Leigh and Cass have travelled different roads, but they need each other. Were heads and tails, I suppose you could say, Cass explains to Tom. Though Leigh always counters Youre the wolf in sheeps clothing, and Im the little lost lamb playing wolf to protect myself. Black and white, Tom hopes night and day. At any rate, each plays Best Supporting Actress to the others role. They grew up in Brisbane, which should explain a lot, and were fed milk and biblical verses in their highchairs. When Leigh telephoned, the day before yesterday, Cass could feel the rush at the top of her head. Leigh She was laughing already. I dont believe it, I thought youd vanished from the face of the land Where are you Brisbane God no Not Brizzy. Leigh hasnt been heard from for two years, though the family gossip mill has been murmuring Townsville, Cairns, Kuranda, Daintree, Leigh heading further and further north, heading deeper into shady reasons, bad company, offshore boats, Darwin in a shocked whisper, Cape Trib, Thursday Island grant her Thy mercy, Lord, New Guinea Then Brisbane again, it was rumoured. Someone had seen her at Expo, her hair ungelled and unspiked, looking like a normal person, and shed said In sales, giving a phone number. Selling dotted line No one dared to ask what. At the phone number, a male voice went off in a shower of expletives and detonations about that fucking bitch whod moved on, bloody lucky for her, and if he ever fucking caught up with the slut dotted line Lost traces, lost causes, lost sheep. The family signed and bowed its head Remember, O Lord, thy wayward child and turn not Thy face away from dotted line Im here, Leigh says. In Sydney. Excitement, salamander style, comes slinking in through Casss eardrum and makes straight for all her nerve centres of temptation. Listen, Leigh says. I need a place to crash, its sort of urgent. Cass picks her up at Circular Quay. God you look terrible, but what does it matter Reinstated as baileroutinchief, Cass feels giddy with pleasure. Yeah, well. Ive been doing a bit of coke. Doesnt go very well with food. Leigh lights a cigarette. Hows Deb Adorable. Youll see in a minute. Toms home, so I just rushed out. And have you been a good girl while Ive been gone Leigh asks. They both laugh. What happened Cass wants to know. What do you mean You said it was urgent. Oh, that. Leigh shrugs. Nothing much. You remember Hanlon That bloke you were living with in Brisbane Him. We hit the road for a while, business you know, but I got tired of doing the dirty work and taking shit, so I What sort of shit Oh, you know, the usual. He hit me round a bit. Leigh, why Why do you keep latching on to men like that Youve gotta stop Yeah, I know. Ive tried, I really have. I just cant seem to get turned on unless theyre hellraisers. Anyway, in Brizzy, Hanlon set up this little dream of a deal, with me in the hot seat, natch, and it came to me that I could just take the money and run. So I did. Ripped him off for twenty thousand, and headed for Melbourne. God, Leigh Twenty thousand dollars Cass is appalled, her eyes glitter, she is full of plans. Well dotted line she cant stop reeling from the enormity of it Well, now you can afford to, you know, quit dotted line Quit, uh, selling. You can go straight, get an apartment here, finish your degree dotted line Never give up, do you Leigh says fondly. In high school, they had been neck and neck. Leigh had won a state medal as well as a Commonwealth Scholarship. A brilliant future, her teachers said, which turned out to be true in a way. Still, Leigh sighs. Mackie was worth it for a while. She winces, then smiles, then winces again, remembering Mackie, the excon shed run off with before the end of her first year at Queensland Uni. About going back dotted line I think about it a lot, but I dunno after all these years. Its never too late. Yeah, yeah. Leigh is wistful. I meant to, actually. Use the money for, you know, uni or something. But I blew it all on coke in Melbourne and last week I saw You blew twenty thousand dollars Well, not just me. Friends, you know. I threw a few parties. And I guess the word got round because last week Its all gone Cass is awestruck. That entire amount Fraid so. Leigh twists sideways in the seat, leaning against the passenger door, to gauge the effect of her words on Cass. My cokes at maintenance level, though. Its under control. I get frightened for you, Cass says. If Leigh werent around, what would happen to the world on its axis What might Cass have to do Yeah, me too sometimes. Leigh laughs. Anyway, last week I saw Hanlon watching my place. He doesnt take kindly to being gypped, so I thought Id better bugger off. Hitchhiked up, left early yesterday and just arrived. God, Im tired. She slept for fifteen hours. She woke, she ate something, she threw up, she slept, she sleeps. Tom, looking into the guest room before heading for his office the Saturday catchup, says God, its the worst Ive ever seen her. Shes thin as a whippet. Except for her tits, he thinks. In spite of himself, hes stirred. The unspiked black hair, longer now, shaggy and glossy, falls across a childs face. He kisses Cass brusquely So how long is she planning to camp here Not that hes made uneasy by Leighs presence in his house, not really. Because this is what Tom has observed that the children of True Believers go one of two ways, and that there is a delicate ecology within families. To Toms legal mind hes a partner in a Regent Street law firm, Leigh is some sort of warranty. Leigh wakes into high sun. Lets go to the beach, she says. Well dotted line Theres this fingerpainting thingamy dotted line Live a little, Leigh laughs, exasperated. And so they push the stroller along the neat residential streets of Bellevue Hill and down the long asphalt slope to Bondi. Cass is always mildly surprised that no one asks for her passport at that point where the buildings change so sharply. Cass watches the way the men walk up and down where the sand turns hard, the way their equipment strains against their skimpy briefs, the way their eyes, not even pretending to be covert, scan the rows of oilslicked breasts the peacock parade on its mating route between towels and bodies. It still surprises Cass, the lack of selfconsciousness on all sides. Bare bosoms are so common that if she rolls sideways on her towel and squints, the beach appears to be strewn with egg cartons, pointy little mounds in all directions. Big ones and small ones, floppy ones and tight little cones. She considers if I took off my top, would Deb be startled Would Leigh And if Tom heard of it A man walks within eight inches of her head, flicking sand in her eyes, and manages to spill beer on Leighs midriff. Leigh sits bolt upright and her splendid bare breasts bounce and quiver. Jeez, sorry. The man squats down, blotting at beerwet skin with his towel. Oh, bugger off, Leigh says without malice. Hey, an accident, swear to God The man turns toward Cass and winks. He has very white teeth and a dimple beside his chin. Cass has an urge to stick out her tongue, throw sand at him maybe, and a simultaneous one to run her fingers down through the hair on his chest, across the flat tanned belly, across the blue lycra welt to that bleat of skin on the inside of his squatting thighs. Baby skin, and she cant take her eyes off it. Shed forgotten this the way sun and salt air and drowsiness and the smell of suntan oil add up to lust. Not lust exactly. More a sort of catholic sensuousness, an erotic languor toward the whole wide world. Got some beer in the Esky, the man says. Wanna join me Sure, Cass murmurs silkily, eyes meeting his. Why not Be right back. Cass stretches like a cat and reaches behind and unhooks her bikini top. She squirts a glob of sunscreen into one palm and rubs it lovingly on her nipples. What the hell are you doing Leigh asks. Whyd you invite that jerk back here Well never get rid of him. Cass smiles. This feels good, very good sun on her white and private breasts, its like losing your virginity again, a lifesaver watching while she massages in the oil, a slow rhythmic caress, autoerotic. Watching herself being watched, she can feel what it was that hooked Narcissus. A married woman Leigh is agitated, Leigh is suddenly and inexplicably angry. A mother Put your clothes back on, were going. Casss eyes go wide. Youve got to be kidding. You think youre funny or something You think youre Then chaos comes in a skirl of sand. First, the Esky man is knocked for a sixer, the blue Esky sails in an arc toward the surf trailing cans of Swan Lager like so many bows on a kite tail. After that, its helterskelter screaming, cursing, an assortment of missiles footballs, cricket bats, a rubber skippingrope, bodies lunging, bodies falling, blood. There are gouts of blood on the sand. Mothers scream and gather up tots and towels, heading for the concrete steps. Cass scoops up Deb and runs to the water. Children cry and dont know if theyre crying from fear or from the sand in their eyes. People wipe their wet faces and find themselves sprinkled with blood. A little further off, a ring of boys gathers to watch and barrack. This is some fight, some thrill. Its wogs The wogs started it. They were bothering a white girl, they threw sand in a white ladys face, they kicked a football right into a little kids head, a little white kid, hes got concussion."

        "text": "TEST REPORT Remingtons 40XB KS Rifle State of the Art Varmint and Benchrest Rig Les ORourke The Remington 40XB varmint and benchrest rifle could easily have deprived me of the pleasures associated with fine tuning a new rifle. The very first centrefire rifle I owned was not a 40XB, but it was chambered for the .222 Remington. I had read about this new super accurate cartridge in the rave reviews of its use on everything from foxes and rabbits to benchrest competition. This was the ultimate in accuracy, a cartridge that could swat flies at a hundred yards. A 10power Weaver scope was fitted to the rifle and it was bore sighted before I drove out to the back paddock, with high expectations and a box of factory rounds to try it out. Leaning out across the bonnet of my 63 Land Rover I proceeded to try to shoot it in. I finally managed to put a round through the target at fifty yards. Trying to shoot a group to adjust the sights, I was lucky to get five shots close enough together to call a group at 100 yards. Eventually, it took tuning, bedding the action, floating the barrel, adjusting the trigger and then resorting to reloading ammo to suit. That first rifle finally did live up to expectations after I carried out all of these tuning steps. Along the way I gained a lot of valuable knowledge and reread a lot of ASJ articles with a little more insight and understanding. If I had first purchased a Remington 40XB none of the above would have happened and I would not have spent the next twentyodd years reloading and fine tuning an array of rifles in many calibres. photo The first group I shot with the 40XB was also over the bonnet of a 4X4, a slightly newer model. I had intended to fireform some of the Remington softpoint 50grain factory rounds supplied so as to reload them later, but as I watched through the 624X Bausch and Lomb scope a cluster of holes hovered around the tip of the 100 yard target. Two things were immediately apparent one, the rifle shot like stink, and two, the optics on the Bausch and Lomb scope were superb. That group measured just under 25mm 1 inch for 10 shots. The rifle had come complete with a Harris bipod attached to the Kevlar reinforced synthetic stock with the trigger set at around 1 12 lbs let off. Topped off with the versatile 624X Bausch and Lomb targetvarmint scope in Redfield mounts it looked as if it was made to create ragged one hole groups and clobber rabbits at long range. It was behaving exactly as it looked even before I had troubled to find a custom load for that particular rifle. The Kevlar stock had a wide flat foreend which was made to sit on a benchrest and the cheekpiece brought the eye into perfect alignment with the scope. I emptied two packets of Remington factory fodder that afternoon and was constantly amazed by how well it grouped. If my first .222 had performed this well out of the box with factory ammo I would not have ventured into reloading at all. There would simply have been no need. The Remington 700 action on which this rifle is based needs no introduction to anyone who has ever considered building a benchrest rifle. It has been a favourite on the line for decades. To dissect the action would be covering old ground it is enough to say that the leading benchrest rifle builders in Australia consider this to be a fine option far an accurate rifle. Then when you consider that the actions used in the top of the range 40XB rifles have been specifically selected for this purpose by the Remington custom shop after careful examination, it is no wonder that they shoot so well. The 690mm 25 stainless steel barrel was a hefty 33mm at the action and barely tapered to 22mm at the muzzle. A righthand twist of 1 in 5, slightly faster than the standard 1 in 14, was found when a rod was pushed through the hammer forged barrel, although the catalogue lists the rifle as having a 1 in 14 twist with the option of a faster 1 in 12 available. This would indicate that perhaps the rifle would readily digest slightly heavier match projectiles than the 52and 53grain ones generally photo caption caption photo available. Although the trigger was adjustable for letoff I did not attempt to change the setting as I saw no reason to do so. It was more than adequate already set at its lowest setting of 1 12 lbs for a varmintcumbenchrester. If I were to use it primarily as a benchrest rifle that would be different. The adjustment screw is easily accessible through the bottom of the stock without removing the action from it. It was a pity, however, that Remington had not actually also provided a hole in the triggerguard so that a straight screwdriver could be used to avoid any possible damage to the adjustment screws head. The weight of the barrel gave the rifle a decidedly unbalanced feel as it easily out weighed the Kevlar stock, making it front heavy. This is not a major factor when you realize that the rifle is not intended to be used offhand, but either from a bench over sandbags or from a field rest such as the supplied Harris bipod. With the bipod removed but the 624X Bausch and Lomb scope in place the rifle weighed 13lbs. Removing the bipod reduced the weight to 12 14 lbs. The stock alone weighed 2 14 lbs. The factory average for these rifles is 10 14 lbs. If used as a benchrest rifle, this weight would automatically put it in the heavy varmint class. I could see little chance of lowering the weight except by having the barrel shortened and fluted as well as removing the five shot magazine. Removing the magazine well and sleeving the action is an option I would give some serious thought to as I dont feel the need for a magazine on a varmint rifle and especially a benchrest rifle. This operation would also add greater rigidity to the action and possibly increase its accuracy potential. First thing I did on arriving home after that first informal session was to pull ten of the Remington 50grain softpoint rounds and try to find out what was making them tick so well. They were loaded with a spherical powder and the charge in the ten rounds only varied by .25 grains, the average being 52 grains. Whatever the powder was it performed very well. The primers were the standard Remington 6 12, not the 7 12 match. My immediate impulse was to try the WW748 powder in the fired cases and see if the results would be the same. Various loads were tried and I had to increase the load to 26 grains with the Sierra 52grain match projectiles before the groups began to shrink. Although I stopped at this load, the rifle was not showing signs of pressure and I feel that a further reduction in group size could have been obtained by going to 5 or 27 grains of These loads are listed as maximum in most loading manuals and should be approached carefully. photo caption I do not advise they be used as a starting point. Safe they may be in this rifle but a change in case or primer could lead to dangerous overloads. The 26 grains of WW748 ignited by Remington 7 12 match primers put ten Sierra 52grain HPBT Match projectiles into .734 at 100 yards while shooting in what could best be described as gusty conditions. Before the wind came up I had managed to fire two tenshot groups using Remington factory ammo from the bench. The first of these was shot with 50grain soft point loads and put nine shots into .436 with a flier bringing the group to .672 and I dont mind admitting that I was responsible for the flier, not the rifle. The second group was shot using the 50grain PowerLokt HP fodder, which blew out to .736 for ten shots impressive, but not as good as the softpoint. No group fired at any time, no matter what the combination used, was over .9 Having tried 748 first, I then turned to my old favourites IMR4198, IMR4895 and Reloader Each powder was loaded using previously tried and tested loads that had worked well in many of my .222s over the years. All of the projectiles were seated out just to touch the lands and then backed off .01. This gave an overall length of 200 and still allowed the cartridges to be worked through the fiveshot magazine. A single shot version of the 40X can be had with a solid receiver if you wish. Every charge was fired for groups of ten shots after two barrel warmers. The barrel was then cleaned after each string using Bisley Bore Solvent and swabbed out before the next string. The day the tests were carried out was a cool 15 degrees with a righthand cross wind that was mainly consistent but occasionally gusted and swung around to blow from the front. Of the loads tried the best effort for ten shots was achieved using 24 grains of IMR4895 which produced a group of .574. Further tuning in charge and seating depths could easily improve this result. Next in line was 21 grains of IMRThis clustered nine shots into a group of .690 with obvious signs of the light 52grain projectiles lifting in a head wind and a nominated flier spoiling the group. The Reloader 7 charge was used in two fiveshot groups by two of the Little River benchrest shooters, who were keen to try out the rifle. Serge Preradovic and Jack Hurst had first been attracted to the rifle after seeing the two groups I had shot with the Remington factory rounds. Serge then proceeded to shoot a .326 group using the Reloader 7 charge of 19 grains behind the Sierra 52grain pill despite the heavy trigger compared to his 2 oz match rifles trigger. Jack planted a .75 group while coming to terms with the heavier trigger. Serge and Jack then sat down and using the remaining softpoint factory rounds posted some very small fiveshot groups, the smallest measuring .376 and none larger that .72, all shot in gusty conditions as the day deteriorated. With the last four remaining softpoint cartridges Serge pulled out all stops and watching the flags carefully posted a two hole group that measured .213. These benchresters were not too happy to have the rifle taken away and packed in its case at the end of the day. The standard .222, with its case design now almost obsolete as far as the benchrest fraternity is concerned, had made quite an impact on these two who usually shoot custom built 6mm PPC rifles fed specially selected components. Recommended retail for the 40XB KS in the repeater model is 2750 and 2550 in the single shot version. When you realise that this is a fully custom made rifle guaranteed to shoot .5 groups in this chambering, it is not really a lot of money. It is available in all of the standard varmint calibres as well as the popular 6mm and 7mm BR Remington rounds. It can also be ordered in a range of larger calibres such as .2506, .308 Win, .3006 and even .300 Win Mag. When you look at what it can cost to tune a varmint weight factory rifle to this degree with the possibility of having to change the trigger for a better one, and add a more stable stock of fibreglass or Kevlar, and take into account gunsmithing costs, what may seem a cheap alternative can wind up costing as much. Each of these rifles is not a product of the normal assembly line but is turned out by hand from selected materials in Remingtons custom shop."

        "text": "CLOUD STREET Tim Winton Through the crowd she sees the bloke leaning on the first pillar above the post office steps, and her first impulse is to go on ahead and buy those salmon and onion sandwiches at Coles and forget the whole flamin thing. Hes not bad looking. Good suit, nice pair of shoes. Glasses, though he doesnt seem the squinty, limp type. Hatless. A bit of an individual, it seems. Shes too nervous for this. Whats a bloke like that want with a shopgirl like her Hes no run of the mill lair. Hes the sort of man you pray will come out of the smoky gloom and ask you for a dance. Rose wheels back for another look and finds herself going up the steps. Now or never, Rosie. When she gets to him, his eyebrows rise and Rose feels herself being given the onceover. Before he can, she gets the first word in. Gday, Earl. Havent strained yourself, have you He smiles indulgently. Hello. I thought youd be a looker. Boom goes Roses heart. They stand there a full moment in the spring sunshine with people coming and going around them, posties wheeling past on their heavy old PMG bikes. You hungry Rose asks. I am. Yes, yes, lets get a bite. They wind up at the sandwich counter in Coles and Rose forgoes the salmon and onion. They eat and Rose swings on her stool like a girl, waiting. This bloke seems different to men shes known. Theres no big talk, no flashing of money, no nervous guffaws. Ill guess and you tell me how close I am, he said, wiping his fingers on greaseproof paper. You left school at fifteen. Your dad votes Labor, you play netball, youd like to be a lawyers secretary and you sleep with your socks on. Rose smiles and knows whatever she says will sound stupid. Patchy, she says, but boring enough to get me right. Whats your name Rosemary. Rose. Yes, she says relieved. What a talker. You need the switchboard between us, do you, before you can really fire I spose Im used to it. I suddenly dont know what to talk about. Football The common cold Just ask me out, she says. Lets go out together. Friday. Youre a reporter, she says. You went to uni, your parents live in Nedlands and youve tried to teach yourself to talk like one of us. Us Friday, she says. Meet me at Shenton Park station. Seven oclock. Bye. She slides off her stool, minding her stockings. She steps out into the sunshine and has to concentrate to find her way back to work, though its barely a block away and shes walked it every lunch hour for years. Well, she thinks, hardly believing her cool delivery. Well. She wondered about her guess. A reporter Yes, shed seen those blokes around. Fast movers, funny, sharp, always asking and watching. Yes, hed be right there in the thick of it. Hed know politicians and criminals. Hed be a mover and shaker. Well, well. Toby Raven At sixthirty that Friday, Rose was waiting outside the Shenton Park station. He lurched up in a Morris Oxford and nearly took her left hip from its moorings. The first thing she learnt about Toby Raven was that he couldnt exactly drive. He made his way, but thats the best you could call it. Rose climbed in, suddenly twice as nervous, and they hopped away. Well, well, he murmured, smiling widely at her after a few moments. Hello, said Rose. Hello. Toby sent the car in a swoon towards the kerb and Rose prayed that he would never again feel moved to take his eyes off the road. Itd taken all afternoon to dress for this, and she could barely move for starch with her nervousness turning so quickly to naked fear, the sweat on her steamed up the tulle and the car began to smell like a laundry. She pulled the wrinkles out of her gloves and tried not to ruin her lipstick with gnashing as they drove beneath the long shadow of Kings Park and beside the river reclamation to the lights of the city centre. Gawd, she thought, this should be a fabulous feeling cruising with a beau if only a girl wasnt afraid of dying. She sat back as Toby swooped and swerved, grunted and grated, and took deep breaths as the colours of the city broke over her she did a real job of seeming perfectly serene. They passed through the high class end of town with its grand hotels and ballrooms to cross the railway bridge into shabby streets and boozers parks. Toby wedged the car up on a kerb with a thud that nearly put Roses head through the roof. He sighed triumphantly. Lets go in. Rose couldnt see anywhere likely to be an eating establishment. There were shopfronts, houses, shadowy doorways. She got out and smelled garlic. Youve gone to a lot of trouble, Toby said beside her. It was hard to tell what he meant, but she smoothed her great full skirt graciously all the same. He led her to a narrow doorway where a big, bumperbreasted woman met them and took them down to a crowded, smoky room full of tables, chairs, tablecloths, candles, laughing people, chinking glass and cutlery. Great vats of spaghetti were carried past by boys, and jugs of wine that reminded Rose of nosebleeds. People seemed to be speaking all kinds of languages, and some seemed to know Toby. They sat at a small waxspattered table, and bread was brought. It wasnt exactly the dining room at the Palace Hotel. Where are we she said, trying to look pleased. Marias. This is where the real people come. Rose felt her cheeks glowing. Beaut How do you like your spaghetti Oh, she huffed, like my tea as it comes. He laughed. Youre not about to let me go on that tea business are you Listen, she owned up, I dont know a thing about spaghetti. Or the real people. Ill just have whatever you reckon. Two carbonaras, he told the boy. And a jug. Do you come here a lot Yes, all the time. Terrific place. Its a hideaway for those in the know, you might say. We all come here. Makes a bit of a change from the old mutton and boiled veg. Toby smiled at someone over Roses shoulder and now and then she sensed an eyebrow raised. You know all these people I know who they are and they know who I am. Some of us are friends, associates, old flames. Im clubbish, youd have to say its my last concession to a bourgeois past. Rose tried not to panic. You okay Rose strangled out a yes. Youre not nervous Dont be nervous. Im quite safe, you know. Not respectable but I am able to restrain myself with a lady. Rose smiled. She ran her fingers along the checked tablecloth. What are you thinking You want to go home Were different, said Rose. You dont know a thing about me he protested gaily. Then tell me. What do you do Is a man only what he does No, Rose said, only what he is, I spose. Well, Rose, youre dead right. Im a hack. A journalist on the Daily. I is probably what I does. Youve been to university, or something, havent you Ah, sharp lady. See, were different. So what Rose smiled. You write, then Well, you couldnt call what I do writing, though I do scribble a bit in my own time. Do you read Yes, she said breathlessly, I read. Thank God. Thank Jesus, Mary and Josephus, she reads Rose, youre a lovely girl. The moment I heard your snooty twang on the phone I knew it was love. See, were not so different. Rose laughed. Toby was so confident, his face so full of mad expression, his hands seemed to crackle with animation. He fitted the din and swirl of this place. The spaghetti came with wine and salad. Rose hadnt eaten since breakfast, so she went to work. It was like eating kite string but the wine soon took the awkwardness out of it. Tell me who you read, he said with a lump of cheese camping on his chin. Oh, Gawd. Dont be shy. I love books. My rooms is full of them. I read the whole Geraldton library endtoend when I was a kid. Name some names. But Rose didnt know names, she only remembered stories. You name some, she said. Toby grinned, closed his eyes Hammett, Steinbeck, Hemingway, James Jones, Mailer, D. H. Lawrence. Xavier Herbert, Sillitoe, Camusdotted line She let him go on and on in a winy whirl as people brushed by with friendly nods and vats of red sauce. Their duffle coats and minks flapped, their pockets jingled, their laughter blanketed Rose Pickles in, warm as all getout. Rose had enough wine in her to keep calm as they jerked their way through the traffic to the Esplanade. The lights of the river seemed more beautiful than shed seen them. The palm trees along the foreshore cast weird silhouettes. One of the worlds strangest towns, said Toby, aiming them down Riverside Drive. I wouldnt know, said Rose. Perth is the biggest country town in the world trying to be a city. The most isolated country town in the world trying to be the most cutoff city in the world, trying desperately to hit the big time. Desert on one side, sea on the other. Philistine fairground. Theres something nesting here, something horrible waiting. Ambition, Rose. It squeezes us into corners and turns out ugly shapes. You must see a lot of things, said Rose, hating herself for sounding so wideeyed. Too many things. Rose thought of morgues, cells, the steps of aeroplanes, the flash of camera bulbs. Her world was mundane and domestic in the high times. In the low times dotted line she couldnt even think of those times. The night wasnt big enough for all those feelings. Toby jacknifed the Morris into a carpark across the river from Crawley. The university clock was lit and it stood above the trees, the lamps, the water. Thats nice, she said. No, he murmured. This is nice. Rose took the kiss and was surprised at how soft his skin was. She slid in close to him. Nice is a terrible, bourgeois word, said Toby catching a breath. Whatever, said Rose, whatever. She loved the smooching sound of the upholstery. She stopped being kissed and started kissing. She held his head, felt his hands on her back, in her hair. Just switching you through, she murmured, trying not to giggle. Rose Pickles, he said. His hand was between her breasts and she left it there as the river went by and by. Oh, Rose, you loved me. How you did. And there you go drifting by with the river, out on an eddy in a black, shiny Morris Oxford with a man who quotes D.H. Lawrence with his tongue in your ear and cheese on his chin. How you longed, how you stared at me those thundery nights when we all tossed and the house refused to sleep. Its gone for you now, but for me the water backs into itself, comes around, joins up in the great, wide, vibrating space where everything that was and will be still is. For me, for all of us sooner or later, all of it will always be. And some of you will be forever watching me on the landing. Back at his flat, Rose falls on the bed thinking dammitall Im twentyfour years old, as her acre of tulle comes away and his hands run down her legs to peel her stockings I want him. She feels the air cool on her shins and draws him down. He slides into her and its as hard as the recesses of her heart and wonderful, only unlike Rose Pickles heart it stops beating and lurching and loses its steel and lets her down into a sad melancholy quiet."

        "text": "Turn to Question 12 or read on for more information Trading stock Broadly, trading stock is anything you have on hand which you produced, manufactured, acquired or purchased for the purpose of sale, manufacture or exchange. For example, trading stock includes livestock but not working animals except those used by a primary producer crops, timber, etc. when harvested and wool once removed from the sheep. Manufacturers must include as trading stock the value of partly manufactured goods and materials on hand. For more details about what constitutes trading stock, please contact the Tax Office. You can choose one of the following three methods to value your trading stock a cost price based on full absorption costing, b market selling value, or c replacement price. Where the value of the trading stock is less than the value of a, b or c above due to obsolescence or other special circumstances, you have to notify the Commissioner that you have elected to use the lower valuation by answering the question at Item 59 on page You may use different methods for each item of trading stock in different years, or for different items in the same year. However, the opening value of each item in a particular year must be the same as the closing value for that item in the previous year. Prescribed payments income Do not include copies of your payment summaries with your tax return. However, you should keep them for five years. If you held a Deduction Variation Certificate NAT 755 or a Deduction Exemption Certificate NAT 754 during the year, keep it too. The Tax Office may ask you for any of these later. Gross income and tax deducted should always be included in the return. These amounts are shown on the payment summary form, which each of your payers is required to send to you by 14th July of each year. When you receive your payment summaries, check that they are correct before totalling the gross income and tax deducted. If you received a payment and did not receive or have lost the payment summary, you should contact the payer and ask for a copy. Payers are required to report to the Tax Office details of prescribed payments made. Payers must also report the amount of tax taken out of these payments. This information is crosschecked with your tax return to ensure that the correct amount has been declared. If you do not declare all your income or do not claim the correct amount of tax taken out of these payments, you may have to pay more tax or face prosecution. Make sure that you declare all your income. Superannuation Employers are entitled to a deduction for contributions made to a superannuation, provident, benefit or retirement fund for the benefit of eligible employees or their dependants. The purpose of the contributions must be to make provision for individual personal benefits, pensions or retiring allowances. The deduction is allowable in the year of income in which the contributions were made. A deduction for contributions by an employer is available for more than two funds until 30 June 1994 provided one of the funds was established before 1 July 1990 and the fund is a statutory fund. The deduction applies whether or not the fund to which the contributions are paid is a complying fund, that is, whether or not the fund itself is entitled to concessional tax treatment. From 1 July 1988, there is no limit on the amount of deductible contributions, except that an employer contributing to a complying fund in respect of an employee, is effectively limited to the amount which is necessary to provide benefits for the employee within the reasonable benefits limits. Depreciation rates An item of depreciable plant acquired on or after 1 July 1991 that has an initial cost of 300 or less, or an effective life of less than three years, is entitled to 100 depreciation. From 1 July 1991, taxpayers are permitted to selfassess the effective life of their depreciable plants acquired after 12 March 1991, having regard to their particular circumstances of use. Alternatively, taxpayers may elect to use the Commissioners published determination of effective lives. Effective life means the period during which an item of plant can reasonably be expected to be used for income producing purposes by the taxpayer or any other person based on the taxpayers circumstances of use. If you choose to estimate the plants effective life at the time it was first used for income producing purposes or installed ready to use, you will need to take into account both the known circumstances of use of the item and circumstances that can reasonably be expected to arise. The details as to why a particular effective life was used should be retained. If you elect to use the Commissioners published determination of effective life, the applicable rate depends on the time the plant was acquired. Plant acquired before 27 February 1992 For the 199192 income year, seven broadbanded rates can be used 33 13, 20, 15, 10, 7 12, 5 or 2 12. If the basic rate i.e. effective life divided into 100 is not one of the broadbanded rates, the plant may be depreciated at the next highest broadbanded rate. For example, an item with an effective life of eight years would have a basic rate of 12 12 which would be broadbanded to 15. Broadbanding applies to all assets other than works of art and plant depreciable under a special depreciation regime. The broadbanded rates can be increased by a loading of 20 for all depreciable items other than motor vehicles. Plant acquired after 26 February 1992 A new rate schedule applies in respect of depreciable plant either acquired under a contract entered into after 26 February 1992 or which was commenced to be constructed after that date. The new schedule does not apply to works of art, passenger motor vehicles and similar vehicles such as station wagons etc. designed to carry less than nine people. These will continue to be depreciable under the pre 27 February 1992 rules. The new general rates are as follows Years in effective life Annual depreciation percentage Diminishing value Prime cost Less than 3 Immediate Immediate 3 to less than 5 60 40 5 to less than 6 23 40 27 6 23 to less than 10 30 20 10 to less than 13 25 17 13 to less than 30 20 13 30 and over 10 7 For more information, contact the Tax Office or obtain a copy of The Depreciation Guide NAT 1996 from any Tax Office. Taxation Ruling IT 2685 containing the broadbanded rates of depreciation can be purchased from any Tax Office. Holders of Crown leases who incur capital expenditure after 26 February 1992 in installing incomeproducing depreciable property on the land will be entitled to depreciation deductions. Contact any Tax Office for further details. Calculation methods Depreciation is calculated by the diminishing value method or the prime cost method. Plant is depreciated using the diminishing value method unless you elect to use the prime cost method. Where you decide to use the prime cost method, you should record that you have made this decision. You should retain this record so that you can make it available to the Tax Office on request. The method you choose will apply for the useful life of the plant or until it is disposed of, scrapped or destroyed. You should make a decision for any plant that is depreciated for the first time in this financial year. You have to choose the same method for all plant acquired in a particular year after 25 May If the plant is sold, the purchaser does not have to adopt the sellers depreciation method. The purchaser can choose one of the above methods. Depreciation of motor vehicles For motor vehicles and station wagons including four wheel drive vehicles first used during the financial year, the maximum amount on which you can calculate depreciation is 48,Depreciation on certain motor vehicles falls under the substantiation rules. For these motor vehicles you must provide proof of cost if they were bought after 30 June Partial use for income production In depreciating property that is only partly used to produce assessable income, you must claim the percentage that is the business proportion. Partyear use of property Where property used to produce assessable income was purchased during the year, the depreciation deduction must be worked out for the time you owned it. For example, if incomeproducing property was purchased on 1 October 1993 for 15,000, the depreciation allowable would be calculated as follows 15,000 x depreciation rate x 273 Disposal, loss or destruction of plant or motor vehicle When plant or a motor vehicle used only for your business is disposed of, lost or destroyed, and the depreciated value is greater than the consideration received, the difference between its depreciated value and the consideration received is deductible. If the consideration received is more than the depreciated value, the excess up to the amount of depreciation allowed on the plant or motor vehicle must be included in the assessable income and shown at total business income. Alternatively, you can reduce the depreciated value of plant or motor vehicle you acquired in that year or, if no plant was acquired that year, you can reduce the written down value of any existing plant. If you want to take advantage of these provisions, your records must clearly show how the excess was applied against the cost of replacement plant or motor vehicle. Where plant or a motor vehicle is only partly used to produce assessable income the calculations are different. You should contact your local Tax Office so they can help you work out if you should claim a deduction or include an amount of assessable income. NOTE If plant was acquired after 19 September 1985 and the consideration received was greater than the original purchase price you may be subject to capital gains tax. Refer to Question 13 on page 56 to find out. Depreciation claims When claiming a deduction for depreciation you must keep for five years the information shown on the Depreciation Schedule on the next page. Prepaid expenses A deduction for business expenses paid in advance for services must be apportioned over the period during which those services are to be provided, subject to a maximum writeoff period of 10 years. However, those rules do not apply if bullet the payment is made under an agreement entered into before 26 May 1988 or bullet the services will be wholly provided within 13 months of the date the payment is made or bullet the payment is made under any law or by order of a court or bullet the payment is less than 1000 or bullet the payment is for salary or wages. Entertainment expenses Entertainment expenses are not deductible except in very limited circumstances. If you are claiming entertainment expenses, keep full details of the circumstances in case we need more information later. Home office expenses If part of your home is used for income producing activities, some of the expenses you incur in respect of the home may be partly deductible. Where part of your home qualifies as a place of business, expenses which may be partly deductible include occupancy expenses rent, mortgage interest, rates and house and contents insurance and running expenses electricity, cleaning, depreciation, leasing charges and repairs to furniture and furnishings in the office. You should apportion expenses on a floor area basis and, if the area of the home is a place of business for only part of the year, a time basis. Where part of your home is used as a home office but it does not qualify as a place of business, only the additional running expenses you incur may be partly deductible. Refer to Taxation Ruling 9330 or contact any Tax Office for further details. Research and development expenditure If you have costs for research and development, you will need to refer to The 1994 Form C Instructions NAT 669 which are available from all Tax Offices. Environmental impact study expenditure You can write off the costs incurred after 11 March 1991 for evaluating the environmental imapct of an incomeproducing project of yours. The period for writeoff is the lesser of bullet 10 years or bullet the expected life of the project to which the evaluation relates."

        "text": "An elusive export culture WHEN major economic reports are issued there is a tendency to anticipate too much and, in policy terms, do very little. Often the recommendations are predictable and critics declare the report full of motherhood proposals. Or the scope and ambition of the study is so grand as to invite the pretentious label blueprint. The report Emerging Exporters issued yesterday, could easily fall into those categories. Yet the study also presents many opportunities. Nimble companies and shrewd policymakers will not be surprised by the results. In any case, the work by consultant McKinsey and the Australian Manufacturing Council provides a thorough analysis of the challenges ahead for local firms and the nation in the quest to build a pervasive export culture. One of the few bright spots during the recession was the stunning success of manufactured exports. The report identifies 700 or so emerging exporters producing socalled elaborately transformed manufactures. These small to mediumsized firms are operating across a broad range of industry sectors and expect to continue their good performance during the 1990s. One quarter of these companies are born global. This is 75 per cent of their sales are overseas. The majority of these emerging exporters, however, are mainly domestic producers only 20 per cent of sales are exports. In general, these successful companies share common features a vision and commitment to exports a focus on quality, technology and design strong customer orientation proximity to Asia and some foreign ownership. But the study also identifies a number of inhibiting factors, perhaps most tellingly the availability of finance. The major banks seem unwilling to deal with these highrisk exporters. As well, improvement is needed in the areas of marketing, management skills, image and market access. The report argues that while government microeconomic reforms have led to cost reductions for business, more needs to be done. Industry policy needs to be more active, they argue, giving a hand up to exporters. There is plenty of room for governments to improve business conditions particularly for exporters but they should reject any variety of the picking winners agenda. Past policies such as lowering tariffs, faster paced structural change particularly in the labour market and stable macroeconomic conditions maintaining low inflation have certainly helped. Still, there is a strong case for enhancing the competitive position of individual companies. There is scope to improve the effectiveness of bodies such as Austrade and the links between research bodies and industry. But rather than spending more money on export assistance programs, these measures could be streamlined and better targeted. Economic policies should address the needs of these leadingedge smaller companies. As the report argues, there should be more interaction between exporters and the bureaucracy, especially in easing the barriers to entry to Asian markets. The solution lies not so much in government but in leadership, commitment and quality of management. As the report found, 90 per cent of Australian manufacturers do not export, even though many have the potential to do so. There is much work to be done in changing the attitude of business leaders and the wider community. As the report confirms, there are signs of an emerging export culture in Australia. But unless the focus of managers, unions, workers and governments is on world best practice, international competitiveness and the global marketplace, the nations full potential will remain elusive. Touch of realism in waste debate WITH about 100,000 tonnes of intractable waste in storage, diminished government interest in building a hightemperature incinerator to dispose of it and a ban on exporting it to countries willing to burn it for us, is it possible the town of Mt Isa could come to the rescue The mayor of the northwest Queensland mining town, Mr Ron McCullough, has offered sites in the semiarid region near Mt Isa for the storage and possible disposal of nuclear and other toxic wastes. He believes a comprehensive industry based on getting rid of the waste no one else wants to know about could employ up to 200 people and attract new industry to his town. Not only that, he wants the worst of the wastes the nastier the better because there is more money to be earned in tackling them. Despite some discouragement from federal authorities, Mr McCulloughs proposal deserves to be seriously considered. Transport and costeffectiveness will have to be examined and the mayor also needs to be sure of hisconstituents support. Some years ago, when the mayors of one or two NSW towns were attracted to having a jobs and incomeearning incinerator in their shires, they were disobliged when their townspeople found out and raised public opposition. Mr McCullough has judged his communitys more favourable attitude on the basis that minimal concern has been expressed since his proposal was made public more than six months ago. The Federal Governments policy on intractable waste is to keep it in storage until acceptable technologies are developed to dispose of it. This is in line with the stand taken by Greenpeace, which staged protests around the world last year against a shipment of Australian waste sent to France for incineration. It means large quantities of waste have to be stored in unsafe or otherwise inadequate conditions. The longer that continues, the greater the danger of contamination from leakage. Yet the Government is stuck with its policy. Last November, based on the report of a committee canvassing options for disposing of intractable waste, the federal Minister for the Environment, Mrs Kelly, ruled out building an incinerator. She preferred the concept of superior technologies to get rid of PCBs, CFCs and other intractable chemicals. The trouble is, those technologies are still uncertain. Last week Mrs Kelly reiterated a temporary export ban by declining a permit for 1000 tonnes of PCBs to be sent to France for incineration. She said countries everywhere were coming to accept they should dispose of their wastes within their own borders. That is where things stand unresolved, and likely to stay so indefinitely, unless the Mt Isa offer gains support. Legitimacy in human rights role HUMAN rights issues have become almost as integral a part of bilateral relations between nations as trade or tourism. Australia, the United States and other nations whose people enjoy basic personal freedoms have a duty to keep it so. To fall silent about human rights would be to give up some of our own freedoms. In Vienna yesterday, Chinas Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Liu Huaqui, criticised Western nations for asserting to impose their human rights standards on the rest of the world. The theme of cultural separatism is a familiar one in the developing world, particularly in Asia. The premise is that countries are shaped by different cultures and it is natural they have their own, varied, governing standards. It is therefore unnatural and alien to apply Western standards to nonWestern nations. This is reasonable as far as it goes. However, it tends to ignore that it is in the nature of nations to interact with one another. Open societies like Australias have, as an inherent part of their openness, an interest and concern about what is happening in the world. If we discover something we abhor, it is in our nature to say so. This is not to say Australia or any other country should be constantly banging the human rights drum. Sometimes the effective way to reduce or remove abuses is to make a point quietly and resist the temptation to publicise successes. In his speech to the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights, Mr Liu described the Western practice of speaking out against human rights abuse as being tantamount to an infringement of sovereignty. With some candour, he said accusations on human rights went beyond simple interference in a nations internal affairs. They also could result in political instability and social unrest inside the accused nation. No one, he added, should be allowed to use the human rights issue to exert political and economic pressures. Mr Lius speech places China in opposition to the view of most nations attending the UN conference. Even Russia now accepts the validity of nations to speak out about human rights abuses. However, Mr Liu correctly stressed the importance of economic development as a means for improving internal standards. Prosperity is a powerful incentive. It encourages people to work hard for peace, stability and freedom. But Mr Liu made a lopsided argument of it when he demanded the people be absolutely subservient to the economic machine and its rulers, and said Nobody shall place his own rights and interests above those of the State and society. Like Mr Liu, the Indonesian Foreign Minister, Mr Ali Alatas, said human rights should not be conditionally linked to economic and development aid. The US Secretary of State, Mr Warren Christopher, disagreed. He said countries found violating human rights should face sanctions and be denied aid and investment. But as the Dalai Lama pointed out when, to Chinas annoyance, he was permitted to attend part of the conference, there does not have to be a contradiction between the need for economic development and the need to respect human rights. Economic leverage cannot be ruled out if it is the only way to make a country treat its people better. Neither should it be wantonly employed. The inclusion of human rights on the bilateral agenda does not mean movement there has to be harnessed to movement on other issues. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, is right to insist the human rights lever be a flexible one, employed on a casebycase basis. Putting violence in perspective THE GovernorGeneral, Mr Bill Hayden, offered no apology for his forthright opinion that women must share the blame for the high incidences of violence, especially against children and in the home. Speaking at the Second National Conference on Violence in Canberra, he asserted Most men are not waging a war against women. In fact, they were as appalled by violence as women were and were not given to it as a gender group. Predictably, there has been a strong reaction to Mr Haydens remarks. But it deserves dispassionate analysis. The GovernorGeneral is not usually given to intemperate remarks. He has often expressed his opinions, sometimes with vehemence. These latest remarks were courageous and timely. It is not fashionable or popular to suggest that both sexes share similar responsibility when it comes to problems of violence. No one questions the need for feminist activism to change the subservient status to which Australian women have been subjected. But statistics on violence demonstrate this does not mean all violence can be sheeted home to men. In fact, the incidence of physical abuse of children by women in NSW outstrips that by men by 10 per cent. So the justice women properly expect from men must be part of a total program of equity. Gender conflict for its own sake is counterproductive and sensational media reporting to fulfil a premeditated ideological position can only do harm. It also should be remembered the GovernorGeneral has experiential and academic training in the field of law enforcement. He once walked the policemans beat and knew the problems of domestic violence at first hand. It is a lesson he has obviously not forgotten. He is not only vitally interested in the human condition but thoughtful and active about its improvement. If his words act as a corrective to the femalevictim maleculprit scenario often portrayed in parts of the media, he will have elevated the debate on violence above the mere namecalling to which it has sometimes descended. There will probably be as strong a reaction to his remarks on the media. He believes there have been instances of a glorification of violence that have been unhelpful, even dangerous. But his appreciation of the role of the journalist has been a significant element in his work as GovernorGeneral. Having a friendatcourt will do no harm if the criticism is accepted in the manner in which it has been given."

        "text": "Ozone dangers The hole in the ozone layer isnt just a news headline. It could have farreaching effects on our health by Allison Tait The ozone layer. It was the cause celebre of the late 1980s. Yes, youve heard all about it to the point of saturation in some cases and you know that the hole in the allimportant ozone contributes to the greenhouse effect but do you know what effect its having on you Concern for the ozone layer first surfaced in the early 1970s when it was realised human activities were increasing the concentration of ozonedestroying substances in the stratosphere. The ozone layer made headlines in 1985 with the discovery of a hole over Antarctica. By 1987 this hole was the size of the United States and Mexico combined. The ozone layer itself is the result of a chemical reaction between the suns rays and oxygen. The ozone levels in the atmosphere change naturally. Seasons of the year, latitude, night and day and possibly the sun cycle affect the atmospheric ozone. However, as this layer shields the earth from the suns radiation, ozone layer depletion on a large scale is cause for concern. According to a report published in 1989 by the National Health and Medical Research Council NHMRC A reduction in the level of ozone in the earths atmosphere is a threat to human health. Ozone absorbs ultraviolet radiation a decrease in the abundance of stratospheric ozone will lead to an increase in the amount of ultraviolet radiation reaching the earths surface. Increases in the incidence of skin cancer and some eye diseases cataract, pterygium and damage to peoples immunological systems are likely results of decreased ozone. Cause for concern indeed Health dangers The most commonly encountered effect of ultraviolet radiation is sunburn. The longterm effects of chronic exposure of skin to solar radiation include skin cancer and accelerated ageing of the skin. Australia already has the highest recorded rate of skin cancer in the world. Add to this the fact that we are among the closest to an ozone hole there are now two, one over each pole, take into account the increased radiation and you understand the health risk involved with the destruction of ozone. Apparently, for every one per cent decrease in ozone, theres a two per cent rise in UV levels. In Australia, this could mean an extra 5000 nonmelanoma and 100 more melanoma skin cancers every year. Of course, these figures could change considerably if current attitudes towards skin protection change. The most effective form of protection is to stay right out of the sun, but in many cases this is impossible. Proper precautions must be taken when venturing into the sun stay in the shade between 11 am and 3 pm, when the sun is at its strongest, always wear a sunscreen preferably one with a sun protection factor SPF of 15, and when in the sun protect your skin with a hat and shirt. With a little care and thought, the extra UV radiation beaming through the depleted ozone layer need not be a problem for your skin. The second major problem resulting from increased UV radiation is eye damage. The most common eye diseases caused by UV radiation are conjunctivitis pterygium, a complaint due to reflective light where the membrane covering the eyeball thickens and senile cataracts, the partial or complete opacity of the lens of the eye. It has also been found that some drugs and chemicals contain photosensitising agents which absorb light and undergo photochemical reactions when exposed to excessive UV radiation. These can increase the harmful effects of sunlight on the eye. Some oral contraceptives fall under this category. Once again, there are protective measures that can be taken to ensure the eye is not overexposed to UV radiation. Sunglasses that comply with Australian safety standards should be worn at all times when out in bright sunlight. It is important that these glasses have UV filtration qualities. The third effect that the depletion of the ozone layer brings is little known to many Australians. Possible interference with the human immune system is a problem that may have longterm effects on the health of Australians in general. Evidence that UV radiation affects the immune response of cells in the skin so far rests on animal experiments. Exposure to current levels of solar or artificial UV radiation can result in mild to moderate degrees of immunodeficiency within the immune system and within the skin itself. Future increases in UV radiation, especially UVB radiation, might produce an increase in both the severity and the incidence of the problem. UV may act as a trigger for any virus lying latent in the cells. Increases in immunodeficiency could see an increase in cancer and fungal infections. Once again it is important to remain out of the sun as much as possible, and to take the correct preventive measures when out. The ozone layer is vital for our planet. While it is uncertain that its depletion can ever be rectified, it is important that we all become aware of our actions, both for the environment, and for our own health. It is not necessary to become a hermit who never ventures outside. Just remember to take the proper precautions when enjoying the great outdoors. Antibiotics some alarming facts While antibiotics can save lives, the indiscriminate and inappropriate use of them poses serious longterm threats to our health People, on the whole, have got so used to going to a doctor and getting a pill to fix whatever is wrong that many feel cheated if they go and are not given a prescription. Even if you go to the doctor with a cold, flu or virus you probably expect to be given something. This attitude, combined with the rapidly growing array of antibiotics that are available, plus our belief apparently growing at an equally rapid rate that our bodies are unable to fight any infection and that all infections are bad for you and potentially overwhelming, has combined to make antibiotic use so common that it is rare to find a patient who has not been given antibiotics several times in her life. Sadly, even little children and babies are being given them at the tiniest sign of infection. There is a further disturbing scenario. Not only are antibiotics being given to kill off the bacteria that may be causing the infection, they are also being given on a supposedly preventative basis something for which they were never initially intended and for which they are poorly suited. They are also being given for viral infections, for which they can do no possible good since they only act on living hence antibio or biological life things and a virus is not a living thing. This is sometimes justified on the basis of speculations like Well, there might be a bacterial infection there too, yet without any tests being given to establish this or to prevent a bacterial infection on top of the viral infection Though which infection, and therefore which antibiotic, is never specified. However did we live, only a few short years ago, without this array of medication Yet many of you will, in fact, have survived childhood very well without them, particularly if you have a few decades under your belt. I know I did. It would seem, therefore, timely to consider the possible harm, as well as the benefits, that these antibiotics could be doing to you and how you could survive, every bit as well, and possibly better, without them. To finish on a positive note we will look at the practical alternatives you can utilise. Not all bad Antibiotics are not all bad. Their discovery enabled practitioners to help patients with certain serious and possibly lifethreatening infections. It is their overuse that is the problem. As more and more antibiotics are being used with increasing frequency, they are killing off the gentler bacteria and allowing more virulent forms the ones that survive the antibiotic onslaught to flourish. This then creates a need for new and stronger antibiotics which kill off the weaker relatively speaking of the remaining bacteria, allowing the very resistant ones to flourish and so on. In time we could well find that the remaining highlyresistant bacteria are the ones that can overcome our immune systems and for which we cannot develop effective antibiotics. From birth Initially the individual has a sterile gut. From birth onwards, the bacteria on the skin and along the internal mucosal membranes builds up. Similarly, there is only a small number of antibodies for defense and the immune system is poorly developed. Part of the development of the protective immune system comes from antibodies received in the mothers breast milk. Other antibodies develop as a response to the various bacterial challenges that occur. Each new disease, and its associated microorganisms, stimulates the production of more antibodies to fight the disease and defend the individual, thus further strengthening the immune system. Giving antibiotics at this stage in life does nothing to improve or strengthen the immune system and may do it considerable harm. Digestive tract One of the first problems that result from antibiotic use, whether it be in infants, children or adults, comes as a result of their effect on the microorganisms in the digestive tract. All too often the good and helpful bacteria the ones that you want to be there for many reasons are killed off by the antibiotic. These good organisms assist in the digestive processes they produce a number of important nutrients, including many B vitamins and vitamin K, and they take up space and thus help to keep out the pathogens, the harmful bacteria. Adverse effects of the killing of these good bacteria include excessive growth of candida albicans causing thrush, increased blood levels of uric acid as the uric acidconsuming bacteria are killed, the development of organisms that produce gas and wind, deterioration of the normal processes of digestion and absorption of nutrients, and bleeding. Allergies All too often, antibiotics are given for problems that clearly have an allergic origin problems such as congested and painful sinuses and runny noses. The antibiotics may be given at first on the erroneous assumption that the allergic symptoms are in fact a cold secondly on the erroneous assumption that the antibiotics would, were a virus present, attack the virus causing the alleged cold and, thirdly, on the erroneous assumption that it is sensible to give an antibiotic justincase a bacteria is present or may come visiting. As a result of these three erroneous assumptions, useless and potentially harmful antibiotics are prescribed, and the detection of the true cause of the problem the allergy, is clouded and may even be missed all together. Thus, giving antibiotics for allergy problems is unlikely to be helpful and is often counterproductive. In addition, the use of antibiotics can actually cause allergic problems. From the results observed both in my own clinic and in those of many colleagues, it seems all too likely that one of the consequences of the overuse of antibiotics is the development of allergies in people without a prior history of allergies. These antibioticinduced allergies are a contributing factor to the increasing incidence of eczema, asthma, sinus problems, runny noses and so forth. Candida albicans There is a strong connection between the use of antibiotics and the development of candidiasis. This problem has increased alarmingly with the growing use of antibiotics and can lead to further allergic problems and many symptoms, both physical and mental. Many people allegedly suffering from recurring cystitis are, in fact, suffering from antibioticinduced thrush. They may initially have had a bladder infection, or it may have started as thrush. Treatment with antibiotics may kill off the pathogenic organisms but it doesnt assist in the healing process and, in the meantime, the damaged tissue is vulnerable to further development of the candida albicans. When this causes further symptoms, labelled cystitis, although this is a secondary problem another antibiotic is given and the cycle repeats itself."

        "text": "THE GREEN PAPER A COMMITMENT TO GROWTH AND EQUITY. The double digit level of unemployment of the late 1980s and early 1990s has been a source of great economic and social cost for the Australian community. In the past two decades the growth of unemployment may have softened societys perception of what is regarded as an acceptable level of unemployment. The Green paper refuses to accept unemployment as being acceptable at any level in its commitment towards full employment The Green Paper aims at fulfilling the Governments objectives of A.Reducing Unemployment, particularly the high level of long term unemployment. B.Increasing employment opportunities. C.Improving the skill base of the workforce. D.Promoting equity in the labour market. The Green Paper committee believe that full employment is an achievable goal for Australia. In restoring full employment the Green Paper identifies economic growth and changes in assistance programmes for the long term unemployed as being the areas in which policy should be directed. The current high levels of unemployment represent a source of lost production and inefficiency for the economy. In times of high unemployment the government must divert more funds to dole payments and assistance programmes as well as losing a significant amount of potential tax revenue. The growth in the level of long term unemployment also has an adverse effect on the efficiency of the Labour market. With a large number of workers becoming separated or dislocated from the Labour market competition is reduced. The Green paper also highlights that a mismatch of skills in the Labour market may also produce inflationary pressures in a recovery and a sluggish response of employment growth to the growth in output. The social costs of high unemployment cannot be ignored. Experience and research have shown the linkages between unemployment and social problems such as health and crime. These social costs are of even greater concern given the high growth in the level of long term unemployed people. Generally the longer an individual is unemployed the more difficult it is for them to resume fulltime employment. The Green paper committee claims that this is a result of A.The stigma which is attached with being longterm unemployed. Employers often view a person as being less employable the longer they have been unemployed. B.The loss of contact with the labour market makes it more difficult to find about new opportunities. C.Loss of relevant skills in a changing work environment D.Loss of confidence and morale. With approximately 35 per cent of those unemployed being without employment for a year, this became a high priority for the Green paper. It is evident that certain groups in society have a higher level of unemployment than others. This may be a result of emerging changes in the Labour market or discrete discrimination on the part of employers. Unemployment is higher for some groups than others because not all groups have attributes which are equally attractive to employers. Men bear the higher burden of unemployment and also tend to have a longer duration of unemployment. The Green paper attributes these differences between the sexes to the tendency for women to leave the labour force more readily when jobs are scarce. An important factor contributing to the composition of the unemployed is that of age. Unemployment tends to impact various age groups differently. It is the under 30 group that tends to have a disproportionate share of the unemployment problem. The committee attributes the youth unemployment problem not to growth in the youth labour force but to reduced demand. The main problem is that changes in the Labour market have reduced the opportunities for the disadvantaged or those without qualifications or training. The Green paper highlights that technological change and increased competition from those with skills for lower paid jobs has meant less opportunity for teenagers. While it is the under 30 group which has the higher level of longterm unemployment, the Green paper shows that the average duration of unemployment tends to increase with age. Those from a nonEnglish speaking background also have a higher incidence of unemployment. The explanation for this trend is based on the importance of English speaking communication skills in securing employment. An increasing number of young people are postponing their entry to the Labour force by seeking postsecondary qualifications or training. Qualifications or training and experience are often used by employers as means of screening applications and seen as a source of high productivity. The Green paper shows that those with qualifications have a lower level of unemployment than those without postsecondary training. An important point made by the paper is the tendency for new jobs to be created in either the bottom or higher pay brackets. Jobs in the middle pay range are disappearing. This has had an effect on the composition of those unemployed. Many low skilled jobs are being taken by people who possess qualifications, pushing a large number of the low skilled onto the dolequeue. The competition for low wage jobs often pushes pay rates close to the rate of the Job search allowance. The Green paper argues that this may add to the problem by providing a disincentive to work. In the discussion of the causes of Australias unemployment problem, the Green paper pinpoints a shortfall in demand as the major problem. Against the background of a steadily increasing labour force, falls in the demand for labour in the early 1980s and early 1990s were quickly reflected in large increases in the unemployment rate. PG33 The paper is very quick to dismiss structural change in the economy as a major cause of the current unemployment problem. Despite retrenchments in a number of industries the committee is confident that structural changes will create jobs by diverting resources into areas where they will be used more efficiently. A high level of populationemployment growth, high labour mobility and successful labour market programs has ensured that Australia has avoided the structural unemployment problems experienced in Europe. It could be argued however that the high unemployment rate may in itself create structural unemployment. People who have been unemployed for a lengthy period may lose their skills and confidence, making it very difficult to return to employment. The overall effect would be to boost the NAIRU. It through a combination of rapid economic growth and special assistance programs which is seen as the means of restoring full employment. The Green paper bases its analysis on a series of simulations using the Access Economics Murphy AEM model of the Australian economy. It is offered by the paper that economic growth of 5 to 5 per cent has the potential to reduce the unemployment rate to as low as 5 per cent by the year 2000This growth is dependent on policies which A.Restrain income and keep inflation under control when the economy begins to rapidly expand. B.Speed the pace of Microeconomic reform and ensure that Australian industry continues to grow and improve its competitiveness. C.Stronger productivity growth. The Green paper believes that the high growth rates necessary to reduce Unemployment to its projected levels are realistic. Most importantly the paper believes that inflation can be controlled in periods of rapid economic growth, allowing unemployment to fall. The Green paper recognises that an inverse relationship exists between employment growth and real wage levels. However it concedes that controlling real wage levels through an Incomes policy can be difficult. It believes that increased productivity and output growth are the best means of controlling real wages. The paper highlights that the Industrial Relations Commission could attempt to reduce nominal wages across the board to reduce real wages. This is likely to be unsuccessful if these nominal wage reductions are passed on in the form of lower prices, diluting the effect upon real wages. In this situation the cuts in nominal wages would have to be much larger than the actual falls in real wages. The Green paper believes that large cuts in nominal wages would be very difficult to institute, given the likely adverse distributional consequences of such a move. Despite its views on the control of real wages, the paper stresses that nominal wage restraint is possible and very important in ensuring that employment grows in the recovery. It places its faith in the continued success of the Accord and a commitment on the part of the Unions. The removal of tariff barriers and the competitive pressures placed on Australian business in attempting to capture a larger share of the Asian market may also assist in the control of inflation. Australia had had a relatively poor productivity performance in the last twenty years. The Green paper has identified an improvement in productivity performance as being essential in the reduction of unemployment. Increased productivity growth can help improve living standards, reduce inflationary pressure and, as noted below help reduce the NAIRU.pg.62 The improvement in the quality of both capital and labour are essential in increasing productivity. In regards to capital, business investment is essential in maintaining the level of technical progress embodied in the unit of capital. As stressed by the paper, it is technological change and innovation that improve the growth potential of the economy. The importance of maintaining a capital stock is also highlighted. If capital stocks grow low during a recession, inflationary pressures emerge during a recovery. The importance attached to nominal wage restraint and productivity growth in the Green paper is illustrated in the Murphy model simulations. The Green paper initially considers separate simulations of policy measures designed to increase labour productivity and restrain nominal wage growth. The effects of labour participation shocks are also simulated by the model. The policy simulation involving a reduction in nominal incomes shows that it is the dominant factor in reducing the unemployment rate. In reducing the economies propensity to generate nominal wage inflation the NAIRU is effectively reduced. The reduction in unemployment in this simulation is explained by the rapid feedback effects of growth and investment. In simulating the effect of policies which improve labour productivity, the model shows a much smaller effect on unemployment. Initially the high productivity growth increases unemployment, with fewer workers required to produce the same unit of output. The Green paper however believes that productivity growth will not lead to a situation of jobless growth. The model supports this view in showing a gradual fall in the unemployment rate after an a small initial increase in the jobless rate. It is assumed that the benefits of productivity growth are passed on in the form of lower prices, producing higher real incomes and increased demand. In the recent economic recovery concern has been expressed about the low levels of investment expenditure. Both saving and investment are essential in ensuring economic growth is sustained. In past boom periods of economic activity the problem has been that investment has been funded mainly from overseas borrowing. This is due to the lack of domestic saving. The consequence of overseas borrowing has been a worsening of the CAD. The Green paper believes that unemployment can be increased without causing CAD problems. The projected economic growth is seen as selfsustaining. Higher output growth leads to higher profitability, an acceleration in investment expenditure, and increasing consumer demanddotted linepg.51 The paper maintains that savings will be boosted by the reduction in unemployment which growth is projected to produce. A reduction in unemployment is shown by the model to increase the level of public saving decrease in the Net Borrowing Requirement. It is also commented that the increases in real income from growth will also boost private savings. The proposition that growth would be selfsustaining is backed by two final simulations using the Murphy model. The first is referred to as the High Growth scenario. It shows the results of successful policies which restrain nominal wage growth and improve productivity. The model shows that in this scenario there is a large improvement in the unemployment rate. Inflation is also shown to fall and stabilise until it eventually it returns to the trend rate. The second simulation is referred to as the Employment Growth scenario. This is basically the same as the first simulation except that it introduces two other elements. The productivity growth in this case is initially higher capital productivity. Also in the first two years of the simulation it is assumed that labour supply is reduced by various labour market schemes. This trend is reversed after the first two years. The results of the second simulation are almost identical to the first. The purpose of the two different simulations is to show that it is nominal wage restraint that is the dominant factor in reducing unemployment."

        "text": "Letter 11 9th 15th Feb 92 Dear Mum Dad, Hi Thanks for my birthday card our anniversary card. Thanks also for your letter of 31512 aero of 141812 letter of 293012 aeros of 23241 17But I cant seem to find any aero dated 121 which you referred to in the aero of 2324 Were really greatful for the Rs3,700 you sent. It went towards the shortfall for Davids school fees. We also received your parcel on 271 in good condition. So it took 4 months 9 days from when you posted it. Thanks so much for it. It was great. As Elsa told you we also got the Vegemite pack from Kraft so we are feeling rich in Vegemite these days. Did you pay for the Kraft pack It says gift pack on the side. The kids loved your presents remembered you yet again. I am enjoying the book Elsa thanks you for the talc. I am sending Tajs presents up to him with Abdul who is going back to the same village this week. We also eventually got Jonathan Wandas letter posted to our old address. Funnily enough we recently almost settled on a flat right next door to that place. More about that later. Did you read the following paragraph in my letter 8 Could you ask Jeff Vanessa Burgess to look for a white manila folder marked in pencil M.A. among my alphabetically arranged files which I think are in a drawer of my desk in their garage. If when they find it could you send it over sometime Just check in the loft first in case I left it there. I think I only stored my office files there. Im still puzzled where my first photo album is which had portraits of me at a desk in Kindergarten, class photos for each year of primary school photos from Papua New Guinea. I searched at your place among our things at Greystanes but couldnt find it. Perhaps you could just keep it in mind if youre ever rummaging around, but dont go to any extra trouble. We dont hear very much at all from Beth, probably because we each have our respective networks of friends in our respective cities. And We never go to Peshawar she rarely comes here, though we have written a couple of letters to each other. Sorry to hear about your hernia, Dad. About M.E. Myalgic Encephalomyelitis its funny how it seems to affected women more than men. I wonder why. Although Hux Gunter had it too. Were ready to move now that weve been back in Pakistan for nearly a year. We couldnt have faced a move when we first saw Baarts place in mid We want to move because Elsa finds it too dark in our present basement flat. So well get an upper storey this time, closer to Davids school. 10 minutes each way After one day of watching Quinceys driving from the passenger seat I cancelled the whole idea. He is not at all a good or confident driver. I was very nervous, which for me is saying something. So now I take David Christopher Willson who lives downstairs from my office Kens to the British school each morning at 8am Steve Willson picks them up at 3pm each day. That suits us both because often Steve I have our respective errands to do on the same trip. Willsons are Americans but the British School is open to all nationalities after all British children have places. Ken has just managed to extend his existing visa to mid March. Before then he will have to leave the country to get a new visa from a Pakistan High Commission or Embassy New Delhi is the closest most probable. This is standard procedure for tourists wanting to stay longer there is usually no way around it. This means that he could get another 3 months after that which could take him up to mid June at the latest. He is still unsure of when to leave at this stage perhaps end of May. He is taking Sarawat Shah with him to Delhi in March just for company. It will be a real adventure for S.S. because no K has ever left the country. Ken is still plodding away at the drawings, very meticulously very beautifully. I am sending some samples to Snowdons Bates. We are very pleased at their high quality, the K are also very impressed with what he is producing. This style was also by far the most popular in the survey of styles that Ken originally conducted up there. We are sure the illustrations will make a deep lasting impression on them. The K are really struggling to maintain their identity in this crucial time of particularly serious exploitation change. These illustrations will be very special to them because they give dignity to itheirr world. We know that at they will enhance the accompanying texts tremendously not just to break up the text, nor just to superficially attract readers, nor just to merely show the appearance of things. Each illustration is a piece of art in itself which the K value. The realistic portrayals of indigenous subjects or indigenousappearing subjects for trd texts will make the booklets, iincluding the subject matterr, very personal to them. Ken is very interested in the K has done a lot of reading, thinking praying, especially relating to the communication of the Message to them specifically. However, paradoxically, we are yet to see whether he will return here, or go to Uganda, or stay in N.Z. His life is at a crossroad with many different options he is not finding it easy to decide on direction. Please pray for him. A week ago a young couple turned up here hoping to work here long term. Joe is an Australian born of Finnish parents Mari is Finnish. They have had YWAM training have spent many months in the subcontinent. They feel very much at home here. They are currently on tourist visas but they are seeking a way to stay longer by getting another kind of visa, like a student visa to study Urdu, or one like ours. After considering several options they seem quite open to the idea of joining NWFF. They plan to be still here when Snowdons come in May so they can meet them then talk to them. At the moment they are staying with us are very happy helping us in many practical ways babysitting, sewing, painting furniture etc. Needless to say we are also very happy for their help. They are very easy guests. When we move hopefully around beginning of March after the current tennants have moved out the owner has painted cleaned we are thinking of moving the office Ken etc. to 1131 for the following reasons. For an extra 3rd bedroom the rent is actually though marginally cheaper It will be very handy having my office next door to Rons again as we need to consult each other interact quite a bit. We currently have an intercom from our house to Trails so we would leave that there. 1131 has a telephone which 8 Kens doesnt have. It is closer to the market. And it is a more central location for us as a family to keep a link with all our friends from this neighbourhood after we move to F103 a couple of miles away. Well let you know our new address telephone number after we have signed the contract in case it falls through. In any case mail can still come to 1131 since were keeping it for the office until we have notified everyone of our new address. Love from Greg, Elsa David, Boaz Cherry. 30692 Dear Mum Dad, Hi We just received your latest letter dated 10216 yesterday Elsa has beaten me in replying in an aero. I cant remember whether she mentioned the heat here. Weve had maximums of about 42 deg. C for most of June. We really notice it here on the top floor as compared to the basement at 1131, especially with one AC air conditioner out of order. It really slows us down. Today Elsa is working again at the British Council. She has a spate of days at the moment in order to try to regain what weve spent in trying to supplement Davids school fees. Today is the last day of the school year, so his last day altogether. We are enquiring about correspondence courses but are not ready to participate in the study centre which Willsons are trying to start unless until they get a teacher. At this stage there are only 4 or 5 kids who are firm enrolments. NWFF has paid the rent for the officeflat 1131 till 4th October. From 1st July for at least 4 months an Australian couple will be sharing it with me, paying for two thirds of the rent as I will keep my office there. Their contribution to the rent will allow me to keep the whole place at least till the end of December at this stage. Their names are Chris Julie Bilby from Melbourne. He is teaching English to adults at the same college as Brent Jones. Mary Neil arrived on the same day as Wendy. She stayed with us for just over a week then went to stay with friends in Peshawar. Shell go to the KV with them meet up with us there. She only has a 3 month visa at this stage so she would need to go back home reapply. Shes about our age speaks with a strong Mississippi accent. She has a Masters degree in intercultural communication has secretarial skills. She read about the K much like I did about 10 years ago. She wrote to several people about her interest. She is not in any organisation yet. Donna is AOG. Andrew Bunce is doing fine as far as we know. Weve only met him once or twice. Hes in Murree. Were trying to get up there for weekends but have not really managed more than a day or two so far. We have the use of a little room which is too small to stay in for more than a couple of nights. But its all we need as we dont want to move up there like we used to. I dont know if I told you that the calligrapher I used years ago had died. So Im trying out a few others. Im also negotiating with a printer about the adaptation of their newly purchased computerised facilities for Urdu which I told you about. Steve Joan are nowhere near ready for publication. Ron is specialising in TR dictionary while we are specialising in literacy. Traditionally printed Urdu is not popular because of centuries of being used to calligraphy. Its an artform in itself. But now that computerised calligraphy has finally broken through it means the latest technology of data storage editing as well as printing can be used to produce exactly the style that people like. In Pakistani cities trading hours vary according to the shopkeepers. Typically most shops would open from around 10am to 10pm, 6 days a week. There is a good shopping centre only 2 minutes drive from our house so I often shop in the evenings. As Elsa said we are very excited that Cheryl Allans plans to come to Australia are getting more concrete now. I personally feel a granny flat would spoil your property. Im glad youre feeling better now Mum. We still enjoy the occasional good tape from TCMC. We cant put it that way to Tony because it doesnt sound good that some talks are better than others. But occasionally friends have sent a tape that they were blessed by or that they thought would be good for us."

        "text": "THE GULFPREPARING FOR WAR Leading lights urge restraint as protest movement builds Growing chorus calls for peace By LENORE TAYLOR, SCOTT HENRY and STEVEN WILSON LEADING authors, actors, clergy, federal MPs, academics and doctors have joined to urge the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, not to commit Australia to a war in the Middle East. And they have appealed to other Australians to join the peace effort. Authors Thomas Keneally and David Malouf, actress Rebecca Gilling, comedian John Clark, fashion designer Jenny Kee, historian Manning Clark, federal ALP leftwing MPs Frank Walker, Laurie Ferguson, Daryl Melham, Jeanette McHugh, Stuart West and senators Bruce Childs and John Faulkner are among 135 people who have signed an advertisement placed in The Australian today urging Australians to reject involvement in a war. The signatories condemn the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but urge Mr Hawke to give the United Nations sanctions a chance to work. Mr Hawke has ruled out sending Australian ground troops to the Gulf, and has said there will not be an escalation of Australias naval involvement. But with international opinion firming that war is inevitable, peace groups have formed around the nation. In Sydney, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth rallies have been organised on January 19, to coincide with those worldwide. Melbournes rally is scheduled for January 18, and Sydney activists have also organised a lunchtime rally for Tuesday, the day of the United Nations deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait. In Sydney yesterday, university unions representing 145,000 students condemned the use of military force in the Gulf and called on Mr Hawke to withdraw all Australian forces immediately. Students United Against War, made up of representatives from Sydney University, the University of NSW, Macquarie University, the University of Technology, Sydney and the University of Canberra, joined the National Union of Students to oppose the Iraqi invasion and a first strike by US and allied forces. The students called on the Federal Government not to deploy any new armed forces to the Middle East, to bring the frigates home and to take an independent role. In Brisbane, 35 groups including peace, ethnic, environment, union, church and political organisations vowed to stage a series of protests. A spokeswoman for the group, Mrs Carol Dowling, said protests would include a week of allnight vigils and rallies at Brisbanes King George Square. In Melbourne, 30 people joined in a Gulf Peace Team march, gathering at the Shrine of Remembrance before marching along the footpath into the city. In Western Australia, a 30day vigil outside a city church continued yesterday. The States strongest lobby group against the war, the Alliance for Peace in the Middle East, plans a 24hour vigil over January 15 As well as signing the peace network advertisement, the environment group Greenpeace delivered a strongly worded letter to Mr Hawke. Its executive director, Mr Paul Gilding, wrote Greenpeace notes with alarm that you personally have not rule out an escalation of Australias role in the event of war. Equally, Foreign Minister Evans has not ruled out Australias continued involvement in the event of nuclear war. Prime Minister, you have grave responsibility to the people of Australia far greater than that which the United States demands. Depending on the decisions you make regarding Australias role in the Gulf, your name can go down in history as the Australian leader who merely repeated the mistakes of the past or one who had the courage and conviction to stand apart. Export surge jeopardises rate cut By CHRIS WALLACE THE next cut in interest rates has been pushed back by new balance of payments figures showing continued imports growth despite the recession. The current account deficit for November was 37 billion according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released yesterday squarely within fincancial market expectations. But after taking seasonal factors into account, import growth of 6 per cent outstripped a 2 per cent rise in exports for the month. The balance of payments figures were described as fairly reassuring by the Acting Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, in Perth yesterday, given the uncertainties and the changes which have occurred since the time the Budget was put together. Mr Dawkins said they were an unspectacular set of figures, but suggested that the governments balance of payments strategy was very much on track. Current account figures for the first five months of the financial year a total 65 billion deficit representing a 29 per cent improvement on the corresponding period last year suggest the Budget forecast of 18 billion for 199091 will be met. GraphicsCaption Speaking in Geelong yesterday, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was more bullish about the likely current account outcome. Its in line with an outcome for the year which would be significantly below the 18 billion figure projected in the Budget, Mr Hawke said. The reason for continuing strong imports following a record period of tight monetary policy which has pushed the economy into recession remains a worrying mystery to policy makers. The import figures for November were dragged up by big defence equipment and fuel imports, the latter reflecting higher world oil prices because of the Gulf crisis. But underlying imports, which are heavily influenced by prevailing economic conditions, nevertheless rose 6 per cent after taking seasonal factors into account. Merchant bankers BT Australia estimated that underlying imports rose 8 per cent in November after taking seasonal factors into account and excluding BHPs import in October of a tanker from the comparison. Mr Dawkins conceded that the Government did not fully understand why import growth was still so strong. Treasury is waiting on quarterly balance of payments figures for December, due to be released in March, to work out whether the growing import figures reflect the dollars depreciation during the past few months, or whether it is because of higher import volumes. The dollar depreciated by 8 per cent on atradeweighted basis betwen September and November. On the basis of experience, import growth should have eased much more quickly given Australias present position in the economic cycle. The merchandise trade balance fell in November to 143 million after seasonal adjustment. But this represented the seventh positive trade balance in the past eight months, and the cumulative tradebalance for the first five months of 199091 is an 82 per cent improvement on the corresponding period in the previous year. Exports rose 2 per cent in both original and seasonally adjusted terms. But rural exports fell, dragging the overall result down with falls recorded in sugar and other rural exports. The net income deficit, largely reflecting Australias cost of debtservicing abroad, also worsened significantly from 3 billion in October to 41 billion in November. Treasury expects the net income deficit to remain about this level for the rest of the financial year. Mr Dawkins said he did not expect the recession to be protracted, and that the prospects for domestic industry were pretty good. I think the important thing for all of us and for corporate Australia particularly is to look forward to the recovery, he said. What we know is that there will be a recovery inevitably, and that we will go into that recovery in fairly good shape. The cost structure in Ausltralia has been reduced and a lot of the inefficiencies within the Australian economy have been removed. The Oppositions spokesman on Treasury matters, Mr Peter Reith, said the latest figures confirmed that Ausltralia was addicted to imports and that any imminent interest rate cut had been ruled out by the figures. If the present trend continues, it will be difficult to sustain the present interest rate cuts let alone see further reductions, Mr Reith said. Mr Reith said there must be a concerted attempt to correct Australias fundamental economic problems, and renewed the Oppositions call for a miniBudget to address the situation. There must also be an acceleration in the rate of structural reform which is impeding the competitiveness of our export and import competing industries, he said. He offered bipartisan support for the introduction of a broadbased tax on goods and services. Mr Reith said he and the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, would be prepared to discuss with Mr Hawke and the treasurer, Mr Keating, a package of tax reforms designed to turn around the economy. The Opposition would back any move by the Government to have a consumption tax in place by January 1 next year, Mr Reith said. We have not had a recession of this depth and hardship for many Australians since the war, and I think it is time to do things differently, he said. We genuinely offer our bipartisan support for dotted line tax reforms which would give people some incentive and start to boost productivity, he said. Mr Reith had earlier told the Young Liberals national convention in Brisbane that the introduction of abroadbased goods and services tax would pave the way for substantial cuts in personal income tax. He said the Oppositions proposed tax reforms also provided for the abolition of wholesale sales tax and the exemption of export products from tax. Our security poised to combat proIraqi terrorists By foreign affairs writer TONY PARKINSON SECURITY authorities in Australia are getting access to highgrade data from the Western intelligence network as they set in place their strategy to counter the threat of Iraqiinspired terrorism. Canberra is being fed specific intelligence from overseas agencies on the movements of known terrorists, the pattern of linkages between Middle Eastern terrorist organisations and their methods of operation. There is very highlevel cooperation on these matters, a senior official told The Australian yesterday. While Australia has traditionally had ready access to information from friendly agencies overseas, the recent exchanges are seen as particularly valuable because of our limited exposure in the past to Arab and Palestinian terrorist groups. As well as sophisticated computer profiles that Australian immigration authorities have developed on terrorist suspects, the intelligence from countries such as Britain and the United States is regarded as critical to maintaining watertight barrier checks at airports around the country. The US and Britain have a longer and more painful history of dealing with Middle East terrorism. In other gulf developments yesterday SIX Iraqi helicopters containing an unknown number of defectors landed in Saudi Arabia yesterday as an Iraqi brigadier who defected earlier warned that President Saddam Husseins forces could launch a preemptive attack. PALESTINE Liberation Organisation leader Mr Yasser Arafat predicted a Gulf war would last between three and six years and draw in the whole of the Arab world. THE Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Shamir, ruled out a preemptive strike against Iraq but told visiting British MPs he believed this weeks meeting between the US Secretary of state, Mr James Baker, and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Mr Tariq Aziz, would make clear to Mr Hussein he had no chance of winning a war. The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, recognising the possibility of terrorist attacks in this country, admitted yesterday Australia could be among Western nations targeted if Mr Hussein sought to encourage a campaign of terror against his enemies. Mr Hawke also said he still believed the odds were against war in the Gulf. While the situation is very precariously balanced there I think, still, war is somewhat less likely than likely, he said, adding that Iraqs decision to attend talks with the US in Geneva this morning was very significant. But if the crisis degenerated into open conflict, he was confident Australias security agencies would be able to counter any threat of terrorism. There is a general caution being exercised around the world dotted line all countries, let me say including Australia, have been aware of that possibility, Mr Hawke said. I can assure you that in those circumstances our various resources have been properly alerted, and would be in a position to deal with any such possibility. While officials in Canberra would not divulge their assessment of the level of threat Australia might face, it is understood to be regarded as significantly lower than Western Europe and the US. In Britain still smarting from the bitter experience of Arab and Palestinian nationals orchestrating terrorist campaigns while resident in London contingency plans for security clampdowns on likely Iraqi sympathisers are believed to be extremely tough."

        "text": "OCEAN OF STORY July 1902August 1917 IN CHRISTINA STEADS memory, her mother was a dim vision of pale skin, dark eyes, and long dark hair lying across a pillow on a high brass and lacquer bed.1 She herself, dressed in a red twill dress, was swinging on the bedpost, singing to her mother, who had always liked her singing. It must have been morning, for the sunlight filtered through the front window of their whitewashed cottage. Suddenly the nurse, an ugly old woman, told her to go away and stop annoying her mother. The little girl looked at her mother, confidently. Yes, go, Chrissie.2 Filled with a sense of betrayal, the child left the room. She was fingering the panelling of the door, not knowing why she had been sent out, when her aunt came along What are you doing there spying Although she was only 2 12, the child knew what was meant. Her aunt shooed her away. Seventyseven years later, Christina Stead was still angry.3 But had she imagined it all Later, the sick young woman became blurred in Steads mind with Emma Bovary on her deathbed, where she too was visited by a frightened small daughter.4 Did Stead really recall Sydney in the summer of 1904 Or was that darkened room actually in YonvilleLAbbaye, a provincial town in Normandy Christina Stead never made much consciously of the loss of her mother, though she did once say, comparing herself to a guttercat, that she had not trusted anyone since she was about 5 After her mothers death, she became her fathers special girl. My mother died he mothered me. David George Stead was a lively young scientist, a zoologist, brimming with stories about the marvels of the natural world and its strange inhabitants. In the evenings, with the light falling from the streetlamp through the open slats of the venetian blind and his foot on the packingcase on which his daughter slept, he would tell his tales. And it went on and on, night after night, for more than two years.6 Among the last things Stead wrote were two tender pieces reconciling her to the unusually gifted man whom she had reviled in her most famous novel, The Man Who Loved Children. It was her father, she acknowledged, who had taught her to swim in the ocean of story.7 stars Christina Ellen Stead was thirdgeneration Australian. She liked to think her family history was shaped by literature. In Great Expectations, published in 1861, the convict Magwitch is transported to Australia, where he makes his fortune in sheep. In 1862, Steads paternal grandfather an avid reader of Dickens packed his bags, farewelled his family in Kent and boarded the Hotspur for the threeandahalfmonth voyage to Sydney. He was 16 years old.8 Whether or not fiction played so decisive a role in Samuel Steads destiny, Australia did offer an opportunity for hardworking tradesmen to break out of the English class system. By the time Samuel Stead came to Sydney, gold had paved the way for a boom in the Australian economy that was to last for thirty years. Samuel did not make his fortune, but he was enterprising and found employment with a firm of building contractors, later setting up his own business in North Sydney. His last family house was named after Dickens house, Gads Hill. Late in life he joined the Dickens Society, and as a child, Christina was occasionally taken to see her grandfather perform at socials, where he would recite from the novels, joyfully impersonating Scrooge, Nicholas Nickleby, Quilp and Fagin. At the age of 22, in 1868, Samuel Stead married 19yearold Christina McLaren. Scottish born, she had come to Australia as a baby with her newly widowed mother.9 Samuel purchased a small plot of land on Walker Street, a winding street not far from the harbour in St Leonards now North Sydney, where he built a modest twostorey weatherboard house. There Christina produced seven children by the time she was One daughter, May, died in infancy, leaving three boys and three girls Sydney, Samuel, Christina, Jessie, David and Florence.10 Grandfather Samuel with twinkling eyes, moustache and a dashing dark red handkerchief was a freethinker, as atheists were then called, who occasionally took snuff and enjoyed a glass of port.11 He belonged to the Order of Odd Fellows, the oldest of the several orders of British lodges transplanted to Australia,12 committed to ideals of brotherhood, democratic sharing of responsibility and mutual financial assistance. Modestly imitating the ritual and symbolism of Freemasonry, the Odd Fellows appealed largely to tradesmen and skilled artisans. In time, Stead took his turn for a year as Grand Noble of his local Lodge. His wife Christina, by contrast, was a kindfaced but plain woman, with an austere, worldrenouncing piety. As a member of the Plymouth Brethren, a nonconformist Protestant sect, she regarded smoking, alcohol, dancing, gambling and the theatre as vices.13 But like the Odd Fellows, the Brethren were strongly democratic, rejecting ecclesiastical organisation on the grounds that it was a denial of the spiritual equality of all male believers. The younger Stead children, David and Florence, occasionally accompanied their mother to meetings. Davids strong individualism may well have reflected his mothers antihierarchical tradition. David George was born on 6 March He was a handsome boy, with thick yellow hair, tender blue eyes and a happy nature. According to his daughter Christina he actually shone his pale blaze came from more than just his fairness it was a sign, she believed, of his vitality and selftrust. It dazzled people. If his older siblings had some sentimental and quite uninformed views of England, David responded to the country of his birth like Adam in Eden. Australia was his prolific and innocent garden.14 Despite their mothers cultural sobriety, the Stead household was cheerful and musical, with frequent family singsongs around the piano. When they sang in the evenings in the front room with the lights on and the blinds up tunes from operas and rousing old favourites like The Battle Cry of Freedom, When Johnny Comes Marching Home and John Browns Body passersby would stop in the street to listen.15 One terrible night in the winter of 1893, their mother died of an angina attack.16 She was Only 16 years old and particularly close to his mother, David was devastated. He vowed to keep her rules of life. Christina Stead, her grandmothers namesake, recalls He never went to the theatre or to concerts he abhorred dancing, because of the contact of bodies he did not allow kissing or embracing in the home, nor endearments, nor cajoling, which he thought led to degrading habits of minddotted line He whistled very tunefully, and usually tunes from operas, but only moral operas Martha, William Tell, Maritanadotted line He was shocked that the arts so often dealt with what seemed to a pure man, unsavoury subjects.17 Indeed, David George held a strange mixture of both parents views, and with passionate fervour. He was an atheist, like his father, and so committed to atheism that he refused to enter a church. Yet he was a puritan, like his mother, and just as firm about never letting a drop of alcohol pass his lips. He had his fathers good looks and liveliness, and his mothers sureness of purpose. All three boys left school at the age of Sydney and Samuel became painters and signwriters David was apprenticed to the Sydney rubberstamp maker Karl Faulk, where he learnt to pride himself on his decorative lettering.18 But Nature had always been his passion. In his late teens he attended a zoology course at Sydney Technical College, where he boiled down and mounted a cat and a dog that would stare at his children from glass cases. And he became an active member of the New South Wales Naturalists Society, a group of committed amateurs. In 1898, at 21, he joined the Linnean Society of New South Wales, the professional naturalists body. By 1900 he had several short articles published by the prestigious British Linnean Society. stars Davids lively younger sister Florence who had her fathers beautiful voice and taste for acting went to work at 14 as a seamstress in the workrooms of David Jones, the fashionable department store. It was through Florence that David met Ellen Butters, an embroideress, whom he married on 17 August 1901, the year Australia was formally declared an independent nation. It was a nation of divided loyalties the fierce nationalism of the 1890s was countered by cultural ties to the British Empire and Mother England. The Federal Parliament had been opened in Melbourne by the Duke of York later King George V, and Australian volunteers were fighting for the Empire in the Boer War. Twentyfiveyearold Ellen Stead, pretty, gentle and pious, also found her loyalties divided that year. Though she came from an ardently devout family, her wedding was not a religious service the 24yearold groom was adamant about that. It is thought that he even tried to forbid his wife to pray. Ellens father, equally headstrong, banished his daughter and her new husband from the family home. Ellens brother Duncan later claimed that she visited her mother and siblings secretly,19 and was bewildered by the strange world into which she had married snakes in the copper and creatures everywhere and she not allowed to pray.20 Two months after her marriage Ellen was pregnant, and it was in their modest tworoomed cabin on Kimpton Street, Rockdale, south of the city, that Christina Ellen Stead was born on 17 July 1902, the year that Australian women gained the right to vote in federal elections. Grandfather Butters refused to speak to his daughter or look at his grandchild.21 In the next year or so, the family moved to Oakleigh Villa, a whitewashed house with a stone verandah and picket fence, standing alone on a rutty road leading to Rockdale station.22 David Stead set up his menagerie in the back garden. He kept venomous black snakes, and a diamond snake, whose erratic eating habits he noted with interest.23 However, his special interest was not snakes but fish. David Steads expertise in this area was acknowledged by the NSW Fisheries Commission, who employed him in May 1902, although he had no formal qualifications. He was made a scientific assistant under Harold Dannevig, Director of Fisheries for the Commonwealth. That year the government printer published his article on the Murray cod. Christina Stead liked to think she looked like her mother, but the one surviving photograph of Ellen Butters reveals little resemblance. In the solemn studio photograph, Ellen is in her early teens a comely adolescent with docile brown eyes, full lips and a long dark plait. She is wearing a prim dress with a high neck, legofmutton sleeves, and a fur collar clasped by a large, ornate brooch. A lace kerchief is tucked into her belted waist and she has a white communion book in her lap. She looks timid, submissive the daughter of an authoritarian Victorian father. As a child, Christina was very fair and had several of her fathers features, though in her, unfortunately, they did not form the same harmonious blend. Her father was tall and strongly built. In photographs he has the air of a man who knows he is handsome. His large forehead, prominent nose and resolute chin give him a proud, selfconfident bearing. His daughter had the same imperious presence. In the family it was said that Christina looked like her fathers sister Jessica something she hated to hear, not because Jessicas appearance was unpleasing, but because she had remained an old maid, a fate Christina regarded with horror. stars Ellen Butters parents, Christina Steads maternal grandparents, were also from the British Isles. Richard Cameron Butters, born in Ireland of Scottish parents in 1832, was an adventurer who left Ireland with his brother in the aftermath of the Great Famine for the gold diggings of California. From there, hearing about the discovery of gold in Australia, they came to New South Wales."

        "text": "Cover Story Travelling North In the first half of the 1980s more than 700,000 people migrated between states, the greatest population drift in Australias history. In the latter half of the decade the pace accelerated. During that time Queenslands net gain was 12,000 people every three months, most in search of the Tropical Dream. PHIL JARRATT reports on the results of their quest Rick Cooper and Helen Collins, decidedly middleclass and almost middleaged, realised about five years ago that they were sitting on a gold mine. Their home at Middle Cove on Sydney Harbour, in which they held a healthy equity, was suddenly worth more than twice their purchase price of two years earlier. Rick had a keen eye for the financial markets and calculated correctly when Sydneys redhot housing market would peak. He moved quickly and sold within 5 of the highest valuation. For the cashedup CollinsCoopers the options were endless. They could afford to buy another home outright and negative gear an investment property. They could even move into commercial property if they worked hard and kept the cashflow up. At 55, they could retire millionaires. But something happened. Says Collins It had been in the back of my head for a long, long time. I once had a boss who slaved and made a lot of money for his golden years. He dropped dead on the tennis court just before he retired. It occurred to me that you shouldnt leave the things you really want to do until it is too late. Then I met Rick, who worked 20 hours a day and played motivational tapes in his car. For the next few years we had a lot of money but no time to enjoy it. The pair were prime candidates for the Tropical Dream. Last year, like 40,000 others, they fled New South Wales. Like 45,000 other interstate migrants, they moved to Queensland. There was more than a year between selling our Sydney home and making the move, says Cooper, but the fact is that, psychologically, from the moment we put the house on the market, we were travelling north. The past decade has seen the beginnings of the greatest population drift in Australias history, a movement north and, to a lesser extent, west from the established metropolitan bases which dwarfs the exodus from the cities during the Depression. When men went on the wallaby in the 30s, they did so in search of jobs. In the 80s, families moved out of Sydney and Melbourne in search of the Tropical Dream an easy life in a sunny climate where affordable housing meant you were no longer a slave to your mortgage. Ironically, in the 90s, some of those dreamers will have to go on the wallaby in search of jobs if they want to keep the dream alive. According to a study of population movements released in March by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, more than 700,000 people changed states in the first half of the 80s. Although our most recent census was in 1986, interstate migration is believed to have increased until it reached a peak coinciding with Sydneys realestate peak in late At that time, Queenslands net gain due to interstate migration was more than 12,000 a quarter while NSWs net loss was just under 12,The drift has temporarily slowed since then as Sydney homeowners wait for the realestate market to bottom out before selling up but Queensland still had a growth rate a full percentage point above the national average. Broadly speaking, the population drift is from south to north but people are also moving from Sydney to Canberra, from Melbourne to Perth and many points in between. The metaphor for the movement, however and this is one beloved of Queensland realestate hawkers is the family freezing by the onebar heater in Melbourne, barricaded against the bailiffs as financial institutions crumble all around them. They sit and shiver and dream the Tropical Dream. Dream about Travelling North. For many, the swaying palms and the house they actually own will remain a dream but it is an eminently sensible and reasonable dream. In the middle range, real estate in southeastern Queensland is roughly half the price of Sydneys and 50 less than Melbournes. Under Wayne Goss Labor state government, Queensland appears to have set a sensible course towards sustainable development and controlled foreign investment which should ensure the states continued economic growth into the next century while red tape and bureaucratic intervention remains low. Moreover, the growth of the southeastern Queensland conurbation the fastestgrowing metropolitan region in Australia has at last been reined in from whiteshoe madness to a level designed to safeguard the basic but essential ingredients of the Tropical Dream such as palm trees, white sand and clear blue water. The city of Brisbane came of age in the 80s, making its international debut as a host city with the Commonwealth Games in 82 and Expo in When he took office in late 1989, Premier Goss vowed to make Queensland something more than the branchoffice state and the rise and rise of Brisbanes central business district is testament to this happening. The capital has a long way to go before it becomes the hub of the Pacific rim envisaged by Brisbane Strategy Plan architect Professor Bob Stimson but it has become an increasingly attractive and cheaper alternative for companies establishing national and regional businesses. The driving force behind the population drift, however, has nothing to do with job opportunities or the Brisbane CBD. The drift is centred on the Gold and Sunshine leisure coasts to either side of Brisbane and on the lush hinterland stretching back to the Great Dividing Range at Toowoomba. It is all about qualityoflife issues and its origins go back 20 years to the hippies and surfers who sought an alternative to the city rat race. Surfers in search of the perfect wave and a holidaying secretary with big boobs led the way north in the mid60s. Perhaps it is fairer to say that they popularised it fishermen, caravanners and rural locals had known of the joys of the NSW North Coast since the popularisation of motoring holidays after World War II. But the surfers were the first to move into nirvana, scratching out a living emptying garbage bins or fashioning boards in coastal towns from Crescent Head to Yamba to Byron Bay and then over the border to Coolangatta, Burleigh Heads and finally Noosa. The surfers came, stayed and bought. They were the first migrants of leisure and many of them have become realestate millionaires sitting in headland mansions, bemoaning the crowds. The hippie movement was born a few years later and it became fashionable to denounce city ways. After the Aquarius Festival at Nimbin in northern NSW in 1973, many of the hippies stayed on they formed communes and collectives and generally drove the farm folk spare. Hippies had become passeacute by the late 70s but core groups remained in the northern rainforests and coastal villages, toned down their idealism and their dopesmoking and became New Settlers. Whereas the hippies had chained themselves to bulldozers, the New Settlers stood for office and fought the developers in council and court. The New Settlers introduced new lifestyles and new architecture and proved to have stickability and political clout. In the Byron Bay area last year, they almost got Helen Caldicott into federal politics but couldnt stop Paul Hogan building a tasteless mansion. For the first few years, ordinary Australians many of them the parents of surfers or hippies viewed these leisurebased migrations with scarcely veiled contempt. They couldnt understand why young Harry would forsake accountancy studies to work a prawn boat in the Clarence River or why young Cheryl would want to live in a geodesic dome in a mosquitoinfested rainforest when she could have a Pettitt and Sevitt deluxe on a new estate just 50 minutes from the GPO. But, when the leisure migrants stayed on and became successful in their own ways, perceptions began to change. The David Williamson play and later movie Travelling North is a beautifully whimsical study of an elderly couple moving north to retire in the sun. Retirees didnt need hippies and surfers to teach them about eking out the super payout in a warm and sunny place but their parallel drift north created an economic interdependence in places such as Byron Bay, Tweed Heads, Surfers Paradise and Noosa Heads. While they werent prodigious spenders, people enjoying the golden years kept businesses and service industries alive in the lean periods between holiday seasons. The couple in Williamsons play leave family ties behind in Melbourne but in the 80s an increasing number of retirees moved north to be reunited with children and grandchildren. Fred and Gwen Fisher sold their home at Caringbah, in Sydneys south, last year and bought a comfortable bungalow in the Noosa hinterland surrounded by bush and with a hectare of subtropical garden. As much as they love their new home, they love even more their proximity to daughters Ruth and Sue and the grandchildren. Ruth and her husband moved to Noosa seven years ago to work in the building industry Sue and her husband followed two years later and bought a fourwheeldrive safari tour business. The Fishers missed the realestate peak and took their house off the market but last June, when interest rates dropped a point, they got near enough to the price they wanted. Says Fred The difference between selling and buying prices was enough to make us comfortable here, as long as we dont live too extravagantly. And I dont think theres much chance of that. Our priorities are to spend time with the kids and keep the garden looking nice. Gwen Fisher was initially worried about missing her circle of friends but, symptomatic of another phase of the population drift, various friends have holidayed with the Fishers and some are moving up to join them. Word of mouth among retirees has been the main instrument of Toowoombas recent population growth, according to mayor Clive Berghofer. Retirees have also been the instrument of much of developer Berghofers recent wealth, as the garden city becomes one large retirement village. But the drift to Toowoomba comes mainly from the rural sector. People who spend their working lives by the sea tend to spend their retirements fishing and beachcombing, hence the popularity of the Gold and Sunshine coasts with refugees from Sydney and Melbourne. As the dream of moving north permeated mainstream Australia, it also became somewhat diluted. While surfers and hippies had wanted clean air and rural tranquillity, the new leisure migrants wanted clean air, rural tranquillity, bitumen roads, a supermarket around the corner and the prospect of employment. They found a compromise of sorts on the Gold Coast. If there is a recession on the Gold Coast, no one has told the bulldozer and bobcat drivers. They provide the soundtrack for the sprawling city as they level scores of hectares daily, pushing suburbia back into the hills. Overnight, grazing paddocks become islands with canals gouged around their perimeters and mazes of cul de sacs guarantee every dreamer a Gold Coast waterfrontage. The turf is laid, the roads are kerbed and guttered and up go the signs The Anchorage, Riviera Keys, Plantation Estatedotted lineAt a new estate called Clear Island Waters behind Broadbeach I marvelled at the sheer nothingness of the dogs leg of avenues bearing such romantic names as Bimini Court, San Simeon Drive and Key Largo Boulevard. Blocks looked out over a shimmering scorched earth plain and a stretch of water only marginally more inviting than an open drain but imagine what the folks back home would think of such an address as Key Largo Boulevard, Clear Island Waters Landscape architect and Surfers Paradise Chamber of Commerce president Jill Allen moved from Melbourne with the first generation of dreamers in the early 70s. For the first 10 years she stayed at home and looked after the kids while husband Les introduced concrete slabs to the Gold Coast building trade."

        "text": "POLICE STABLE SWOOP Virus scare probe By PETER CAMERON, BRONWEN GORA and MARK OBERHARDT MAJOR Crime Squad detectives yesterday swooped on trainer Vic Rails stable to probe the mystery horse deaths which threaten the multibillion dollar Australian racing industry. A police spokesman said the stables had been sealed off. Hours later the toll had risen to 13 after another stricken horse had to be put down. It is believed one avenue of inquiry police are following is that the horses and their trainer may have been deliberately infected with the killer virus following a series of death threats. Eleven of the horses so far struck down were from the stables of Rail, who remains in a critical condition in Brisbanes Mater Hospital, also with an unidentified virus. Fears are mounting NSW horses could be at risk from the mystery disease that saw race meetings across Queensland cancelled yesterday. Australian Jockey Club officials confirmed yesterday two horses that raced at Randwick had arrived from Queensland during the week. One, Unequalled, was transported across the border on Friday just hours before the federal officials banned the movement of all horses in southern Queensland. Concerned AJC officers confirmed the horses had come from an area quite near the Brisbane stables where the horses had died. Three other Queensland horses that raced at Randwick yesterday, Brave Warrior, Baggio and Capestad, all arrived in NSW before September 7, when the disease was detected. A sixth horse stabled at Newcastle has been placed under stringent quarantine after it was revealed it had come from the stables where the virus first struck. Experts are working around the clock to try to identify the virus. The symptoms include hemorraging, swelling of the jaws, lips and genitals and a skin rash. The crisis which threatens Australias 10 billion racing industry resulted in the indefinite suspension of all race meetings and equestrian and dressage events in southeast Queensland yesterday. Department of Primary Industries officials have insisted that all horses thoroughbreds, standard breds, and pleasure horses in the south of Queensland remain in their own areas until the killerbulletContinued Page 2 Police swoop on stableFrom Page 1virus can be identified. It is estimated the ban will affect 20,000 horses. As fears mounted about the possible spread of the disease, AJC veterinary surgeon Crain Suann denied the two newly arrived Queensland horses, Unequalled and Miss Sandman, posed any risk. He said the two were cleared to race after consultation with Department of Agriculture and quarantine officials. Mr Suann said it had not yet been confirmed whether the disease was infectious, adding when you look at the pattern of the disease as it has occurred already we are past the incubation stage. Department of Primary Industry spokesman Dr Ian Douglas said it was vital that all horses remained in their own regions. He said the ban on movement applied from Gladstone south to the border and west to the Darling Downs. The ban has effectively stopped all gallops and pacing meetings until at least next Tuesday while many pleasure gymkhanas will also have to be cancelled. DPI officials have also quarantined three stables in Brisbanes main racing area at Hendra, a spelling yard at Cannon Hill and a spelling property at Kenilworth. Investigators are now leaning towards the mystery virus being a contagious one rather than being caused by toxics. To say we were certain it was a contagious disease would be too strong but we are certainly leaning towards that theory, Dr Douglas said. We have ruled out there being any toxic substance in feed or bedding. Perhaps this disease is carried like a human cold or perhaps by an insect. He said African horse sickness, equine flu, equine herpes and poisoning had also been ruled out. We havent totally discounted rumours that this is a deliberate attempt to infect the horses. These stories always get around in this type of case but we have no proof at this stage, he said. AJC chairman Bob Charley said the equine tragedy was being taken extremely seriously by his organisation and was under close scrutiny by government departments. A list was released late yesterday naming all horses including recreational and racing that had entered NSW from Queensland since September Anyone who has a horse of any description they feel may be suffering from the virus should ring 1800 675 Two shot dead in factory raid By SARAH HARRIS TWO middleaged men were killed and a third injured in an armed raid on a health food distribution factory in Sydneys northwest yesterday. The men were apparently working at the D.F.C. Thompson factory unit in Hornsby when two intruders burst into the premises. In a hospital bedside interview, the surviving victim told police how the men, one of whom was allegedly wearing a red balaclava and carrying a rifle concealed in a blanket, confronted staff. It appears there was a struggle, several shots were fired, leaving two dead. It seems no words were exchanged, a police spokesman said. Late yesterday police launched a huge search of the area as helicopters buzzed overhead and heavily armed Special Operations officers scoured bushland behind the factory. The bloody scene was discovered by ambulance officers after they received an emergency call to the industrial estate in Leighton Place, Hornsby, at about 55pm. It is understood the call followed an anonymous report to Hornsby police of two men in a panel van carrying shotguns. Police arrived at the scene to find one man, apparently an employee of the company, dead in the doorway of the factory. Twenty metres away, behind a blue dumpster, a second body lay sprawled. It is unclear, at this stage, whether the man also worked for the factory. A police spokesman said no identification had been found on the body. The third man, who was shot in the arm, was able to provide a description of the alleged attackers to police. The first is described as 40 to 50 years, with fair, receding hair and 178cm tall. The second is slightly taller and was wearing a red balaclava. Another employee, who was apparently working at the back of the factory at the time of the shooting, told detectives he heard a couple of dull thuds like a broomstick hitting concrete, before reaching the front of the premises where he discovered the victims. Police admit they are baffled as to the motive for the attack but suspect it may have been a robbery gone wrong. They have been unable to establish whether anything is missing from the premises. Hornsby patrol commander, Chief Inspector Barry Dening, admitted police he had no idea late yesterday as to the motives for the attack. Anyone with information which may assist police should call Hornsby detectives on 476 Crisis looms at crowded airports By WARWICK BRENNAN SYDNEYS general aviation industry was facing a crisis with airports unable to cope with the increasing light plane traffic, a Federal Airports Corporation FAC official warned yesterday. And the situation was expected to worsen with the closure of Schofields Aerodrome in Sydneys northwest in two weeks. The closure of Schofields, which handled an estimated 20,000 flights a year, would leave only three airports servicing the hundreds of thousands of light aircraft flying in and out of Sydney each year. The FAC warned yesterday that the existing three airports Bankstown, Hoxton Park and Camden Airfield were expected to reach their carrying capacity within the next few years with no room for them to expand. FAC general manager of general aviation Barry Thompson said although safety was not in jeopardy, Schofields had been a desperately needed aerodrome. He said Bankstown airport was already handling about 450,000 general aviation aircraft a year, while Hoxton Park and Camden airfields were both handling about 110,000 and they would be unable to take many more. But without Schofields they would be forced to accommodate the extra flights. Within the next few years those airports will be very close to capacity, he said. On that basis I believe that the retention of Schofields is critical for general aviation because it is necessary to take up the increase in traffic. To build facilities similar to that now would run into the millions of dollars, he said. And thats if you could find the land to do it in the first place. Former head of the Civil Aviation Authority Dick Smith has also criticised the closure. Its a very shortsighted decision, Mr Smith said. When you close down aerodromes like that then obviously we lose the opportunities to employ pilots. The decision to close Schofields has come after the State Government bought the adjacent HMAS Nirimba site from the Federal Government this year for 8 million. The State Government, which is to turn the former navy site into an education precinct, wanted the aerodrome closed saying it was inappropriate to have it near the facilities. Flying operations are to cease at the aerodrome at the end of the month and the site is expected to be cleared out within three weeks of the closure. However, the secretary of Schofields Flying Club, Ron Aitken, said there was no justification for the closure of the aerodrome. There is no valid reason for closing the aerodrome, Mr Aitken said. The noise levels here are below the set standards and none of the flight paths pass over the former HMAS Nirimba site. Tunnel bungle to cost NSW 20m By WARREN OWENS and MICHAEL WILKINS A BUNGLE by the previous Labor Government is set to cost the NSW Government 20 million in back taxes The tax office is auditing the Sydney Harbour Tunnel deal signed in 1987 by the Unsworth government, in which Federal Transport Minister Laurie Brereton was Roads and Public Works Minister. The contract, signed with development consortium partners Transfield and Kumagai, appears to have locked the Government into paying up to 20 million worth of tax deductions claimed by the developers, if the Tax Office reviews its stance. The deductions were guaranteed by the Government as part of the deal. If in future they were deemed unclaimable, former premier Barrie Unsworth and Mr Brereton agreed to have the State pay the money. In 1987 both men ignored Treasury advice to get a tax ruling on the issue before going ahead with the deal. Instead, the Government promised to pay the tunnel companys tax bill, if the tax office pounced and put that promise into law with the tunnel contract. Now the tax offices audit branch has started inquiries, sparked by the NSW AuditorGeneral querying the ownership of the tunnel. The tax office reportedly regards ownership as a key indicator of whether tax deductions should be approved for Government projects. NSW AuditorGeneral Tony Harris angered the Roads and Traffic Authority last year when he queried its annual accounts, arguing the tunnel deal with a private company made the RTA a joint venture partner. Any government project cannot claim tax deductions and the developers should only have claimed half the tax they did. A report by Mr Harris to be tabled in parliament on Tuesday is expected to resolve the issue. His yearlong investigation has been delayed by eight separate RTA legal letters, highlighting the Governments sensitivity over the tunnels finances. The AuditorGenerals report will also focus on the M4 and M5 tollways, but the harbour tunnel will command most attention. His report is expected to urge the Government to give more careful attention to the risks and benefits of deals with private companies to build and operate major public projects. Government officials believe the M4 and M5 contracts showed that key bureaucrats had learnt a lot from earlier experiences about dealing with private venturers. Roads Minister Bruce Baird said it was no surprise there was a problem with Labors contract for the tunnel. We have always had grave reservations about the tunnel deal originally signed by Laurie Brereton, he said. Tenders should have been called for and there should have been greater scrutiny of the process."

        "text": "Australian Copyright Council Mrs P H Peters Senior Lecturer in Linguistics Macquarie University SYDNEY NSW 2109 Ref 920050 Usr Org Txt Prm 26th May 1992 Dear Pam Peters, Thank you for your letter of 14 April. I apologise for the delay in my reply. I also apologise for not being able to attend the class for your graduate students in book editing. I hope the evening was useful for the students. I enclose a list of our more detailed publications. Bulletin 78, Computers and Copyright, would be of particular interest to you as it deals with questions of electrocopying and databases. I understand from your letter that you are concerned that there may be copyright implications in a project involving entering extracts of certain print and broadcast materials onto a database for the purposes of linguistic research. I shall now outline the relevant principles. The materials that you are dealing with are 2,000 word extracts from a variety of sources. These include printed material, including books and magazines, and language from broadcast materials from television and radio. To be protected by copyright, a work must be reduced to some material form, that is written down or recorded in some way. The fact that you are recording the interviews or monologues means that this requirement is satisfied. A written or recorded interview or monologue may be protected by copyright as a literary work, provided it is sufficiently original. Arguably a simple conversation or series of short questions and answers would not have the requisite skill and labour on behalf of the authors to be regarded as a literary work. If, however, its creation involves narrative skill and structure, it would be protected. It is likely that the majority of sources for the extracts will be protected as either literary or dramatic works. There may also be a copyright in the published edition of the works in print. All of these materials are recent and copyright would not have expired. It is then a question of whether the extracts constitute a substantial part of their respective works. While the 2,000word sample does not correspond to any structural unit of the original and ends abruptly, it still may constitute a substantial part of the original work. The test is whether or not the portion taken constitutes an important, recognisable, or distinctive part of the original. It is likely that this would be the case in many of the samples. Indeed, newspapers and other shorter pieces will be included in their entirety. It then must be asked whether the entry and manipulation of such extracts of text into the database would constitute copyright uses. You state in your letter that you will be transcribing the words of the audiovisual material in to a computer readable form that will then be entered on the database. The means of entering the data will be relevant in determining whether the copyright in the published edition will be relevant. Data is generally put into electronic storage in two ways registration by keyboard, that is by transcribing the works. optical registration scanning analogue registration is analogous to photocopying. A scanner registers whole page and once copied, the page and its contents can be manipulated. This form of manipulation is often used in desk top publishing. optical reading a scanner recognises and identifies certain letters or characters and stores them as text. It is possible to edit or manipulate the text as if it had been registered by way of keyboard. Both systems of optical registration can be used simultaneously in the one system. Only in analogue registration is the actual typeface copied. Reproduction The significant use of the material in a computer storage and retrieval system will be by way of reproduction in a material form. This use may occur either when the information is stored in the computer input stage or when it is retrieved output stage or both. Copyright owners can control the input of their materials onto computer storage and retrieval systems if the input is a reproduction in a material form . In the Apple case, the High Court confirmed that computer storage of copyright works is a reproduction in a material form and will generally require permission of the copyright owner. It is not clear whether a publisher is able to control the making of a machine readable copy of the edition by exercise of the published edition copyright. This is because it is possible that this right refers only to reproduction involving a photographic process. Section 88 of the Copyright Act describes the copyright in the published edition as follows For the purposes of this Act, unless the contrary intention appears, copyright, in relation to a published edition of a literary, dramatic, musical or artistic work or of two or more literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works, is the exclusive right to make, by a means that includes a photographic process, a reproduction of the edition. If the restrictive interpretation is accepted, electronic or machine reproduction will not be able to be controlled by a publisher holding only an interest in the published edition. If a wider view is taken that photographic process is one of the processes by which edition may be reproduced publishers will retain this control. I am not sure from your letter whether the texts can be accessed after they have been entered onto the database. If they are to be used for linguistic research or the extraction of data such as frequency statistics of certain key words and the user has no access to the works themselves, then the only activity which may require the copyright owners licence is the initial reproduction of the work for the purpose of selecting and tabulating the frequency of key words. Whether a licence is required depends upon whether a reproduction is made during this process and whether it is in a material form. If the work is reproduced transitorily so that, once the process of selection is completed, it cannot be reproduced, it is unlikely to be in the requisite material form to require the copyright owners licence. Where the whole or a substantial part of the materials input into the system are capable of being retrieved the input is likely to be a copyright use as even though not all the information is reproduced in the output. There may also be other copyright uses of the material in the databases, especially the international database, such as transmission by cable to subscribers, broadcast and adaptation. The fair dealing exception While the use of the materials in this fashion would probably constitute acts comprised in the copyright, you may be able to rely on the fair dealing provisions for research and study. Section 40 allows a fair dealing to be made with a work for the purposes of research or study, without permission from the copyright owners. This use of the work would seem not to involve any reproduction other than the initial input, and would have no effect on the potential market for, or value of the works. Therefore it cold be argued that as the use of the works was purely for linguistic research, this fair dealing section would apply. Thank you for your enquiry. If you have further questions, please let me know. Yours sincerely, Scot Morris, Legal Officer Encl. LETTERHEAD Mrs. P.H. Peters, Macquarie University, SYDNEY NSW 2109 15th August, 1991 Dear Pam Peters, Thankyou for your letter of the 15 July. I apologise for the delay in my reply. I enclose Bulletin 47, Writers and Copyright, and our free pamphlet Copyright in Australia together with a list of our more detailed publications. I understand from our telephone conversation and your letter that you wish to establish how the American version of your work on style and usage fits in with your publishing contract with Macquarie Library Pty. Ltd. The important issues are 1is the American version still the work 2is the sublicence covered by the subsidiary rights 3are you obliged to do the American version 4are you entitled to additional payment for this I shall now outline my view of the relevant clauses. The subject matter of the agreement which you enclose in your letter is defined in clause 1c as the Macquarie Guide to Style Usage which under 1c shall mean and include the first and all subsequent editions thereof including material which may be added in any subsequent edition. You state in your letter that while the arrangements for the Australian edition have yet to be finalised, an American sublicensing deal has already been entered into. This is an unusual state of affairs in that normally sublicensing overseas editions takes place after the original Australian edition has been published. Nevertheless, the rights which are granted to the publisher under 1 are exclusive world wide rights for publishing the work in any form. There is no clause obliging the publisher to publish within a certain date and no restriction on them sublicensing overseas publishers before publishing the Australian edition. The Australian Society of Authors recommends that the Publishers should be under an express obligation to exercise the rights and publish within a specified time no later than eighteen months from the date of delivery, for example. As to whether the alterations you are to make for the American version render it another work which should then be the subject of another agreement, it is a question of fact and degree. If the work is the text written in accordance with the synopsis attached to the publishing contract with minor alterations for the American market, it would not be considered a new work. If the work had been rewritten to the extent that it was substantially different to the manuscript, then arguably it may constitute a separate work and thus require a fresh agreement. From my discussion with you I do not believe this is the case. The question of the additional skill and labour on your behalf in adapting the work for the American market is not directly addressed in the contract. It is unlikely that clause 1 relating to revisions to keep the work uptodate would enable them to require you to adapt the work. Clause 1, which refers to the Publisher being able to request the Author to make such amendments and corrections as it considers advisable is much broader but still would not extend to the American adaptation, in my view. If the publisher were to employ someone else to edit and adapt the work for the American market, they would need to pay for that skill and labour. As such adaptation was not specifically contemplated in the original contract, you may wish to attempt to negotiate additional payment for doing the adaptation. Royalties The royalties payable on an edition licensed to another publisher overseas would come within clause 1i, 50 of net receipts. There is no definition of net receipts nor what deductions the publishers will make before calculating the royalty. If the American publisher is affiliated with Macquarie Library, what then is the basis of payment of licence fees to your publisher There is no clause requiring your consent to licensing agreements. They are under no legal obligation to disclose sublicensing details, but should, as a matter of courtesy give you that information. The royalty payable on the editions published by Macquarie Library eg the Australian edition, is 10 of net receipts under clause There is no information on the publishers discounting practices, nor on the deductions made before determining the net receipts. The royalty rate could potentially be quite low. The ASA recommends that authors are paid an escalating royalty between 1015 of the recommended retail price. In answer to your specific questions aThe fact that the publishers have sublicensed to another publisher and you are to adapt the original manuscript for this purpose does not change the status of the work. Both the original and the American version are the work for purposes of the agreement, in my opinion. bThe royalty rates for any version of the work sublicensed to another publisher are 50 of the net receipts of the licence fees. clause 1i. The royalty for any version published by Macquarie Library ie the Australian version is 10 of the net receipts. cAs the contract did not specifically contemplate adapting the work for other markets, you may wish to attempt to negotiate payment for your work of doing the adaptation."

        "text": "First drive Outback comeback photo Motoring editor BILL McKINNON goes outback to drive the new Jeep Cherokee and some great Volkswagon camper conversions After a nine year absence from this country, Jeep chose to launch its new Cherokee fourwheeldrive wagon in Central Australia, so the proposition we were expected to consider was clear Can an American automotive icon hack it in Australias rugged outback The answer is Yes, but while theres plenty to like about the new Cherokee, both in the bush and around town, it also has some glaring faults. Its certainly well priced. There are two versions of the fivedoor, fiveseater wagon the Sport, at 39,968 and the Limited, at 47, It may come as a surprise, given the American penchant for large cars, that the Cherokee is relatively compact. It is nearly half a metre shorter and sits more than 20 centimetres lower at the roofline than Mitsubishis Pajero, yet ground clearance in comparable. The mechanicals of both models are the same, with a 0 litre inline six cylinder multipoint fuelinjected engine coupled with a fourspeed electronically controlled automatic transmission which can be used in twowheel drive mode, but which also has part and fulltime high range four wheel drive operation and a fourwheeldrive low range. There is a caption Comfort setting for highway cruising, and a Power setting, which hangs onto each gear longer for better acceleration, and like Mitsubishis Pajero, you can shift from twowheel drive into full time fourwheeldrive without having to stop. Both versions of the Cherokee are very wellequipped for their asking price when compared with other fourwheeldrive wagons. On the Sport, airconditioning is standard, plus power steering, windows and mirrors, a leatherwrapped tilt adjustable steering wheel, remote central locking, limited slip differential, four speaker AMFM radio cassette, retractable cargo cover and a roof rack. No other fourwheeldrive wagon on the market under 65,000 offers as much standard equipment as the Limited, which adds ABS, leather upholstery and trim, electrically adjustable front seats, cruise control, alloy wheels, a digital compass and ambient temperature gauge in a roof mounted console, and CD compatible sound system to the Sport package. When it comes to performance, the Cherokee is also a clear winner among the fourwheeldrive wagons. It will cover the 0100 kmh sprint in just over 10 seconds, which is a good 2 seconds clear of the runner up, Toyotas 5 litre RV80, which has a manual transmission. It has abundant, smooth power everywhere, and coupled with the fourspeed auto which hooks up the right ratio very quickly and smoothly the Cherokee is an exceptional drivetrain both on and off road. This outstanding get up and go is attributable in part to the Cherokees light weight 1535kg, a result of its integral bodychassis construction. This seems to have had no effect on strength though on some very poor tracks in Central Australia, it felt solid and flex free. The Cherokees handling, however, doesnt match its performance the ride quality is reasonable, but understeer is pronounced and corrugations can cause both ends of the vehicle to get very untidy. The first shipment of Cherokees has a 21 steering ratio, which is way too low. It seems like several turns of the wheel are necessary before you get the desired result add to this an almost complete absence of road feel, plus massive overassistance, and the Cherokee could become a very unpleasant handful if you needed to take quick evasive action. Later shipments will have a more direct 141 ratio which should be much better. The interior of the Cherokee is reasonably spacious considering its compact exterior dimensions, but in other respects its a real let down. The driver faces a dash and a steering wheel that are ergonomic disasters straight out of the 1960s, with switches and controls all over the place, many of which are obscured or difficult to operate. Cheap and nasty plastic and trim materials, poor quality fittings, seats which sag like theyre 10 years old and, would you believe, fake woodgrain dash and door trim on the Limited complete what is a very sorry picture. If a Japanese or Australian manufacturer released a 1994 model with an interior of this style, layout and quality they would be laughed at. Overall, the Cherokee offers plenty of performance and standard equipment for your money, but in other respects its a long, long way from being up with the 1990s fourwheeldrive design standards. Trakka is a Sydneybased company which specialises in camper conversions. It uses Volkswagen Transporter vans, Toyota HiAce vans and the Toyota 75 Series Landcruiser four wheel drive as the base vehicles and outfits each to several specification levels, selling the final products with a full manufacturers warranty. photo caption Trakkas Volkswagen campervan lineup starts with the standard Multivan, at 30,500 for the 60 kW two litre four cylinder manual, or 35,000 for the 81 kW 5 litre 5 cylinder. Its a simple rear seat to fold down bed conversion, which seats five people. The Standard Camper, at 43,500, 5 48,000 is a campervan in the true sense of the word, with a popup roof on hydraulic struts, curtains, storage drawers, a table, a 70 litre water tank, a 68 litre fridge which runs off mains or 12 volt power, two burner metho. stove, a sink, 240 volt power plug, plus a battery charger and an auxiliary battery. The sink, stove and fridge are housed in moulded plastic units. The Deluxe 49,500 5 54,000 adds swivelling front seats, an extra table, an AMFM radio cassette and moulded plastic interior linings throughout. Whats inside The Volkswagen Transporter has come a long way since the original rear engined Kombi with the split windscreen and the flat four engine. The 1994 VW Transporter is front wheel drive, and the engine is mounted carstyle in front of the driver. It has fully independent suspension all round, power steering, disc frontdrum rear brakes, an 80 litre fuel tank, and a cargo area of 6 x 5 metres, which is more than enough for a spacious, wellequipped camper conversion. In overall size, the Transporter is shorter and narrower than Toyotas Tarago, though slightly taller at 94 metres. Its very easy to drive, with excellent vision all round, and adequate performance from the 5 litre version. The test vehicle used a four speed auto transmission, and averaged 4 litres100 km on the highway. Steering, handling and ride quality is excellent for a vehicle of this type, particularly on rougher country roads. Some of the controls are awkward to use, notably the automatic shifter which is too short, and poorly positioned too close to the drivers seat, and the brakes require plenty of pedal effort, but quality is impressive the Transporter feels very solid, and gives the impression that it will continue the Kombi tradition of lasting a long time no matter what you throw at it. The Caravelle is the top of the line Transporter, with 5 litre 5 cylinder engine as standard, double wishbone suspension up front, plus features like electric mirror and windows, antiintrusion side bars in the front doors, central locking, cruise controls and a sixspeaker radio cassette. In original form, it is designed as a people mover, with three rows of seats capable of carrying seven. Trakka has used the Caravelle as the basis for its Caravelle Camper, which is similarly equipped to the Deluxe, and seats five. It costs 59,000, or 61,700 with the fourspeed auto. Theres plenty of room inside, and with the poptop raised, taller people can stand comfortably. The front seats swivel around to face the living area, and you can walk through from the front seats to this section as well. All of Trakkas interior fittings and mouldings are high quality, and in this regard the Caravelle Camper feels like a VW factory conversion, not an aftermarket one. Access to the fridge, stove and sink is easy, and the stove swings out of the vehicle so you can cook outside. The double bed is very easy to set up, but its 10 centimetres too short for six footers, and not particularly comfortable, either, with too many contours and insufficient padding. Trakka is working on improving the design with the campers currently in production. If you dont like the idea of towing a caravan or trailer, and the prospect of sleeping in a tent doesnt thrill you either, a Volkswagenbased Trakka campervan is the ideal compromise and the most convenient twoperson touring package on wheels. Towards 2000 Bill McKinnon looks at four cars which point the way to the future of motoring The 1990s may well go down in history as the decade in which the car developed a social conscience. The realisation better late than never that more compact, space efficient and environmentally friendly cars are necessary and not just a good idea has seen the development of such vehicles accelerate over the past few years. In fact, several major European manufacturers have developed models which are genuine working prototypes of the vehicles well be driving before the year Volkswagen, Europes largest car maker, has long used its trusty Golf hatchback, Europes best selling car for the past 11 years, to experiment with alternatives to conventional engines. Last year it released the Golf Ecomatic, the first production car to offer a fully automatic system that turns the engine off when its not required during driving. At the heart of the Ecomatic system is a vacuum servo clutch, which disengages whenever the accelerator is released, and electronics which switch the engine off and start it again when the accelerator is depressed or a gear is engaged. Traffic beater The Ecomatics forte is city traffic. When idling on Sydney roads, for example, the Ecomatic uses no fuel and produces no exhaust emissions as the engine only runs when the car is moving. The Ecomatic uses a diesel engine, which compared to a petrol model produces fewer hydrocarbon emissions, comparable oxides of nitrogen but more particulate emissions soot. A system of pumps and an upgraded battery maintain power to the brakes and the steering when the engine is switched off, and lights, indicators, instruments and the heater continue to work at all times. Volkswagen claim a fuel economy figure of 6 litres100 km in urban conditions, an improvement of 22 percent on a conventional Golf diesel. It also says hydrocarbon and oxides of nitrogen emissions are down by 22 and 25 percent respectively, and carbon monoxide emissions are reduced by 38 percent. Although there are no immediate plans in Australia to import the Ecomatic, it is on sale in Europe, where a British panel of environmental and technical experts photo caption declared it the most significant contribution to the environment launched in At the Detroit Motor Show in January, Volkswagen revealed its Concept One, a 21st century interpretation of the VW Beetle, which is designed to test whether theres a market for a new Peoples Car. Upbeat Beetle Volkswagen believes that consumers are intimidated and confused by alternative energy choices in cars. The idea is to lessen this technophobia by wrapping the technology in an exterior design that takes its cues from past models. The stylists have hit the spot with the Concept One it looks just as lovable and friendly as the original Vee Dub. The Concept One is only 8 metres long and uses frontwheel drive. Driver and front seat passenger airbags and antilock brakes are fitted and the interior includes air conditioning and leather upholstery. Three drivetrains are available a 50kW three cylinder version of the Ecomatic diesel, as fitted to the Golf, a dieselelectric hybrid, and electric power only. The dieselelectric hybrid offers the best option. In the city, where performance is less important, you can use the 18 kW electric motor. Top speed in this mode is 100 kmh. On the open road, the diesel engine gives a top speed of 168 kmh. The 1993 Frankfurt Motor Show saw BMW and MercedesBenz release their versions of motoring, late 1990s style. photoThe MercedesBenz Vision A 93 is one of several smaller vehicles which the worlds oldest car maker is developing for those who drive predominantly in the city."

        "text": "The tropical circulation in the AustralianAsian region May to October 1989 P.W.Bate Regional Office, Bureau of Meteorology, Darwin, Australia Manuscript received September 1990 revised October 1990 The tropical circulation from 70degreeE to the dateline is examined for the months May to October A positive phase of the Southern Oscillation, which developed during 1988, continued to dissipate during this period, though some anomalies typical of a positive phase persisted. The southwest monsoon in the northern hemisphere was slightly underdeveloped and withdrew early from the Indian subcontinent. Monsoonal rainfall was below average in a large part of the south Asian land mass. Eastern Australia experienced heavy rainfall early in the season, while drought conditions became evident later in some areas. The number of tropical cyclones was above average. Introduction This summary discusses the tropical circulation during the period May to October 1989 in the area of synoptic analysis responsibility of the Darwin Regional Specialised Meteorological Centre RSMC, that is, from 70degreeE to 180degree. Characteristics of the 1989 season are compared with longterm means, salient features of which are described by Garden et al. 1989. Lower and upper tropospheric flows, mean sea level pressures MSLP, and seasurface temperatures SST are examined in the context of the phase of the El NinaccentoSouthern Oscillation ENSO. Upper level divergence and the seasonal variation of convection are also studied. Finally, a number of regional climate features are discussed, namely tropical cyclones, the Indian monsoon and north Australian rainfall. Previous summaries in this series have benefited by collaboration with authors from the Malaysian Meteorological Service. As this was not possible in the present case, there is no detailed description of the east Asian monsoon. All date sources used are listed in the Appendix, and are referred to in the text where appropriate. Seasonal mean charts, from the tropical analysis scheme TAS of Davidson and McAvaney 1981, were averaged over two threemonth periods May to July 1989 MJJ and August to October 1989 ASO. Time series of velocity potential and outgoing longwave radiation OLR, published in Darwin Tropical Diagnostic Statements see Appendix, suggested that such a division was appropriate in terms of the distribution of tropical convective activity during the season. SST anomalies were calculated from the climatology of Reynolds 1983. Broadscale seasonal circulation Southern Oscillation Figure 1 shows the behaviour of Troups Southern Oscillation Index SOI from January 1980 to October 1989 and its fivemonth running mean to August This period was chosen to depict the two significant positive excursions during the decade. After a prolonged period of positive values during much of 1988, the smoothed SOI declined during the season. Keith et al. 1991 noted a trend for cool eastern Pacific SST anomalies to decrease toward the end of the previous six months while Mo 1989 observed that oceanic and atmospheric patterns in the tropical Pacific were returning toward normal during March to May However, some anomalies typical of a positive phase of the SOI hereafter called positive ENSO event persisted well into the season. Seasurface temperature The SST anomaly pattern, shown in Fig. 2 for the 3month periods MJJ and ASO, remained remarkably stable over the six months. Warm anomalies dominated the area and were strongest about the southern and western Australian coasts and throughout the Indonesian archipelago. Positive departures, initially evident about the eastern Australian coast and southwest Pacific, were weaker and further north in ASO. A cool anomaly, apparent at first in the north Pacific to the southeast of Japan, weakened steadily through the season. These patterns display broad similarities to those given by Butterworth et al. 1990 for the corresponding periods in 1988 both seasons were characterised by positive SOI. The maps also show generally positive anomalies in regions where most of the tropical cyclones formed refer Fig. 12. An inspection of SST charts published in the Climate Diagnostics Bulletin CDB and Monthly Report on Climate System MRCSsee Appendix indicated that the magnitude of negative anomalies in the equatorial central and eastern Pacific declined throughout the period, as might also be expected during this phase of ENSO. Mean sea level pressure Figures 3 and 4 show, respectively, 3month averages and anomalies of MSLP. The anomaly charts were based on monthly CLIMAT messages in conjunction with longterm station means, with additional data from MRCS, CDB and Australian region gridpoint analysis data from the National Meteorological Centre, Melbourne. Pressures at low latitudes were generally near average throughout the season. During MJJ positive anomalies over India and China indicate a slightly weaker than normal monsoon trough the negative anomaly surrounding the Philippines perhaps reflects the presence of tropical cyclones. Over much of Australasia belowaverage pressures were consistent with a positive SOI, while the subtropical ridge in the Indian Ocean was strongly developed. In ASO the monsoon trough east of the South China Sea was better developed than in MJJ, though over India it remained generally weaker than average. Tropospheric flow Figures 5, 6, 7 and 8 show charts of the mean flow and vector wind anomalies for MJJ and ASO at 950 hPa and 200 hPa. At 950 hPa the anomaly patterns appear to indicate that the major tropical wind regimes were weaker than normal, as anomalies were largely opposite in direction to the longterm flows. The anomaly fields should be interpreted with caution some of the anomalies are similar to those found in corresponding periods in the years 1986 to 1988 Kingston et al. 1987 Garden et al. 1989 Butterworth et al. 1990, a period which encompassed both positive and negative ENSO events. They include anticyclonic and easterly anomalies over the Indian subcontinent and the Bay of Bengal, and westerlies in the southern Indian Ocean and low latitude northwest Pacific. At 200 hPa, west to southwesterly anomalies at low latitudes west of 12OdegreeE, particularly over the Bay of Bengal, and cyclonic and east to southeasterly anomalies over the southern Indian Ocean were similar to those found in 1987 and All this suggests biases in either the climatological fields Atkinson and Sadler 1970 Sadler 1975 or the TAS, but it is not possible to ascribe them with certainty to either source. A comparison of the TAS with ECMWF analyses at 850 hPa and 200 hPa for June to August 1984 Hendon 1988, however, identified no obvious biases. Despite the reservations regarding wind anomalies, the MSLP and 950 hPa fields are broadly geostrophically consistent in most regions. During MJJ the monsoon circulation was somewhat underdeveloped over continental Asia, as already noted in reference to the pressure anomaly fields. The pattern at 200 hPa in the western Pacific, with equatorial westerly anomalies and subtropical easterlies, is well correlated with positive SOI Selkirk 1984. The monsoon circulation over the northwest Pacific was not strongly developed, the upper ridge lying well north of the monsoon trough. By ASO the monsoon circulation east of 100degreeE had moved closer to an average state with very small anomalies at 200 hPa. There appeared little change in the monsoon circulation over south Asia and the Indian Ocean. In the northwest Pacific the 200 hPa ridge axis and 950 hPa monsoon trough axis were more closely coupled than before. Light southeast trades about north Australia were consistent with lower than normal pressures. The crosssections in Figs 9, 10 and 11 also illustrate the change in the northwest Pacific. In ASO upper northerly return flow across the equator increased east of 100degreeE and slightly decreased west of 100degreeE Fig. 9, while zonal components show an improvement in monsoonal flows at 130degreeE but a slight weakening at 100degreeE, reflecting the early retreat of the Indian monsoon reported in MRCS November 1989. Tropical cyclones During May to October 1989, 29 tropical cyclones TCs defined as having maximum 10minute mean winds of at least 17 m s1, or named systems were analysed by Darwin RSMC. Of these, 26 occurred in the northern hemisphere. Tracks are shown in Fig. 12 these include the prestorm depression stages. Details of periods of occurrence and maximum winds are given in Table A factor of 88 was used to convert maximum winds for northern hemisphere cyclones from 1minute to 10minute means. Northern hemisphere Comparisons of northern hemisphere TC occurrence with climatological statistics from Joint Typhoon Warning Center Guam JTWC, 1989, are given in Table In the Pacific both TC and typhoon occurrences were above average and more frequent than in May to October 1988 Butterworth et al. 1990. This confirms the work of Chan 1985, who found that the phase of the SOI leads northwest Pacific typhoon occurrence by approximately 11 months. The statistics also lend support to the finding of Gray 1988 that northwest Pacific TC activity tends to increase in easterly phase quasibiennial oscillation QBO years. The QBO was in an easterly phase during 1989, reaching a peak late in the year CDB, January 1990. Table 2 shows that in ASO a much greater proportion of northwest Pacific TCs intensified to become typhoons than in MJJ. As noted previously, by ASO the axis of the 200 hPa ridge over the north Pacific had become more closely coupled with the lowlevel monsoon trough axis, particularly east of 140degreeE. Thus vertical organisation was improved, providing a more favourable broadscale environment for TC intensification. Divergence between the north Pacific tropical uppertropospheric trough, which was well developed for the whole season Fig. 7, and the neighbouring upper ridge also had a strong influence on TC genesis and intensification. This was particularly so in October, when all of the six TCs two continuing from September became typhoons two of them supertyphoons. Northern hemisphere TC genesis events from June to October 1989 are superimposed on a timelongitude section of 200 hPa velocity potential in Fig. Events were generally clustered about higher magnitudes of negative velocity potential, which are taken as a proxy for broadscale upper divergence. The velocity potential periodicity reflects broadly the MaddenJulian 1971, 1972 oscillations. Gray 1988 noted that genesis events tended to be grouped in alternating active and inactive phases of variable length, and that these showed some correspondence with the 40 to 60day oscillation in a number of parameters. The Bay of Bengalnorth Indian Ocean is a comparatively small basin and TCs are less common Table 2. At least five tropical depressions developed in this area during the five months May to September, four of them in MJJ of this number only two intensified to TCs. One of these was analysed by the India Meteorological Department data available for June to September as a tropical storm for less than 12 hours on 22 July shown as Unnamed in Table 1 and in brackets in Table 2 it produced flood rains as it traversed India. This storm was not analysed as such by either Darwin RSMC or JTWC, so comparison with longterm statistics is not strictly valid. Southern hemisphere Three lateseason TCs developed, two in May in the Pacific and one in July in the Indian Ocean. Statistics given by JTWC 1989 for the combined south Indiansouthwest Pacific basins for the years 19811988, show averages which may include depressions below TC intensity of 9 occurrences in May and 4 in July. All three TCs developed in an environment of above average SST. Velocity potential time series for the latitude band 5degreeS15degreeS not shown also displayed peaks near the times of genesis of the three southern hemisphere TCs, most notably for the Indian Ocean occurrence in July. The southern hemisphere series was generally in phase with the northern hemisphere series shown at Fig. 13, indicating that 30 to 60day oscillations evidently had some effect in the winter hemisphere. Broadscale vertical motion and convection Maps of velocity potential at 950 hPa and 200 hPa are shown in Figs 14 and Note that a zero boundary condition is applied at the analysis domain edges. The most important feature diagnosed by these maps is the relative shift in the axes of maximum positive 950 hPa and negative 200 hPa velocity potential. In the northern hemisphere these were in closer vertical alignment in ASO, suggesting improved organisation of the broadscale vertical motion in the monsoonal region, confirming previous observations."

        "text": "WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT DIY PAVING caption Good planning is the key to successful doityourself home paving. Thats the advice from the Queensland paving manager of pgh Clay Bricks and Pavers, Chris Sheehan. Homeowners most successful at doityourself paving are those who plan their project thoroughly from the outset. Proper planning makes the difference between a doityourself paving job that looks professional and one that leaves the homeowner disappointed, says Chris Sheehan. The first step in successful doityourself paving is ensuring all the materials are at hand to perform the work successfully. These items include wooden stakes and string to mark off the area to be paved, two screed rails 3040mm thick, a suitable screed board, sharp washed medium river sand, paver joint sand, a rubber hammer, a spirit level, brickcutting equipment and your choice of pavers. The next major step involves preparing the ground for the pavers. This preparation is critical to the longterm appearance and durability of the paving. You next need to select the desired level for the finished pavers. Once this is decided, drive four stakes into the ground around the area to be paved. Run string lines between the four stakes to the desired surface level, establish a datum and adjust for drainage fall. This surface must be smooth and wellcompacted. Spread sand on to the area to be paved and then screed the sand to ensure a flat surface. The bedding sand should be about 40mm deep. A partial compaction of the bedding sand is sometimes preferred to insure a uniform base. Laying the paver is the next step. Chris Sheehan recommends starting in one corner and laying the pavers flatly on to the sand, with a 24mm gap between pavers. The herring bone pattern is strongest. It may be necessary to cut some of the pavers using a lump hammer and brick bolster, hiring a paver splitter or using a masonry saw. To ensure that the pavers are well secured, you should pour concrete footings along the photo photo photo perimeter of the paver 10mm below the paver surface. The next important step involves compacting the pavers with some jointfilling sand swept between the joints to minimise chipping during compaction. A rubber mallet and piece of timber can be used for smaller walkway areas. For driveways and larger walkway areas a mechanical plate vibrator is recommended. Use a piece of carpet or a sheet of plywood beneath the vibrator to reduce paver damage. The final step in doityourself paving involves filling in the cracks between the pavers. A special joint sand needs to be spread over the surface of the pavers and swept until all the joints are full. caption photo photo caption MAKE YOUR OWN FASHIONABLE 4PANEL SCREEN The portable screen is one of the handiest pieces of furniture you can own. Used as a decorative element in a room, as a backdrop to a chair or in front of a disused fireplace, such a screen is a truly versatile decor item. Ideal for subtly camouflaging a messy corner or helping to create a false wall near an entrance, a screen also enables you to change the mood of a room. Our easytomake screen with its fabric mantle is inexpensive to build and its decorative impact is limited only by your own personal taste. To make this simple fourpanelled screen you will need the following materials 8 pieces of light timber, for example pine, about 1850mm long suggested depth 19mm, width 40mm 8 pieces 440mm long which fit inside top and bottom 6 small hinges, which do not require a chiselledout recess. We used 50mm nonmortice hinges wood glue staple gun and a box of staples drill with bit and screws around 40mm long, or hammer and nails about 60mm long 4 metres of fabric no less that 130cm wide.We used John Kaldors new Riviera Collection in malachite colour.If you wish to make a double sided screen you will require another 4 metres of fabric STEPS Assemble materials. Position the wood. Measure the length you want the feet to be at the bottom and make sure it is the same for each frame then photo glue in place and screw or hammer in nails, etc. Because we used cotton we were able to tear fabric to size making sure we had enough to fold over the edges of the wood and also for a hem which is tucked under so no raw edges show or fray. Staple fabric in the middle of sides then go around stapling it firmly in place. Fold corners under neatly and tear fabric up between the feet and tuck it up and around the edges. Take special care stapling the backing fabric if used neatly over the frame, covering the previous staples. Attach hinges to alternate sides making sure the shaft faces outwards and that the panels are in the correct order. Be careful because this can be confusing. NOTE Wind extra fabric around feet or use braid to decorate the feet and edges of the panels. The material can be varnished for a strong, glossy finish with a coating such as Bristols water based Easy Clear Interior Timber Finish, which does not dry tacky. The approximate cost to make the screen is 40 plus fabric.

The bad news is that the only way to get rid of your mortgage sooner is to plough more money into it. Now lets have the good news. You dont have to plough in a lot of money to make a big difference and it need not be in one lump sum. A small but regular trickle will ultimately have a big impact. A variable rate fixedterm loan, or standard home loan, is still the most popular mortgage arrangement for owneroccupiers and thats most of us. This is the usual loan offered by banks and building societies. Repayments, usually monthly, are the same throughout the term of the loan, changing only with the rise and fall in interest rates. Each repayment consists of interest and principal. In early repayments the proportion of interest is higher and the proportion of principal is lower than in later repayments when the opposite applies. Before the deregulation of banking there wasnt much flexibility in the standard home loan offered by our major lenders. Increased competition between banks has changed all that. And thats the other piece of good news, you can tailor your mortgage repayments to suit you, rather than the bank. Theres a whole new range of options to consider and that doesnt just apply to new loans. Existing borrowers can alter the terms of their loan to suit their changing requirements. You can pay more now and less later on, you can pay more often, you can increase your repayments by small annual increments, you can make a lump sum payment at any time, and you can even use your savings toa offset your interest. Any one of these methods will save you thousands of dollars in the long run and shorten the term of your loan. If youve been making regular repayments and just managing to make ends meet, youve probably put the mortgage options into the toohard basket. Its understandable in tough economic periods but perhaps its time to reassess your situation. Here are some of the options Pay more now and less later on Its not for everyone, but if youre a dualincome couple who dont plan to have children for a while then shop around for highstart loans. As the name indicates, the monthly repayments are higher when the loan begins than they would be for a standard loan, giving you the advantage of paying off the loan more quickly when you have the benefit of two incomes and paying less interest in the long run. If one partner gives up work you revert to normal loan terms. Change your payment schedule Incredible as it may seem, changing your payment schedule from monthly to fortnightly or even weekly can save you tens of thousands of dollars in interest payments over the life of a home loan."

        "text": "Marine mammals and conservation in the Antarctic marine system This paper was presented at a plenary session of the 6th International Theriological Mammal Conference held at the University of New South Wales in July, M. M. Bryden Department of Veterinary Anatomy, University of Sydney,NSW 2006 The principal factor affecting the antarctic marine ecosystem in the last 70 years has been, undoubtedly, exploitation of the great whales. Five species of rorquals Mysticeti Balaenopteridae see Fig. 1, front cover are widely distributed and are sympatric in the Southern Ocean Fig. 2 during the summer feeding phase of the annual cycle. They are the blue, fin, sei, humpback and minke whales. In the 60year period 192526 to 198485, more than one million of these five species of whales were killed in the Southern Ocean, and more of some species of these southern rorquals mainly humpback whales were killed in lower latitudes during their winter breeding migrations. In less than 50 years, the populations of blue, fin, sei and humpback whales were reduced by 90 per cent or more. It has been said that blue whales have been depleted to about 1 per cent of their prewhaling numbers, but data are insufficient to substantiate such claims. We have some evidence that humpback whales, at least in some areas were depleted as severely as that. Minke whales were not killed during most of this period, as they were considered too small to sustain a viable industry. It was only near the end of the whaling period, when numbers of the large rorquals had been reduced so drastically, that some minke whales were taken. The principal food item for all these species, as well as some species of seals, sea birds, fish, and larger invertebrates such as certain squid, is krill. The term krill is a Scandinavian word meaning whale food, but in the antarctic context, krill and the genus Euphausia are virtually synonymous, because the huge swarms of organisms that comprise the food of rorquals and other krill predators are made up largely over 90 of the single species Euphausia superba. There has been some argument about the relative importance of krill in the antarctic marine ecosystem, as research has revealed more details of the system. There is no doubt, however, that along with copepods, euphausiids are the dominant organisms in the zooplankton of antarctic marine waters. Krill is still regarded as the key trophic intermediary between primary production and many higher vertebrate consumers in the Southern Ocean Fig. 3. This view is supported strongly by the work of Rau et al. 1992, who demonstrated a similarity between the anticipated range of vertebrate dietary nitrogen 15, and nitrogen 15 content of antarctic krill. In the Southern Ocean, krill Euphausia superba, Fig. 4, see colour section, forms huge swarms where phytoplankton blooms occur, especially near ocean upwellings. In coastal regions swarms of Euphausia crystallorophias occur. The major mammalian krill predators are the crabeater seals Lobodon carcinophagus, of which there are approximately 15 million, and in some regions at least, antarctic fur seals Arctocephalus gazella. See Figures 5 and 6 see colour section. Major shifts in the balance of the various Southern Ocean predators have occurred in recent years, probably as a direct result of the depletion of the great whales. Among the mammals there is good evidence that numbers of at least some rorquals, crabeater seals and antarctic fur seals increased dramatically from the 1950s to the 1980s. Allied to these shifts in relative abundance of krill predators, increased in the pregnancy rates of fin and sei whales, and a possibledecrease in their age at sexual maturity, were observed. Age at sexual maturity of crabeater seals and possibly minke whales also appeared to have declined Fig. 7, and there is some evidence that the present crabeater seal and minke whale population levels are significantly greater than those existing before intensive southern whaling began. Some increases in populations of krill predators have been dramatic. The Antarctic fur seal population at South Georgia showed a 1417 per cent increase annually for several years. There may have been a levelling off of some of these population shifts in recent years. In the early 1970s, concern was raised about the potential effects of exploitation of krill for human consumption. This enormous resource was viewed as having the potential to overcome a perceived worldwide shortage of animal protein. Removal of large amounts of krill from antarctic waters, it was argued, may adversely affect the recovery of whale stocks. A krill fishery has been operating in antarctic waters for over 20 years. A total of more than 5 million tonnes of krill was harvested from 1973 to 1992 see Fig. 8. While this catch has been limited, and is unlikely to increase significantly in the immediate future, future increase could be expected to have a major impact on the balance of species within the antarctic marine system. Chittleborough 1984 estimated that in the undisturbed prewhaling period, baleen whales consumed about 180 million tonnes of Antarctic krill per year. This is greater than the combined consumption by seals, birds and fish. The current depleted whale population consumes an estimated 40 million tonnes per year. This is about 80 times the 1982 maximum commercial catch of krill, and about eight times the total commercial krill catch over 20 years. If we take the simplest view, it means also that approximately 140 million tonnes of Antarctic krill annually are available for consumption by predators in Antarctic waters that were not available before whaling began. Other species, particularly fin fish and squid,are harvested in significant numbers in some regions, particularly the southern Atlantic Ocean. These activities potentially can affect certain specific higherlevel predators, but some of these harvested species are themselves predators on krill so their removal may remove some of the pressure from the mammalian krill predators. In contrast to the apparently dramatic increases in populations of krill predators, in recent years there has been a decline in numbers of southern elephant seals in the Southern Ocean. Elephant seals are not predators of krill, but they do feed on species that are themselves dependent on krill see Fig.3. The decline has not been uniform whereas elephant seal populations in the southern Pacific and Indian Ocean regions have declined by 50 per cent in the last 30 years or so, the southern Atlantic Ocean population has remained static over the same period. The simplest explanation for these shifts in the balance of populations and species of mammals is that it is foodderived. It could be argued that the greater availability of krill as a result of the very great reduction in biomass of krill predators, in the form of the great whales, has allowed the other krill predators crabeater seals, fur seals to increase. If the system were as simple as that, a possible result would be a longterm increase in the populations of species with relatively short breeding and life cycles, such as these seals. This would accompany a slower increase in numbers of rorquals, and possibly stabilization of populations at lower than prewhaling levels, because they have a lower fecundity and therefore are unable to compete well in the race to exploit the abundance of krill. With regard to southern elephant sealswhich are not krill predators, if the same were true we would expect to observe the population declines in areas where greatest commercial exploitation of their food components has occurred. How do these proposals line up with the facts Two lines of research are being done in Australia to examine these proposals. Southern Elephant Seals The first is a study of southern elephant seals by Dr Mark Hindell, who did some of the work while a PhD. student and has continued it in the University of Tasmania. Southern elephant seals breed on subantarctic islands, at latitudes of about 50degree to 60degreeS Fig. 9. They breed in harems in the austral spring Fig. 10 see colour section. Although they breed on subantarctic islands, these animals are part of the antarctic marine system, because they feed for the most part at least close to the antarctic continent. Studies using timedepthtemperature recorders Fig. 11ac see colour section have revealed that adult elephant seals make two return trips of up to 1600 km each year. Following the breeding season they go south to the feeding areas Fig. 12. About three months after the breeding season they return to the subantarctic islands to moult, after which they go again to the antarctic feeding areas. Some animals, mainly nonbreeding bulls, moult on the antarctic continent itself. At present, knowledge of the diet of elephant seals is limited. It is believed to consist of approximately 75 per cent cephalopods mainly squid and 25 per cent fish. The remoteness of the feeding areas makes it extremely difficult to quantify the composition of the diet, but recent qualitative studies Green and Burton 1993 have shown that several species of fish and cephalopods are consumed. They further show that diet varies at least qualitatively with season. Recently we have examined the energetic needs of captive southern elephant seals at Taronga Zoo in Sydney. By comparing the activity budgets of the captive and freeranging animals, we arrived at estimates of the energetic needs of freeranging elephant seals. These and earlier, less rigid studies, indicate that elephant seals are significant consumers within the antarctic marine system Table 1. The elephant seal population in the southern Pacific Ocean sector declined at an annual rate of approximately 2 per cent for 20 years until the mid1980s, but seems to be stabilising now Fig 13. Similar rates of decline occurred in the southern Indian Ocean population, but not in the southern Atlantic. Major fishing for squid and fin fish has occurred in the southern Atlantic, but not the Pacific and Indian Oceans, so the declines in elephant seal numbers cannot be attributed simply to reduction in food. Hindell discussed several possibilities in the Macquarie Island population, and concluded that the decline may be a correction following an overshoot in the recovery of the population from extreme exploitation late last century and early this century. To my mind this is the most plausible argument, although others have been put forward. Whichever is correct, I believe it is fair to say that the declines are probably not simply foodderived. Because the reasons for the decline are not know with certainty, continued monitoring of populations of southern elephant seals, and intensive studies of their feeding and ranging patterns, are essential. Humpback Whales The second research project is centred on surveys of humpback whales on Australias east coast. All southern rorquals feed in antarctic waters in the austral summer, and migrate north to tropical waters to breed in winter. Humpbacks have the convenient habit of following coastlines as they migrate, like the gray whales that migrate along the coastline of the west coast of the USA to and from Baja California. On Australias east coast, they are particularly cooperative in that they remain very close inshore, at least in some parts of the coast, and like gray whales they can be counted from the shore. These humpback whales form a major part of what is known as Area V humpback stock see Fig. 14. The population was depleted severely in the period 195163, when shorebased whaling stations were operating at Byron Bay and Tangalooma. Some whales were also taken in antarctic waters in the summer months during the same period. The original population in 1951 was estimated by Chittleborough 1965 to be approximately 10 000 whales. PhD. student Miranda Brown has been looking at the figures again, and there are suggestions that it may have been considerably more than that, even as high as 20 It was believed to be reduced to approximately 200 whales by 1963 Chapman 1974. If these figures are correct, then this population was depleted to about 1 per cent of its original size by whaling. Aerial surveys were conducted in the years 198082, during the northward migration, to determine the width of the migration corridor Figs 15 and 16."

        "text": "Language skills need developing THE federal Minister for Education, Mr Dawkins, annoyed academics recently when he said Australia was a monolingual nation. As the academics pointed out, some 200 Aboriginal and community languages are spoken in Australia in addition to English. In Melbourne, more than a quarter of the population regularly use a language other than English. However, there is one group that does tend to be monolingual, according to Professor Barry Leal, and that is the business community. In a report on language education published this week, Professor Leal, deputy vicechancellor of Macquarie University, says there is a generation of monolingual Australians in management positions who have had minimal contact with any foreign language and who are culturally and linguistically inept when dealing with foreigners. Professor Leal says the inability of our business leaders to speak foreign languages is a defect that we can no longer tolerate. He is right. Australia may take pride in its multiculturalism but it does relatively little to promote the teaching and study of foreign languages. Many schools treat language teaching as a luxury, concentrating on subjects such as physics, mathematics or economics which feed directly into careeroriented tertiary courses. Why should Australians bother to learn Chinese, Japanese, Arabic or European languages For one thing, it is no longer safe to assume that English is, or will continue to be, the dominant lingua franca of business and trade. For another, this country must become more exportoriented, and communication skills are the key to international salesmanship. We can no longer insist that our trading partners do business with us in English. There is much to be said for Professor Leals view that foreign languages should again be compulsory in schools, and that they should be incorporated into tertiary business and management courses. Until we upgrade our language skills, Australia will continue to undersell itself. Kohl no longer such a merry old soul FIVE months ago, Helmut Kohl was a heroic electoral victor, first Chancellor of the modern united Germany. Today he contemplates a humiliating defeat in a state election that has cost his Christian Democrats their majority in the upper house of Federal Parliament, and damaged the reputation that Mr Kohl had put on the line. Pressing economic issues played an important part in the CDUs loss of RhinelandPalatinate, heartland of both the Chancellor and his party. Most important was growing unease at economic fallout from reunification and a sense that the Chancellor has mishandled the issue. While it is too early to read portending personal or party disaster into the election result, it seems certain to force significant changes in the CDUs governing style. The easy answer to questions about reasons for the weekend turnaround in favour of the opposition Social Democrats is taxation. At the time of unification, Mr Kohl promised that West Germans taxes would not rise to pay for union with the East. It has now been revealed that imposts must increase to help accommodate an Eastern bloc that is in worse economic not to mention psychological shape than many realised. Higher taxes have brought fears of rising inflation and price destabilisation in the West. Mr Kohl is now seen in many quarters as having rushed the two nations overhastily into matrimony. He has also been rudely awakened to the fact that he will no longer solely be dictating the course of the marriage. The SPD, adding another of the lander to its belt, has strengthened its position to insist on a say in unification policy. Even more humiliating for Mr Kohl, the Free Democrats, who support him in coalition, are reported to be contemplating a renewed link with the SPD. Their continued loyalty will command a high price. The Christian Democrats must also consider ways of broadening their own appeal, even if this means weakening the oneman hold of King Kohl. The risky resurrection of Jeff Kennett AS a political ambush, the coup that restored Jeff Kennett to the Liberal leadership in Victoria yesterday had all the essential elements of surprise, shock and success. It was conceived in secrecy, sprung in stealth and executed with ruthless efficiency. Having a stab at the leadership has been a recurrent ritual in the Victorian parliamentary Liberal Party since the retirement of the inimitable Sir Henry Bolte, but the participants have usually lacked the numeracy or dexterity to slay rather than wound their victims. In the autumn of 1989, party malcontents sank their blades into the scarred back of Jeff Kennett, hitherto the survivor of sixandahalf frustrating years as Opposition Leader. Lacking a more acceptable candidate, the party promoted Mr Kennetts less than illustrious lieutenant, Alan Brown, as his successor. Now a restive party has knifed Mr Brown and his deputy, Alan Stockdale. This is perhaps less astonishing than the decision to resurrect the very leader whom it butchered with similar brutality nearly two years ago. The Liberals were driven by a hunger for power unmitigated by personal sentiment. Loyal support to a leader is regarded as an essential virtue only so long as the leader is perceived to be effective. More often than not, the party yearns for a leader who is strong, decisive and emphatic, with a high public profile. Mr Brown never fitted into the desired mould of a Menzies or a Bolte, and never quite rose above his cruel sobriquet of Mr Beige. However, in contrast with most of the attempts to topple Mr Kennett, who had led his party into two election defeats, there was no obvious crisis or controversy to precipitate the sudden move against Mr Brown. There was little doubt that he, or a drovers dog, could have led the coalition into a resounding victory over the Kirner Government in due course. The Liberals eagerness for office appears to have been sharpened by an impatience to bring down the failing yet defiant Labor Government as soon as possible. Somehow Mr Brown seemed to be too cautious to consummate this desired objective swiftly and boldly. Recent opinion polls confirmed that his approval rating lagged behind that of the coalition and that of his far from reticent predecessor. To a party anxious to accentuate the positive and accelerate the inevitable, and in the absence of any other obvious leadership talent, Mr Kennetts residual popularity and natural assertiveness appeared to be the qualities required to hasten the almost inescapable downfall of the Kirner Government. Mr Kennett has been, at various times, an outspoken advocate of using the Oppositions majority in the Legislative Council to precipitate an early election. It remains to be seen whether he will push for this course rather than the policy of slow legislative strangulation proclaimed by Mr Brown. IN restoring Jeff Kennett, the Liberals have opted for a highprofile, highrisk leader in the hope of procuring greater political rewards and presumably sooner than seemed attainable under the deposed leadership. There is no guarantee that their wishes will be granted, only that life in Spring Street, and for a bemused state of Victoria, will become more interesting. Mr Kennett has a record of being brash, impulsive, abrasive and aggressive. Some of his public comments in the past two years seemed to have been embarrassing to the Brown leadership team. But he is an effective election campaigner, a practised parliamentary performer, and a compelling communicator. He will be noticed and he will be heard, if not always heeded or applauded. Much more than the hapless Mr Brown, he is capable of projecting a sense of vision and giving the coalition a sense of direction. There is something of a likeable political larrikin about him, although he has matured over the years. An immediate question mark hangs over his relations with the Liberals coalition partners, the Nationals. In the last election campaign, Mr Kennett was widely criticised for his pretence that the Liberals could defeat Labor and govern without the National Party. That was plainly unrealistic then, but it is no longer so. However beneficial the partnership may be in opposition, a coalition government is likely to be fraught with difficulties and tensions, and Mr Kennett may well wish to loose the ties bound under Mr Browns stewardship. The second question is what he will try to do and how successfully to topple the Kirner Government. There is no doubt that his accession has raised the expectations of those keen to bury Labor, and he will be under pressure to satisfy them. A third question is whether he can heal the wounds and close the divisions that the leadership coup will have left in his party. Mr Kennett has plenty of front, but he had better watch his back. Time for honesty on IRC policy THERE is absolutely no reason why Australian has to have national centralised wagefixing presided over by the Industrial Relations Commission. The fact that the system has been in place since Federation is not an argument for perpetuating what is, in fact, only one possible solution to the problem of wagefixing in a mixedmarket economy. But if the Federal Government wants to change the system then it ought to come clean. At present it seems to be trying to inflict a sort of death by a thousand cuts on the IRC. Last week the Treasurer, Mr Keating, in effect dismissed the IRCs national wage decision and endorsed the ACTU move to pursue wage claims outside the commission. He said the Government would continue to seek implementation of its pricesincomes accord with the ACTU and to move towards decentralised wagefixing. This policy was confirmed last night by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, in a brisk statement that did not even mention the IRC or its decision rejecting key elements of the latest accord. This contemptuous treatment of the IRC is consistent with the Governments attitude over several years. It has downgraded the institutions status and altered the basis for paying its senior members. The reasonable suspicion is that the Government is seeking to diminish the commissions independence and make it more subservient to Government wishes a mere rubberstamp for GovernmentACTU deals. Honest people can dispute the wisdom of last weeks national wage decision, and the ACTUs rejection of it. But there can be no dispute that the Government has compromised the authority and credibility of the IRC by rejecting the decision and encouraging unions to flout it. Cabinets message play it our way or be ignored is especially pernicious because it will reverberate through other federal judicial and quasijudicial institutions. If the Governments enthusiasm for decentralised and deregulated wagefixing were taken to one logical conclusion, it would simply abolish the IRC, legislate to fix legal minimum wage rates, and let market forces establish actual rates. This would at least have the virtue of honesty. What is unacceptable is to have the Government undermining the IRC whenever it disagrees with a decision that flows properly from the commissions present statutory independence and responsibilities. The opposition spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Howard, is frank about his plans for reaching the Shangrila of enterprisebargaining through freemarket freeforalls. The Government should be equally frank about its intentions. JapanSoviet summit a modest success THE first official visit by a Soviet leader to Japan may not have been a total failure, but it was at best a very modest success. Certainly, it is a long way from President Gorbachevs dazzling foreign policy successes of a few years ago. After an exhausting four days of meetings, President Gorbachev left Tokyo emptyhanded except for a handful of lowlevel agreements signed on such matters as fishing and aviation, and a 100 million emergency food aid grant, which the Japanese had already promised last December. The expected breakthrough in the 46year dispute between the two countries over a group of barren, windswept islands in the Pacific Ocean just north of Japan failed to materialise, except for a promise for further talks. Nor did Mr Gorbachev succeed in convincing either the Japanese Government or Japanese businessmen that the Soviet Union presents wise investment opportunities for the worlds second richest country."

        "text": "SECTION 15 WHY DEVELOP COMPLAINT PROCEDURES Complaint procedures should form part of an organisations overall strategy to prevent sexual harassment. Such procedures convey to all employees the message that sexual harassment is unacceptable and is treated seriously by management. Complaint procedures should be accessible and flexible and offer a range of options for addressing complaints. Complaints should always be handled by properly trained staff and procedures need to be regularly reviewed to ensure that they are operating effectively. Above all, staff must feel confident about using them. It is usually better for all parties concerned if a complaint can be resolved through internal, inhouse procedures for the following reasons bulletIt gives management the opportunity to change behaviour and educate employees in a positive way bulletIt can minimise the potential stress, hostility and disruption which is often generated if a complaint is taken outside the organisation bulletIf a formal complaint is made to an external agency such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, the employer may be held legally responsible vicariously liable for the behaviour of its employees. The Sex Discrimination Act provides that an employer will be liable unless it can be shown that all reasonable steps were taken to prevent sexual harassment from occurring. Implementing internal complaint procedures is one measure an employer can take to reduce the risk of liability bulletComplaints which are not resolved quickly can become very expensive in terms of lost time, money and resources, particularly if they are referred to an outside agency for example, time spent in meetings and interviews, time spent preparing documentation and statements, diversion of clerical or administrative resources and lost wages are all potential costs which need to be considered bulletIf a complaint is referred to an external agency, legal costs and compensation payments may be incurred. If the matter goes to a public hearing, there is also the likelihood of negative publicity which could damage an organisations profile and credibility. Complaint procedures will vary depending on the size, structure and character of a particular organisation. The following features however should be common to all sexual harassment complaint procedures bulletsuited to the particular work environment and structure of the organisation bulleteasy for employees to access and use bulletresponsive to the problem bulletincludes a commitment that all complaints will be treated seriously bulletcan be activated immediately bulletoffer informal and formal options, depending on the nature of the complaint and the seriousness of the allegations bulletstrictly observes confidentiality bulletguarantees that no one will be victimised for complaining bulletprovides names and contact details of people responsible for dealing with complaint. Those responsible for dealing with complaints should be well trained. They need to be fully familiar with the organisations policies and procedures, the relevant law on sexual harassment and the operation and functions of outside agencies such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Good interpersonal skills in communication, negotiation, listening and conflict resolution are also very important. An organisation may decide to appoint or nominate particular staff as sexual harassment contactcomplaints officers. Alternatively, an EEO Coordinator could perform this role. Ideally sexual harassment contactcomplaints officers should be chosen from various levels within the organisation, and both men and women should be appointed. To maintain discretion and confidentiality, these officers should hold positions where staff would need to see them for reasons other than a sexual harassment complaint. Complaint procedures are not static they need to be monitored, reviewed and refined to ensure their effectiveness. It should not be assumed that sexual harassment is not a problem just because no complaints are being received. It is important to determine what people think of the procedure, whether they have any hesitations about using it and how it could be improved. A confidential survey of staff opinions and ideas may assist in gathering this information. If an organisation is serious about resolving sexual harassment complaints management must bulletmake a public commitment to the prevention of sexual harassment bulletimplement and endorse sexual harassment complaint procedures and policies bulletmonitor the procedures and make changes where necessary bulletensure that employees are well informed about policies and procedures bulletallocate adequate resources for training and awareness raising. Many sexual harassment cases go unreported because people are concerned that they will not be taken seriously if they complain. The success of a complaint procedure will depend on employee confidence that they will be treated fairly, that the matter will be kept confidential and that there will be no repercussions for taking action. Managers and supervisors will encounter a wide range of responses and prejudices when dealing with the issue of sexual harassment. There will almost always be a discrepancy in the perception of the conduct between the parties to a complaint. A complaint procedure must therefore ensure that both parties are given the opportunity to be heard in a fair and impartial way by a person who is sensitive to the issues and primarily concerned with the effective resolution of the problem. When a complaint is made, it is always important to ask bulletWhy did this situation occur bulletWas there an atmosphere in the workplace which condoned the behaviour bulletHow could it have been prevented bulletWhat measures are required to stop this from happening again bulletWhat can be done to change the prevailing atmosphere or climate of the workplace It is important to recognise that complaint procedures should not operate in isolation. They need to form part of an organisations educative and preventative strategy for dealing with sexual harassment. SECTION 16 HOW ARE COMPLAINT PROCEDURES DEVELOPED Complaint procedures can be produced by looking at other organisations policies and consulting with employer organisations and unions. Participating in accredited training programs may also give you some ideas. Surveying staff for their thoughts on what a complaint procedure should include not only provides valuable suggestions but helps to ensure employee commitment to the policy. A complaint procedure should be flexible, contain assurances about protection from victimisation and confidentiality and be widely distributed. It is worth the effort to spend time developing a procedure which will be effective. Consider the following suggestions bulletResearch other policies and procedures which have had success. Particularly look at organisations which are of similar size and character bulletParticipate in training courses designed for this purpose bulletConsult with umbrella employer organisations bulletConsult with unions and other agencies which are involved in the area bulletConsult organisations working with crosscultural issues and people from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds bulletSurvey staff about what they think an effective procedure should involve bulletWhen a procedure has been developed, do not set it in concrete. Review it regularly and make necessary changes where appropriate. Features of a Complaint Procedure There are certain features which all sexual harassment complaint procedures should contain. These include bulletFlexibility by providing a range of options for the resolution of complaints, ranging from informal to formal procedures bulletAvailability of particular measures for staff from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds for example, the availability of interpreters if required, the publication of sexual harassment policies and procedures in various languages etc. bulletA guarantee that the parties to a complaint will not be victimised, but that disciplinary action may be taken where a complaint is found to have substance bulletAn assurance that the consent of the person making the complaint will be obtained before any course of action is decided upon bulletAn assurance that no one will be victimised for complaining. The complaint procedure should be in writing and distributed widely throughout the organisation. It should contain bulletA statement of the companys policy on sexual harassment bulletA description of the approaches that can be taken in response to a complaint, detailing issues such as confidentiality. These should be used as guidelines for managers, supervisors, complaints staff and the person making the complaint bulletInformation on the rights of both the complainant and the alleged harasser bulletNames and contact details of staff responsible for inquiries or complaints bulletInformation on outside organisations which can assist. SECTION 17 MANAGEMENTS ROLE IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT COMPLAINTS It is important that managers and supervisors gain the trust of those involved in a sexual harassment complaint. They can do this by listening carefully to what is said, by making sure that the complaint is taken seriously, and is dealt with fairly and promptly. Managers and supervisors must be able to ensure that they will treat the matter confidentially and provide protection to staff so that no one will be victimised. A choice of trained and appropriate male and female staff responsible for receiving complaint and providing advice should be available. Staff should also have the choice of either informal or formal complaint handling options. Management will need to ensure that staff have confidence in the organisations complaint procedure. This can be achieved by bulletEnsuring the procedure is activated in a prompt and fair manner bulletEnsuring confidentiality and protection from victimisation. Explain to those involved that confidentiality should be maintained. Supervisory staff should be alert and act quickly if there are any signs of victimisation occurring bulletProvide adequate information to staff and ensure that sexual harassment policies and procedures are widely publicised throughout the organisation. Consider using regular notices to remind staff, refer to the policy and procedures during interviews with job applicants and provide regular information sessions bulletMaking sure that complaints are taken seriously and all points of view are respected. It is difficult to remain impartial in these situations. Be aware of your own values and impress upon complaints staff the need to demonstrate fairness and objectivity at all times bulletAppointing appropriate staff. Where possible, appoint specialist staff who have been trained to provide information, answer inquiries and act as complaints officers bulletProviding appropriate training and support for staff in these roles bulletReviewing the procedure from time to time to make sure it meets the needs and concerns of the organisation and its employees bulletBeing aware of the needs of all staff for example, employees who are not fluent in English may need access to interpreters. Management should also be aware that staff from certain cultural backgrounds may be reluctant to complain or discuss sexual harassment openly. Training sessions should be designed to ensure that all staff, regardless of their cultural background or ethnic origin, know that they have the right to complain about sexual harassment. Need for Expertise It is highly desirable that the managersupervisor and the person making the complaint have access to people with expertise in dealing with sexual harassment matters. There should be someone other than the manager to whom the person making the complaint can go for assistance. There should also be a range of options available for dealing with complaints. The choice of which option to pursue will be up to the person complaining. Many people who wish to complain about sexual harassment, make it clear from the outset that they want it dealt with informally. They may not wish to proceed if making a formal complaint is their only option. Other people may wish to have the matter dealt with formally but want it kept inhouse. Alternatively, the person complaining may wish to immediately lodge a formal complaint with an outside agency, such as the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Management should be aware that all employees have the right to approach an external agency with a complaint of sexual harassment. However, often this action is only taken because no internal complaint procedures have been developed or the complainant does not believe that their employer will treat the matter seriously and take appropriate action. If given the option, many people would prefer to have the matter resolved internally. SECTION 18 WHAT IS AN INFORMAL COMPLAINT PROCEDURE Often complaints of sexual harassment can be quickly and effectively resolved through informal procedures. Informal action could involve any of the following options selfhelp intervention by a third party independent management action Selfhelp involves the person who has been harassed approaching the harasser themselves with a request that their behaviour ceases. The complainant may ask the manager, supervisor or contact officer to accompany them if they require support."

        "text": "Islamabad, 221291 British Council Library building Dear Mum and Dad, Your lovely Christmas card with clippings and photo arrived yesterday. We loved hearing from you just 3 days before Christmas, and getting so much news. We all really miss you both. Thanks too for your phone call to inquire about the childrens health, they are all fine now, though David is still fighting a sore throat again When I spoke to Pete on the phone on 11th Dec, he said they really enjoyed your exhibition Mum and are impressed with your work By the way,I hear Heikas baby is due 21st Jan,not 26th, which is my fathers birthday. As you can see by the paper, Im not at home. In fact, Im at work but instead of 9 Candidates I have only 3 to examine. Yesterday was the coldest day weve had this winter it was freezing Also it finally rained, which is probably part of the reason the other candidates didnt turn up. They often have to come from far away, and if the weather is bad then the roads are very muddy and there is a rush with the public transport. Also, this season being the end of the year is quite hectic for everyone even if they dont celebrate Christmas they have the Qaids birthday holiday on 25th Dec yes they stole it from us. The Qaid is the founder of PakistanQaideAzam Mohammad Ali Jinnah. I am quite disappointed as I get paid according to the number of candidates and yet I still have to be here all day, though with less people to interview I should finish early. They are supposed to cancel if there are less than 4 candidates but one came from Muzzafarabad and a phone call from his employersponsor of course ensured that he got tested a long way Today Greg minds the children, he has agreed that he should do the needed hsework too, so he has a challenge to try and get some of that done too, as it is never easy with all three at home. However Quincey, our servant does the basics so its not too bad.., Yes its school holidays now, and I think David Boaz were well truly ready for it a 14 week term is really too long for the littlies. Next term I think Ill let them have a couple of days off in between anyway. Actually Boaz really cant manage 5 days he seems to get very very tired so Im going to reduce it to 4 to start with, the school wont mind, hes still so little. Am so sorry I havent written more, 1 letter its hard to realise how little Ive written to you it has been incredibly hectic here,as usual, we seem to have to constantly make decisions to say NO to people, which is hard Our biggest NO was sending Taj back to the valleys after his final term exams. It was a VERY hard decision, but the wisdom of it is has been made very clear since. Being a boy, his age,11 and culture fi different to ours added to his strong personality and not too studious attitude to make it too big a load on our family. Ken had him stay for 6 weeks till his exams were over, and Ken himself had had enough by then too. Taj is a delightful boy and he needs a lot of prayer,now now so that he can be steered in the right way. He made out he was a believer when he came to us, but we know now that he hasnt met Him yet, though he is open, he has made up some compromised ideas which could blind him for a while. The seeds of the WORD are there and I have a hard task to make sure he doesnt feel rejected by us, and also praying that his education will continue hopefully in the valley as I told Jinnah when he came in Oct. The Trails sons wedding is no this week. Hes marrying a Pakistani girl whom he w met at M.C.S. Murree Christian School in Murree. They are both studying in the States and he plans to g come back here and live work as a doctor. 1 letter The wedding involves 3 main functions to which weve been invited. Greg will go alone to the actual wedding 27th Dec in Taxila as it is too much for the children 600 Pakistani guests, an outside buffet, no room for ex everyone at in the hospital Chapel where Her parents are both Drs at Taxila Christian Hospital Dr Lall helps the Kalash a lot. Before the wedding Gail there is the Mehndi like a girls tea party in on Christmas evening. Well go together .Gail, Esther, Sharon 2 Ron sons in ou Fitches van also at Taxila Hospital Compound where Lalls live. Then on 289th we have the wedding reception here in Islamabad in the evening. It means I have to find 2 acceptable outfits so yesterday I went and bought 2 nice pairs of shoes to dress up what I already have in dresses. For Christmas we are having Turkey. I bought an extra one to cook slice up give away on the day as that is thereir custom here, to share with others neighbours, beggars when you are celebrating something. Ill have Ken, Sarawat Sha and Daud Sha for lunch as well on Christmas day. Were not having presentgiving except privately to open O.S. parcels yours hasnt arrived yet Carlas did yesterday. We bought one present for our whole family only a small Keyboard which we hope will add to the musical input in our home, its fabulous with about 100 different tones , and only cost about The keys are small so should suit the childrens fingers nicely, can play with earphones so we dont disturb anyone. Ive begun playing guitar a bit more now that the children are older let me. Greg I are trying to find ways to enrich our home life and ways to relax at home so that we wont get so stressed with all the restrictions of living here, and also so the children enjoy being home too as we have to be. Boazs birthday wentparty went ahead despite his being sick with a sore throat exhausted at the end of his first term at school. He had lain listlessly on the couch all day, but by 00pm when Rachel Jones 412 5 yrs old TEAMdropped in to bring her present he perked up and managed to enjoy his birthday afternoon tea Id cancelled half the people and left only the ones closeby so I could cancel the whole thing at the last minute if I had to. We had a SPOT puppyshapped birthday cake which my friend Donna decorated for me as I was running out of time, party hats sweets jelly. Well send you photos wen when theyre developed. They had a lovely time. Even Ken came with a birthday card hand done a present. As I write this I have a bad cold and yet cant blow it my nose here in the exam room with the candidates here writing. Its very quiet and its not culturally pleasant for them to hear me, so Im using up a box of tissues wiping the stream silently David has requested a Superman suit all year so Im going to make he and Boaz both one,but I doubte Ill get it done before Christmas. All the material only cost me 3 Steve Wilson has just come to swap cars keys with me. They are moving house today into the portion below Greg Kens flat cum office They have 4 small children 7yrs 9 mths,and if when Ken goes back to N.Z, sSteve will share the Gregs portion with him as an office. Theyll use Fitches green van to move the big furniture today. Having them close by just 5 mins walk across the park in front of our house will be great. Especially for me, and David David loves to play with Christopher7 and Angela6,and otherwise only has Rachel nearby 5.Forename is very sociable but can be a bit demanding with minding children etc,so well just have to establish rules early. Forename across the road is so different understanding uninposing yet a real friend I cut her hair every month or two she TRUSTS me amazing J Donna Hardee has become a dear friend too shes a great counsellor too The Lord has really met my needs with friendships here and through them. Thanks for all your prayers with lots love big hugs to you both. Elsa. 176 St68, F10Islamabad 24th March 7am Dear Mum and Dad, We received your phone call yesterday, Dad, that Mum is in hospital. Were so sorry to hear that Mum has had to undergo surgery, and the pain that shes had. Were praying now,and by the time you receive these we pray shell be recovering well, and free of pain. Youll be in theatre now Mum, Greg I have just prayed for you together. You rang on the afternoon of a public holiday Pakistan day. A huge army parade was planned, with airshow,navy show included, but due to rain it was cancelled. Our new house has a clear view down to where it was to be held distant, and we would have been able to see the air show really well. Instead though,we got something better dotted line a peaceful day at home with time to enjoy our view of the Margalla Hills wet and green from the rain, with a shrou light veiling of mists from clouds shifting and settling on them all day. It is evident that we have moved to a far more peaceful area. We had no just one or two doorbell rings yesterday, and no other interruptions apart from a phone call. This is so unusual here Still David Boaz Cherry were able to play with the children downstairs at the usual time, and I didnt even notice them come up to get their balls off the terrace, the layout of the house is such. Our shift was complicated by Forenames time of crisis, but now that there is a lull I can appreciate that here Ill have far more timewithout the constant interruptionsand can also feel and be more creative here. The light in the house really lifts my morale and I enjoy the kitchen immensely so I should it has plenty of cupboards and bench space a decent stove double sink etc It has the sunlight afternoons hot in summer, and is a happy light green colour. Forename has started having counselling once a week with Mary Surname, who counselled me, is very good, using prayer as part of her counselling sessions. After my praying for herin her presence, Forename I think has become comfortable enough with prayer to let Mary pray during counselling. Miracles are happening with her hubby letting her go to see me, stay onight once a week, go to see Mary and even offering her a trip to U.K He is the one we need to pray about too, as he is her environment in controls it all so much being retired is home all day. Last week Forename collapsed here after her first session with Mary. It was quite a tough day as her hubby came to drag her home against her will and I took her side. Then I left them to sort it out and went change Cherrys nappy while praying fervently It is good to have to do practical things with the littlies constantly it keeps me downtoearth He left here and she went home later when she felt better. Later that week she took an overdose, but not too severe.The tension probably helped me get the bad neck Ive had the last three days. Its better today."

        "text": "DERRIDA IN AUSTRALIA For the French philosopher, Jacques Derrida, there is no step beyond the text unless text is understood in the narrow, conventional, colloquial sense of the term, where truth would indeed be equivalent to a reality beyond the confines of books and libraries, armchairs and ivory towers of every kind. One may well be able to step beyond the text that is equivalent to book, but this is not what Derrida means by text. Rather, he argues, a certain kind of framework has been imposed on him, certain categories such as deconstructionist have been used to classify his work for polemical reasons thereby depriving it of its intellectual inventiveness. Pierre Bourdieu could easily be speaking on behalf of Derrida as well as himself when he says The logic of the classificatory label is very exactly that of racism, which stigmatizes its victims by imprisoning them in a negative essence Bourdieu 198739 . Of course it is true that in everyday life, people speak of writing and of text as though these were secondary phenomena, and quite unproblematic secondary phenomena at that. Fine distinctions are left out of account the logical and philosophical or even metaphysical aspects of thought and action are hardly given a moments attention. Perhaps the more prejudicial aspects of popular culture reinforced by the media find their very condition of possibility in this influence of the unproblematic, takenforgranted dimension of social life. Derridas whole raison detre as a philosopher is revealed in the commitment to make fine distinctions, to reflect on what passes for the obvious, the takenforgranted, the natural. So it is very likely that the effect of Derridas approach in Australia is going to be, if it has not already been, somewhat scandalous. For, in many ways, Australian culture has been founded on a notion of populism and antielitism, not to mention, antiintellectualism. This populism has been legitimated by references to democracy and fairplay, as well as to various forms of naturalism. In order that Derridas position might, by contrast, be appreciated, I shall cite him at length as he describes what he means by text, while in the midst of a political debate about apartheid It is precisely for strategic reasons dotted line that I found it necessary to recast the concept of text by generalising it almost without limit, in any case without present or perceptible limit, without any limit that is. Thats why there is nothing beyond the text. Thats why South Africa and apartheid are, like you and me, part of this general text, which is not to say that it can be read the way one reads a book. Thats why the text is always a field of forces heterogeneous, differential, open, and so on. Thats why deconstructive readings and writings are concerned not only with library books, with discourses, with conceptual and semantic contents dotted line They are also effective or active as one says interventions, in particular political and institutional interventions that transform contexts without limiting themselves to theoretical or constative utterances even though they must also produce such utterances. Thats why I do not go beyond the text, in this new sense of the word text, by fighting and calling for a fight against apartheid, for example dotted line Derrida 1986 1678 . DIFFERENCE AND IDENTITY Through the dominance of a populism that derides complexity, doxa the unquestioned frameworks of thought and action becomes all the more effective in Australia often within academe as well as outside. The doxa determines that the analysis of Australian culture and society should be in terms of what Derrida calls the notion of truth as pure selfpresence. The doxa, in other words, in still dominated by the correspondence theory of truth truth as adaequatio. This is why, later in this chapter, I want to begin a study of some of Fred Williamss landscape paintings paintings which, quite predicably, are often viewed by the critical art establishment as owing their unique qualities to the unique qualities of the landscape. This would be the basis of their realism of their presumed stake in the realm of the proper and the substantive the basis of their stake in what is deemed to be substantive. I have chosen to attempt to read Williamss paintings but these works obviously constitute only one of the areas at stake. I could have chosen television, or any of the media or again, areas like pedagogy, film, or microtechnology for all, as Gregory Ulmer has so lucidly shown,1 provide important points of entry into writing as grammatology. It is not possible, within the necessary limits of this presentation, to justify every aspect of my approach to the Australian scene. However, I should emphasise the following To begin with, although grammatology is not an intrinsically political practice any more than the objects it works with certain aspects of Australian culture and society have assumed a political importance they have not had before. These aspects may be summarised by a series of terms referring to the struggle over difference and identity multicultural and Aboriginal Australia Australian nationalism and identity multinational and national economic corporate identity media centralisation and identity international art style especially in architecture and urban planning and identity sexual difference and identity, and many more such struggles. The 1988 Australian Bicentenary and the symbols through which it was played out, can be seen as the intense focus for a number of these struggles. The red, yellow and black Aboriginal flag, for instance, stood as the counterpoint to the red, white and blue Australian flag. In a different context, the Bicentenary of the French Revolution has served thinkers such as Julia Kristeva and Tzvetan Todorov as a pretext for reflecting on whether significant aspects of Frances cultural and political heritage can be seen to encourage, or to repress an enlightened cosmopolitanism that is, an enlightened encouragement of difference as against variations of racism.2 These struggles over difference and identity will no doubt be seen by some to extend no further than struggles over various identities that is, struggles over differences between identities, where an identity very different from the one desired may have been forced onto an individual or group. But this notion of difference is simply another version of identity as the same. It is a concept of difference which, at minimum, shows itself to be quite deaf to a fundamental dimension of feminist discourse one indebted to a psychoanalytic version of difference. Derridas work, on the other hand, does not present difference as another identity, as another version of the same. Indeed, the grammatologist raises the stakes much higher by proposing that difference cannot be incorporated into any identity whatsoever. Difference, nevertheless, would remain the precondition of identity. Such an environment of struggle serves as a pretext for bringing the work of grammatology to bear on the Australian cultural scene. While even this environment of struggle does not in itself mean that a grammatological approach to the landscape in Fred Williamss painting will have immediate political implications, it nonetheless remains an important point of departure for such an approach, as it also increases the likelihood of an outcome involving political consequences, and perhaps quite fundamental ones at that. THE READER AS WRITER To illustrate further the implications of grammatology, and to prepare the ground for what will come later, I would like to turn briefly to the artistic field and draw attention to a work, La Feacutee eacuteleacutectronique, by the video artist, Nam June Paiumlautk at the Museum of Modern Art in Paris, done for the Bicentenary of the French Revolution. It was, for much of 1989, located in the Raoul Dufy room of the museum a significant point because of the connection of this room with the history of technology and, specifically, electricity.3 Nams work is a presentation which both plays with, and at the same time challenges, video technology in multiplying, exponentially, the number of possible narratives that are evoked in the viewer by a flood of familiar images. Thus five robot columns totalling 200 television receivers circa 1940s model represent figures emblematic of the Revolution. These are named Rousseau 1989, Voltaire 1989, Diderot 1989, Robespierre 1989, and Olympe de Gouges 1989 woman of letters and feminist before the letter. Each receiver emits hundreds of images those of the figure whose name appears on each column, images associated with that figure Rosseau childhood, nature Robespierre a bloody saw, and so on for the other figures, as well as other images from Hollywood movies, images of Paris, of France, of everyday life in the modern world, of European history, etc. images reversed, inverted, dissolving images, images being effaced leaving a blank screen for certain periods of time at the end of which the flow recommences. Here, the viewer constitutes a narrative for him or herself in accordance with the play of his or her own unconscious. For there is not proper narrative per se, only its raw material, which as we shall see is writing as such. Nam June Paiumlautk thus shows himself to be the James Joyce of video art This, then, is what we are seeking the revelation of a strategy in the domain of identity which would place the readerviewer or recipient in general in an active position visavis what is being presented. In another example, the architect, Bernard Tschumi, has explained that his plan for the Parc de la Villette science park in Paris involved strategies of disjunction . The latter implies that at no moment can any part become a synthesis of selfsufficient totality Tschumi 198835 . Consequently, the parts of Tschumis Parc de la Villette exist in a state of nonrelation to each other like so many dispersed fragments. There is no single synthesis, unity or whole rather, the parc encourages conflict over synthesis, fragmentation over unity, madness and play over careful management Tschumi 198835 . Like Nams video presentation, then, Tschumis architecture also prevents the illusion of a single, unique harmony, or narrative being imposed onto space. Rather, specific forms of harmony are elicited from each person who enters the parc. Through their refusal of synthesis, both projects point to the dissolution of the proper and the beginning of writing. This refusal, I suggest, is also a refusal of realist, mimetic doxic interpretations of the nature of video, architecture and, subsequently, other art forms. Such resistance to the doxa would thus mark the point of intersection between socalled deconstruction and the realm of the doxa itself. This point of intersection will, I believe, again be revealed when I come to demonstrate Derridas grammatological approach in my brief study of the landscape paintings of Fred Williams. Williamss paintings serve as a point of departure in the effort to bring to light the potential political implications of a stereotypical view of the Australian landscape. I do not argue, however, that Williamss paintings are intrinsically political. Grammatology in no sense works to show the political effects of all those things which were thought to be removed from politics. Rather, it is within a specifically political concatenation of forces that grammatology may have political effects. WRITING AND GRAMMATOLOGY To clarify the meaning to be attributed to writing or to grammatology as these terms appear in Derridas work, might seem to imply that we only need expound at length on their philosophical basis. And, in light of the way Derridas work has been generally appropriated, we might assume that such an exposition would give an insight into the nature of deconstruction as another specifically philosophical strategy, one that, as such, would have a firm grounding in the history of Western philosophy. From this angle, deconstruction might be capable of revealing the paradoxes, contradictions and ironies of traditional Aristotelian logic, but it would itself be inexorably indebted to this very same logic, despite the fact that it might also become a kind of ticks head that begins to work to destroy the very system which seemed, initially, to have entirely absorbed it. Like Gregory Ulmer, I wish to make a distinction between deconstruction and grammatology the first being understood as the more distinctly philosophical arm of Derridas arsenal of thought, whereas the second grammatology would be the source of rhetorical, poetical, and artistic strategies generative of a truly active writing or philosophy a writing or philosophy as performance. The most important thing about performance here is that it is geared to generate effects the mark of the performance is in the effects. I shall try now to clarify this important point by referring to Derridas concept of writing a concept which is not strictly a concept, for it is rather writing, as we shall see, which is the precondition of all conceptualisation. As is known, Derrida used the advent of the structuralist approach in the social sciences as the pretext for examining the fundamentals of Saussures linguistic theory the same theory that had placed the sign in such a position of prominence in semiotics and structuralist theory during the 1960s. The promotion of the sign here had not overcome the prejudice exemplified by Saussure which made writing secondary to speech in theories of language from the time of Plato."

        "text": "PRICES SOAR By WARWICK BRENNAN Food costs hit families FOOD prices are set to increase with rises in bread, chicken, eggs and milk. Families will be hit with rises of up to 10c on some products as the crippling drought worsens across the State. Other essential foodstuffs are also expected to cost more if the drought continues into next year. Some wholesale bread prices are already up between 5c and 10c with retailers preparing to pass on increases this week. Eggs will rise 10c a dozen while a special drought price of an extra 3c a litre for milk is being considered. The fishing industry is suffering as rivers dry up, pushing up the price of freshwater species. And oysters will cost about 35c a dozen extra if the drought continues and oysters starve because of the lack of nutrients in rivers. The gain shortage, which has pushed prices up 100 a tonne in the past two months, has resulted in huge cost increases in most industries. Although the major primary producers said there had not been any rises for consumers yet, they warned higher prices were only weeks away as production costs continued to rise. Bread prices will rise this week, a Bread Board spokesman said. Consumers can also expect to pay between 15c and 25c extra a kilo for chicken before December. Executive director of the Australian Poultry Industry Association Jeff Fairbrother said poultry producers werebulletContinued Page 2 Food costs hit families bulletFrom page 1trying to cope with the shortage which had seen prices rise from 165 a tonne in August to 265 a tonne this month. He said for every 10 rise in the price of wheat, the cost of producing a chicken went up about 20c a kilo. You cant just absorb that increase, he said. All poultry products will go up. NSW Egg Producers Cooperative sales manager David Watson said consumers could expect a price rise of at least 10c a dozen by Christmas if the grain price continued to rise. NSW Dairy Corporation director of operations Ron Hicks said the corporation was monitoring the situation carefully. Mr Hicks said if the drought continued, pressure from farmers would mount to increase the price to consumers to help meet costs. Under consideration is a special allowance which would lift the price of milk by about 3c a litre while the drought continued. Mr Hicks said milk production had been holding up fairly well until now although farmers were facing higher production costs. He said there had been no shortage in the liquid milk market but some shortages were starting to occur in the dairy foods sector. Possible price rises for cheese and other dairy products was harder to predict, he said, as these products were not regulated like the milk market. The fishing industry has been particularly hard hit by the drought with price increases of 10 per cent across the board. Commercial fisherman Keith Sewell said lobster was already selling on the floor for between 40 and 45 a kilo 10 more than last year. Bream prices have also risen to about 10 a kilo up from about 6 at the same time last year. People hoping to have prawns on the table at Christmas will be paying record prices above the present level of 28 kg. NSW Meat Industry Authority spokesman John Carter said no price increases were expected in red meat in the short term as supply was still high. Supplies of fruit and vegetables also remained high, keeping prices constant, although suppliers warned that could change in a matter of weeks. Bushfires fear of a new Black Saturday By JOHN LARKIN OUR parched farmers arent the only ones who want the drought to break. NSWs bushfire fighters are praying for at least two months of rain to quench bushland they say is as tinderdry as the countless hectares devoured by the disastrous January fires. The drought has raised the spectre of another horrific bushfire season. The bush is bone dry, so dry that the NSW Bushfire Service had to scale down its burnoff last week after several of its fires got out of control. Last weeks late downpours did little to diminish the threat. We need a couple of months of sustained rainfall to make any difference, NSW Bushfire Service official Ross Smith said yesterday. The signs of another tough summer are ominous. There were eight major fires in one day in the grasslands around Campbelltown two weeks ago. Fires are igniting at usually wet areas around Picton. Last weekend, 14 brigades fought a 300 ha fire in the Hawkesbury area. A house and two cars were lost. Last Tuesday, fourmetrehigh flames at a grassfire near Blacktown kept fire fighters busy all day. I havent seen anything like that for years, said Dave Dawson, the deputy fire control officer at Blacktown Bushfire Service. I believe its much worse than January. Weve had no rain since last year virtually, and its wintertime. If we dont get rain between now and October weve got real problems. NSW Bushfire Service Commissioner Phil Koperberg is a worried man. While confident NSW will not see the likes of the January bushfires for some time, this year is shaping as another tough one for thousands of volunteer bushfire fighters. The events of January 1994 were fairly unique and not likely to impact often on a community like Sydney, he said last week in an interview at his Rosehill office. Nevertheless if the drought continues unabated we will have a severe fire season around Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the Southern Tablelands, the south coast, the north coast and the New England area. The commissioner is careful not to inflame panic, but he notes gloomily that the Bureau of Meteorology, while not in the business of longterm forecasting, has said there will be below average rainfall until October. The areas most at risk will be those that escaped Januarys flames and which have not been burnt off in one of the BFSs hazard reduction exercises. In these areas, combustible material dry grass, vegetation and dead trees still lies on the ground. It is impossible to burn all of it off. Mr Koperberg is concerned about the Baulkham Hills and Hornsby areas, St Ives, Pymble, Davidson, Belrose, Turramurra, Frenchs Forest, Lindfield and Roseville. Other areas of concern are the Blue Mountains from Mt Victoria to Lapstone, the grassland areas around Campbelltown, Penrith, Camden, Liverpool and Blacktown, the southern highlands from Picton to Goulburn and the south coast, from Helensburgh to the Victorian border. Pastureland from Dural up to the Hawkesbury River is also vulnerable this season, as are dry tracts near Windsor, Richmond and Wilberforce. The commissioner stresses that these areas are not necessarily in danger, but are vulnerable due to their large amount of dry vegetation. If you can have a fire of the severity that we had in ComoJannali in January then you can have it at Dee Why or Palm Beach or Middle Cover or Lane Cove, he said. Thats the bottom line. If the drought breaks and we have normal spring and summer rainfall, then well have a normal fire season. After Januarys horror, the BFS upgraded its hazard reduction burnoffs, but the heat has made a threat of even these. We should be at the height of our burning now and weve had to terminate most of it, Mr Koperberg said. Weve slowed it down because some of them are getting away from us. Its so dry and so unseasonally warm and windy. With increased resources and new legislation obliging every landowner to take steps to reduce fire hazards, Mr Koperberg feels more confident this season about his units capacity to respond quickly to a threat. Whilst with the benefit of hindsight there are some things we would do slightly differently, most of what we did we would do again, because it was successful, he says. The State Government last week launched a video education program sponsored by NRMA, to highlight fire danger. A computerbased learning program for schools, Operation Fireguard, will be launched shortly. BFS staff numbers have been increased. Volunteers are up by 5000 since January and the Rosehill BFS office staff now numbers Forty new fire tankers will be put on the road in time for the bushfire season. In all, the BFS will have 100 new firefighting vehicles, costing 20 million, ready for action. New measures include highly trained incident management teams that will be deployed to help local units in an emergency, a computerenhanced lightening detection system and two mobile communications units costing 500,000 apiece. The BFSs State Tactical Assistance Response Group has been upgraded and equipped to go anywhere in NSW to support local fire fighters. A new 1 million operations centre at Rosehill, including the latest in satellite technology, will allow better surveillance. Mr Koperberg sums up the changes Better coordination, better communications and better intelligence. The success or failure of dealing with a major fire depends on how early you know its there, how early youre able to apply resources to it and how good your intelligence is. The January fires cost three lives and 204 houses. The toll could have been higher, according to the commissioner. With the new legislation, the householders role in preventing or limiting fire in important. Mr Koperberg urged all householders to clear combustible matter from around the house, keep the roof and gutters clean and make sure gardens are not overgrown. If fire does approach, ladders should be nearby to give access to the roof, hoses kept handy, doors and windows securely closed and all ventilation ports plugged. And dont even think of confronting a fire in shorts and a Tshirt. Sturdy dress of cotton or wool is the firefighters dress code. Its a question of good housekeeping, Mr Koperberg said. If all these precautions are taken and providing the house isnt surrounded by bush, then there is a very good chance that it can be saved. SILENT BIRTHS The baby hears the screams of labour WHEN Jacinta Lyndsay cuddles her newborn daughter, her face becomes imbued with the maternal pride that has inspired countless Madonnachild masterpieces. But then, theirs is a special bond that not so much as a moan has been permitted to jeopardise. Thats because Jacinta is a longtime member of the Church of Scientology, which encourages its devotees to maintain a vow of silence during birth. There was no thrashing, let alone any of the howls that normally erupt during labour, when Jacinta gave birth to Meg at her Vaucluse home two weeks ago. It may seem medieval to some and impossible to others, but Jacinta, 29, insists it is done with nothing but the babys wellbeing in mind. Meg is Jacinta and husband Dougs second child born in this manner and, despite a slight hitch when the umbilical cord wrapped around Megs head, all proceeded calmly and quietly. Silent birth has always been a tenet of Scientology, but it became a contentious topic only after a number of celebrities belonging to the movement went public on the procedure. Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman highprofile members of the church adopted their daughter Isabella Jane last month only after ensuring she had been delivered in silence. Other members who had their children delivered in accordance with Scientology teachings include John Travolta and wife Kelly Preston and Lisa Marie Presley and her husband, Danny Keough. Lisa Marie, 24, is said to have endured nine excruciating hours of labour without painkillers before she gave birth to her son, Benjamin Storm Keough. Lisa Marie, a devout member of the church since the age of 10, apparently gagged her cries of pain by clenching her teeth on a roll of gauze. According to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, the fetus not only hears the sounds outside the womb, but makes a detailed mental recording of them. In his selfhelp bestseller Dianetics, Hubbard explains that when an unborn child has a traumatic experience, including being bumped, knocked or squeezed in the womb, anything said by the mother or others around the mother is recorded word for word in the childs subconscious."

        "text": "Hewsons dream will we adopt his elaborate scheme The LiberalNational coalition has proposed a series of reforms that would bring immense change to our society. Daryl Dixon reviews the effect they would have on investors young and old Tax and retirementincome policy will never be the same again as a result of the LiberalNational coalitions proposals. Even if it is nor elected, its program will force needed and sensible changes to existing policies. The coalitions program ignores no major aspect of tax or retirementincome policy, and if the Labor Government thinks the goods and services tax GST is a sitting duck, it is sadly mistaken because the pluses in the coalitions program go a long way to addressing major defects in present policies. For personal finances, the most significant features of the program are box Substantial reductions in marginal rates of personal income tax, which would mean a greater return for working overtime or when investing for a higher rate of return. box Retention of the imputation credit system of company tax but an increase in the company tax rate from 39 to 42 per cent. box A dramatic change in the basis of retirementincome policy to provide the greatest help to lower and middleincome people. box Major changes to lumpsum and lumpsumtax arrangements. photo box The replacement of the highly discriminatory wholesale sales tax with a GST that would increase the price of many items food and services but reduce the prices of others petrol and manufactured goods. Reduced incometax rates The marginal rates that would be phased in between the election of the coalition and 1996 are long overdue. Most taxpayers would pay either a marginal rate of 2 per cent or 30 per cent and the top rate, ultimately, would be 42 per cent, the same as company tax. These rates would decrease the attraction of the two main tax shelters negative gearing and superannuation particularly for higher income earners. Investors should be careful about entering negativegearing transactions that rely on deductions at present tax rates to make their investments attractive. The marginal tax rate for taxpayers with incomes between 36,000 and 50,000 a year would, for example, fall from 47 per cent to 30 per cent. This would greatly reduce tax assistance for negative gearing. Such dramatic proposals should make investors review their existing negatively diagram geared investment to see if they would still be profitable under the proposed tax scales. And even if the coalition does not win office, the government is almost certain to match or better the most attractive aspects of its opponents policies particularly the reduction in personal income tax rates. Superannuation The coalition would radically alter superannuation rules so investors should urgently review their super and rollover savings strategies. The contrast with the present policy is stark. The government now gives the greatest superannuation tax subsidy to those with the highest incomes. The coalition says it would set a cap of 1500 a year on tax assistance to new super savings by any one individual. This would mean that lower income groups would gain proportionately more than higher income groups. This would be achieved by granting a tax rebate of 25 per cent on total contributions of up to 6000 a year. In a bold, and fair initiative, a working spouse would be able to claim an additional rebate of up to 1500 a year for making a 6000 contribution to the superannuation savings of a nonworking spouse. This means every married couple would be able to put 12,000 a year in superannuation and gain a substantial advantage. The big losers would be all highincome earners who are making very big contributions. Such people would be well advised to make their contributions for this tax year because the rules are likely to be changed soon. Similarly, if you would be a winner from the coalitions program, it would be advisable to delay contributions to a later date. The coalitions policy of concentrating superannuation asistance on average wage earners and families is almost certain to shame the government into making its policies more equitable. Action can be expected sooner rather than later in this area because the changes would not involve a big budgetary cost. Company tax changes Buying shares that pay franked dividends would still be attractive. The coalition proposes to retain the imputation credit system, whereby shareholders get a refund of tax paid by a company after they get franked dividends. With company tax increased for 39 to 42 per cent, imputation credits would be more valuable. The higher rate of company tax, however, would reduce the attractions of investing as a company instead of as an individual. Products offered by life companies, including traditional life insurance policies and life insurance bonds, would be subject to more tax, thus further reducing the attraction of this type of investment. The coalitions program would also reduce the scope for highincome individuals to save tax by owning their investments in a company name and therefore being subject to a lower tax. Under the proposal, in 1996 the top marginal rate of income tax would come in line with the company tax rate. Before that, the company tax rate would exceed personal tax rates paid by most. Lumpsum arrangements The coalitions proposals on lumpsum benefits and annuity payouts are also radical and again designed to help lowerincome savers while not disadvantaging middleincome groups. The intention is both to prevent large lumpsum payouts and to encourage people to use their payouts to provide a stream of income in retirement. A cap of 300,000 on the maximum lumpsum benefit together with the abolition of lumpsum tax and generous arrangements for annuity payouts would close off the massive rorts permitted under the present rules. The preservationofbenefitsage would be raised to 60, thus making it more difficult for people to get both a big superannuation payout and the age pension. If the coalition wins office, retirees would no longer be forced to buy superannuation annuities that die with them. Nor would they be required to take their money out of rollover funds at age These changes would be part of longoverdue measures to ensure that superannuation savings are actually used for retirementincome purposes. Increased tax on fund income Some investors, especially those with money in rollover funds, are concerned about the coalitions proposal to increase the tax rate on fund income from 15 per cent to 25 per cent. That measure is apparently designed to fund the cost of the proposal to abolish the tax on lumpsum benefits and claw back a larger part of the concession given to those with substantial amounts in superannuation and rollover funds photo excerpt For some retirees, the 25 per cent tax on fund income would exceed their proposed new marginal tax rate of 5 per cent 2 per cent base rate plus 25 per cent Medicare levy. But before rushing to remove their money from superannuation or rollover funds, they should study the impact of the proposed abolition of lumpsum tax and the generous arrangements for annuities. As at present, annuities would be exempt from the 25 per cent fundincome tax. To match the exemption of lump sums from tax, all returns of capital from annuities would be free of tax. This means that most retirees would pay only very low average rates of tax on payouts from annuities. Help for younger people The coalitions program would offer help to young people wanting to save to buy a house. The proposed arrangement would allow up to 75 per cent of accumulated superannuation savings to be used to help people aged below 35 to acquire a first house. They would be required to pay interest on their borrowings from the superannuation fund. Combined with the maximum annual 1500 rebate, which has greatest value for those who pay lower income tax, this new measure would provide encouragement to young people to save in a superannuation fund. And they would have an expanded range of superannuation savings options because of the proposed retirement savings accounts that would be offered by banks, building societies and other financial institutions. Allowing for the GST How the GST would have an impact on investors is difficult to determine. However, the combined effect of the coalitions tax, age pension retirementincomes policy appears to offer adequate protection against the impact of GST on the cost of living in retirement. Abolition of superannuation lumpsum tax, reduction in personal tax, increased age pensions and compensation for selffunded retirees would provide substantial assistance for the retired. Investors, in anticipation of a GST, could be tempted to make planned real estate investments before its introduction because housing seems to be the only major area of outlay where some savings in tax bills could be gained. Most other large items, such as cars and consumer durables, would be subject to less tax under the GST than they are at present. Selffunded retirees The coalition predicts that a 15 per cent GST would increase inflation by less than 5 per cent. However, its package contains measures to ensure that retired people with incomes of less than 30,000 a year would not be disadvantaged. Specific measures to compensate and assist age and service pensioners and retirees include box An 8 per cent increase in the base rate of pension compared with a general increase in price levels of less than 5 per cent as a result of the GST. box A GST tax credit to ensure that all part pensioners earning some additional income would be fully compensated. boxCompensation of up to 2500 for retirees with incomes of less than 30,000 a year to allow for the impact of GST inflation on the real value of accumulated cash and bond savings. box Tax credits for private health insurance of up to 400 a year for single people receiving less than 12,000 a year and 800 for married couples with combined incomes of less than 14,500 a year. box Introduction of special savings accounts to reduce tax payable on interest income. The coalition envisages that health outlays, a key component in all retired peoples budgets, would be totally exempt from the GST. The package also contains action to simplify income tax arrangements applying to pensioners. This matches the governments proposals to ensure that no pensioner will pay tax after July 1, The coalition has designed its goods and services tax policy in a fair way. However, many retired people are likely to react unfavourably to any new tax on their spending and ignore the increase in their incomes as a result of the compensation package. New Zealands GST, I believe, is now generally accepted though not necessarily admired. The main problem there is with proposals to change the basis on which retired people gain access to a government pension. In Australia, the coalition has wisely decided against trying to change the fundamentals of the age pension arrangements introduced by the Labor Party. The aged should not be panicked at the thought of a GST as proposed by the coalition. Unlike the 1985 Option C GST proposed by former Treasurer Paul Keating, the coalition package is biased in favor of selffunded retirees and people on lower incomes. Complex and confused but why Providing for retirement has become a worry for most Australians, but the mess is not likely to be sorted out by either of the political parties. Michael Rice reports on the reasons photo caption Most people would agree that superannuation in Australia today is both complex and confusing. We have had 10 years of major changes, but few would argue that the system we have in place today is satisfactory. There are at least four underlying reasons why we have such a mess. Until these are addressed, we are likely to have a poorly designed and complicated setup for some years yet. The reasons are many, but include the following. Lack of national superannuation business plan The Federal Government has evolved a national retirement incomes policy on the run. Despite the numerous reports and inquiries covering superannuation over the last 15 years, we still do not have a proper national goal."

        "text": "11 April 1994 Dear Alison By doing something which i couldnt repeat if you paid me i have finally removed KidPix from the screen and called up this blank page i hope it doesnt suddenly turn into something else I feel like i havent written to you for ages, although i know thats not the case its just that not much has been happening to enable the writing of an enthralling letter, so here comes another mundane one How are things chez Morgan, especially chez the pregnant Morgans stomach, back etc i hope you are feeling as well as can be expected, if not positively blooming. By now i suppose your mum and dad have been and gone it must be lovely having people visit, but so hard seeing them go again at least you wont have to worry about that with us You have now spent the two major Christian festivals in Nepal did you miss a packed Easter day church, or did you have one there I still miss that feeling you get from a very full Anglican church with all the choral works on Easter Sunday i keep meaning to visit one but never get around to it. Jennifer and Matthew returned to school today after their first school holidays the term went so fast as, thankfully, did the holidays only four days if you dont count Good Friday and Easter Monday in fact, im not really sure they didnt just think they were having a bit of a long weekend. They had friends over one day, and we went into town to have lunch with daddy, and on Saturday we went to the zoo getting there at 15pm, not realising it closed at 5pm. It was actually the best trip weve had to the zoo, as we said they could only ride on the cable car if they didnt mention it, so we whizzed around the top part of the zoo and saw the orangutans in their new McDonalds home and Luke enjoyed looking at the giraffes and then it was time to go. Next time well look for the Nepali animals is there anything especially native we should know about to find yaks yetis i can only think of Tibetan ones. Luke has just woken up 45 minutes ahead of when he should have wouldnt you know it He must have heard me at the computer and decided he wanted to join in. Oh well, au revoir 18 April 1994 Hello again. We received your prayer letter last Friday the thing that strikes me most is that when Jon is asleep you make time to do something with Annie On the weekends, when Luke is asleep during the day, Jennifer and Matthew get sent off to their rooms to play or rest, while Mummy and Daddy have some peace and quiet of course, it never goes uninterrupted, but stilldotted line. Are you both getting very fit andor losing lots of weight with the sort of food and exercise you are having who needs to pay money to a gym when you live in Tansen Its great that Annie has settled in at last, and i can just imagine your rubber egg with legs because ive got one too its very funny isnt it although mine still isnt talking much. Do you have much contact during the day with the other playgroup mothers Can you drop round for coffee thats where i really miss you, as well as being on the other end of a telephone, or are you all a long way away from each other The views all sound spectacular, the hospital work less so it must be so frustrating and so sad that people that could be saved here are dying. We do thank God for the work of Chris and all the other doctors etc at the hospital. On the subject of hospitals, we went back to the ENT this morning and its more grommets and no adenoids for Luke he goes back on 55 for his next operation. Hopefully this will result in a rapid increase in his verbal skills, although his comprehension is fine, indicating he is hearing, so perhaps hes just decided to put off the talking for a while He currently has a big cold, which has taken us back to the disturbed nights that we left behind after his first lot of grommets went in, plus he has been getting up at 15am i didnt think it could get much worse that 5am but it has, it has how do you keep yours still asleep at 7am. But apart from this, which does drain the energy somewhat, he continues to be very cute he has just started giving me cuddles, which is really nice, and he plays pretend games with his wrestle bear, giving it food and a dummy not the dummy he has in his mouth, mind you i think its going to take a team of people to prise it away Interestingly, when he goes to Occasional Care on Wednesdays, he surrenders it to them quite cheerfully when he arrives and it gets put in his locker, but as soon as he sees me in the afternoon, he rushes over to the locker and starts banging on the door to have it returned to him no doubt what he assosciates me with I took him to buy some new shoes a few weeks ago his toes were hanging over the edge of his sandals, although he had hardly worn them, as they tended to make the eczema really red and angry on his feet, even when wearing ascloseto100asyoucanget cotton socks. I got to Shoes and Sox in Chatswood at 10 past 9, thinking that at least that early in the morning, there would be no waiting HA The shop was already full, and when i took my ticket at the door, it was number 25 they certainly need bigger premises there, and i hope the workers all get stress counselling or something We were finally served at 10 oclock, and the man who looked after us was very thorough, taking 20 minutes till he was satisfied that hed found a pair of shoes that would fit properly. I asked him to start with the cheapest pair which was still 45 and we worked up to 56 when we struck gold owing to the broadness of Lukes foot this was just as well, because the next shoe to try was going to be 85 Really, if most children have broad feet, which he told me they do, why cant Clarks etc just make their range of footwear for that age accordingly Unfortunately, his feet still go yukky with these on, and he will need to wear them heaps more that he ever wore shoes in summer, but i suppose it cant be helped Patricia McVeagh didnt have any suggestions when i went to her a few weeks ago for an eczema checkup at that stage his skin was almost clear, but with the onset of the cold weather, or something else, who knows, it is currently back to red itchy patches all over poor Luke. Poor Luke is also a bit of a chub according to P McV his length is on the 50 line, and his weight over the 90 line, and dont i feel it, carrying him around. A propos of nothing in particular, the Old Bear stories are starting this week on channel 2, and Playschool, in addition to the rocket clock and the flower clock now has a digital video clock i dont know if this was on any of the episodes i taped for Annie, but i saw it the other day and was most impressed Jennifer and Matthew had a week of swimming leassons in the holidays half an hour a day for 5 days and by the end of it, J was swimming half a lap of the pool freestyle and backstroke all by herself i was again most impressed. I still think its very difficult for them to coordinate the breathing and the arms and legs and turning the head to the side, but she was having a very good stab at it. Interestingly, Matthew was the better last time they had the holiday lessons, but this time, he couldnt quite work out how to get it together, although he was very enthusiastic every time the teacher tried to showtell him what to do, he would immediately start trying, without actually waiting to listen or watch His backstroke was very funny he was kicking his legs, ramrod straight, with toes pointing to the ceiling, in time with his arm movements no wonder he couldnt keep afloat But the teacher they have now i have finally fallen victim to the local custom and booked them in for weekly lessons is doing a good job of showing them how to kick, which the holiday teacher didnt really do, so im sure hell pick it up eventually. They enjoy it though, and thats the main thing. Guess what ive done ive had a hair cut I actually went into this hairdressers on the spur of the moment Walk in off the street haircuts only 10 between 10am and 12 no appointment necessary . I did only go in for a trim of the ever present split ends, and the hairdresser said to me will i just take off a couple of inches and so youd still like it below your shoulders , to both of which comments i answered yes . While she started cutting, i occupied myself trying to read the labels on shampoo bottles i could see reflected in the mirror, so i didnt have to look at myself reflected in the mirror, and when i did finally take a quick glance, she was halfway round and there was all my hair lying on the floor, what was left just touching my shoulders It is barely long enough for a pony tail, which i like to be able to do when it is hot, or at the gym etc. It looks quite nice its not nearly as radical as when you had yours cut what are you doing about hair now i suppose it is already back down to your waist, but i suspect it is the beginning of the end theres not much point in trying to grow it again as it has never been very satisfactory at reaching below my shoulder blades. Jennifer has also had her hair cut, in more ways than one I came out one morning to find Jennifer and Matthew quite peacefully watching a video, with clumps of Jennifers hair fighting for space on the floor with all the toast crumbs and squashed sultanas and stale bits of NutraGrain i was unable to ascertain exactly WHY Matthew had felt moved to do it, other than, i suppose, the fact that there were the scissors and there was this tempting head of hair Fortunately, he hadnt done much, but it was enough to neccesitate a visit next door to our neighbour who runs a hairdressers in her backyard granny flat. She cut a fringe for Jennifer, at my request, a few months ago, as I wanted to see if it would make her hair in any way easier to manage it didnt i think she has been born with the sort of hair that looks unbrushed 10 seconds after you brush it, but she only made a very small, wispy one in fact you could hardly tell shed had anything done. This time, however, she had to be a bit more drastic, so Jennifer now has a fairly full fringe, and it looks really nice. 30494 Hello again. Ive just spent the last 30 minutes putting Luke back to sleep and trying to find the video remote control because the child lock was on and i didnt know how to disengage it without the remote control unit it needs to be on permanently now as Luke has discovered he can reach his videos Thomas, Johnson and Friends, ABC music videos and Bananas in Pyjamas, take them out of the box and try to insert them never yet with success into the machine,."

        "text": "OVERVIEW OF SEISMIC HAZARD ANALYSIS General Since the first seismic risk map for the Australian continent was produced McEwin et al., 1976, using extreme value arguments, the seismology community have adopted the CornellMcGuire procedure Cornell, 1968 and a considerably greater data base has become available. The latest published earthquake maps are those of Gaull et al. 1990 as modified as a result of the Newcastle earthquake by MichaelLeiba and Gaull 1990. The maps present contours of peak ground acceleration, velocity and Modified Mercalli scale intensity for a given average return period 500 years expressed as a 10 probability of being exceeded in a period of 50 years. As noted in Gaull et al. 1990, Caution must be exercised when the results are to be integrated into engineering design criteriadottedlinebecause ofdottedline the statistical uncertainty of the values of the parameters. In particular the problem of incomplete earthquake records and the short history of earthquake observation were noted. In examining the maps the spatial unevenness associated with recorded earthquake events is evident, see Figure 1 from Gaull et al. 1990. There are large areas of Australia for which no significant earthquake activity has been recorded. It is not clear whether this is because i there was noone to observe and, prior to the early part of this century, virtually no instrumentation for recording cf Drake, 1974, or ii whether the rare and major events have not yet occurred in the short recorded history, or iii whether it is simply due to a lower degree of seismicity. It is important to recognize that earthquakes in the Australian continent are of the socalled continental or intraplate type, which means that they do not, as in most recognized earthquake regions, occur at the edges of continental plates. The physical mechanisms governing intraplate earthquakes are not wellunderstood although they may well be associated with previous faulting activity Johnston and Kantor, 1990. However, it is clear that their rate of occurrence is significantly lower than that of conventional earthquakes. This means that, for statistical purposes, long records are required for a given level of accuracy in probabilistic description of their occurrence rate. An overview of the procedures used to obtain seismic risk maps has been given by Gaull et al. 1990 and the fundamentals of seismic risk analysis and code rule development reviewed by EERI 1989. Most texts dealing with earthquake engineering spend little time on codification, although a good appreciation of the various uncertainties and the degree of accuracy attainable in design force etc. prediction can be obtained from some e.g. Dowrick, 1987. The main areas of uncertainty and assumption are reviewed below. Earthquake Source Zones The CornellMcGuire procedure for the development of risk maps stems from Cornells 1968 concept that a particular earthquake feature such as a fault zone will generate ground effects at a particular site depending on i the rates of earthquake activity of magnitude greater than given levels, and ii the distance of the epicentres from the site of interest. Cornell foreshadowed the possible use of his theory for the development of seismic zoning maps for engineering design purposes. However, it is clear from his paper that his interpretation of zones was in terms of particular earthquake features. It seems that in the application of the procedure to the derivation of seismic risk maps, the zones have become whole geographic regions, presumably with some kind of commonality in terms of earthquake activity. However, this is not always readily evident when a typical set of zones used for this purpose is considered, see Figure 2 Gaull et al., 1990. For example, zone 22 contains both the Snowy Mountains region and the Sydney basin. Perhaps more serious in terms of statistical interpretation is the fact that such zones are considered to be homogeneous. This means that they are taken as essentially the one earthquake generating feature, and that all data about earthquake events within the zone have equal status. While this would be valid if an appropriate geological feature or set of features could be identified as corresponding to the zone, it can only be considered an approximation for larger areas, perhaps with disparate geology cf. Horoshun, 1990. This manner of use of zones has potentially serious implications for the quantitative estimation of risk see below. It should be noted here that the geology referred to is that relevant to earthquake activity. This may extend up to say 20 kms into the earths crust. A further consequence is that the delineation of a zone can have a major impact on the information content portrayed by the seismic risk map, since being overly generous in delineating a zone implies a greater or lesser extent of a particular level of earthquake activity which might in fact be associated with only relatively localized geological features. The impact of zone delineation can be seen in a more direct but simplistic fashion by comparing the zone boundaries of Figure 2 with derived contours of peak ground acceleration shown in Figure It is clear that the zoning adopted in Figure 2 is closely mirrored in the contours shown in Figure The problem of zone delineation has been noted before. Bender 1986 quotes earlier seismologists, including The procedures used in delineating seismic source zones are illdefined. No single standard exists dottedline because of the nonuniform level of pertinent seismological, geological and geophysical information available for areas of vastly differing tectonical geological settingsdottedline. Boyce 1990 suggested performing analyses of the computed seismic risk or of design ground accelerations to changes in zone delineation. This seems sensible, but what should also be considered is the actual size of zones used, noting that each zone is assumed to be a homogeneous region. It has been suggested also that the boundaries might be smoothed by considering each point source within the zone as one with which there is an associated uncertainty regarding its location, represented by a variance Bender, 1986. However, this does not address the basic question. A feature of concern regarding Figure 2 is the absence of zones for a large part of Australia. This seems to imply no significant level of earthquake activity, a contention not supported by Figure It appears that a background zone has been used for the unzoned parts of Australia Gaull et al., 1990. However this zone can hardly be considered to be homogeneous cf. Figure 1. Probabilistic Modelling Cornell 1968 assumed that the occurrence of earthquakes of magnitude above a given level of interest could be described in time by a Poisson distribution. This means that each earthquake event is considered to be independent of all others, even for the one earthquake generating feature. This assumption fits established theory for stochastic processes if earthquake activity is considered as a random process in time upcrossing a given and sufficiently high level. The time between such upcrossings i.e. larger earthquake events is then given by the Exponential distribution cf. Melchers, 1987. If the level considered is not sufficiently high, or the upcrossings are not rare, the Poisson assumption is not valid and the other results do not follow Leadbetter, Lindgren and Rootzen, 1982. In developing risk maps, data obtained from earthquakes is plotted on socalled recurrencemagnitude plots see Figure 4, with the recurrence interval plotted on a logarithmic scale. This accords with the above notions of Poissonian upcrossings. The difficulty in employing such ideas, therefore, lies in three areas i the assumption that earthquake activity is properly represented by a stochastic process, ii that the upcrossings are rare events, and iii that the recurrence probabilities can be estimated, even for rare events. The first two of these points were noted above it seems reasonable, for continental type earthquake activity, to accept the modelling by stochastic process with Poisson upcrossings. Certainly the data is insufficient to suggest other models. The third point is illustrated in Figure 4 after Gaull et al., 1990. If the data set is obtained from a relatively short observational record, it is impossible to estimate accurately the recurrence intervals for relatively rare events. Indeed, if such an event does occur, it is likely to be assigned a recurrence time which is too short. This means that information about recurrence times for what might be rare events of larger earthquake magnitude are subject to considerable uncertainty, as illustrated on Figure 4 see also Dowrick, 1987 113117. Fortunately, taking events into account relative to the period of observation is conservative in terms of estimated recurrence interval, as evident from Figure This applies also for rare events which have not yet occurred provided the data for lower magnitude and more frequent events is homogeneous with respect to the larger, less frequent events. It is common practice in engineering to extrapolate from short recurrence interval data i.e. frequent events to long recurrence interval data i.e. extreme events. This is only justifiable, however, if the physics of the underlying process is wellunderstood and welldefined. Even then considerable errors can arise in extrapolation, as is wellknown in waterresources work. In attempting to address this problem, Gaul et al.1990, stripped foreshocks and aftershocks from their data and then applied the Stepptest to ensure that the available data suggested that a Poisson assumption had been approximately reached. It is important to realize the limitation of this procedure. Since the majority of the data is for short recurrence interval earthquakes and therefore, as it happens, low magnitude earthquakes, the test will merely indicate whether that available data can be approximated by the Poisson model. Little can be inferred about whether the rare, large magnitude events satisfy the model or whether the model itself is adequate. Conversely, if the modelling is highly accurate, the occurrence of an earthquake event would not be expected to have any impact on the seismic risk maps. Yet this is precisely what occurred following the Newcastle earthquake, when the recently developed risk maps of Gaull et al. 1990 were revised locally MichaelLeiba and Gaull, 1990. This is an illustration of the state of the art of seismic risk analysis. The latter is not, however, likely to be significantly improved or changed except with both better understanding of continental type earthquake activity and the availability of a longer period data base. Whilst the first can be fostered by greater research efforts, neither can be achieved in anything other than the very longterm. It is for this reason that an understanding of the state of the art and its limitations is so important. Maximum Credible Earthquake A maximum magnitude limit on earthquake activity is sometimes applied with the CornellMcGuire procedure. As noted by Boyce 1990, the selected magnitude is often chosen as one half greater magnitude than has been observed. This is, of course, conservative in a sense for the current data set, but since it prevents extrapolation as in Figure 4 the procedure is, strictly speaking, totally arbitrary and statistically unsatisfactory. Experience in other disciplines leads to only one conclusion namely that the concept of maximum credible earthquake should be abandoned. As more data becomes available, the current maximum credible event is continually shifted upwards and in any case there is always a finite, even if very small, probability than an event larger than the maximum credible event might occur at some time in the future. Effect of Distance to Epicentre Attenuation In converting the earthquake magnitude to local ground shaking parameters acceleration, velocity, displacement or Modified Mercalli intensity an attenuation relationship must be used. It is usually a function only of distance to the epicentre, but could involve soil and rock properties as well. A short discussion of the uncertainties involved in the most commonly used attenuation relationships has been given by Boyce 1990. Essentially, there is wide scatter of data about the relationships which have been proposed Gaull et al., 1990. This scatter indicates uncertainty in the predictions of attenuation and hence uncertainty in the ground shaking parameters being determined. It is possible to make some allowance for this uncertainty in the modelling of attenuation relationships, but to do so requires extensive data or the ability to make inferences based on data available elsewhere EERI, 1989."

        "text": "ON THE COURSE HOW THE RULES CAN GET YOU OUT OF TROUBLE When you find yourself in a quandary, here are some quick lessons on how to take relief BY STU SCHNEIDER There is definitely one thing that we all have in common with the best golfers in the world. Sooner or later, whether were trying to break 70 or 100, were going to have a brush with the Rules of Golf. For many golfers too many, according to those who administer the rules that means trouble. Not because weve hit our ball outofbounds or into a lateral hazard or onto a cartpath. Trouble because many golfers treat the Rules of Golf like high school algebra. We learn to get by the final exam, but a month after the last class, its all forgotten. Even tour pros are guilty. Youve seen it on television a pro hits his ball onto a cartpath. What does he do Reach into his golf bag for his rule book Take charge of the situation and drop his ball caption diagram in the proper spot More often than not, he gets a dazed and confused look on his face and starts craning his neck for the nearest rules official. A few minutes later, a guy with a walkietalkie and a tan rides up in a golf cart. He explains to the pro playing for 80,000 all the things hed know if he bothered to read a 50 rule book. You dont have that luxury. If you find yourself in a tricky rules situation, or even a simple one, you should know what to do without anyone elses help. There may not be 180,000 at stake, but knowing the rules knowing how they can get you out of trouble can save you strokes and nassau money. The rules demonstrated on the information box following pages by touring pros Nick Price, Jeff Sluman, Chip Beck, Joey Sindelar and Frank Beard are among the most common trouble situations encountered from tee to green. Every golfer should know them, or at least know where to look them up in a rule book. And every golfer should carry a Royal and Ancient rule book in his golf bag. The booklets are available from all registered golf clubs and state golf associations. photo photo photo Immovable obstructions Here Nick Prices ball in on a cartpath. Like other manmade objects such as sprinkler heads or irrigation boxes shown with Chip Beck below,a cartpath is defined as an immovable obstruction. You are entitled to relief if it interfers with your stance, lie of ball or swing. In the top photo, Nick has identified two possible points of rellief A and B, both not nearer the hole. Since B is closest to Nicks original ball, thats the spot where the ball may be dropped or within one clublength of that point, but not nearer the hole. Youre allowed to use any club in measuring a clublength, including one of those extralong putters. THe ball cannot roll closer to the hole than this reference point. If it does, it must be redropped. If the ball hits either yourself or your equipment in this case the club on the ground, it does not count as a drop and must be redropped without penalty. If the ball rolls back onto the path or where the player has interference from his stance or swing, you must redrop. If it happens again, you must place the ball at the spot where the ball first hit the ground on the second drop. photo Ground under repair, casual water The procedure Jeff Sluman will use for taking relief from ground under repair, marked with white paint, is similar to immovable obstruction relief. In the top photo, Sluman has identified three possible relief points A, B and C that are free of the condition and not nearer the hole. Since A is closest to his ball, thats the reference point he must use if he desires relief from the ground under repair. As a helpful hint, placing tees to mark the one clublength area the ball must be dropped within is not required, but is recommended. If the dropped ball rolls more than two clublengths, closer to the hole than Slumans relief point or back where interference from the ground under repair exists, he must redrop. In the photo at right, senior tour pro Frank Beard has found his ball in casual water. Casual water is defined asany temporary accumulation of water on the course that is visible before, or after a player takes his stance, except, obviously, in a water hazard. You are entitled to relief if casual water interferes with your lie, stance, or, if your ball is on the green, your putting line. Follow the same procedure as for ground under repair. If your ball is in casual water in a bunker, and you elect not to play the ball, you may drop it, without penalty, in the bunker, as near as possible to the point where the ball lay but not nearer the hole, on ground that affords maximum relief. Or you may replay the shot with a strokeanddistance penalty. Or you may drop behind the hazard, with a onestroke penalty, keeping the point where the ball laydirectly between the hole and the point on which the ball is dropped. photo photo diagram photo Reglar, lateral water hazards The margins of water hazards are marked by yellow stakes or lines signifying a water hazard or red stakes or lines lateral water hazard. A player has two options for a ball lost in a water hazard, and both carry a one stroke penalty. You can play from as near as possible at the spot where the ball was last played you may retee if the ball was a tee shot. Or, as Price is doing above, drop a ball behind the water hazard on an imaginary line extending from the hole through the point at which the ball last crossed the margin of the hazard, with no limit as to how far behind the hazard the ball can be dropped. For a ball hit into a lateral water hazard left, in addition to the above options, youve got two others You can drop a ball outside the hazard within two clublengths of either the point where the original ball last crossed the margin of the hazard, not nearer the hole A, or at a spot on the opposite margin of the water equidistant from the hole B. Procedure for an unplayable lie You can declare your ball unplayable at any place on the course except when it lies in or touches a water hazard. Once you do, as Joey Sindelar has done here above right, youve got three options, each carrying a onestroke penalty 1 You can play from as near as possible at the spot from where you played your original shot. 2 You can drop a ball within two clublengths of the spot where the ball lies in any direction, but not nearer the hole, as Sindelar is doing below right. Notice he measures his two clublengths from the ball, not the condition. 3 The other option is to drop a ball on an imaginary line between the hole and the spot where the unplayable ball lies below, with no limit as to how far back you can go. If you declare your ball unplayable in a bunker, you must drop within the bunker unless you choose option No So if you putt a ball off the green into a bunker, under this rule you can take a onestroke penalty and putt again from the same spot. photo photo photo INSTRUCTION WHICH WEDGE, WHEN AND HOW Technology has caught up with the short game. To take full advantage, drop a wood or long iron from your bag infavor of a third wedge BY GEORGE SERHAN with Neville Yates The great Gary Player caused a stir when he won the 1974 Australian Open at Lake Karrinyup in Perth. It was my first big tournament and I was enthralled by his magical wedge play. I soon discovered he was carrying three wedges, which was unheard of in those days. Players game was outstanding. He carried a much more lofted club than anyone else and was able to get up and down from the most incredible places. He used it for difficult sand shots and to lob the ball high over the bunkers and make it land softly by the hole while the rest of us were resigned to making bogey. He won by three but that club saved him more shots than that. The third wedge became the hot topic of discussion that week, with some pros conceding it was not a bad idea and others damning it as a waste of a club. However, while Player was the exception 20 years ago it is now the norm for tournament professionals to carry an extra wedge, whether it slots photo between the pitching wedge and sand iron or is a superlofted club for lobbing the ball from difficult lies or to tight pin positions. I joined the thirdwedge brigade many years ago and have found it an extremely useful addition to my bag. My short game has improved greatly as I have grown in confidence at my ability to play a wider variety of shots. Years ago, if you wanted a third wedge your only choice was to modify a sand iron. I increased the loft in a vice and ground all the bounce off the sole to make it more suitable for playing shots off hard ground. As the club gained favor and popularity among better players, manufacturers recognised the marketing potential and created the L wedge. These days there are more choices in utility wedges than any other club, bar the putter, of course. And the increased options spell good news for players of all standards. You can get wedges with a variety of loft and bounce angles to suit a wide range of course conditions, swing types and personal preferences. They can be used to fill distance gaps from 100m into the green or to help handle specific playing situations more easily. No longer do you have to manipulate your sand wedge and your swing to hit different shots. You simply choose the club made to meet the photodemands of the shot you are most often faced with. Instead of laying open the clubface, looping a big swing and overworking the hands, you can take a 60degree wedge and get the ball to fly high and land softly with the same, simple action that serves you on all your other halfshots. You may need to grip down and adjust the ball position for some shots but the basics of the swing should be the same. So many strokes can be saved around the green by making the most of your options. On the following pages youll find some tips on how to play six different short shots and which wedge to use. Youll also read more about the sand iron and see the latest utility wedges available here. Try different models and specifications to find the club that best fills in your shortgame arsenal and start saving shots diagram caption Use lob wedge off hard ground Youre asking for trouble if your use a sand wedge in a packed bunker or off a bare, hard lie when you need to hit a high pitch over a bunker or mound even if your make a good swing. The bounce on the sole means that the trailing edge of the club will hit the ground first and jump or slid, usually resulting in the ball being bladed over the green. If you use the wedge with a lot of loft and little or no bounce, you can make the same swing, come in on the same angle and the result will be a nice, high, soft shot. Your setup should be influenced by whether you have an uphill or downhill lie. Generally, you should have your body slightly open to the target line, with 80 per cent of your weight over your left foot and your hands slightly in front of the ball."

        "text": "YIORGOS THE APEFACE WOKE UP EVERY MORNING WITH A COLD AND BLEARY LIGHT IN HIS EYES Yiorgos the Apeface woke up every morning with a cold and bleary light in his eyes and the smell of fresh bread. He filled his baskets with twentytwo loaves and rode across the village. Yiorgos the Apeface was a polite man, of a basically lonesome nature. He lived a quiet life and was betrothed to a girl from a distant town. He spent his mornings delivering bread for his mothers bakery and his afternoons cutting wood. In this ordinary life there was one thing that Yiorgos the Apeface liked especially to do. That was to sit in a corner of the shed when all the work was over and read. But whenever his mother, who grew up well before the first school began, found a book, she used it to light the fire. Vaia found her sons reading irritating. Yiorgos the Apeface was not a child any more, nor was he a schoolmaster. Reading could only encourage his lonesome nature. So when he finished his work, Vaia found more work for him to do. If he finished this work she sent him to help old Manolios the Kafedzis. When Manolios the Kafedzis died, leaving no children of his own, Yiorgos the Apeface naturally took over the kafeneio. Now, being such a famed miser, people wondered what had happened to Manolios money. During the night they kept digging up his grave to see if he had not taken it with him. In the end Meriklis the Gravedigger took the body out of the graveyard and buried it somewhere in an empty field. When the League of Good Men called this an unholy burial, Meriklis the Gravedigger said Manolios was not a holy man. He was the sort of man who would have liked the idea of being buried in an unmarked grave. As for his money, the truth is he had most probably spent it. For in his last days he had fallen on hard times. In the Days of Progress the kafeneio was just a place for old men to play with their worry beads. In the Days of Progress people worked like ants. There was a school, a doctor, a League of Good Men and never enough food. The League of Good Men drained the marsh and made new fields. Most of the villagers worked on the fields of the marshland and were paid by the League of Good Men in yellow slips. In the village these slips came to replace legal tender. The villagers could buy what they needed with the yellow slips in the League of Good Mens store. And it was on one of these days that the gorilla child was christened Yiorgos the Apeface. How hairy was Yiorgos the Apeface To his betrothed descriptions to a betrothed are found to be flattering he had been described as hairy, in a manly, handsome sort of way. Yiorgos the Apeface was an industrious man. He spent all week cleaning the kafeneio, scrubbing the floorboards, painting the walls and repairing broken chairs. He no longer had time to read and for this Vaia was relieved. On Sundays he put on his best suit, brushed his hair neatly, and waited patiently for the people to come. A few old men came, drank Turkish coffee, and played with their worry beads. Shy as Yiorgos the Apeface was, he came to enjoy the company of these old men. Now one day, among the many fine things that the League of Good Men brought to the store, were buckets of octopus. But the people of the village did not like the look of them. Even after the Doctor declared that octopus could cure headaches, backaches, make your daughters breasts grow round and her cheeks glow rosy, people still did not buy them. The League of Good Men squabbled about who ordered the octopus. And when they saw that the octopus would be thrown out, the League of Good Men declared they would give it to the kafeneio of Yiorgos the Apeface. Theodosios, who was a foreman in the League of Good Mens fields, was sent to the house of Vaia and Yiorgos the Apeface with two buckets of octopus. Theodosios had not been to his wifes house for many years on account of them being mortal enemies. But in the brothel it was well known to the whores that he cried out his wifes name in his sleep. Theodosios left the octopus in the courtyard. When she recognised him, Vaia chased her husband out of the house with a loaf of hot bread. But Yiorgos the Apeface accepted the buckets of octopus because it was the only thing his father had ever given him. Secretly he was delighted by it. Not knowing what to do with all this octopus, Yiorgos the Apeface went to the store and bought red wine and sacks of onion. That week people walked past the kafeneio and saw him beating the octopus on the verandah. In the Days of Progress this was an odd sight indeed, and people dawdled outside just so they could watch. Yiorgos the Apeface pounded the octopus until it was tender and cooked it in the wine. He also collected wild cherries and made a wild cherry drink. He painted a sign on a board, a modest sign with little black letters. Those who could not read asked their children what it said. It said simply that there was a wild cherry drink to be bought in the kafeneio for five drachmas. That Sunday many people wandered into the kafeneio just to have a look. No one was more surprised than Yiorgos the Apeface himself. And, being such a shy man, he became instantly afraid. He thought the people might become drunk, break windows and start a riot. But this did not happen. The people were very well behaved. They sat in the kafeneio and spoke to each other softly and sensibly. Women minded their children so they did not run about the place but sat quietly at their parents feet. Men were especially polite to their wives. Of course everyone asked about the wild cherry drink, and those who had five drachmas even got to taste it. As for the tender octopus in wine sauce, everyone daring enough to try it agreed on what a fine meal it was. That night no one stayed too late or laughed too loud. The League of Good Men, who were sleeping only streets away, had no idea of what was happening in the kafeneio of Yiorgos the Apeface. From then on the kafeneio of Yiorgos the Apeface was open every night. The people looked forward to it all day. Yiorgos the Apeface mostly stood behind the bar. He was still a shy man, still with a lonesome nature, but it appeared that he was cured at least of his reading habit. When the League of Good Men heard about the gatherings they went to the kafeneio of Yiorgos the Apeface to put an end to all the mischief. But when they got there they had to admit that there was no mischief, that everyone was well behaved. Everyone was laughing, but there appeared to be no drunkards. The meals were delicious and well priced. The wild cherry drink that everyone wanted was a sweet childrens drink with no spirits at all. Before they left they demanded that Yiorgos the Apeface at least pay for the octopus they had given him. In this payment, Yiorgos the Apeface was prompt. As people got used to each other, the kafeneio of Yiorgos the Apeface became a very lively sort of place. Yiorgos the Apeface did something quite uncharacteristic of himself. He bought a gaitha from a travelling tinker and taught himself to play it. When everyone was seated and served, he sat on the end of the bar and played his gaitha, and the people said that he had quite an ear for music. There was almost no one in the village who did not make an appearance at the kafeneio. Vaia put on her one good dress and came to her sons kafeneio. She want from table to table serving food. Theodosios saw her there one night and wondered at how lovely she had become. It was at the kafeneio that you found out who was born and who had died, who was paying what for the crop, who was in love and who was not. It was there that Abdul brought Fatime for a glass of cold water while she waited for the bus to take her to the town where she went for her countless abortions. It was there that the villagers first heard how Old Koulousios was sleeping with Young Koulousios wife. Sunday was a particularly good night because there were strangers from other towns, with news of the world. Now, the wild cherry drink never went up in price. As the modest sign said, it was five drachmas a glass. But the problem was that the wild cherry drink could only be bought with drachmas, and most of the villagers, who worked in the League of Good Mens fields, had little money, only the League of Good Mens yellow slips. Of course there were meals, tasty mezethes and many other drinks to be bought with the League of Good Mens yellow slips, but the wild cherry drink, as the modest sign said, cost five drachmas. For those with money the wild cherry drink was popular. The League of Good Men bought bottles of it to help put their children to sleep. Other men said that they wanted to buy some for their children too. Kostas the Butcher, who could not bear to miss out on anything, bought four whole bottles with money his wife had been saving for months. His daughter Marianthe came to cry in the kafeneio because that money had been to buy her green velvet from the travelling merchant. She had red hair and the man she loved would only have her in green velvet. The League of Good Men made up a cherry drink of their own and sold it in the store for only one slip. But no one bothered to buy the wild cherry drink of the League of Good Men. In his rooms the Doctor told all the people that if they drank the wild cherry drink of the kafeneio, worms would grow in their mouths and eat their teeth, but no one paid any attention to the Doctor. In the fields of the marshland Theodosios made a tired speech about how long and hard life seemed. He said the marsh had once belonged to everyone. He said now they were breaking their backs all day in these lands while the League of Good Men just sat on their arses. Theodosios took a handful of the League of Good Mens yellow slips from his pocket and set fire to them. The other men threw their yellow slips on the fire too. In the eyes of the field workers, Theodosios face had dignity. They left the fields vowing never to return. The League of Good Men brought in others to work their fields. They came to the village in forty carriages. The stangest collection of field workers the villagers had ever seen. They were made up mostly of mercenary soldiers and beggars with shifty eyes. There was also a tribe of women. Beautiful dark women who belonged to no one but themselves, proud women with faint moustaches. There was even a famous onelegged cutthroat just released from prison who kept tobacco and alcohol in his wooden leg. They pitched their tents near the fields and sat around fires signing songs that sounded to the villagers like barbaric war cries. Within two days there was not even one lock left in the League of Good Mens store. In the night a band of masked thieves emptied out the store of the League of Good Men."

        "text": "Loud Calls of the Yellowbellied Glider, Petaurus australis Territorial Behaviour by an Arboreal Marsupial Ross L. Goldingay Biology Department, University of Wollongong, Wollongong, NSW 2500, Australia Abstract The yellowbellied glider, Petaurus australis, is possibly the most vocal of all marsupials but little attention has been given to the functional significance of its calling behaviour. This study describes various traits of the calling behaviour and examines their significance. The traits were i calling occurred throughout the night but was more frequent in the first 3 h of activity ii calling frequency was significantly greater near the boundary 1 calls per 30 min rather than the core 2 calls per 30 min of glider home ranges iii calling and gliding were highly correlated iv calling rate was influenced by a gliders feeding behaviour and v experimental playback of calls simulating an intruder resulted in calling rates by gliders that were significantly higher after the playback 3 calls per 15 min than before the playback 8 calls per 15 min. Gliders approached the area of playback in 50 of tests in one instance from a distance of 200 m. Assessment of the calling behaviour of gliders, by reference to seven functions proposed for loud calls of primates, indicates that the most likely function of calls is to mediate intergroup spacing. The traits of the calling behaviour, together with the observation that glider home ranges are virtually exclusive of those of neighbouring groups, suggest that calls serve a territorial function. The use of vocalisations appears to be the most effective method for advertising territories, which commonly exceed 50 ha. A review of the use of loud calls by other species of arboreal marsupial showed that at present there are insufficient data to enable an adequate assessment of the function of loud calls among these species. Introduction It was recognised 60 years ago Carpenter 1934 that the frequent use of loud vocalisations by howling monkeys, Alouatta palliata, may play an important role in territorial defence, and such communication may also facilitate the coordination of foraging movements by monkeys within a group. Loud calls are arbitrarily defined as those vocalisations that are audible to a human at least 200 m from their source. In dense habitats, vocal signals are much less subject to attenuation than are visual or chemical signals e.g. Waser and Waser 1977 Croft 1982. Hence, loud calls are commonly employed by arboreal mammals. For example the use of loud calls has been documented for many species of primate e.g. lemurs, Phaner furcifer CharlesDominique and Petter 1980 bushbabies, Galago zanzibaricus, Galago crassicaudatus Nash 1986 tarsiers, Tarsius spectrum MacKinnon and MacKinnon 1980 gibbons,Hylobates lar Ellefson 1968, Hylobates muelleri Mitani 1985a, 1985b howling monkeys, Alouatta seniculus Sekulic 1982, Alouatta palliata Whitehead 1987a, 1987b titi monkeys, Callicebus torquatus Kinzey and Robinson 1983 mangabeys, Cerocebus albigena Waser 1975 orangutan, Pongo pygmaeus Mitani 1985c. The exact role of loud calls may vary among species. In gibbons and howling monkeys, the use of vocalisations may be overt and frequent, and vocal displays may precede chasing e.g. Ellefson 1968. Thus, vocalisations serve an obvious territorial function e.g. Raemaekers and Raemaekers 1985. However, in some species such as the mangabey, Cercocebus albigena, the use of vocalisations may be more subtle and result in mutual avoidance of neighbouring groups without any visual contact Waser 1976, 1977. Mangabeys do not show site defence and home ranges of neighbouring groups overlap substantially. Hence, their vocalisations do not serve a territorial function but play an important role in mediating intergroup spacing and may also provide ancillary functions such as facilitating the attraction of mates or communicating the location of food resources e.g. Waser 1976, 1977. Primates have received a disproportionate amount of research attention because they are ideal subjects for observational studies Terborgh and Janson 1986. A small number of studies of rodents, lagomorphs and wolves have also suggested that the frequent use of loud calls is associated with the spacing of individuals e.g. Smith 1978 Harrington and Mech 1979 Conner 1984 Lair 1990 although other functions may be important. Further assessment of the role of loud vocalisations by mammals other than primates will indicate whether generalisations can be made about the functions of frequent loud calls and may provide an insight into the selective forces involved. The yellowbellied glider, Petaurus australis, is a small 590 g, arboreal marsupial whose ecology is convergent with that of many primates because of similarities in diet and social organisation Goldingay 1989a. It is an ideal subject for comparison with the primates because it is extremely vocal and emits several different calls as it forages Wakefield 1970 Kavanagh and RohanJones 1982 R. Russell 1984. Moreover, the functional significance of its vocal communication has received limited consideration see Kavanagh and RohanJones 1982 R. Russell 1984. The aim of this study was to assess the role of the loud calls made by the yellowbellied glider. The study examined the following traits of the calling behaviour i the nightly pattern of calling ii variation in calling rate with respect to a callers position in its home range, and its feeding activity iii the vocal response of individuals to calls of other group members and iv the vocal response of individuals to loud playback calls made by unfamiliar individuals. Study Animal The yellowbellied glider occurs in the eucalypt forests of eastern and southeastern Australia. Its diet consists predominantly of plant and insect exudates, with arthropods and occasionally pollen providing the smaller but important protein component Goldingay and Kavanagh 1991. Gliders live in small family groups with either a monogamous or polygynous mating system and occupy large 2585ha home ranges that show little overlap with those of neighbouring groups Henry and Craig 1984 Craig 1985 Goldingay and Kavanagh 1991, 1993 Goldingay 1992. The calls of gliders heard most commonly are 1 full call two shrieks and a long gurgle, given when not gliding 2 gliding moan low frequency call emitted just after gliding out of a tree 3 gliding gurgle long gurgle given when gliding and 4 Short call a nongliding call similar to the full call but with only one shriek and repeated many times. These calls are given at frequencies of 74 kHz the main energy band is 13 kHz and have durations ranging from 75 s for the gliding moan up to 0 s for the full call Kavanagh and RohanJones 1982. Methods Study Area This study was conducted in the Coolangubra State Forest 37degree01S,149degree23E, approximately 20 km southeast of Bombala, New South Wales, and in the Kioloa State Forest 35degree35S,150degree19E, approximately 20 km northeast of Batemans Bay, New South Wales. The gliders at these sites have been the subject of studies that examined their foraging behaviour and social organisation and many individuals could be identified by coloured reflective ear tags see Goldingay 1986, 1989a, 1989b, 1990, 1992 Kavanagh 1987 Goldingay and Kavanagh 1990. Gliders are only active at night and observations were conducted with the use of a bright spotlight. This method of observation did not influence the behaviour of gliders because they noticeably habituated to the spotlight and spent much of their time foraging see Goldingay and Kavanagh 1993. Glider groups had mean homerange sizes of 34 ha at Kioloa and 63 ha at Bombala, based on a minimum convex polygon estimate Goldingay 1992 Goldingay and Kavanagh 1993. A few observations were made at a third location near Nowra 34degree53S, 150degree36E, New South Wales. Nightly Pattern of Calling In 1986, gliders at Bombala were followed for whole nights during studies of their foraging behaviour see Goldingay 1989b. In summer January, one glider from each of three groups was followed while in winter July, individuals from one group were followed for a total of three nights. During these periods, the times when calls were emitted were recorded. In January, the frequency of gliding by individuals was recorded to investigate the relationship between calling and gliding. In July, collars containing radiotransmitters were placed on gliders to facilitate continuous monitoring during the longer nights but it proved impossible to maintain constant contact with gliders as they foraged through creek areas. Thus, no detailed data were collected on gliding. Instead, because all group members foraged within a radius of several hundred metres of each other, the time of calls given by the other two group members was recorded. This provided further information on the pattern of calling. Influence of Food Type on Calling Behaviour Gliders feed on several different foods that vary greatly in abundance during the year. Exudates are obtained from only a small number of trees within a home range and gliders remain in such trees for extended periods Goldingay 1989b. For example, sap is obtained periodically during the year from a small number of trees of particular species, and gliders may spend whole nights in such trees Goldingay 1987, 1991. In contrast, when gliders are feeding on arthropods they spend significantly shorter periods in trees and visit a much larger number of trees. Therefore, calling behaviour may vary whilst foraging for different foods. However, if calls are given at random, calling frequency calls h1 should not vary for different foods. Calling rates were measured when gliders were feeding on different foods at Bombala. Glider groups at Bombala remained stable at 2 or 3 individuals Goldingay and Kavanagh 1990, so the calling rate was not influenced by the number of individuals in a group. The only data used were those from nights when the weather conditions were still and dry. Data were taken mostly from the wholenight observation periods in 1986 because feeding bouts were generally fully observed and weather conditions were similar. Gliders stayed an average of 184 min in a tree when feeding on sap compared with only 10 min in a tree when feeding on arthropods Goldingay 1989b. Thus, data on nongliding calls i.e. full calls and short calls only were recorded because the frequency of gliding may have elevated the calling rate when there was frequent movement between trees. Calling with Respect to Position in Home Range Territorial animals often display more commonly near the boundaries of their territories e.g. Effefson 1968 Robinson 1979 Mitani 1985a. If loud calls serve a territorial function then vocalisations may be given more frequently near the edge of a territory. This was investigated at Bombala by arbitrarily dividing home ranges into core and peripheral regions. The latter was the area within 200 m of a homerange boundary, determined from extensive observations of tagged gliders see Goldingay and Kavanagh 1993. The core was that area within 200300 m of den trees or major exudate trees. All calls given by a glider were recorded for 30min intervals when different gliders remained in the periphery or core for the entire period. If calls function to coordinate the foraging movements of individuals within a group then individuals should frequently respond to calls from other group members. Data were collected at Bombala to examine the influence of different call types on the calling behaviour of gliders within a group. The vocal response within 1 min of gliders to three call types short call, gliding gurgle, full call by other group members located nearby within 200 m was recorded. Vocal Response to a Simulated Intruder If vocalisations are used as a territorial signal then vocalisations of an unfamiliar glider should affect the calling rate of resident gliders. An experiment was conducted on glider groups at Kioloa and Nowra using the playback of a gliders full call to monitor the response of resident individuals to a possible intruder. A taperecording of calls of gliders in Nadgee State Forest, NSW, which had been analysed by Kavanagh and RohanJones 1982, was obtained from R. Kavanagh. For each experiment I entered the home range of a glider group early in the night and, if a call was heard, I approached to within 50200 m of the approximate locations of the call. No attempt was made to observe the gliders. All glider calls from the area of the original call and within 200 m of my location were then recorded during a 15min period. At the conclusion of that period a single full call was broadcast at the highest volume setting from a cassette player held approximately 2 m above ground."

        "text": "MACQUARIE UNIVERSITY RESEARCH GRANT MURG 1993 INFORMATION AND GUIDELINES The MURG Scheme is intended to provide several forms of research support for University staff members at a relatively modest level. It is now one of three schemes supported by the Universitys Research Budget the others being the Macquarie University Research Fellowships Scheme and the Macquarie University Postgraduate Research Awards Scheme. All three Schemes are dependent on the annual allocation of funds for the direct support of research from the University recurrent budget. Both the Fellowship and Postgraduate Schemes involve substantial prior commitment of funds from the overall recurrent research allocation which must be accommodated in the annual determination of the MURG component. REVISED ARRANGEMENTS FOR 1993 ONWARDS Having reviewed the Universitys various internal research support schemes during 1992, the Research Committee has decided to make some major changes to past arrangements. These changes do not apply to either the Fellowships Scheme or to Postgraduate Research Scholarships. The objectives of the changes are bullet to simplify application procedures bullet to make the scheme more flexible bullet to maximise access to all researchers bullet to update funding levels To achieve these objectives, there will be one major Scheme with a common application form. The whole Scheme will run twice each year. Round 1 will be for grants commencing 1 January, and Round 2 will be for grants commencing 1 July. The new arrangements will allow staff some choice in the timing of applications. It is hoped this will both improve integration with their personal research programs and maximise alignment with their development of proposals to external funding agencies in cases where the internal support is being used to seed an external grant. However, none of these changes imply that in real terms there will be more funding available than in the past. In fact, the increased funding limits in the Seeding and Supplementary Grants categories will necessarily require the Research Committee to be more selective in these areas. MURG will now have seven funding categories. The previously separate Visiting Research Scholars and Travelling Research Scholar Schemes will be subsumed by the new Scheme, and two additional categories, Publications Assistance and Teaching Relief, will be introduced to a limited extent in the first instance. The seven categories of research support and their funding limits will be Maximum Limit of Grant bullet Project grant 5,0001 bullet Publications preparation assistance 3,000 bullet Teaching relief assistance 5,000 bullet Seeding grants 14,0002 bullet Supplementary grants 12,0003 bullet Visiting Research Scholars support 6,70045 bullet Travelling Research Scholars support6,7004 1 Increased from 4,000 to 5,000 2 Increased from 12,000 to 14,000 3 Increased from 10,000 to 12,000 4 Travel maximum 2,500 plus living allowance 525 per week for up to a maximum of eight weeks 4,200 5 Applications in the Visiting Research Scholars category will not be available until Round 1 in 1994, as funding for this category in 1993 is already committed. MURG 1993 ROUND 1 Applications are invited for research support in accordance with the seven categories under Round 1 of the 1993 Scheme. If you wish to apply for research support, please complete one Research Proposal form for each grant category for which you wish to apply note, a maximum of two applications allowed and submit it to the Research Management Unit via your Head of School or Office. GRANT APPLICATIONS MUST REACH THE RMU NO LATER THAN FRIDAY 6 NOVEMBER 1992 Applicants should read the Information and Guidelines document carefully before completing an application form, since failure to satisfy guidelines may result in the return of the application. MURG funds are allocated on a competitive basis following consideration of applications received from individual staff members. The Universitys Research Committee, through its Chair the Deputy ViceChancellor Research, makes recommendations on such allocations. To ensure equity of access to funds, the following guidelines will apply bulletan applicant may submit only two applications per round of the Scheme bulletall grants are for a period of twelve months, although carryover of funds for up to three months will be allowed. This carryover period does not affect eligibility to hold up to two grants at any one time. bulletA personal maximum allocation of grants in any year will also apply. For 1993 this figure has been set at 17,000 at any one time bulletFor joint applications personal amounts are calculated simply by dividing the sum applied for by the number of applicants. This means that if a researcher were to submit two proposals under the midyear round and both were successful, then shehe would be ineligible to apply under the endofyear round that year. On the other hand, if a researcher successfully received one grant in the midyear round, shehe could expect to be able to submit only one proposal at the end of the year. Applicants should also note carefully the maximum number of applications they may submit under the seven categories specified on the form. For the total 1993 scheme, TWO applications may be submitted for Project Grants and Seeding Grants, and ONE application for each of the other five categories. Please note the following important points bulletA report of the applicants research activity during 1992 is absolutely essential for the application is to be considered by the Research Committee. This applies to all applicants, including newly arrived staff members. Where a report is not provided no funds will be allocated to the project concerned. bulletApplicants should give full details of support requested and awarded for 1993 from all sources, whether they be associated with established grant schemes or commissioned research contracts. bulletAny projects involving human or animal experimentation, defencerelated research, recombinant DNA, potentially pathogenic microorganisms, carcinogens, or ionising radiation will need to be considered by the appropriate University Ethics Review Committees. Applicants requiring new or continued clearance of their projects should complete the respective form and forward them to the appropriate committee. bulletFor applications under the Seeding Grants or Supplementary Grants categories, CSIROMacquarie University Collaborative Research Fund Grants and the ARC Small Grants cheme are NOT considered to be external funding. bulletIn the case of joint applications the SchoolsOffices involved should be indicated on page 1 of the application form and the application itself forwarded via the most appropriate School. bulletThe University has determined that researchers using experimental animals will be required to allow for the total cost of animals from their research grants. bulletAllocations are made for individual projects and funds are held within individual accounts and will be administered centrally. bulletFinancial reporting on these grants is the responsibility of the Finance Office. bulletOverruns or the commitment of funds for purposes not approved by the Research Committee must be avoided at all costs either may have impact on future funding. bulletAllocations are made for a twelvemonth period only for funds committed but unspent by 31 December 1993 carryover will be allowed up to 31 March 1994 and 30 September 1994 for grants commencing 1 July. bulletIn exceptional circumstances carryover to a later date may be allowed subject to a written submission setting out a full justification for such action being approved by the Research Committee. Round 2 of the 1993 MURG Scheme will be announced in April 1993, with a closing date in May for grants commencing 1 July. 1 ELIGIBILITY To be eligible to apply for MURG funding an individual must be a member of the fulltime academic staff holding a permanent or annual appointment, or a member of the fulltime general staff establishment. Individuals not eligible to apply are therefore research assistants, professional officers, technical staff and other individuals whose positions are funded from internal or external research grants. These include Macquarie University Research Fellowships, ARCfunded personnel, etc. Australian Postdoctoral Research Fellows may not apply in their own right however, they might apply as second chief investigator with their teamleadersponsor. ARC Research Fellows and ARC Senior Research Fellows are considered equivalent to fulltime members of academic staff. Other fulltime research fellowship holders whose appointments have been independently obtained ie they are not occupying a position initially secured by, or in association with, an academic staff member, as is the case with postdoctoral fellows may apply to the Research Committee for access to the MURG Scheme which will be considered on a casebycase basis. Research is not within the normal contractual obligations of general staff, therefore each application from a general staff member must be endorsed by the appropriate Head of SchoolOffice. In so doing, the Head of SchoolOffice will need to assure the Research Committee that a the project has academic value to the University, b the applicant has the capability to undertake the research, c adequate resources are available within the SchoolOffice to carry out the research, and d the research may be achieved within the applicants normal duties schedule ie it should not be done in the applicants own time. Where two SchoolsOffices or a School and an Office are involved, the Research Committee will need endorsement and assurances from both Heads of SchoolOffice. Note that ALL MURG applications must be submitted through, and supported by, the School or Office concerned. 2 APPLICATIONGRANT LIMITS bulletThe number of MURG applications per individual is limited to two per round. bulletThe number of MURG allocations held by any individual is limited to two at any one time, and must be from different categories. bulletThe personal maximum support will be 17,000 per individual staff member. bulletFor joint applications, personal amounts are calculated simply by dividing the sum applied for by the number of applicants, but the maximum limits for each Category will apply to the total grant. bulletAlthough applicants may wish to discuss an expanded budget in the body of their applications the actual sum requested and justified must not exceed the limit imposed by MURG guidelines for maximum grants. Failure to satisfy this guideline will result in the applications concerned being returned to the applicant. The Research Committee cannot guarantee to consider the resubmitted application in that particular round. bulletAny queries relating to these guidelines or procedures should be directed to the Research Management Unit Jennifer Newton, ext. 8609, Research Committee Cluster Members, or the Chair of the Research Committee. 3 GRANT CATEGORIES Applications must be submitted under one of seven categories 1 Project Grant Maximum Grant 5,000 For lowcost highquality projects which are either unlikely to attract external funds in the short term, or which require inherently low levels of support 2 Publications Assistance Grant Maximum Grant 3,000 For assistance in the preparation of manuscripts, etc, for publication. Support may be in the form of specialised services such as artwork or photographic work not normally the responsibility of publishers as in most scholarly journals and some monographs. Note that subsidies to publishers in the form of page costs, general publishing costs, and specialist services ordinarily undertaken by publishers as is common in book manuscript preparation will NOT be supported. Limited funds only will be made available in the first instance. Further information on this category is set out in Appendix 3 Teaching Relief Grant Maximum Grant 5,000 For relief of teaching duties where substitute staff may be employed without compromise to the quality of the educational service delivered. It is expected that this will include some routine courses and their associated administration, together with tutorial, laboratory and field assistance. It will NOT include the major lecturing components of courses requiring the specialised highlevel expertise of senior and experienced staff. It is intended that preference will be given to two classes of researchers bullet those who do not need any other type of assistance where it is essential that the applicant herhimself carries out the research and cannot usefully apply for other types of support such as might be obtained under the other four of the first five categories described in this section bullet those responsible for very large projects funded by Commonwealth granting agencies which do not provide any infrastructure support which could otherwise contribute to teaching relief or direct administrative assistance. NB Directors of Commonwealth funded Special Centres are not eligible to apply, given that other arrangements already exist to provide them with relief from teaching."

        "text": "Magistrates outburst refreshing The uncompromising outburst by Mr Michael Frederick, SM, in the Para Districts Magistrates Court at Elizabeth, might strike many people as intemperate, coming from the presiding officer of one of our traditionally most staid social institutions. Others will find Mr Fredericks comments a breath of fresh air. There can be no doubt he was driven by deep frustration, even anger, which is not always the best frame of mind to bring to a rational debate. At the same time, his frank views, his colorful language and his stinging criticisms, dished out with equal vigour to legal practitioners, defendants and court staff alike, are guaranteed to stimulate public interest. That is an important first step in effecting some of the changes that are alltooobviously necessary and long overdue. If Mr Fredericks language offended some people, that might not be such a high price to pay for change. It will be a pity if his comments are just dismissed as irrational or as an indulgence. Anyone who has been caught up in the interminable, expensive, bureaucratised court system, or who has seen its sinuous workings at first hand, will relate to much of what the magistrate had to say. We all have different tolerance levels. We expect them in a magistrate or a judge, of all people, to be buttressed by intellectual rigor, a sense of social, as well as legalistic, justice, and a decorum appropriate to high public office. We also expect our judges and magistrates to be people of the real world. Mr Frederick cannot be judged on this one outburst, although he has a reputation for calling a spade a bloody shovel. If anything, such a concession to the apparent years of stress and frustration are testimony to the need for urgent review of many aspects of the legal system. If Mr Fredericks attitudes, formed over six years on the bench, seem simplistic or crude, they are a perfect reflection of what a great many people, within and outside the legal fraternities, think but say only in the privacy of familiar surroundings. If some of Mr Fredericks comments appeared foolhardy, they were also courageous. And it was time someone said them. By lambasting some legal counsel, streetwise young offenders, special pleaders whose show of remorse is just a facade for the courts benefit, and a system which is bloated on public money but which is still inefficient, Mr Frederick voiced the concerns of us all. His attack should not be seen as one on individuals, although it was directed at those before him on the day. The Legal Services Commission, for example, dismissed by Mr Frederick with a curt legal aid, shmegal aid, is a fine institution which embodies a fundamental concern, that of the right of every citizen to legal representation. But it, like the courts themselves, is only as effective as the people who work there. And it cannot function unless it is properly funded and administered. For that the Government is responsible. As for those who work there, far too many use it as a softoption legup to gain courtroom experience and quickly develop the sheltered workshop mentality that cruels the professional environment of many publicly funded enterprises. Probably, Mr Fredericks tirade was an overreaction. It was a very human one, though, and understandable. It should not lead to pious tuttutting by colleagues who might have managed in various ways either to cope with more equanimity or to shelter themselves from the realities that Mr Frederick faces each day. It should certainly not lead to any move to discipline him for his indiscretion. In presenting us with a few hard truths in uncompromising language, Mr Frederick has made a contribution to changing those things that need changing. He may be seen as unreasonable in some of his views but, to paraphrase Bernard Shaw, it is the unreasonable people, not willing to accept the status quo, unafraid of speaking their minds, who change things in a world in which the vast majority of reasonable people prefer to do nothing. River boats locked in There is little point in River Murray boat operators claiming that a proposed fee for all vessels passing through river locks is insidious. Such a fee is a logical part of the userpays mechanism. Although the Government says it is not imminent, it is probably inevitable. Tourist operators and other boat owners can take heart, at least for now, from the fact that the Public Infrastructure Minister, Mr Klunder, despite earlier defending the fee proposal, now says SA will not try to implement it. The EWS document, which uses a crude method to determine a relationship between the number of locks, their cost and an alleged 25 fee for every vessel passing through them, is far from the last word on the matter. For a start, it would be unreasonable for boat owners to pay the full cost of lock maintenance and operation. There has been no suggestion, yet, that they should. But boat owners must accept the userpays approach and cooperate in looking for a fair way of implementing it. ACCs year of living dangerously Local Government Week, starting tomorrow, is intended to make us take a closer look at our councils. This is apt while the Adelaide City Council is proudly celebrating its sesquicentenary of being the first elected local government body in Australia. It is also celebrating a year of disasters with some monumental farces. The latest act is the threemonth delay to Beneficial Finances proposed East End Market redevelopment. This itself is an extension of four years of bickering over a variety of proposals for the site. Beneficial, a very indirect arm of the State Government through the State Bank, is thought to be losing 17,500 a day in holding costs since it put up its plans in December. Meanwhile the character of one of Adelaides most interesting precincts continues to deteriorate. The issue is muddied by legal action and by the developers politicking. Its design marginally breaches the City of Adelaide Plan but, it says, this is only so it can contain a residential component on which the council is so keen. It is outrageous that this wasnt sorted out months ago. On Monday, the councils planning and environment committee is to consider a negative report on the Beneficial project from city planner John Hodgson. It will be a test of whether the council remains scared of tackling big issues and of whether it is hopelessly split into factions for and against development. This last is a legitimate complaint of city manager Michael LlewellynSmith. He says the division between members is making it increasingly difficult for the administration. But then, in the byzantine world of our Town Hall, Mr LlewllynSmith must himself be questioned for taking more than four weeks to decide on whether the State Government should investigate a possible conflict of interest by Alderman Mark Hamilton. And nobody, elected or unelected, seems to emerge with much credit from the delays in the Town Halls 13 million restoration and the damage to the new organ and to the Adelaide Festival. In Local Government Week, the Adelaide City Council, teetering on the brink of condemning itself out of existence, deserves the closest watching indeed. Australian sensitivities Australia has been showing some disturbing signs recently of insensitivity in relations with Asia, notably with the proposed multifunction polis and Thailands reenactment of the building of the River Kwai bridge. Reactions here to both have suggested poor communication, if not racism. And they have caused poor reflections on Australia in Asia. Prime Minister Bob Hawke tried to please veterans this week when he successfully asked for a cancellation of part of Thailands annual River Kwai Celebrations, the part reenacting Japanese soldiers forcing war prisoners to rebuild the bridge. This is a sensitive subject for some veterans but that is hardly reason to deny its existence. Better to ask that it be properly done than cancelled so that, like the Hiroshima museum, it could be an enduring deterrent to mans inhumanity to man. The result has been a Bangkok newspapers condemnation of Australia for a lack of etiquette and an act of interference. This image of Australia, among a people to whom etiquette and independence are important, comes at a delicate stage of negotiations for Australian involvement in the SkyTrain commuter consortium and Westpacs banking licence in Thailand. The Australian fuss might not have arisen had the Thai show been better explained. It is similar with the multifunction polis. This is a plan for a 13 million city built by Australian, Japanese and other interests and dedicated to improving this nations technology, manufacturing and exporting. It is an idea worth pursuing. But it has been poorly explained to the Australian people. In Sydney, particularly, it has aroused some disturbing negativism among journalists and academics, with undertones of a Japanese invasion. These attitudes are reported in a leading Tokyo business paper under the headline Deep distrust of Japan, with suggestions that many Japanese companies were having second thoughts about investing. This comes a week after a 12nation conference in Singapore was looking positively on Australias visionary Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation grouping. Ominously, the major parties in out election campaign are keeping quiet about the multifunction polis and about anything to do with foreign relations. Communications among ourselves seem as poor as with our neighbours. We are walking into cultural minefields in seeking our regional future. We cannot, as the stereotypical Australian tourist does, stomp through in R. M. Williams boots. This weeks bad press in Asia suggests the need not only for better maps but also for treading a little more sensitively. Festivals for the future After festivalitis, sermons and soda water the day after, Adelaide can judge the 1990 Adelaide Festival a success. But it is a success with qualifications that must be taken seriously if we are to continue calling ourselves the Festival State. Artistic director Clifford Hocking can afford to feel pleased. His themes of world music were refreshing. And events in our autumnal outdoors especially Opera and Jazz in the Park were completely Adelaide. He also gave us some potential scratches under the skin. Indias Kathakali and a new Hamlet should have been challenges. The role of Aboriginality in Australian culture was raised if only on the Fringe. A subtheme of political persecutions could have been controversial. Yet there was a certain flatness among the public about this Festival. It is a comment on Adelaide more than on Mr Hocking that the controversies seemed to be a newspaper critique Peter Goers on Archaos and the Town Hall renovations. We do tend to be an apathetic audience. Mr Hocking sought to overcome this with many known, popular Australian performers. It is no critical reflection on any that they may have been too familiar to arouse fever pitch. In a lesson to the next artistic director, Rob Brookman, there was a marked lack of a central blockbuster to tear apart the critics and the dinner party conversations and to attract more people to Adelaide. That attraction is a legitimate and important function of the Festival, not only as a symbol of Adelaides unique lifestyle but also for tourism and the economy. Mr Hocking could blame the lack of a blockbuster on inadequate funding, and blame the popular entertainment on the need for boxoffice returns. And if there is any future decline in the preeminence of Adelaide as an art centre we could all lay some blame on governments. The Adelaide City Council and the State and Commonwealth governments are shirking their Festival support. They must be forcibly reminded that only Adelaide is qualified to remain Australias arts capital. This demands greater involvement of State Government ministers and of Tourism South Australia. Business sponsors might need more prodding. We might also examine another important event, the Barossa Valley Vintage Festival, and see if there are lessons in its powerful involvement of the community at all levels. Decisions by the Festival board and management affect everyone in South Australia, not just the people at the Festival Centre."

        "text": "The notion of a unitary concept of national identity, canonly be seen as a product of a person or persons imagination, particularly if consideration is given to the nature of diversity within cultures and their historical origins.Moreover, national identity is imagined rather than invented, as invention implies it has substance, when in fact it is ambiguous to say the least. To demonstrate this point examples of this diversity will be drawn from the cultures of Australia and the former Yugoslavia. This essay will consider within the bounds of possibility a definition of what a nation is. Secondly, it will argue that national identity is an invention in the minds of politicians and sociologists, for legitimating their theories and practices. Thirdly, it will argue that the concept of national identity is a form of categorisation, which excludes groups who do not conform to its model, therefore it is imagined and has little or no reality in most peoples lives. And finally, it will argue that the appeal of national identity is emotional and struggles for its legitimacy produce at best, xenophobia and at worst, ethnic cleansing. A clear definition of a nation is nonexistent, however, a sociologist would define a nation as a group of people who share a single communal identity, with a common history and culture within a geographical unit. A politician would define a nation in a similar way, perhaps adding language and ethnicity, but would include the geographical unit being governed by one political system. These definitions explain the relationship and difference between a nation and a nation state. Robertson l993, pp33l332 Conversely, Andersons definition of a nation suggests that the political and social are inseparable in the modern nation state, it is an imagined political communityand imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign. Firstly, it is imagined because most members will never know each other even though they share in an image of communion. This is due to print Capitalism which made it possible for growing numbers of people to think about themselves, and to relate to others, in profoundly new ways. l983, p40 Furthermore the community itself is imagined, as a nation is seen in the context of a deep and united fraternity, despite any inequalities or exploitation that may exist. Secondly, a nation is limited because of its self interest within its own boundaries as opposed to the notion of a global identity. And finally, these imaginings are so powerful that people are willing to die for them and it is this sacrifice which is the central problem posed by nationalism today and the seeds to the answer lie in its cultural roots. l983, ppl5,l6,40 The cultural roots or history of a nation according to Hobsbawm, is a retrospective mythology and he quotes from Ernest Renans lecture What is a Nation to support this theory. l992, p23 Forgetting history, or even getting history wrong are an essential factor in the formation of a nation. Which is why the progress of historical studies is often dangerous to a nationality. National identity is seen as a necessity, to ensure social and political unity and rulers of a nation have considerable power over the process of defining the national identity. Ernest Gellner argues that nationalism is a theory of political legitimacy, and ethnic boundaries should not separate the powerholders from the rest. Castles l988, p9 Therefore, any historian who tries to correct history and expose the national character as a myth, makes a political or social intervention which undermines the powerholders legitimacy. Nation builders and rulers often create a national identity in terms of ethnicity, thereby linking the political with the social for greater legitimacy. The problem with this categorisation or linkage is that it can create national separatism, as in the former Yugoslavia or national xenophobia, of the type found in Australia. Hobsbawm l992, pp2324 Anderson states that the cultural roots of nationalism are not to be found in political ideology, but rather in the cultural systems that preceded it, out of which and against, it came into being. l983, pl9 Australias roots sprung from the origins of a penal colony and as a British colonial settlement. According to Ward, the convictderived bush ethos grew and flourished and became the most important component of the national mystique. Furthermore, all legends have some basis of historical fact and Australias national characteristics are widely attributed to the bushmen of the last century. These characteristics included dislike of authority, mateship and a tough ruggedness, which enabled them to survive in the harsh Australian outback terrain. l958, ppl5 The legend of the bushman was continued on and incorporated into the Anzac myth, which was politically motivated and connected to Australias relationship with Britain. Lohrey l982, p29 The Anzac Myth was a powerful invention of national identity and conjures up as Anderson put it, ghostly national imaginings, that are enshrined in national monuments like cenotaphs and tombs of unknown soldiers. l983 pl7 However, as Edward Said pointed out Culture is a system of discriminations and evaluation, which means that culture is also a system of exclusions. Gunew l990, pl03 The exclusions from the Australian national character were firstly, the original aboriginal inhabitants, who at that time were not being colonised, but being murdered with the ambition of extermination. Gunew l990, pl03 Moreover, the national identity serves to ignore any history of Australia before British Colonisation in lSecondly, women were excluded from the national identity, their role in shaping the nation was ignored rendering them invisible and reinforcing their subordinate position. Thirdly, it ignores the role of the British Imperial state and the upper classes. Castle l988, p9 Anderson states the British imperialism was a cultural policy of anglization and stresses the incompatibility of empire and nation. Australians could not become Governorsgeneral until much later on and these positions were held by the English English. l983, p89 It appears that native born Australians began to look for a national identity around the same time as the idea of nationalism and its preoccupation with catergorisation became popular. However, the inventors of national identities are part of the imagined community and its cultural process, consequently identities are created in the context of beliefs at that time. Walter l989, pp2l22 Furthermore, the cultural process happening at that time for Australia, was an attempt to distance itself from colonial rule and move toward independence and nationhood. But ultimately, those who had the greater power to define history and the national character selectively ignored competing definitions and the result was invention rather than reality. Foster l99l, pp237238 Australia today, is the product of a continual migration process and its population is drawn from all parts of the world. It is a nation based on citizenship rather than ethnicity and according to Price, over two thirds of Australians are now of mixed ethnic origin and that is steadily increasing. l99l, p9 The Australian national identity has remained connected to past history, while its culture has been continually changing, increasing the distance from reality. This was evident by the amount of protests voiced, regarding omissions and the selectivity of symbols for the BiCentennial Australia Day celebrations. Walter l989, pp89 The notion of a person or persons without a nation appears to impose a far greater strain on the modern imagination and defies the recognised categories. Belonging to a nation has become imbedded in peoples minds as a necessary requirement for completeness. Gellner 1983, p6 Consequently Hobsbawm argues, when society fails, the nation appears as the ultimate guarantee. This seems to be evident in the breakup of the Soviet states in the USSR after the end of the Cold War and particularly in the ex Yugoslavia. The result has been a resurgence of ethnic and nationalist separatism and the conflicts appear to be historical. Hobsbawm also argues, ethnicity turns into separatist nationalism for similar reasons to that of colonial liberation movements, which establish their states within the frontiers of the preceding colonial empires. Moreover, the Soviet Constitution had divided the country into theoretically ethnic territorial subunits. Therefore, historical ethnic divisions in Yugoslavia had been suppressed by the Soviet Union and as a consequence of its collapse, these historical ethnic lines are where the fractures are appearing. Conversely, when a community or society fails and peoples sense of belonging is threatened, restoration is sought through the imagined community of the nation or the ethnic group, because is seen as permanent, indestructible and guaranteed by birth. Hobsbawm 1992, p2526 Nations have become cultural products and nationalism the cultural process from which sociologists, anthropologists and nationalists have promoted nationalcultural identities to legitimise their causes. Foster 1991, pp235236 A sense of belonging is the human emotion used by promoters to make their appeal. But to understand nationness and nationalism, Anderson suggests a study of how they came into historical being and the ways their meanings have changed over time, may explain why they command such profound emotional legitimacy. 1983, pp1516 The first dispute in the ex Yugoslavia is The Macedonian Question, in which two nationalist ideologies are making claims to the cultural property of the nation as part of their national identity. The problem is that two national identities Greeks and Macedonians are being constructed from the same raw materials and national symbols. The solution appears to be that these two cultures could share these foundations for their identities and that double meanings may coexist. The denial of either partys rights would be a form of symbolic ethnic cleansing and this may lead to a more literal form such as the type happening in Bosnia. Danforth 1993, p10 The end of Soviet rule in the exYugoslavia, meant for the Serbs and the Croats, a chance to reclaim the European birthright of which they had been deprived. For the Muslims it meant freedom of religion, Western style democracy and European Community membership. Sorabji 1993, pp3435 Conversely according to Verdery, the members of the former ruling apparatus do not see themselves as being able to participate in a democratic, market based society. Therefore, they have become powerful opponents of moves towards democracy and effective supporters of nationalism. The type of nationalism being claimed is ethnic in origin, which restricts its membership to those who qualify, and the result is three cultures with ancient histories in conflict. 1992, p9 Andersons theories on history explain some features of the Ethnic Nationalism in Bosnia. Firstly, it is based on history and the more the ancient dynastic state is naturalised, the more its antique finery can be wrapped around revolutionary shoulders. Secondly, Revolutionaries always, to some degree, inherit the state from the fallen regime and this includes some of its former members. And finally, it is leaderships and not the people who mobilise popular nationalism, largely after the fact and always in the language of self defence. 1983, p146 The Claimants to a superior ethnic identity in Bosnia are the Croats and the Serbs, the victims are the Muslims. The nature of ethnicity can be broken up into three elements and they are kinship, language and religion. In relation to kinship, the length of generations in one area varies and ties to kinship vary from group to group. Language is confusing as any area in which a major linguistic boundary exists, the people are bilingual. Also the dialects spoken between the groups in Bosnia are very similar. The religious history of the area is complicated as religions cut across the divisions of kinship and language. The nature of diversity and intermixture within these groups produces inconsistencies, which are the results of cultural migrations, caused by previous wars, conflicts, imperialism and revolutions. Therefore, the symbolic elements of ethnicity are inconsistent in a historical context and as a consequence the claims made by ethnic nationalists of identity, are imagined to create legitimacy for their cause. Hammel 1993, pp78 According to Hobsbawm the collapse of the familiar society creates fear of the unknown and groups join together with visible badges of membership and recognition signs, but the result is separatism and denial of what the human race has in common. 1992 p26"

        "text": "New Federalism and Health J.R.G. BUTLER Australian National University The recent new federalism proposals are aimed at addressing problems such as vertical fiscal imbalance, and the increasing proportion of Commonwealth grants to the states as specific purpose payments. This has evoked some concerns in the areas of social welfare and community services. These concerns have centred on the ability of the states, in the event of any of the relevant specific purpose payments being untied, to maintain national uniform standards and pursue distributional objectives in these areas. This article considers the current hospital funding arrangements in Australia from the perspective of the new federalism. It argues that such arrangements have led to a structural imbalance in the market for hospital services, while at the same time imposing significant constraints on the ability of the states to address this imbalance. The prospects for alleviating the imbalance, while preserving the distributional objectives of the present funding arrangements under the new federalism proposals, are then discussed. Two voucher schemes which have been proposed to reform hospital financing in Australia one for health insurance, the other for hospital services are outlined and their merits considered. It is concluded that these schemes are in accord with the tenets of the new federalism while maintaining universal insurance coverage for hospital services. It is now well over a year since the prospect of a new federalism appeared on the horizon involving, among other things, an untying of specific purpose payments to the states, rationalisation, and elimination of duplication of services. In that time, some policy changes which accord with the spirit of the new federalism have begun, eg, with respect to the regulation of heavy vehicles. But an area which has given rise to some controversy in this context is social welfare and community services. From the outset, fears were expressed that national uniform standards could not be maintained if significant powers in these areas were handed back to the states. With the states suffering fiscal stress itself a manifestation of some of the problems which the new federalism aims to address, some felt that expenditures on social welfare programmes would be subject to fiscal retrenchment if their financing reverted to state governments. Consideration of the issues raised by the new federalism has already led a major review of the Aged Care Reform Strategy to recommend That in recognition of the need for full integration of the planning and financing of residential and community care, one level of government take overall responsibility for these functions CDHHCS 1991a, 229. This article is concerned with issues surrounding the new federalism and the financing of health care. More particularly, its focus is on hospitals, as hospital funding entails a large Commonwealthstate intergovernmental grants programme which accounts for the bulk of Commonwealth specific purpose payments to the statelocal sector for health.1 Two main questions are addressed. First, in what ways might the current hospital funding arrangements give cause for concern in terms of the tenets of the new federalism Second, what reforms could be implemented which would allay the equitydistributional concerns mentioned above with respect to other social welfare and community service programmes and at the same time lead to microeconomic reform and the untying of the tied hospital grants The main thrust of the paper is contained in the following three sections. The next section provides a brief outline of the macro health care financing arrangements in Australia. This is followed by a discussion of the effects of the hospital financing arrangements on the states, highlighting the constraints which the current arrangements impose on states decisionmaking with respect to hospital policy. The broad features of a reform proposal based upon a voucher scheme are then outlined in the final section. It is argued that this kind of scheme has the potential to attain the distributional objectives of the Medicare hospital programme while simultaneously reaping the benefits of the new federalism initiatives. The Macro Health Care Financing Environment The Medicare Hospital Funding Arrangements Since its inception in 1984, the Medicare health insurance system has had as its objective the provision of universal medical and hospital insurance to all eligible persons.2 The medical insurance component of Medicare provides a rebate to eligible persons for approved medical services.3 This rebate is equal to 85 of the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee for services provided out of hospital and 75 of this fee for services provided to hospital inpatients other than Medicare inpatients. The medical insurance scheme is administered by the Health Insurance commission. The hospital insurance component of Medicare is organised quite differently. The Commonwealth government has entered into agreements with the states generally termed the Medicare agreements whereby the Commonwealth will provide specific purpose grants to the states towards the costs of their public hospital systems. In return, the states have agreed not to levy any charges for treatment provided by their public hospitals to eligible persons who, being inpatients, opt to be treated as public patients such patients being referred to as Medicare inpatients or who, being outpatients or casualty or emergency patients, opt to be treated at a public hospital casualtyoutpatient department. The distinction between these two components of the Medicare programme is important to an understanding of the economic incentives arising out of the programme. But opting to be treated as a public inpatient in a public hospital, a person can avoid bearing any of the costs associated with that inpatient treatment, ie, they face a zero price at the point of care. If that person opts to be treated as a private patient in a public or private hospital, the charges levied upon them for medical services will be covered by Medicare medical insurance to the extent of 75 of the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee but no cover will be provided by Medicare for the hospital charges. Patients who wish to have insurance cover against these hospital charges must purchase such cover from private health insurance organisations. Private Health Insurance Although the private health insurance industry in Australia is heavily regulated by the Commonwealth under the National Health Act, there is no subsidisation of private health insurance premiums by any level of government. Purchasers of such insurance, however, do not necessarily pay actuarially fair premiums as these are effectively ruled out by the community rating requirements imposed by the legislation Gadiel 1988. This results in a considerable degree of crosssubsidisation within private health insurance from relatively lowrisk groups to relatively highrisk groups, although overall there is no subsidisation of private health insurance as such.4 Another relevant feature of the regulations is the requirement that private health insurers offer cover against the 25 gap between the Medicare rebate and the Medicare Benefits Schedule fee for inpatient medical services. Insurers are required to offer this cover as part of their Basic Private Hospital Table which is geared to the needs of private patients in public hospitals Gadiel 1988,59.5 Private Hospitals Private hospitals were subsidised by the Commonwealth in one form or another from 1953 up until October This assistance most recently took the form of a direct occupied bedday subsidy with three different levels for three different categories of private hospital. In 1985, the Senate Select Committee on Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes held two public hearings to examine the categorisation system and private hospital subsidisation. It concluded that the rationale for the subsidy no longer existed.SSCPHNH 1987,,125 and hence concurred with the decision to terminate the subsidy with effect from 1 October The Senate Select Committee on Health Legislation and Health Insurance 1990 did not support any proposals to reintroduce private hospital subsidies. There is then no direct subsidisation of private hospital charges at the present time, but a relatively small amount of indirect subsidisation occurs by way of tax deductions. Tax Expenditures The term tax expenditures refers to subsidies provided by governments in the form of tax deductions or tax rebates, so that the governments revenue is not as large as it would have been if the deduction or rebate had not been allowed. Since 198586, a tax rebate of 29 of net medical expenses in excess of 1,000 incurred during the financial year has been allowed. Net medical expenses are calculated as the total medical expenses incurred less any rebate from Medicare, a private health insurer or any other insurer. Quantitatively, tax expenditures on health care have represented only a tiny fraction of total health expenditure in recent times. In 198687, they totalled 3 million which amounted to 6 of total Commonwealth health expenditures and 2 of total health expenditures AIH 1990.6 Effect of Health Financing Arrangements on the States The Structural Imbalance Thesis It is evident from the foregoing discussion that the changes which have occurred since 1984 have had the effect of reducing the price of public hospital services to zero while at the same time increasing the price of private hospital services. At present the only source of a subsidy for private hospital charges, or for public hospital charges for private patients, comes about through the tax rebate for net medical expenses in excess of 1,Individuals who choose to insure privately will pay an unsubsidised premium for such cover, a premium which may be more or less than that which is actuarially fair given the community rating requirement. Individuals without private insurance will pay the full cost of private hospital charges plus the gap between the Medicare rebate and the medical fees actually charged less any tax expenditures to which they are entitled because of the tax rebate. This pattern of relative prices for public and private hospital services can be expected to result in an increase in demand for public patient treatment and a reduction in demand for private patient treatment, all other things constant.7 At the same time as this change in relative prices has been occurring, the supply of public hospital beds per capita has been falling while the supply of private hospital beds has remained virtually constant see Butler 1991a 403. Given this scenario, it can be expected that occupancy rates and waiting lists for admission to public hospitals will have risen while occupancy rates for private hospitals will have fallen. A structural imbalance then emerges excess demand for shrinking hospital capacity in the public sector combined with excess supply and underuse of private hospital capacity. Table 1 presents some date on public and private hospitals in Australia for the period 198283 to 1988Considering first the discharge rates, there is a distinct change in the per capita growth rates in both public and private hospitals in the preMedicare 198283 to 198485 and postMedicare 198485 to 198889 periods. Predictably, the growth rate in public hospital discharges turned around from an average annual change of 3 preMedicare to 2 postMedicare, while for private hospital discharges the growth rate fell from 3 to 9. The turnaround in public hospital discharges has occurred even though the public hospital bed supply has bee falling. The extent to which these changes in the growth rates of discharges are reflected in the occupancy rates depends upon the behaviour of average length of stay. For both hospital types, this has been falling throughout the period, particularly so for private hospitals in the preMedicare period. Nevertheless, the occupancy rate increased in public hospitals after the introduction of Medicare.8 Data on waiting lists for public hospital treatment would bring further evidence to bear on the structural imbalance thesis, but unfortunately such data are not readily available. The limited information which is available suggests that waiting lists may have been growing in the late 1980s, but evidence is scant Butler 1991a, 403. A report from the National Health Strategy released in September 1991 discusses the waitingtime issue and presents some date, concluding that it would appear that waitingtimes in most states for some procedures are inappropriate National Health Strategy 1991, 11. The trends indicated in Table 1 cannot, of course, continue indefinitely. If waiting lists for public hospital treatment grow, this nonprice rationing effect can be expected to induce more people to take out private health insurance and use private hospitals. Some recent data from a survey of private hospitals indicates that the estimated occupancy rate in such hospitals has increased each year since 198889 to a level of 4 in 199091 with average length of stay falling to 5 days in the survey period CDHHCS 1992, Tables 3A, 6."

        "text": "Negotiating cultural difference on seeking, not always successfully, to share the world with others or, in defence of Embassy Clive S. Kessler University of New South Wales When, in May, the editor of the Review approached me to contribute to a debate on the continuing utility of the concept of culture in our efforts to understand the countries of Asia and our relations with them, his invitation was nothing but timely. For, like many Australians politicians, diplomats, journalists and workaday citizens, as well as academic specialists I had been pondering the unhappy pass or impasse that AustraliaMalaysia relations seemed to have reached. No academic expert in international relations am I. But, with my long standing scholarly interest in Malaysian society, as well as my continuing theoretical interrogation of the concept of culture bequeathed to me by my intellectually formative involvement in the distinctly different, even rival, worlds of socalled British and American anthropology as well as contemporary sociology, I was struggling with this unnerving problem in Australias regional identity and relations in my own characteristic way by attempting to probe the discrepant, and often quite unrecognised, cultural assumptions that seemed to inform the views of both parties in this confrontation, both of the other side and of themselves. To identify and then make explicit these tacit presuppositions, not simply to myself but to wider publics of thoughtful and concerned people on both sides would, I felt, be salutary. It might not, I was ready to admit, succeed in solving the problem as naive academics are too often inclined to assume such endeavours will however, simply being able intelligently to recognise the problem and the divergent underlying cultural presuppositions that had engendered it to see it even in its intractability for what it is, if that is indeed how serious our problem really is might at least enable us to live with it more maturely and constructively.1 1 This article draws upon a presentation given to the weekly faculty seminar, Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Malaysian National University on 12 September 1991, entitled AustraliaMalaysia relations a personal view. It may be worth noting that on that occasion a most spirited discussion ensued, characterised not by any simple agreement but by some recognition of, and a genuine readiness to explore, the underlying grounds and discrepant cultural presuppositions of some of our ordinarily unacknowledged difference. Two realities to Kuala Lumpur and back In the days immediately preceding my departure for Malaysia on study leave, Senator Evanss conciliatory visit to Kuala Lumpur was covered prominently by the Australian press and television. But while, en route home, our Foreign Minister would soon declare from Singapore that the problem was now largely solved, things were not so simple. On the day of my own departure for Kuala Lumpur, the papers I read in the Sydney airport departure lobby contained angry letters denouncing Senator Evanss grovelling to Malaysian sensitivities and demands2 while on my arrival in Kuala Lumpur I soon encountered Malaysias hardly tentative response to our ministers unilateral Singapore declaration that all was now well. Not Good Enough was one blazoned headline rejoinder to a report on Dr Mahathirs insistence that we cannot accept Aussie explanation.3 2 For example, The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 July 3 Sunday Star, 28 July More were to follow. A series of letters to the editor, commencing with one headed Furore over Aussies flattered them too much, was soon prominently featured in the New Straits Times4 further criticisms of the foreign, especially Australian, media were voiced by Dr Mahathir at the ASEAN Information Ministers meeting in late July immediately following Senator Evanss departure and subsequently by his Minister for Information Datuk Mohamad Rahmat,5 including the claim that the ever critical, even hypocritical, foreign press were always seeking to find and highlight some unflattering or scandalising political angle typically, as to who in some favoured position had allegedly derived some undue advantage or material benefit in what were really straight economic stories and the resources of the nations best cartoonists were also mobilised. The habitually mordant but goodnatured, even affectionate Lat well known for his own wry but uncompromising references to his societys shortcomings as well as its strengths produced a cartoon which depicted Australian Broadcasting from the Fair Dinkum Network relaying its TV specials not from a normal outsidebroadcast vehicle but a garbage truck. The caption read And now dotted line our crew is back with the latest dashes6 No less remarkable was a commentary by the senior journalist A. Nazri Abdullah7 and the savage cartoon by Zoy accompanying it. The latter depicted a large and overbearing foreign journalist in peremptory conversation with an eager, deferential and seemingly somewhat intimidated local colleague What are journalistic ethics like in your country, the local journalist asks. Well, the foreign journalist replies, youve got to master hoaxing and humbug, know how to deceive and libel, to fabricate and embellish stories dotted line for example, to present economic issues as political ones. Asking why do the foreign media tell lies, Nazri Abdullahs commentary went on to explain 4 Letter by Syed Akbar Ali, New Straits Times, 2 August Some subsequent contributions to the debate include Lets make peace, not find fault with our fellowmen by An Australian fellow human and Getting facts right in Aussie bashing by Keith Bruce Sergeant, both in New Straits Times, 8 August 1991 and Be levelheaded toward criticism, Aussies told by Fair Dinkum, New Straits Times, 14 August See also the column by V.K.Chin, AussieMsian ties still cool comment, Star, 13 August 5 The text of Dr Mahathirs address, headed Daunting task for men at the helm, is to be found in New Straits Times, 2 August The views of the Minister for Information that, resentful of Malaysias successes and Dr Mahathirs international stature, the foreign press were out to turn Malaysians against their government, tarnish Malaysias image, undermine its unity and development, thwart its progress and insidiously to colonise Malaysian minds are summarised in Groups out to undermine us, says Minister, New Straits Times, 14 August 6 In New Straits Times, 5 August 7 Mengapa media asing suka berbohong Why do the foreign media lie, Komentar hujung minggu Weekend commentary, Berita Minggu, 4 August This is truly a remarkable riposte to Malaysias critics. Some people, it suggests, cannot but be truthful while others can never be so, simply because of the differing religiouslyinformed intellectual traditions in which they operate. It is a remarkable rejoinder because, if it is true, it entails that what is defective, and grievously so, is not simply Australian or Western journalistic practice but the inherently and pervasively duplicitous culture from which they stem. It would hardly seem possible to ask a government, no matter how well inclined not merely to discipline its press as Malaysia urged Prime Minister Hawke to do but, more fundamentally, to repudiate the very culture of which the society that it governs is itself an expression. And if it is not true, it would seem a terrible libel against an entire civilisation and its religious foundations that had been made within the official media of a nation that was itself protesting that it was the victim of unwarranted and prejudicial lies.8 8 Similarly, during nationallanguage religious programs presented on television an official government medium and apparently prepared under the auspices of the Islamic affairs section of the Prime Ministers Department, it is common to hear comments made suggesting that only Muslims are really clean, that all other religions are deficient or distorted in some way and hence rejected by God, that only Muslims can live a truly moral life while nonMuslims are necessarily amoral and entirely promiscuous, and that Western societies and indeed all societies that have undergone any process of secularisation must inherently lack any moral foundation whatsoever. To what extent claims such as these are recognised as at least arguably untrue by those religious experts who, with official sanction, make them, or to what extent those so typified might be acknowledged as entitled to consider them as prejudicial or lies, is unclear. For explicit accusations that the Australian press was involved in producing lies about Malaysia see Dr M press freedom doesnt mean the right to print lies, New Sunday Times, 28 July 1991 and PM free press is not licence to lie and Dr M. takes Australian press to task, both in New Straits Times, 2 August Interestingly, in his complaints Dr Mahathir has gone well beyond the position taken some years ago by Lee Kwan Yew in his dispute with the Asian Wall Street Journal and Far Eastern Economic Review. Then, in restricting their circulation within Singapore, Lee conceded that the foreign press might say what they pleased for their overseas readership the purveying of what his government considered malicious untruths among Singapores own citizens, however, constituted an improper form of interference in his countrys own internal politics. Dr Mahathir objects not to what the Australian press and entertainment television are saying to his own people, who in the case certainly of Embassy can have no direct knowledge of or access to it, but to their own domestic readership and audience. Clearly, the problems we face in managing the now fraught AustraliaMalaysia relationship are great. Unless we begin to address and explore their origins as a problem in intercultural communication, we will not succeed in overcoming or even merely in coping with them. Such efforts are clearly themselves fraught and potentially counterproductive witness here Harold Crouchs attempt to explain what he saw as the form and strategy of Dr Mahathirs expressions of displeasure by reference to the concept and Malay cultural pattern of merajuk, to which rulers and other traditional leaders habitually had recourse.9 Taken up, not always discriminatingly, by other Australian commentators,10 it became in turn a further source of resentment among discerning Malaysians of genuine goodwill because of its perceived obtuseness and inappropriateness.11 How little good, ironically, his own experience, his undeniable wisdom and sensitivity, and his awareness of a significant flaw in our own national character would do Crouch himself here Well able to recognise that Australians often give the impression that they think they know all there is to know about other countries and that Australian experience provides the basis for the solution of other countries problems, he directly pointed to a discomforting fact that few Australians were ready to acknowledge that it is not only Dr Mahathir who reacts negatively to such Australians.12 Yet, good intentions notwithstanding, to misread anothers cultural reality, as Crouch seems to have done, may in the end be no better than to be totally blind or arrogantly indifferent to its existence. Those offended by his merajuk comments seem little assuaged by this proof of his capacity to see himself and his compatriots in the hardly indulgent eyes of others. 9 Mahathirs merajuk calls for Australian patience, The Sydney Morning Herald, 17 April 10 For example, a subsequent article by Tony Parkinson in The Australian entitled Pride of face in a culture of misunderstanding. 11 See Sri Delima Adibah Amin, The right meaning of merajuk, New Straits Times, 4 July 12 H.Crouch, Embassy, Malaysia and a diplomatic debacle comment, ANU Reporter, 24 July Cultural identity and the negotiation of difference What, then, is my own understanding of the term culture, and is it involved in any more than a trivial or incidental way in understanding the problem confronting us, both Australian and Malaysians, here Stated simply, the view, both intellectual and moral, that informs my own anthropological consciousness and that of most of that disciplines practitioners converges with what is also the foundation of the moral vision, or view of the human condition, of the philosopher Hannah Arendt. Modern anthropology has been a quest to fashion the terms of a totalising view of the human situation a view that may enable us to grasp, within the same underlying conceptual terms, both the unity of humankind and the enormous diversity of the various forms of life in which it finds, and throughout history has found, expression. It is the attempt to see humanity, in all its diversity, as a set of variations upon a common theme. That theme is provided by our generic human nature as a set of broad potentials those explored in particular by what used, under a peculiar division of intellectual labour within the discipline, to be called physical anthropologists or human biologists that, to be realised at all, however, can be realised only in some specific forms in the lifeways of particular societies that serve as the objects of the research conducted by socalled social and cultural anthropologists. Physical anthropologists, that is, explored the biological basis or physical ontology of the human situation social and cultural anthropologists pursued the intensive study both descriptively in the case of individual instances and also comparatively of the various phenomenal forms, the diverse sociocultural worlds, in which that common ontology as a set of existential possibilities and also constraints finds expression. For many otherwise quite different practitioners of the discipline as I have previously put it, the anthropological outlook or stance or vision is a distinctively dual one. An anthropological understanding stems from the simultaneous viewing of an object from two perspectives, from the fusing together, as it were, of images refracted through two quite disparate lenses. Anthropology seeks to pursue simultaneously a grounded understanding of both the unity and the diversity of humankind, of the oneness of the human situation and of the plenitude of the numerous, dramatically varying forms that situation takes. It seeks to fashion a set of terms in which, with equal facility and appropriateness, we can comprehend both generically what it means to be human, to be a person at all, and also what it means to be a person of a particular time and place, fashioned within some unique, historically realised configuration of social and cultural circumstances. Modern anthropology contends that these are not two separate questions instead it rests its claim on the insistence that each of these two questions can be pursued only through the pursuit the simultaneous pursuit within the same broad conceptual frame of reference of the other. Anthropology is thus concerned with the discovery of the general features of human existence within and through the study of its widely varying particular forms.13 13Marx as cultural theorist the prehistory of modern anthropology, in D.J.AustinBroos ed.Creating Culture Profiles in the Study of Culture Sydney Allen and Unwin, 1987, p.See also my remarks on these themes in my discussion of The cultural management of death individual fate and its social transcendence, in M. Crouch and B. Huppauf eds., Essays on Mortality KensingtonKensington Studies in the Humanities and Social Sciences 1, University of New South Wales, 1985,pp135 How is such an anthropological understanding pursued Here Hannah Arendts ideas are apposite. For her, such diversity or plurality was the essence of our humanity, and their exploration and affirmation our means of its enlargement. Her central, hardearned understanding I have noted elsewhere was that to be human, properly human, is to think and that thinking implies plurality, the existence of others with different views. We can think at all only by conceding that things might in fact be otherwise, by admitting simultaneously into our own consciousness more than one possible way of looking at an issue and of somehow bringing these different views or approaches into mutual engagement. Often, this process consists of an internal dialogue between the position that we ourselves are now forming or inclined to hold and the ensemble, or residue within us, of all the significant views on the same subject that, through reading and conversation, we have previously taken into our own minds from others. The difference and plurality that, for Arendt, thinking by its nature presumes, are for her also fundamentally political in their origins as well as their implications, for they are of the public realm, which is the site of the political an arena of free human engagement for the full realization of personality, the negotiation and affirmation of difference.14 It is only by engaging with difference, not simply intellectually within our own minds but in the pluralistic public or political world where difference has its origins and is upheld, that we can ever really understand ourselves. 14 C.S.Kessler, The politics of Jewish identity Arendt and Zionism, in G.T.Kaplan and C.S.Kessler eds., Hannah Arendt Thinking, Judging, Freedom Sydney Allen and Unwin, 1989, p. Becoming who we are and taking full possession of our own historically conditioned cultural identities something that we must all attempt if we are to live responsible lives is, then, of a piece with the practice of anthropology"

        "text": "The passages that I have chosen do indeed show that this authors style is consistent and pervasive. It affects two very different texts widely separated in time. The author is Natalie Zemon Davis a noted social historian, professor of history at Princeton with a career spanning America and France. Her speciality is l6th century France. Social history is a democratic discipline interested not in elites but in the ordinary doings of individuals. There is thus no intrinsic order to the material as for example in legal institutional, political or military history. It is a good field, therefore, to see the kind of order imposed by an historian on her sources. Passage I is from an essay on Printing and the People and is itself from a collection of essays published in l965 by Stanford University Press. It has the usual academic format of notes and index and seems at least primarily to be aimed at Davis academic peers. Passage II is from her book that arose out of her research for the film The Return of Martin Guerre published by Harod University Press in lThis still has notes of less complexity, and a selected Bibliography but is much less formal in tone. Davis makes concessions to a less scholarly reader in Passage II where she uses technical historical terms like gasaille and terrier. She makes their meaning clear. In Passage I she uses one or two unfamiliar words and a couple of French phrases but none the less their meaning, though not translated is clear from neighboring collocation. Menu peuple is close to people. Unreadable word meacutechaniques is associated with a discussion of the relative status of surgeons and physicians. In neither work is there any noted jargon. Neither is heavily latinate or nominalized. The lexical density of Passage I is 53 and Passage II 48 sample of 202 28l words respectively. In short though apparently written for different audiences Davis clearly favours a relatively informal easytoread style that is inclusive not exclusive. She favours certain ways of binding her material together in both passages. She moves from the general statement at the beginning of a paragraph to specific particular detail in the Source material. She choose a vantage point from which to view the intellectual or geographical landscape such as the assembly of Passage I or the Surrounds of Artigat in Passage II. From this point she then describes her observations. Of note is her use of verbal tenses She varies back and forth between the expected past tenses of history to the present tense of her sources. In this way she creates a social context which includes her reader in the material. In passage I Milles de Norry gazes at the reader. In passage I the various individuals trade and agreements are in the present tense. Davis makes little use of the passive voice as would be expected in her informal style. When she does it is to provide a reflective distance from the subject matter passages were written down. The circle of authors that widened was given romance through publication both passage I. Interestingly Davis uses some of the very familiar split verbs get intocome out passage I taking up set up passage II. This is another instance of informality of style and consistent between the two works. Davis favours longish sentences but these are not hard to manage due to the careful and consistent patterning that she employs. She favours repeating syntactic patterns, pairings of words, some synonyms antonyms. In Passage I she repeats like the learned writer twice and attaches similar syntactical groupings to both instances. Proud contrasts with humble but author portraits is paraphrased by donor picture. In passage II sometimes is then repeated and then is continued with most often as an organizing pattern. She favours pairings backandforth villages and burgs expenses and profits share the cost split the profit Passage II. In passage I this kind of patterning is also pervasive. The Protestants read, talked, sang and prayed reading from printed books contrasts with learning from printed books. In her contrast of previous periods and her period she uses both the change from past to present tense but also the connective adverb Now twice to stress the topic position in the sentence passage I. Again consistent with her informal readily accessable style Davis uses pronouns freely. This of course works cohesively within the text as well as avoiding an unduly nominal style. Davis uses patterns of series as well as parallel structures. This combined with a heavy use of prepositions and attached phrases allows her to modify her nouns in such a way as to add many extra details from the sources. Davis does not favour any particular kind of sentence structure simple compound and complex alternate freely which gives diversity of rhythm and variety of delivery. She makes full use of the mobility of adverbial and adjectival phrases, sometimes delaying the subject or separating it from its verb. This is not truly pervasive and is mostly present in Passage I. Davis has a quite marked and personal style that is present in two fairly different works. Her use of verbs is very interesting and indicative of an inclusive bent of mind. Her use of connectives draws the text together into a neat organization of material. But like, In short, nor But now Theres Passage I, Such If Sometimes In this situation Passage II put the final ordering of thought clearly at the beginning of the sentence. Davis has a remarkably readable style, whether she aims at primarily her academic peers or more to the general reader. In neither case is she exclusive Martin Guerre is satisfying to the academic, Printing and the People accessable to the thoughtful nonspecialist. The audience that Davis creates with her style is potentially very wide. Her democratic subject gets a democratic treatment. Her use of verbs brings the reader into the circle of the sources, her connectives give a prevailing order to those sources her vocabulary pronouns, patternings and series make it hard to imagine any other ordering of the material. The resultant text has rhythms close to the intonations of speech. The overall style is very persuasive. At least in the case of Davis, despite the fact that these two works are separated by l8 years, there are indeed consistent pervasive and quite characteristic elements that imbue what she writes about. An authors style is consistent and pervasive even if they write both fiction and nonfiction. David Lodge has managed to fuse a novelists style and an academic style to create a easy academic style. Naturally there are discrepancies, the textbook contains more nominalization, such as theorization, demonstration, importance, theoretical in the Forward. Lodge also has more passive sentences in the textbook and academic jargon peculiar to his field, such as signified, signifier, deconstuctionist in the Hartman introduction. However considering the different intent and purpose of the books these differences are negligible and it is the similarities that are interesting. One of the aspects that ties the texts together could be their common readership people who are interested in literature. The difference in the texts can be accounted for by tone, rather than by style. Lodge tends to use a stack type pattern to impart ideas. In three of the passages marked Hartman excluded he starts with a bold claim and then fleshes it out in subsequent sentences. This is also consistent with topical progression No 4 of the Prague School of Linguistics. This type of format reveals a synchronic mind. Lodge seems to be a similarityseeker rather than a continuityseeker. Another aspect that reveals Lodge as having a synchronic type of mind is cohesion. He favours lexical over grammatical cohesion. Lodge starts with the specific and goes to the general, or the hyponym to the superordinate. For example in the Forward of Modern Criticism he starts with Theory and moves to this collective enterprise. In the Hartman introduction he starts with various aspects of deconstruction, such as signified under the signature, deferral of determinate meaning to the superordinate of deconstruction. In Small World page 222 Lodge starts with small wooden jetties to aquatic bus stops to simply the stops. Page ll4 of Small World provides one of the best examples, starting with passenger then customer and finally to people. The grammatical cohesion seems to be at the end of each sentence, quite often a sentence will end with a generic it, one etc. Page ll4 of Small World particularly adheres to this aspect, and the Hartman introduction ends with it. The sentence structure seems to be similar in all cases, starting with a noun, then a prepositional phrase, which refers to the noun immediately preceding it, or commences with a noun and then immediately a verb. Lodge favours right branching, and conveying his ideas in selfcontained packages. There are few adverbial phrases starting sentences, or even clauses. Lodge builds his arguments after stating something as fact. One area where the academic has influenced the novelist is in sentence length. In the four passages the average is over 30, which is excessive for academic writing and double the norm for fiction. Yet Lodge is okay on Hallidays lexical density scale. He hovers around the ideal of 50This anomaly of long sentences, yet a good lexical density could be attributed to the many prepositional phrases in his long sentences. Another area of influence, but the other way where the novelist influences the academic is the preference of performative verbs. In Small World page ll4, inspect, check, tear out, tag, ask, allocate, issue, cancelled, conclude, on page 222, stitched, swerve, reversed, disembarked and bargained, this is not surprising in a novel, and appears natural. However in a textbook, performative verbs are not the normal but Lodge uses them to great effect, in the Forward generated, borrowed, merged, interfused, recognize, in Hartmans introduction, postulate, liberate, explore, reveal. This quick analysis demonstrates how an academicnovelist fuses their style to create a unique idiosyncratic style. However, it seems that the academic style is more prevalent, particularly in the passages selected from Small World. Lodge uses dialogue and gaps to move his text forward, but when setting the scene, as in the passages highlighted he treats it in an academic argument. This style also reveals the synchronic mind at work, Lodge is more concerned with convincing his readers, than of moving forward. The synchronic mind is usually an academic mind, seeking verification, further arguement to validate a claim. The passages from George Orwells fictions Coming Up For Air Keep the Aspidistra Flying and his article written to the Tribune titled As I Please illustrate how the authors style is consistent and pervasive both in his fiction and nonfiction. Orwell uses the verbal style of writing and combines this with use of both past and present tenses, giving a lively and easy to read text. On reading the passages it is obvious that he endeavours to create a conversational effect and uses interactive devices and choice of personal words to achieve this. Coming Up for Air relates the characters thoughts and memories and has a predominant use of the personal pronoun I, asserting the personal nature of the content of the passage. Orwell tries to get the reader to identify with the character and what he is relating and therefore uses interactive devices which ask for the reader to participate. The sentence watch a woman a woman who really knows how to cook, I mean rolling dough, asks the reader to be active, it is a command. The use of dashes here are to relate an aside and have the effect of casual intervention such as would be used in conversation. Further on in this passage the character asks a question why should she, which again asks the reader to participate. Keep the Aspidistra Flying is written in the second person pronoun, but like the previous passage relates the characters feelings and memories."

        "text": "At the time of my venture into the fine art of forgery I had been some years with a printer. We produced pamphlets, books bound in morocco, and everything between. I began by setting broadsheet ballads when I was fifteen, after four years an apprentice. Each broadsheet had a woodcut picture. As often as not I hawked the first batch in the streets of Douglas myself. They sold for a penny each. I was quite the young blade about town. But before long I was put on to more exact work. My father thought the job a foible and not fit for a man to do. He said he expected I would grow out of it and take up something serious perhaps in the line of his own work. My mother scolded him for a troublemaker. She encouraged me. As for Hall, my model in life, he brought us together by humouring our mother, following our fathers trade, and singing the ballads I printed. His favourite would have you in stitches I am sure Whack the folthe dah, dance to your partner Welt the flure yer trotters shake, Wasnt it the truth I told you, Lots of fun at Finnegans wake. That ballad, so filled with characters, was his favourite not just for the tune, but because it sang the glory of getting drunk. In case you are wondering at his being christened Hall, his middle name was Henry, so both given names began with H. I thought this the grandest thing. I was never drunk. Any time he led me on, Hall always kept a sharp eye on me. If I had had enough he invented some urgent call on our loyalty, a friend we must not let down, an appointment we must keep. I used to fret at this. I sulked a good deal,I dare say. I accused him of being selfish and maybe he was. But it is certain he loved me. Your father is a man of trade, our mother said with a laugh and the wind dancing in among her hair, whereas you are a man of craft. And what am I, then cried Hall. But she had no answer for him. Her eyes grew dark and her mouth helpless. Hall was her pet and she could not shame him. I knew what was what, because she walked in her sleep. Into the room we shared, manys the night I saw her creep and stop in the sightless way of her ailment, facing his bed but not looking down at him. If you ask me she sensed him through her skin. Then she would turn and wander back to the dreams of her own bed. Our father knew too, proof being that he was often awake when she returned cold, because a quarter hour later their bedhead started banging up against the wall. Then began the nights when she stood in her sleep knowing Hall wasnt there. Those same nights she would find her sheets cold too when she made it back to bed, and wake like that. I lay fired with jealousy, jealous that she loved him best and jealous of his freedom to go out with our father. Hall could now claim to be in trade himself. Sundays they brought home quail eggs and a purse of earnings. Trade is about the size of it, Hall told her with his eyes merry. He lapped up the excitement and couldnt wait to put her through the torment again. This is the life of the people anyhow either they go along with the law or they damn it to hell. Does he have the skill, she asked her husband, notwithstanding that he talks too much But she knew the answer already and turned to me. So youre the last hope of commonsense I am left, she said, and if you must go to the foolishness of making a fortune make it of the skill you have. Welt the flure your trotters shake, sang Hall, wasnt it the truth I told you, lots of fun at Finnegans wake. He and I went out to trap some rabbits. As we tramped through the crunching heather I told him about her, how she walked in her sleep I told him she stopped by his bed and that was all. We walked. He could be quiet when the time called for it. He laid an arm across my shoulders to show he understood. Then we played at wrestling. Unless on his part it was not play but the serious matter of proving that my worries on his account were uncalled for. With one arm he could withstand whatever weight I threw against him. Taking string for the neat little trick we had with loops, plus a sack for the catch and several stocks, we came to the dragon stone. A fanciful notion, Hall replied, setting me straight when I began to speak in a low tone of respect, a fishs body, a tigers feet, a bats wings and a tongue of fire. He laughed, scornful. Meat for some hero to kill before supper, he said. This was what sent me to the shelf of books in the workshop. I knew one flaky leather spine bore the title, Heroes in History and Fable. The first page told me that however important our history is to us our fairytales go deeper, that what we decide to do becomes history, but those actions going beyond choice fall into the pattern of the fables we are told. This book had a whole chapter from the Thebaid of Statius about two heroes, one called Tydeus, but the other name slips my memory. Then came the commentary, just four pages long. Such a very suitable length. I took my mothers advice. I had not expected Oxford to be a deceitful town. I came on foot, avoiding Derbyshire, home of the deposed King of Man, through Solihull and Warwick, Stratford upon Avon and Edge Hill, entering the county from the northwest. My last stop before Oxford was Banbury Cross. I mention Banbury, although the cross itself had long since been destroyed, because there, sleeping under a hedge, I had a dream. The sound of harps called my attention to a courtyard in which two persons rode round and round on horseback. The horses cantered in contrary directions, a young woman making the inner circle and a man in rich robes making the outer circle. They kept the same pace. But as they went round, the bridegroom grew in power until I looked for somewhere to hide, fearful that I might be caught prying. His raised arm a triumphant gesture, he threw back his head till what I saw of it was a bearded mouth. The beard jutted black with threads of grey. I remember this because I remarked in the dream how the myopic persons dreams are free of myopia. I am sure you are familiar with that fault in a dream when you go absent for a moment to dream you are aware of dreaming. During this lapse the horses had veered on to the same track. The emergency gave me a jolt, especially when I saw them merge to a single horse, a single rider the mother into whose body the lordly man disappeared. She caught me watching. She tugged at her jingling reins, turned the stallions head, and came at me. I never had this dream before. And never since. So I can be sure it was once only. I woke into the night, scrambled out. By broad moonlight I stumbled down on to the road and set off right away for Oxford. I would not risk another hour in that illomened spot. Twentytwo miles or no, I believed in my heart that if I did not reach my goal before the next night I never would. Such are the foolish fancies of the young who set themselves goals. I am amazed to think that it could not be more than three years since this happened, since a time when I would swear that if I arrived at some signpost before a bird flew across my path I would have seven years of happiness. You know the kind of thing Well, this time I swore that unless I made it to Oxford I would never grow up. My idea of growing up, I might add, was to be like Hall. The fields were freshly turned, apple trees were in bloom, and all the way a cuckoo called to me, always too far away to be seen. The land lay full of promise. And I got there, though we are talking about that time of spring when the nights still fall early. By dusk I came in view of the spires. I took a room in a public house because next morning I must present myself spruce for business. As I say, I had not expected Oxford to be a deceitful town. I mistook its charm. The inn was a coach stage and across the yard a smith sat early in the day shoeing a posthorse amid the hubbub of arrivals and departures. He hammered nails with deliberation. He chose not to notice me when I went over and stood near. Having wished him good morrow and taken my place among some children who watched, I offered a comment on the quality of the beast. Tis her ladyships own, he growled. The hammer blows made a sharp unpleasing sound. Metal on metal. Up until then I had not known how hungry I was but now an aroma of fried gammon filled the whole yard. I must not be tempted I had so little money. I took my precious folio, promised myself a royal feast when I returned, and set out along backstreets behind the colleges. At one point I asked my way of a young scholar not more than a year older than myself, thinking he must surely treat me kindly if for no other reason than the fellowship of youth. I took the route he pointed out, only to learn that he misled me so that I had to retrace my steps. Back where I started, and quarter of an hour wasted, I realized my purse had been stolen. There were four pennies in it, enough for a full meal of the best cooking, enough for goodness knows what else. Yet I must not be put off. I had the future and my family to think of. I found the shops of three respectable dealers. Which would I try Courage failed me because I admitted ignorance not knowing what to look out for. I wandered from one to another and back, peering at them from across the street, pausing to pat a cur, gazing at reflections in a tobacconists window to tell what I could, hurrying away, returning, loitering and then rushing past. I had not yet learned that timidity is the most dangerous vice or that such simple dodges would be noticed. It is likely I would be there still, growing long in the beard with dithering, but that, as I passed one for the fifth time and read yet again the goldembossed sign, the wine merchant next door struck a cask with his mallet the tuneful sound very different from horseshoeing I saw the spicket knocked out, the cask being mounted on a counter just inside the door. He began to fill a jug with dark frothing wine. I dont know why but that decided me. I called myself to order and took a deep breath. The dealer, when he stood up from his desk to greet me, showed himself to be a tall man of sixty years or more. The veins of his hand were dark and particular as the rivers on the maps hung behind his desk. The smell of this place put me at home in an instant leather and paper and old size. When I brought out my Commentary upon the Thebaid of Statius he treated it with reverence."

        "text": "equipment review Sony MZR2 portable minidisc recorder photo its been some considerable time since Sony added to its MiniDisc lineup certainly long enough that it allowed Sharp to sneak in under its guard to offer the worlds smallest MD portable All that has now been corrected. In one fell swoop, Sony has announced no fewer than eight new MiniDisc models, one of which, the MZR2, wrests the worlds smallest MD player title back into Sonys corner of the ring at least for the time being. The biggest news for audiophiles is the MDS501, a full sized Minidisc recorder thats said to offer improved ATRAC algorithms, which result in better sound quality than previously available from MiniDisc, and a full swathe of MiniDisc features and editing options. However, at the time of going to press, the only new Sony model that was actually available for review was the MZR2 portable, Sonys secondgeneration MiniDisc Walkman, a digital MD recorder thats actually smaller than a packet of cigarettes and not a whole lot heavier than a small carton of Moove. MiniDisc, Walkman, Sony and MD are all trademarks andor copyright of the Sony Corporation. Moove is a trademark of the Dairy Farmers Corporation. The Equipment If any audio company even Sony had predicted in 1984 that in less than ten years it would be possible to produce a magnetooptical digital recorder capable of recording up to 74 minutes of highfidelity audio, small enough to fit into a standard shirt pocket and weighing less than 310 grams including battery and with a battery life of more than two hours, I dont think anyone would have believed it. Well here it is, in the shape of the Sony MZR2, and just to see Sonys new MD recorder is to be amazed by it. Unlike Sonys first portable, which had a slot on its bottom edge into which MDs were inserted, the MZR2 snaps apart on a hinge, to allow a disc to slide in underneath the lid section which also functions as the control panel. This clever design simplifies the loading mechanics, extends battery life and allows the MZR2s shallow depth of a mere 30 mm. After a MiniDisc is inserted, the disc initialises during which time a small spin icon is displayed in the liquid crystal display on the front panel, along with a battery icon after which the name of the disc is shown, together with the number of tracks and the total available playing time. If, after this, you dont press a function button within 5 seconds, the MZR2 turns itself off, to conserve battery power. The obvious function button to press is Play, which starts disc replay. However, you can use a Play Mode button to select between Single Play Disc, All Repeat Disc, Track Repeat and Shuffle Disc. Then, so you cant accidentally knock a button and interrupt playback, you can slide a Hold switch to the right, to lock all the function buttons out. Sonys version of Hold is very effective to say the least you cant even open the lid without defeating Hold and even removing then replacing the battery doesnt help. During replay, a vertical bar at the left of the LCD shows recorded level. If you press either of the two volume buttons or , a horizontal display across the top of the LCD replaces the track title readout to show output level as a bargraph. You can alter output volume up or down as you please, with the display tracking your movements to indicate what you are doing, but following three seconds of no activity. the display vanishes, returning the LCD readout of the name of the track thats playing. As most readers will already know, MiniDiscs can display not only the title of the disc, along with performers, venues and so on, but also the names of individual tracks. The LCD fitted to the MZR2 can display only nine letters or figures at a time, so longer titles are box information excerpt scrolled from right to left. Because of this, titles of any length can be accommodated theres no limit other than the simple proviso that the time it takes to scroll through a title must be shorter than the playing time of the track itself Either side of the play button are the forward and reverse track skip buttons. Track access in the MD system is virtually instant in most cases faster than CD. Further to the left and right of these controls are the Stop button and the Pause control. Other controls on the front panel are Track Mark about which more later, End Search searches a partially recorded disc to locate the first available space to start a new recording, Erase Erases Tracks, but only one track at a time and Display Toggles between showing the name of the disc, the name of the track and the date and time a recording was made. Arrayed down the lefthand edge of the MZR2 are a bass boost button two levels of boost available, a lineout socket 5 mm stereo phone socket, a lineinput socket a custom fitting that combines a standard 5 mm stereo phone socket analogue with an optical digital connector and a coaxial digital connector, and a microphone input with phantom power suitable for Sonys ECM909A or ECM7227P stereo microphones. The front edge of the player holds the Record, Open and Hold slider controls as well as the slot for the supplied headphoneremote control accessory. HeadphoneRemote Positioned almost midway along the headphone cord is an inline remote control. An extremely neat little device, with a chromed clip on its rear, to allow it to be clipped to a lapel or pocket, it allows control over volume , track skip two left arrowstwo right arrows, stop black box, pause two vertical lines, track marking, hold onoff and AVLS Automatic Volume Limiter System. This last control is specifically designed to protect your hearing when listening via headphones. Many people are unaware that the enormous dynamic range of MD and CD, for that matter makes it quite easy to damage your hearing by continuously listening at levels that are too loud, but that you cont perceive as being too loud because of the clarity of the signal and the lack of any external sound pressure reference. The AVLS system, when it is switched on, limits the output level of the player. The headphones supplied as standard with the Sony MZR2 are small buttonstyle models which fit inside the ear. If you dont like this style of headphone preferring, for example, fullsize, padded headphones these can be substituted, since Sony has had the foresight to equip the MZR2 with a standard 5 mm stereo phone jack for this purpose. However, if you use a nonstandard pair of headphones, you cant use the remote control, because the two plugs get in each others way. I did not consider this to be a problem. The battery pack supplied as standard with the Sony MZR2 is a tiny LithiumIon rechargeable thats not much bigger than an ordinary AA battery. However, completely unlike an AA battery even a rechargeable one, Sonys new hightech battery LIP12 has a rated voltage of 6 V and a capacity of 1,200 mAH. According to Sony, the LIP12 permits 120 minutes of consecutive recordingor 150 minutes of consecutive playback with a fully recharged battery. Note particularly Sonys use of the word consecutive to indicate these times are only attainable if you record or playback continuously, without using pause, stop etc. So in practise, youll get less recordplay time from the Lithium battery than this. If you do get caught short, Sony supplies an additional external battery pack which screws onto the top edge of the MZRThis pack, if fitted with standard Alkaline batteries, will provide an additional 150 minutes of playback time or a further 120 minutes of recording time. This would be extended even further if you use the new Lithium rechargeable AA batteries. If you know in advance that you will be in for a long recording or playback session using batteries, its better to connect the external battery pack at the beginning of the session, because running the two battery packs in parallel gives more recordplay time than if you stopped and switched power sources halfway through. Running the packs in parallel results in 5 hours of playback or 5 hours of recording. At this juncture I will note that MiniDiscs have the capacity to store a maximum of 74 minutes of sound, so if you record for 5 hours, youll need three 74minute blank Minidiscs and one blank 60minute MD. Some of Sonys publicity seems to indicate that the MZR2 is capable of recording 104 minutes on a single disc. This isnt true. At present and for the foreseeable future 74 minutes is the maximum. When you are close to a 12 volt or 240 volt power source, you can use Sonys caradaptor lead CPA8 or its 240 V power supplyrecharger ACPMZ60A. The ACPMZ60A is diagram caption diagram supplied as standard equipment when you buy a MZR2, but youll have to fork out for the CPA8 yourself. And, while Im talking cables, Sony supplies a standard analogue connecting cable stereo 5 mm phone jack to twin RCA plugs on a onemetre long cable, but neither of the optical digital cables POCMZ1 or POCMZ2. For convenient integration with a system, you will need to buy as least one extra cable even if its just another analogue connection cable. My feeling is that Sony should provide two analogue cables as standard, rather than just one. The only other accessory is a neat little beltpouch, which allows you to carry your MZR2 around on an ordinary belt. Underneath the MZR2 are two pinpricksized holes that allow you to set the clock and reset the whole system. There are also a few lines of type that might cause some confusion in audiophile circles. Those lines are US and Foreign patents licensed from Dolby Laboratories Licensing Corporation. The reason some people might be confused is that on most audio products, these lines usually signify that the product incorporates Dolby Noise Reduction Dolby NR, or Dolby Surround Dolby ProLogic circuitry. In fact, the MZR2 contains neither. What happened was that the Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding ATRAC that is the heart of the MiniDisc system and which, in fact, was developed independently by Sony, turned out to infringe several US patents held by Dolby. As a result, Sony and other MD manufacturers including Sharp, Alpine and Sanyo, have been obliged to obtain ATRAC licenses from Dolby. Listening Sessions My enthusiasm for the MZR2 was slightly damped when I inserted a blank disc, and tried to identify it by recording my own name and address in the ATRAC subcode, as I had with Sonys first portable MZRI discovered that I couldnt. It appears that the MZR2 does not provide this facility. In terms of recording additional data, all it permits you to do is record the date and time of individual recording sessions in fact this is automatically done for you. So, if you wish to record the additional data the MD format is capable of displaying disc name, track titles etc you will need a second MD machine capable of doing this. For most people, this will mean investing in a fullsize machine, such as the MDS501, or at least finding a friend or friendly retailer who has diagram diagram such a machine and will let you program your MDs. I must admit I was rather surprised at the omission of an alphanumeric recording capability on the MZR2, since Id been led to understand that many of the people who purchased the original MZR1 were journalists or soundrecordists, for whom having this facility was relatively important, as it allows records of interviewees names and other details to be stored along with the recordings of their voices. One presumes that Sony is aiming the MZR2 at the much larger group of amateur home recordists for whom such a facility might not be quite so important. In fact, one of my first trials was recording an interview, and I was more than pleased with the performance of the MZR"

From the information provided by you we are of the view that you have a sustainable claim for compensation arising as a result of the incident that occurred on the premises of K Mart Chatswood on 26th November, In relation to such claim we note that shop proprietors have a relatively stringent duty of care to members of the public that frequent their premises. In accordance with such duty, generally, proprietors of businesses must ensure that all areas upon which the general public have access are free of any obstacles and safe from any unforseen incidences. In light of the present state of our instructions we are of the view that a prima facie claim for compensation can be made on your behalf. Having regard to the actions of the employees of K Mart Chatswood in stacking the shelves whilst members of the public are in the immediate vicinity the proprietor of the supermarket would, in our opinion, be found to be negligent giving rise to your entitlement to compensation for the injuries.

In accordance with the medical report obtained at the request of Coles Myer we note that it is their view that all of Nicolas present symptoms stem from her work and not from the incident that occurred on the 26th November We find this view totally inconsistent with Nicolas history and the views expressed by both Dr Dixon and Dr Bone.

        "text": "PETER CAREY THE TAX INSPECTOR 12 It was the day they had tried to put her in a nursing home, but it would be the same on any other day when Mrs Catchprice went to lock the big cyclone gates of Catchprice Motors, she would look up at Cathy and Howies apartment window. The look would say just try and stop me. At six oclock exactly in two minutes time Howie would look through the Venetian blinds and see her apartment door open, like a tricky clock in a Victorian arcade. First, the old woman would put her nose out and sniff the air. Then she would look down at the cars. Then she would come out on to the landing and stare at the window where she thought her enemy was waiting for her to die. She thought it was Howie who conspired to commit her. She needed no proof. It was obvious. He was fiddling with the books, renting other premises, preparing to set up as a Honda dealer, in opposition. He was plotting, certainly, continually, every moment of the day, but what he was plotting to do was to have a life like Ernest Tubb, The Gold Chain Troubadour. He was plotting to have his wife run away with him. It was only Cathy who kept him locked inside those cyclone gates. She had an entire band trying to drag her out on to the road. She had Drunk as a Lord with a bullet on the Country charts. She had fans who wrote to her. She had a life to go to, but she was a Catchprice, and she was tangled in all that mad Catchprice shit that had her shouting at her mother while she fed her, at war with her brother while she fretted about his loneliness, firing her nephew while she went running to his cellar door, knocking and crying and leaving presents for him she bought him dope, for Chrissakes, dope, in a pub, to cheer him up. You would not want to know about that kids life, his brother either. They were like institution kids with old mens eyes in their young faces, but she loved them, unconditionally, with an intensity that she tried to hide even from her husband. Howie could not trust those boys, either of them, but he had learned not to speak against them in his wifes presence. Indeed, Howie had become as calculating and secretive as Granny Catchprice thought he was, but he did not covet Catchprice money or the Catchprice Goodwill Factor and he did not want to set up in competition to the family firm. His happy thought was of long tendrils of vines snaking through brick walls of Catchprice Motors, collapsed fire escapes, high walls covered by bearded mosses and flaking lichens, rusting cyclone fence collapsing under a load of Lantana and wild passionfruit. He was not counting on Granny Catchprices death to free him he judged it would be too long in coming. Mrs Catchprice had the only authorized keys to the cyclone gates, and she would not give them up. Every morning at halfpast six she opened them, and every night she locked them up again. They were not light or easy. You could see her lean her brittle little shoulders into the hard steel and guess what it might take her to get those big galvanized rollers moving. But she would not give up those keys to anyone. If you wanted to get a car out of the yard outside the hours you were meant to go up the fire escape and ask her, please, if it was not too much trouble. Granny did not have guests and neither did Mort. When they shut the gates at night it was as if they were severing connection with The General Public until morning. It was only Howie and Cathy who were social. Their guests had to drive down the workshop laneway and park outside the entrance to the Spare Parts Department. They then honked once or twice and Howie went down to let them in. This was never any problem with musicians. But Howie was sometimes embarrassed to have their visitors first approach their apartment along a steelshelved avenue stacked with leaf springs and shock absorbers. At six oclock, on the dot, Gran Catchprice came out on to her landing. She not only looked across at him, she bowed, and gave a mocking little curtsy. You old chook, he said. He frowned and fitted a cigarette into the corner of his smile. Cathy came in from the kitchen with two cans of Reschs Pilsener. She was wearing a gingham skirt which showed off her strong, wellshaped legs, and white socks and black shoes like a school kid. She gave him one can and sat on the rickety pingpong table. It was two and a half hours before their meeting with the band but already she had that high nervous look she had in the fifteen minutes before she did a show. He loved that look. You could not say she was beautiful, but he sat night after night in bars for a hundred miles around Franklin and watched men change their opinion of her as she sang. She had a good band, but it was nothing special. She had a good voice, but there were better. It was her words, and it was her feelings. She could turn the shit of her life into jewels. She had plump arms and maybe a little too much weight under the chin and her belly pushed out against her clothes, but she was sexy. You had to say, whatever problems she had in bed, she was a sexy woman. You could watch men see it in her, but never straightaway. Big night, he said. He stood up so she could take the bar stool and he sat instead on the pingpong table. Sure, she said. She was bright and tight, could barely talk. Tonight she was going to have her meeting with the band and with the lawyer. She drank her beer. He leaned across to rub her neck, but you could not touch her neck or shoulders unless she had been drinking. Dont, hon. She took his hand and held it. Something had happened with the neck and shoulders. Sentimental Cacka had dragged her out of bed at two in the morning to sing Batti, batti from Don Giovanni to his visitors. It happened then, he guessed. She never said exactly, but he saw it exactly, in his minds eye. You could see the shadows of it. You could draw a map from them. What you think she said. About what Will I do it Youve got to decide, he said. I cant tell you what to do. Im just hurt, I guess. Im pissed off with them for talking to a lawyer. Sure, he said. I know. He patted her thigh sympathetically he was the one who had persuaded Craig and Steve Putzel that they could pull Cathy out on the road if they did what he said. He was the one who found them this socalled Entertainment Lawyer. He had manoeuvred them all to this point where they were an inch away from having the lives they wanted, all of them. He brushed some ash off his suede shoe. He buttoned his suit jacket and unbuttoned it. Big night, he said again. Through the Venetian blinds he could see Mort walking down the fire escape from his mothers apartment. This time next year, all this was going to seem like a bad dream. Cathy saw Mort too. Theyve been talking about the doctor, she said. You can bet on it. Hes been telling her it was all my idea, the coward. Howie always thought Mort was a dangerous man, but he doubted he would be dishonest in the way Cathy imagined. He watched Mort as he bent over the whitewashed sign Howie had written on the windscreen of the red Toyota truck. He scratched at it with his fingernail. He doesnt like my sign, he said. Cathy lifted the Venetian blind a fraction so it pinged. Mrs Catchprice had walked back from the gates and joined her son. She also scratched at the whitewash with one of her keys. You know he thinks Asnew is sleazy, Cathy said. You must have known theyd wipe it off. Ah, said Howie, who cares. That surprised her. She looked at him with her head on one side and then, silently, drew aside his jacket, undid a shirt button, and looked at the colour of his rash. She said You really think Im going to take the leap, dont you He wasnt counting on anything until it happened. She had been this close four years before, and once again, two years before that. Each time Granny Catchprice pulled her strings. You would not believe the tricks the old woman could pull to keep her workhorse working. If were done for tax I cant go on the road. You know that. I cant just desert them. Yes you can, he said. He did up his shirt button. This time youve got to. Yes, she said. Ive got to. She had that tightness in her bones, a flushed luminous look, as if she was about to do a show. He watched her drain her beer. You look beautiful, he said. This time Im going to do it. When you look like that I want to fuck you. He came and held her from behind and began to kiss her neck. She accepted his kisses. They lay on her skin like unresolved puzzles. Hes coming up here, she said. She meant Mort. He could see why she said it. Mort was walking across the yard this way, but he was probably on his way to hammer and yell at Bennys cellar door. Morts house shared a hot water service with their apartment, but Mort had not visited them for nine years. Hes coming here, she said. This is it. Its starting. She had such amazing skin very white and soft. Dont She broke free from his hands, suddenly irritated. Its nothing, he said. Itll be about the nursing home. Theyre going to try and make me stay. Cathy, Cathy dotted line they dont even believe youre leaving them. Shes sending him to say something to me. Honey, calm down. Think. What could they say to you at this stage Cathys eyes began to water. Shes so unfair. Howie stroked her neck. Youre fortysix years old, he said. Youre entitled to your own life. She makes him say it for her. Hes going to say how much she needs me. She put her hand on his sleeve. Hes coming up the stairs. Let me lock the door, Howie said. Mort had not visited their apartment since he argued with Howie about the pingpong table. This is the living room, he said. Theres no room for a pingpong table. With all respect, Howie had answered, thats not your business. Respect is something you wouldnt know about, Mort said. Its the Family Home. Youre turning it into a joke. Even allowing for the fact his father had just died, this was a crazy thing to say. Howie could not think of how to answer him. Respect Mort said. Then he slammed his fist into the brick wall behind Howies head. It came so close it grazed his ear. Ill lock the door, Howie said, not moving. Cathy poured some Benedictine into a tumbler. Then the door opened and she looked up and there was Mort and his lost wife, side by side. But it couldnt be Sophie. Sophie had left thirteen years ago. 13 It wasnt Sophie. It was Benny. He had made himself into the spitting image of the woman who had shot him. Whether he had meant to do it, or if it was an accident of bright white hair, the effect was most disturbing, to Cathy anyway."

        "text": "Particle Acceleration Processes in the Solar Corona D. B. Melrose School of Physics , University of Sydney, Sydney, N.S.W. 2006, Australia. Abstract Theoretical ideas on particle acceleration associated with solar flares are reviewed. A historical outline is used to introduce the various acceleration mechanisms. These are stochastic acceleration in its various forms, diffusive acceleration at shock fronts, shock drift acceleration, resonant acceleration, acceleration during magnetic reconnection and acceleration by parallel electric fields in double layers or electrostatic shocks. Particular emphasis is placed on socalled first phase acceleration of electrons in solar flares, which is conventionally attributed to bulk energisation of electrons Ramaty et al. 1980. There is no widely accepted theory for bulk energisation, which may be regarded as an enhanced form of heating. Ideas on bulk energisation are discussed critically. It is argued that the dissipation cannot be due to classical resistivity and involves anomalous resistivity or hyperresistivity, e.g., in multiple double layers. The dissipation must occur in very many localised regions. Bulk energisation due to magnetic reconnection is discussed briefly. A model for bulk energisation due to the continual formation and decay of weak double layers is outlined. Other aspects of particle acceleration associated with solar flares are reviewed more briefly. The specific topics discussed include the following 1 prompt acceleration of ions to greater thanapproximatesign30 MeV per nucleon on a time scale less thanapproximatesign1 s, implied by data on prompt gammasignray bursts, 2 second phase acceleration, emphasising radio evidence for at least six phases of electron acceleration as well as the data on solar cosmic rays, 3 the problem of creating a seed population of energetic particles, required for the favoured second phase acceleration mechanisms to operate, and 4 the preferential acceleration of ions of different species in connection with the socalled anomalous abundances in solar cosmic rays. Introduction Acceleration of energetic particles in association with solar flares was originally separated into two phases Wild, Smerd and Weiss 1963, de Jager 1969. Radio data suggest that there are many more than two phases of acceleration Smerd 1975, Melrose and Dulk 1987, and there is unambiguous evidence for nonflareassociated acceleration, most notably in storms. However, it remains helpful to concentrate on two general classes of acceleration similar to the two phases as originally proposed. One class of acceleration is bulk energisation in which, it appears, all the electrons in a substantial volume have their energies increased by a substantial fraction in a short time. The other class of acceleration consists of all those processes that involve suprathermal particles with a clearly nonthermal distribution. These include all the traditional second phase acceleration processes, such as acceleration by hydromagnetic turbulence and by shock waves. The concept of bulk energisation of electrons arose in connection with the acceleration of electrons in the impulsive phase of solar flares. A working definition of bulk energisation in the impulsive phase is that it involves an increase in the mean energy of the electrons by a factor greater thanapproximatesign10 in a time less thanapproximatesign1s. In bulk energisation, the energised electrons have a quasithermal distribution in the statistical sense that the ratio of the variance to the mean square energy is close to that for a Maxwellian distribution. The production of a nonthermal tail on the electron distribution and any associated bulk energisation of the ions are important questions that should be addressed in association with any detailed discussion of bulk energisation of electrons. The hard Xray data e.g. Dennis 1985 are interpreted in terms of precipitating electrons emitting bremsstrahlung, and the data then require that greater thanapproximatesign20 keV electrons precipitate at a rate up to about 1036s1 Hoyng, Brown and van Beek 1976. The energy involved in these electrons is a substantial fraction of the energy released in a flare. The most widely favoured interpretation is that the energy released goes primarily into such electrons for most flares, with a substantial energy going into mass motions and into a blast wave only for large flares. The rate equals approximatelysign1036s1 of precipitation and the total number of precipitating electrons required up to equals approximatelysign1039 are so large that they lead to severe constraints on the model. These and associated constraints have led some authors to explore the alternative hypothesis that the hard Xrays are due to precipitating ions Colgate 1978, Simnett 1986. Current opinion favours a dominant role for the electrons. It is relevant to note that many type III events observed in the interplanetary medium are associated with storms and not with flares e.g., Suzuki and Dulk 1985, Kai, Melrose and Suzuki 1985 moreover, many such events are dominated by electrons of quite low energy 210 keV that could not possibly come from a flare site due to the prohibitive collisional losses in propagating through the lower corona e.g., Lin 1985. It follows that bulk energisation is not restricted to flares, and that it also occurs in storms where it is required to account for the electrons in storm type III bursts, and also presumably for the electrons that produce type I bursts. There is no consensus on the detailed mechanisms involved in bulk energisation. There is a wide variety of acceleration mechanisms for suprathermal particles. These include stochastic acceleration of various kinds, including acceleration in neutral sheets, and acceleration by shock waves. Stochastic acceleration is often called Fermi acceleration, but this can be ambiguous because Fermi acceleration is used with two different meanings, one being the specific mechanism proposed originally by Fermi, cf. section2, and the other being the generic sense in which it is effectively synonymous with stochastic acceleration. A characteristic feature of most stochastic acceleration mechanisms is that there is a threshold energy below which any specific mechanism is ineffective or inoperative. Thus such acceleration is effective only when a seed population of energetic particles already exists. Put in other words, an injection spectrum of suprathermal particles is required. The acceleration increases the energy of the already suprathermal particles but does not increase s the number of suprathermal particles. The production of suprathermal particles, that is, the formation of a nonthermal tail on a thermal distribution of particles, is regarded as a separate but essential problem. The main emphasis in this review is on acceleration associated with solar flares. There is an extensive literature on this topic some more recent reviews include those by Ramaty et al. 1980, Heyvaerts 1981, Forman, Ramaty and Zweibel 1985, de Jager 1986, Somov 1986a, Vlahos et al. 1986, Ramaty and Forman 1987 and Sakai and Ohsawa 1987. Related reviews are those of acceleration in the interplanetary medium, e.g., Fish 1979, Pesses, Decker and Armstrong 1982, Forman and Webb 1985, and also some more general reviews of acceleration with some emphasis on solar applications, e.g., Toptygin 1980, Axford 1981, Toptyghin 1983. In section2 acceleration mechanisms are introduced in a primarily historical context and then classified. Some existing and new ideas on bulk energisation of electrons are discussed in section3, and the associated in the impulsive phase prompt acceleration of ions is discussed in sectionSome general remarks on second phase acceleration mechanisms are presented in section5 and the important associated question of the production of suprathermal particles, needed as the seed population, is discussed in connection with socalled anomalous abundances in section Historical Review It is convenient to separate acceleration mechanisms into five general types stochastic, shock, resonant, reconnection and parallel electric. The ideas behind each of these are introduced here from a historical viewpoint. Stochastic Acceleration The development of current ideas on the acceleration of particles is generally regarded as starting with the suggestion by Fermi 1949, 1954 that galactic cosmic rays are accelerated by bouncing off magnetised clouds. The specific mechanism proposed by Fermi is ineffective in practice, but the proposed mechanism contains ideas that are relevant to all versions of stochastic acceleration. One can identify three important ingredients in Fermis mechanism. One is that a particle gains energy in a headon collision with a cloud and loses energy in an overtaking collision. The second idea is that if the cosmic rays are moving at random then they have a higher probability of having a headon rather than an overtaking collision. The first order changes in the energy in headon and in overtaking collisions cancel in a statistical treatment, but the second order effects do not and the difference leads to a net average acceleration over a time long compared with the collision time. The third ingredient is more subtle because it is implicit the assumption that the distribution of particles remains isotropic requires a specific mechanism that isotropises the particles. The reason is that the collisions tend to align the particle velocities along the magnetic field lines, and this alignment severely limits the acceleration. Fermitype acceleration also occurs in the socalled betatron effect magnetic pumping in the plasma physics literature in a magnetic trap when there are temporal variations in the strength B of the magnetic field, in which case conservation of the magnetic moment implies that the energy of the particle is proportional to B Swann 1933, Schlumlautter 1957, Berger et al. 1958. A related process is transit acceleration e.g., Shen 1965 when particles diffuse through an inhomogeneous B. The important features of all such mechanisms is that they involve statistical energy gains and that they require a mechanism that tends to maintain the assumed isotropy of the particles. These ideas are applicable to acceleration by MHD turbulence. Qualitatively, the efficiency of the acceleration is higher when the energy changes are both frequent and small than when they are both infrequent and relatively large, as in Fermis mechanism. In earlier treatments of this effect Thompson 1955, Kaplan 1956, Davis 1956, Parker 1957, Parker and Tidman 1958, the need to maintain isotropy was implicit. Various mechanisms to maintain isotropy were included in later statistical treatments e.g., Asseacuteo and Barthomieu 1966, Sturrock 1966, Hall and Sturrock 1967, with the main emphasis being on resonant scattering e.g., Hasselmann and Wibberenz 1968, Melrose 1968a, Kulsrud and Ferrari 1971. The importance of resonant scattering was first recognised in connection with particles trapped in the earths radiation belts the scattering of ions involves Alfveacute n waves Wentzel 1961, Dragt 1961 and the scattering of electrons involves whistlers Dungey 1963, Cornwall 1964, cf. also Kennel and Petschek 1966. These waves can be generated by the particles themselves due to their induced anisotropy Melrose 1974. In this mechanism, the low frequency MHD turbulence provides the energy and the high frequency waves maintain the isotropy. The nature of stochastic acceleration was further clarified by Achterberg 1981 who pointed out that the interaction with the low frequency turbulence may be interpreted in terms of a resonance at harmonic number s 0, whereas the scattering by the high frequency waves is due predominantly to resonances harmonic numbers s plusminussignAn important implication of Achterbergs approach is that Fermitype acceleration is due entirely to magnetoacoustic turbulence. The point is that MHD turbulence in general consists of a mixture of two modes, both of which propagate at approximately the Alfveacuten speed greek letters in a strongly magnetised plasma. There is a third mode, the slow mode, which is not relevant to the discussion here. The magnetoacoustic or fast mode is compressive and propagates almost isotropically, and the Alfveacuten mode is tortional and has an energy flow only parallel to the field lines. One class of model for acceleration by MHD turbulence involves a magnetic cascade, e.g., Bicknell and Melrose 1982, van Ballagooijen 1986. In a magnetic cascade there is a source of MHD turbulence with a large characteristic scale length. The resulting longwavelength turbulence breaks up into shorter wavelength turbulence, with a dissipationfree flow of energy in kspace from the source at small pipekpipe long wavelengths through the socalled inertial regime to a sink at large pipekpipe short wavelengths. Each breakup should produce a roughly equal mixture of the two modes irrespective of the initial mode of the MHD turbulence. However, only the magnetoacoustic component damps due to Fermitype acceleration of fast particles. Alfveacuten turbulence is ineffective in accelerating particles through a Fermitype process because the matrix element for resonance at s 0 is very small for Alfveacuten waves in comparison to that for magnetoacoustic waves at the same wavelength."

        "text": "Preface This is a book about attitudes. Reinventing Australia is not intended to be a comprehensive assessment of Australian society nor a series of brave predictions about how the Australian way of life will change. It is simply an account of how Australians attitudes are changing under the influence of the events of the past 20 years a period of relentless social, cultural, economic, political and technological change. The analysis is based on a longterm social research program, The Mackay Report, which has been continuously probing Australians attitudes, values, motivations, fears, hopes and dreams since In that time, over 60 individual reports have been published and many of them are quoted in the pages of this book. A complete list of the reports appears in the Appendix, together with a description of the research methods used in the program. I know that many Australians will recognise themselves in these pages. Thousands of people have participated in the group discussions and individual interviews on which the research is based, and I am grateful to all of them for the time they have so generously given to the program. Their willing participation makes this kind of social research possible their frankness and openness gives it its integrity. 1 New Women Old Men There is no doubt about which of the redefinitions of the past 20 years has had most impact on the Australian way of life it isthe redefinition of gender roles which has taken place in the minds of roughly half the population the female half. It is sobering to remind ourselves that we only have to go back as far as the mid1970s to realise that a revolution of breathtaking speed has taken place in Australian womens view of themselves and, by implication, in their view of men. Just 20 years ago, it was safe to say that Australian women were secondclass citizens the legal system said it, the financial services market said it, and the cultural context certainly said it. For most of the twentieth century, Australian women were conditioned to accept that they were living in a society dominated and controlled by men and that, in most cases, they would acquire a kind of secondhand identity from the men they would marry. They may have resented it they may have been deeply frustrated by it but they generally accepted that this was their lot. Today, that kind of proposition sounds absurd. Today, anyone who seriously suggested that women should settle for secondclass status or for a secondhand identity would be run out of town. Of course, there are still plenty of women who will cheerfully settle for a secondhand identity, but mainstream attitudes have radically changed in the past 20 years. When the latest wave of feminism hit Australia in the early to mid1970s, Australian women experienced what felt like an astonishing awakening they discovered that a woman was a person. Thats all. That was the heart of the entire revolution I am a person, entitled to the same sense of identity and the same status in our society as any other person. Not a very radical proposition, on reflection, but it was one which has led to some of the most revolutionary changes in the Australian way of life this century. Once women begin to redefine the role and status of women in our society, this changes everything it changes their view of the role and status of men, of romance, of sex, of marriage, of parenting, of family life, of work, of household management, of politics dotted line hardly an aspect of the Australian way of life has remained untouched by the revolutionary change in the way Australian women have come to see themselves over the past 20 years. The key group of women the women who formed the pioneering generation were those aged roughly between 18 and 35 years when the Womens Lib movement found its voice in Australian society in the mid1970s. Those were the women who immediately sensed that the role models of their mothers and grandmothers were going to be either inappropriate or unacceptable. Those were the women whose latent resentment of secondclass status was activated by the rallying cry of the feminists Germaine Greer in particular. Those were the women who saw a wonderful prospect of liberation before them the prospect of leading more fulfilling lives, and of being more active and complete participants in adult society. Of course, other women held back from the revolution and found themselves rather frightened by the strident messages of the radical feminists. They feared for the safety of traditional values associated with mothering and with family life they wondered why so many women were rushing headlong into a redefinition of gender roles when they themselves were finding such intense satisfaction in traditional wifeandmother roles they wondered what would become of the children of a generation of women who seemed so determined to combine family life with paid employment, and who seemed so anxious to blur the traditional distinctions between men and women. But such dissenting voices were largely drowned out in the enthusiasm for redefining gender roles which so captivated an entire generation of Australian women in the late Seventies and throughout the Eighties. Very quickly, it became obvious that the new values inspired by feminism would have to be expressed in some symbolic way. This is the nature of revolutionary change, after all. Most changes in attitudes and values are the result of changed circumstances but, when a revolution is taking place, attitudes often change first because of an underlying sense of dissatisfaction which has not previously found an outlet, and new patterns of behaviour subsequently emerge. The symbolic behaviour which women chose as an expression of their newfound definition of gender was work fulltime or parttime paid employment outside the home became a central aspiration for this pioneering generation of women. Whereas their mothers and grandmothers had assumed that a career or even a job would be abandoned in favour of the role of wife and mother, the pioneers of the Seventies and Eighties saw work outside the home as the most potent symbol of their liberation. This has always seemed rather strange to men, who might have seen retirement from work as a more appropriate symbol of liberation. But for women who, by cultural convention and social pressure, had been virtually forced out of the workforce when they became mothers, the chance to combine motherhood with a place in the paid workforce was a heady prospect indeed. As a symbol, it had everything it represented a passport to a new, more tangible sense of identity it created the possibility of at least partial financial independence it relieved women from the humiliation of having to describe themselves as being just a housewife. Of course, the enthusiasm to stay in the workforce or to rejoin the workforce after the birth of children had more than symbolic attraction. At a time when Australia was entering one of its most explicit phases of materialism a period in which the Me Generations obsession with selfindulgence was coming into full flower the prospect of being able to earn money while still having a family had economic as well as emotional attractions. And so, in the period from the midSeventies to the early Nineties, Australian labour market statistics were rewritten. In 1970, 32 per cent of married women were in the workforce by 1990, that figure had risen to 53 per cent of all married women and 60 per cent of all mothers with dependent children. But women who had embraced the new values of Womens Lib had not abandoned the traditional homeandfamily, wifeandmother values which they had inherited from their mothers and grandmothers. So although they were busily constructing a new framework for their lives, they were continuing to operate within an existing framework as well. Needless to say, this created enormous complications and difficulties for the women involved. In many ways, it was easier for the radicals than for the moderates. The radicals were more easily able to replace one set of values with another. But for the moderates who represented the vast majority of the generation of women caught up in this redefinition, a very troubled future lay ahead. For these women, the challenge was not simply to live out the new values rather, the challenge was to find a way of incorporating the new values into an existing set of values. The solution which most of them settled for was to lead a double life to express traditional homeandfamily values at home, and to express feministliberationist values at work. For many women, this created the emotional hazard of having to leap a kind of symbolic barrier on the way to work each morning, and then to leap back over it on the way home at night. Many women have suffered from a high degree of personal stress as a direct result of having to make this daily adjustment. They have not yet found a way to reconcile the two sets of values which so often seem to be in conflict, and so they have compartmentalised their lives and paid a very high emotional price for doing so. But the idea of fulltime or even parttime work outside the home as a symbol of the New Woman was so seductive that the difficulties it created for mothers were accepted as part of the price to be paid for being a revolutionary. Even those women who felt themselves to be most ground down or misunderstood as a result of trying to combine the two roles felt that to retreat from the workforce would be to admit defeat and to run the risk of being seen as a traitor to the revolution. Those mothers who elected to stay home and look after their families on a fulltime basis reported during the 1980s that the strongest sense of disapproval which they felt came not from husbands who might have appreciated the extra income or the extra stimulation associated with a working wife, but from other women. It became a common complaint among stayathome mothers of the 1980s that they were often treated by working women as if they were somehow letting down the revolution. The social and cultural pressure on married women to use work outside the home as a means of acquiring a clearer and more independent sense of identity was almost irresistible. And so was born one of the most significant sociolcultural changes of the last 50 years the emergence of the working mother as a mainstream phenomenon. Between 1945 and 1975, mothers who worked were generally regarded as being the victims of economic necessity or, in rare cases, being such stars in their fields particularly professional and artistic fields that it was understood that they would place work ahead of the normal familyrelated goals of the majority of Australian women. Since 1975, however, the working mother has become the norm when almost twothirds of women with dependent children work outside the home, those women who choose not to work find themselves having to explain their decision to stay at home. The Working Mother To understand the real impact of the redefinition of womens role in Australian society at the end of the twentieth century, therefore, we have to devote our primary attention to the phenomenon of the working mother. What is it like to be a woman who has decided to combine a job which her mother thought was a fulltime job with another job outside the home The Problem of Fatigue First, they report having to deal with the problem of daily exhaustion. They see their lives as being a constant battle against fatigue. They go to work and get tired and then they come home only to face what is now often described as the second shift. In other words, they do a days work at work and then brace themselves to tackle a second days work at home including such major tasks as cooking, cleaning, washing, ironing, supervising homework, plus the myriad planning and management tasks which are involved in continuous housekeeping and parenting."

        "text": "Tax office looks at ways to reduce blowout in claims By TIM DODD The Australian Taxation Office is considering a range of measures to reduce the 2 billion blowout in personal tax deductions which is threatening to take back the savings in running costs made from the introduction of selfassessment. But no particular course of action has been decided upon according to a tax office spokesman. The 2 billion increase in deductions, revealed by The Australian Financial Review on Friday, costs the Commonwealth 700800 million a year in lost revenue. The spokesman said that the tax offices latest figures showed the huge increase in deductions had tailed off in the 198990 income year. But the 198990 figures are still provisional because not all personal tax for the year has been collected. The tax office points out that some of the increase in deductions is due to a growth in the number of taxpayers many from the lodgement amnesty, the effects of inflation, and more awareness in the community about employment related tax deductions. But tax officials do perceive the increase as a threat to revenue and are looking at what can be done. There are a number of alternatives. One would be to step up the number of audits andor apply the substantiation rules more strictly. These rules require taxpayers to have documentary evidence to support deductions claimed and are very specific as to the type of evidence required. If they were applied strictly in every case then a great many taxpayers would find they had not kept the correct receipts etc. to support the genuine deductions they had claimed. However, the Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Trevor Boucher, has taken a commonsense approach to substantiation, usually allowing deductions, even without the correct evidence, if it was clear that the taxpayer had incurred the expense. Last month Federal Parliament passed legislation which specifically wrote this discretionary power of the commissioners into the law. This means that a taxpayer can now appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should he or she disagree with the commissioners decision on whether to allow a particular deduction. Another way would be to approach the Government for new legislation limiting the types of deduction allowed or the amount which could be claimed. The option to disallow the first 500 of l,000 claimed outlined by the tax office in documents obtained by The Australian Financial Review falls into this category. But this particular scheme is political dynamite for any government unless it is part of a package of measures which offers compensation to taxpayers. One practical possibility would be for the Government to deal with the increase in deductions as a part of its income tax simplification programme. The programme, most of which is still under wraps, has looked at ways to simplify deductions as a part of the wider scheme. It is not clear how far the simplification of the deduction system will go, but many tax officials would prefer that deductions which are difficult to administer and offer avenues for tax avoidance be largely abolished and replaced by a system which deducted all personal income tax at source. Under such a scheme the Government would compensate for the revenue gain by making tax cuts, but it seems unlikely that the Government would agree to simplification on such a sweeping scale. Govt ends livesheep trade to Saudi Arabia until new agreement By CATHY BOLT The Federal Government has effectively shut down the troubled livesheep trade to Saudi Arabia. In a demonstration of increasing frustration over the Saudis continued rejection of Australian sheep, the Federal Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, yesterday told the Saudi ambassador in Canberra, Mr A. Rahman Alohaly, that the trade was being conducted in an unacceptable manner. In a statement issued after the meeting, Mr Kerin made clear that exports to Saudi Arabia, formerly worth 120 million, would cease until a health and quarantine protocol was negotiated between the two governments. The point has now been reached where, as I informed the ambassador, I do not see how the livesheep trade from Australian can be allowed to continue in the absence of a quarantine and veterinary agreement, he said. I cannot simply sit back and watch the commercial interests involved continue to go their own way, regardless of the consequence both in terms of animal welfare and our relations with other governments that inevitably have to become involved. While power to regulate the trade rests with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation, it is unlikely the statutory authority would issue approval for another livesheep carrier to leave for Saudi Arabia in light of the ministers statement. Mr Kerin said his meeting with Mr Alohaly was prompted by the Saudis decision last month to spurn two more cargoes from Australia and New Zealand 80,000 head aboard the Mawashi Al Gasseem and 66,500 head on the Mawashi Al Tabuk which left New Zealand in November. They were the latest in a series of rejections which began in mid The New Zealand sheep were finally unloaded in Jordan this week while the Mawashi Al Gasseems cargo is still being held in quarantine in the United Arab Emirates. They face an uncertain fate given the UAEs commitment not to take sheep rejected by the Saudis on grounds of disease. The New Zealand Agriculture Minister, Mr John Falloon, suspended livesheep exports from that country on Monday, also pending the establishment of a health protocol governing the trade. Mr Kerin said he had asked the Saudi ambassador to pass on to the Saudi Government and the Saudi Minister for Agriculture and Water, Mr Al Shaikh, the Australian Governments concern over the inability to come to sensible arrangements that would ensure the continuance of the livesheep trade on a secure longterm basis. Without wishing to detract in any way from the sovereign rights of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in quarantine matters, these difficulties and uncertainties can only be resolved by governments. ASX to grant greater leeway on buybacks By BARRIE DUNSTAN The Australian Stock Exchange has produced a final draft that gives listed companies greater scope to buy back their shares on the open market. The new share buyback rules were the main part of a series of amendments to ASX listing rules released yesterday and now await formal approval by the Australian Securities Commission. The new share buyback rules are not expected to be operative until the part of the Corporations Act that allows onmarket buybacks is proclaimed. The ASX estimates this is unlikely to be before February. Under the new rules, listed companies have to establish a buyback scheme by lodging a notice with the exchange and advertising in a national newspaper. The notices need to give the maximum number of shares allowed to be repurchased, the reasons for the operation, whether directors and their associates reserve the right to sell shares onmarket to the company and which directorsassociates and any new information appropriate or relevant to shareholders. Once established, the buyback scheme can run for six months and can be reactivated to giver companies a virtual permanent right to buy on the market. This is a change from the second draft of the proposed rules, which the ASX now admits were inflexible and unnecessarily restrictive. The earlier draft limited companies to a shorter period and locked them into a fixed price for the buyback. Now, companies have the right to creep the buyback price upwards by a maximum of 5 per cent above the average of the last sale price on the last five days where a sale occurred. There are also provisions preventing directors or associates from selling into the onmarket offer if they did not reserve the right to do so in the original scheme notice. The rules also prevent a company from establishing a buyback on the market if the company or any of its directors are aware of an actual or proposed takeover offer or announcement for any of the securities of the company. The new rules also contain strict requirements to disclose where directors or associates have sold to the company in an onmarket buyback sales by directors must be notified to the exchange before the start of business the day after the dealing. The ASX says in its supplement containing the rules that it concluded after submissions on the second draft that it should establish a straightforward, simpletofollow mechanism to allow companies to repurchase their shares at advantageous prices. It has agreed with arguments that it should rely on protections given to shareholders by legislation and common law to deter abuse of the buyback mechanism by directors and their associates who wish to use the market. The rules dispense with some of the notice requirements under the second draft which the ASX says would have imposed substantial costs on companies with a large number of shareholders. The real shape of Austs war effort CANBERRA OBSERVED BY GEOFF KITNEY Australia is making a vastly larger contribution to the Gulf war than a handful of navy ships and medical teams and would have a crucial role to play in what the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, promises will be a new international order emerging from the conflict. There has been little public discussion and only oblique government acknowledgement of the connection but the fact is that the US joint facilities in Australia are playing a key role in providing early warning of Iraqi missile attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia and intelligence on Iraqi defences, troop movements and military tactics. The Nurrungar satellite ground station in outback South Australia is the link to the US Patriot missile batteries in the Gulf which have had such success bringing down Iraqi Scud missiles. Nurrungar picks up through infrared satellite sensors the rocket plumes at the point of firing thus giving early warning of the attacks. One senior government figure yesterday suggested that even if Australia sent every aircraft, ship, tank and serviceman to join the allied force in the Gulf it would be less of a contribution to the war effort than the role being played by the joint facilities. It is understood that in discussions with other countries involved in the multinational force in the Gulf, Australia has referred to the role of the joint facilities as its major contribution to the allied efforts to eject Iraqi forces from Kuwait. And the possibility has now been raised that the joint facilities will be given a significant new role in providing vital information which would be necessary for the successful establishment of a new international order policed by the United Nations. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, in an interview with The Australian Financial Review yesterday, indicated that the joint facilities could be as important to multilateral arms control planning and enforcement in the postCold War period as they had been in policing bilateral agreements between the US and the Soviet Union. If you are moving into a new arms control and verification regime, as part of a new world order in which there is a more rational approach to the resolving international conflicts, the joint facilities have a very definite role in that, he said. The essence of the new world order which the US president, Mr Bush, and Mr Hawke had talked of as being what was at stake in the Gulf war would be a new international structure in which conflict would be resolved through the cooperation of the great powers under the umbrella of the United Nations. There would be three essential elements to this an effective conciliation and peacemaking process built around the SecretaryGeneral of the United Nations a strong peacekeeping force structure and a process of arms control and disarmament policed by the United Nations. If multilateral arms control agreements such as the chemical weapon regime which Australia has been playing a key role in seeking replaced bilateral agreements between the superpowers as the major form of international policing of the behaviour of countries, verification would be crucial."

        "text": "Locomotion in Macropodoid Marsupials Gaits, Energetics and Heat Balance R. V. Baudinette School of Biological Sciences, Flinders University, Box 2100, GPO Adelaide, SA 5001, Australia. Abstract This review examines gaits used by marsupials and their coupling with respiratory and cardiac cycles. It also examines the energy requirements and heat balance in exercising marsupials. Marsupials have massspecific metabolic rates that lie at the lower end of the mammalian range but this is not reflected in locomotory energetics as quadrupedal marsupials fit the predictive model derived from placentals. The group that does not conform to the model contains the larger hopping macropods in which an independence between metabolic rate and hopping speed is achieved on treadmills at most speeds by the storage of elastic strain energy in tendons. This yields a saving of up to 50 of the energy that would be otherwise used for locomotion. The carriage of pouch young appears to reduce the maximum running speed in quadrupedal marsupials but may be costneutral in hopping species. Respiration is entrained to the step cycle in wallabies by means of a visceral piston, but no entrainment of the cardiac cycle has been observed. The consequences of these phenomena are discussed. Marsupials appear to exploit their low body temperatures as a means of storing heat generated during running. Paradoxically, this does not lessen their dependence on evaporative heat loss. Introduction Its two hind legsdotted line are upwards of half an ell in length, and it walks on these only, on the flat of the heavy part of the leg, so that it does not run fast. This account of the tammar wallaby by the Dutch navigator, Pelsaert, in 1629, is probably the first of a macropodoid marsupial, and although he wrote that the animal was a species of cat, he was clearly impressed by its bipedalism. So too was William Dampier, 70 years later, who described what was probably a banded hare wallaby as dotted linea sort of Raccoon, different from those of the West Indies, chiefly as to their legs to these have very short forelegs but go jumping upon them as the others do. Cook, like the Dutch before him, was also impressed by this spectacular form of locomotion and writes of hops spanning seven or eight feet. Apart from its mechanical simplicity, hopping has other significant features. On a massspecific basis it is energetically the cheapest form of locomotion, due in large part to the storage and subsequent recovery of elastic strain energy in tendon and muscle. However, this dependence on stored energy is only apparent in larger hopping species in smaller species such as bettongs, members of the genus Notomys and North American kangaroo rats, bipedalism provides no apparent energy saving see review by Baudinette 1991. A second correlate of bipedalism considered below is the synchronisation of breathing and stride frequencies, a phenomenon seen in other mammals Bramble and Carrier 1983, but most clearly analysed in hopping forms Baudinette et al. 1987 Alexander 1989. In this review gait, energetics and locomotoryrespiratory coupling are dealt with in varying degrees of depth. This is partly to avoid overlap with other recent reviews on energysaving mechanisms Alexander 1991 Baudinette 1991. It is also necessitated by the paucity of information bearing on some aspects of these topics. This review focuses on kangaroos and wallabies superfamily Macropodoidea, a group of particular interest since they are the only large animals to have adopted hopping as their primary form of locomotion. Quadrupedal Gaits in Mammals The gait of an animal, or its pattern of movement, reflects the pattern of acceleration and deceleration of its limbs, and the work done on the centre of mass. It seems reasonable to expect, although it has only been confirmed in humans Margaria 1976 and horses Hoyt and Taylor 1981, that the gait adopted by an animal will minimise the metabolic cost of work done by the muscles at a given running speed. In 1899 Eadweard Muybridge published his classical treatment of gait analysis, Animals in Motion. This monumental work of more than 100 000 photographic plates was prompted by a controversy over whether a moving horse could ever have all feet simultaneously off the ground. The author resolved that dotted line the question settled once and for all time in favour of those who argued for a period of unsupported transit dotted line, then set about to describe the movements of other species of animals, and in the prelude to his detailed analysis described eight gaits the walk, amble, trot, rack, canter, transverse gallop, rotary gallop, and, for the kangaroo, the ricochet. Hildebrand 1976 and Dagg 1973 have subsequently added to his classification to produce a more complete description. Such gaits can be divided into walking and running gaits, depending on the percentage of the locomotor cycle for which the foot is in contact with the ground. Alternatively, they may be divided into symmetrical gaits, in which the footfalls of a given pair of feet are evenly spaced in time, and asymmetrical gaits in which such footfalls are unevenly spaced. A balanced simplification of the 38 symmetrical gaits proposed by Hildebrand 1976 can be achieved with 4 symmetrical walking gaits walking pace, lateral sequence walk, walking trot, diagonal sequence walk and 4 running symmetrical gaits pace, lateral sequence run, trot and diagonal sequence run. Most workers recognise 10 asymmetrical gaits for walking, the slow rotary gallop, slow transverse gallop, slow halfbound and bound and crutch walk and for running, the rotary gallop, transverse gallop, halfbound, bound, and stott or pronk. To these 18 gaits can be added three bipedal gaits the walk, the run and the hop. In so far as it seems reasonable to recognise the 21 basic gaits mentioned above, it is clear that only a very cursory consideration can be given to marsupial gaits because they have not been rigorously studied in many species. All quadrupedal marsupials seem to use some type of walk when moving slowly. The particular member of this class of gaits they use may differ with speed and between species. White 1990 showed that Trichosurus vulpecula can use a walking trot or a diagonal sequence but that Dasyurus hallucatus has a lateral sequence walk and walking trot. Didelphis virginiana has three gaits a lateral sequence walk, walking trot and diagonal sequence walk. Most quadrupedal marsupials use an asymmetrical gait, the bound, or a variant, the half bound, when moving at higher speeds. In the bound the hind and fore limbs act as synchronous pairs punctuated by a period of suspension. Some of the symmetry is lost in the half bound in which the front legs strike the ground one after the other. In describing gaits in Sminthopsis crassicaudata, Ewer 1968 termed fast locomotion a bounding gallop, but from filmed records K. Nagle personal communication reports that the gait of this animal fits Daggs 1973 description of the bound. Similar confusion can arise from Marlows 1969 comment that earlier work by Ride 1965 had showed that Antechinomys spenceri, despite its elongate hind limbs, moves quadrupedally in a series of leaps which are the result of a galloping action. However, Marlows own data suggest a half bound. Other dasyurids for which information is available from filmed treadmill records are Dasyuroides byrnei and Dasyurus viverriunus. Both use a half bound at high speed Baudinette, unpublished data. Observations on two species of bandicoot, Isoodon macrourus and Macrotis lagotis, the wombats Lasiorhinus latifrons and Vombatus ursinus R.T. Wells, personal communication, and the brushtail possum, Trichosurus vulpecula Goldfinch and Molner 1978, suggest that only two modes are used, a slow walk and a half bound at higher speeds. White 1990 reported a galloping stride in T. vulpecula and D. hallucatus but this gait was used only for a short duration and could have been an artefact of treadmill speed selection. Some macropods also employ a bound or half bound. In treadmill studies, Baudinette 1977 found that the quokka, Setonix brachyurus, usually moves in this way, although at speeds above 5 km h1 this gait was occasionally punctuated by six or seven hops. The two species of tree kangaroos Dendrolagus goodfellowi and D. matschiei use a slow alternating walk but at higher speeds move with a bound, Windsor and Dagg 1971 having observed this form of locomotion even on vertical surfaces. In summary, it is clear that quadrupedal marsupials show a diversity of quadrupedal gaits. However, it is one of the areas of marsupial biology for which there is a paucity of data, especially for nonmacropodoid marsupials. Among the data that are available are observations both from overground locomotion and treadmill locomotion, the latter primarily in studies from Baudinettes laboratory. The extent to which differences in these experimental approaches modify the performance of animals is not known. It is a factor that will have to be taken into account if some of the more complex gait classifications are adopted for quadrupedal marsupials. Why do small marsupial quadrupeds, like small eutherians, bound rather than gallop Heglund et al. 1982 have suggested that elastic storage of energy in muscle and tendon is considerable in the gallop of a large animal, since both front and hind limbs alternately accelerate and decelerate the body. Small bounding mammals use the fore limbs as a rigid support between periods of acceleration by the hind limbs, and the potential for such storage and recovery of energy is not as obvious. However, energy storage in animals and in simple machines generally occurs in springs, and the vertebral column may serve this role in smaller animals. The pronounced spinal flexion that occurs during a bound might be associated with the recovery of stored elastic energy. Alexander et al. 1985 showed in dogs and deer that much of the kinetic energy lost by the legs at the extent of the backward swing may be stored as elastic strain energy in the aponeurosis of the principal exterior of the back, the longissinus muscle. Furthermore, it has been suggested that an increase in the time of foot contact with the ground, resulting from bending and extension of the back, may enable the animal to use slower, and therefore more economical, muscle fibres see Kram and Taylor 1990. In the absence of further physical analysis of locomotion in small quadrupeds it is difficult to carry the question further. However, the available data suggest that small marsupials and eutherians have not diverged in their highspeed asymmetric gaits, suggesting that, for animals of this body size, the bound and half bound represent minimal energy costs. Bipedal Motion in Kangaroos Kangaroos and wallabies are the only large vertebrates that move in a hopping gait. Even the fossil record suggests that, apart from macropods, animals using a saltatory form of locomotion seldom exceeded 3 kg in body mass. To early European explorers, perhaps only vaguely aware of the bipedal rodents of North Africa, a 70kg kangaroo must have presented a bizarre sight. Muybridge, in his Animals in Motion 1957, photographed what appears to be a hopping grey kangaroo, and recognised this mode of progression as the most simple of all methods of terrestrial locomotion. Howell 1944 appeared somewhat sceptical that the apparently extreme specialisation in kangaroos would result in efficient locomotion. The Mechanics of Hopping Stride Length and Frequency The speed at which an animal moves is the product of two variables, the length and the frequency of its stride. Stride frequency tends to remain nearly constant as speed increases in galloping animals Heglund et al. 1974 and a similar trend occurs in larger hopping marsupials Fig. 1. Increases in hopping speed in the red kangaroo, and to a lesser extent in the tammar wallaby, are therefore primarily determined by stride length, whereas an increase in stride frequency is important in slower movement. Over the range of hopping speeds used in treadmill studies on the red kangaroo the frequency of hops range of hopping speeds used in treadmill studies on the red kangaroo the frequency of hops ranged from about 130 to 150 per min, or from 1 to 5 Hz Dawson and Taylor 1973. It is interesting that these stride frequencies approximate those preferred by human subjects of similar body mass Farley et al. 1991, supporting the view that frequency is bodymass dependent and that fundamental properties of the muscletendon system set the frequency."

        "text": "Secret world of the Wombat Far from being muddleheaded, as the childrens stories suggest, the energetic burrower has a betterdeveloped brain than any other marsupial. And its lumbering, bearlike exterior masks a remarkably agile frame. Text and photography by Mitch Reardon The cool autumn sun dipped below the rim of the Rams Head Range in Kosciusko National Park. In the golden aftermath, the mountains thickly wooded slopes and the bluegrey clouds were perfectly mirrored in the Thredbo Rivers glassy surface. Sheryn Woon, my guide, squeezed my arm gently, directing my attention from that visual feast to a sudden movement near the base of a spreading manna gum. Wombat, she whispered, gesturing towards a strangelooking, shuffling creature that had appeared at the entrance of a large hole beneath one of the eucalypts horizontally growing roots. I watched as it paused, one paw diffidently raised, its broad, blunt head drooping as if the animal were still asleep. Only its widely dilating nostrils indicated that it was carefully testing the evening air before venturing beyond the safety of its burrow. Reassured, it wandered into the darkening forest a rotund comical figure with inwardpointing hind toes, its broad bottom swaying from side to side on its regular nightly food run. It would pass the night in solitary contentment searching for a variety of native grasses and sedges. My patience had finally been rewarded. Although telltale signs of wombat occupancy were everywhere from an extensive system of burrows and wellused paths to droppings posted on tree stumps and in other prominent places the animals themselves were frustratingly elusive. In two bonechilling nights that crackled with frost, the only indication of wombats Sheryn and I detected at Thredbo Diggings picnic area was a quick scuttling sound in the undergrowth as one fled at our approach. It was not until our third evening that we finally had our brief encounter. It was, like the common wombat itself, without fuss or ceremony. I felt exhilarated by the perfection of our meeting as I retreated to the welcome warmth of Sheryns fourwheeldrive for a reviving cup of coffee. photo caption photo caption caption photo caption Noone knows better than Barbara Triggs that wombats are among the most difficult animals to study in the wild. Her quest to unlock the intricacies of their biology began in 1976, when she was faced with the problem of raising a young orphaned wombat at her home in Croajingolong National Park in northeast Victoria. She had successfully raised orphaned kangaroos and possums, but knew almost nothing about wombats when her husband, Allan, brought home Bruno, an almost furless youngster whose mother had been killed on the road. As we relaxed on the verandah of her homestead, Barbara told me that natural history books were no help as very little research had been done on wombats then. She knew she would have to learn from the animals themselves if she was going to raise Bruno successfully and return him to the wild. Her face lit up as she recalled spending all hours of the night, in all kinds of weather, picking her way through thickets after her elusive quarry. Some of her research was done near her home, but much was carried out in the east Gippsland mountain forests, a threehour drive away, where she used a caravan as a hide to observe wombats. photo caption photo photo caption caption photo A wombats life revolves around its burrow, and as it seldom leaves its subterranean refuge before dusk, my research would begin each evening at a burrow entrance, waiting for a wombat to emerge, Barbara explained. Her task became more difficult when she realised that a wombat uses up to 11 different burrows and that burrows may be used by several wombats, usually at different times. Lacking the resources and expertise to fit radio collars to make tracking easier, she devised her own system of keeping tabs on them. She placed twigs across burrow entrances and, if they were dislodged, knew a wombat was in residence. She also fastened sticky tape to the mouths of burrows to snag hairs from a passing wombat to help identify it. A few hairs may not seem much to go on, but coat colours vary so widely from glossy black to grey, brown, sandy and cream that they can be as good as a signature, she told me. Barbaras studies have made her an authority on wombat behaviour, and the author of two books on them. They have also helped her raise a string of orphans since Bruno, who to her delight still visits her. Id estimate he was nearly six months old when he came to me. He spent three months in a cloth bag slung around my neck 24 hours a day, then I started taking him out into the bush. He always stayed at my heel until he was about 18 months, when he began going out on his own and dividing his time between visiting the house and digging a burrow underneath it. Barbara believes that most people have a skewed perception of wombats. They are mainly nocturnal and shy of humans, so their true qualities remain hidden from most people, she said. Instead we cling to childhood memories of Ruth Parks tales of The MuddleHeaded Wombat, an endearing, lumbering fellow with stumpy paws and muddledup whiskers, who, with the best intentions, always manages to get things wrong. Professor Heinz Moeller, director of the Zoological Institute at Heidelberg University in Germany, discovered that far from being muddleheaded, wombats have the best developed brain of any marsupial. A colleague, Dr Regine Hilbmann, investigated their play behaviour and learning ability and found them very frolicsome and relatively quick to learn a sure indicator of a level of intelligence noone had guessed at. Wombats are remarkable in other ways too. They are one of the biggest animals in the world to dig burrows, which may extend 30 metres. Unlike those of other marsupials, their teeth have no roots and keep growing throughout their life, being worn down continually by the abrasive silica in their food. And although they are thought of as slow and bumbling, they can run at 40kmh over short distances when disturbed. They are also extremely strong. If chased into its burrow by a dog or fox, the wombat will lift its rump and crush the attackers head against the roof of the burrow. photo caption caption photo caption diagram photo caption caption photo photo caption photo caption Not everyone shares Sheryn and Barbaras love for wombats. Wombats are worthless Ron King, a sheep and cattle grazier in Victorias eastern highlands, fumed when I questioned him about them. Ive slaved on the land all my life and I have a fair knowledge of the destruction wombats cause. In my opinion, theyre worse than wild pigs. Ron is one of many farmers who detest wombats. He claims that since the 1960s, when wombat control was scaled down, their numbers have risen to plague proportions. Fences are impossible to maintain. Kangaroos in their hundreds come through holes wombats make and it is no longer economic to run sheep on a lot of my property because wild dogs get in the same way. Some farmers also accuse wombats of fouling their pastures and spreading parasites and disease, while their burrowing is said to undermine buildings and dam embankments and even cause soil erosion. Clive Marks, a biologist with the Keith Turnbull Research Institute in Frankston, Victoria, studied the pest behaviour of wombats for his masters degree at Monash University. He told me wombats were regarded as pests that damaged crops as far back as the 1860s. The problem was compounded in the 1880s when netting fences were widely used to control the spread of rabbits. Inspectors would fine farmers if they had rabbits on their land but farmers blamed wombats for making holes that let the rabbits in, he said. In 1906 the Victorian Government declared wombats vermin and their destruction was mandatory. A bounty system was introduced in 1925 and during the last decade it operated, 195565, payments were made on 63,000 scalps. Today wombats are protected in all states except for 193 parishes in eastern Victoria, where they are still shot, trapped and fumigated. I joined Clive on one of his regular visits to Tonimbuk, 70 km east of Melbourne, where aided by a grant from Australian Geographic he conducts field studies to determine the effectiveness of various fences against wombats. A storm was sending curtains of rain slanting down with a deafening crackle, and as we sheltered in his ute I asked him how he responded to landholder complaints. Wombats are stout, sturdy and strong, with the power to go where they want and by the most direct route through or under a farmers fence if necessary, he conceded. But a lot of whinges are more imagined than real. diagram caption photo The rain eased and Clive began tuning the antenna at the back of the ute, trying to pick up a signal from a radiocollared wombat in order to plot how far it foraged during the night. He wasnt having much luck. Its probably still down its burrow, he said. We persisted a little longer, but with the drizzle turning to cold rain, my heart wasnt in it. Clive caught my mood and shrugged sympathetically. Time to go home, he said. I asked him the best way of excluding wombats from farmland. Electric fencing, he replied without hesitation. The first recorded encounter between wombats and Europeans was in 1797 when sailors from the Sydney Cove, shipwrecked on Preservation Island off Tasmania, dined on wombat flesh. They likened the creature to a badger and a bear, and described the meat as being musky, not very agreeable flavour and very sinewy. In fact, the wombats closest relative is the koala. The two animals have similar rudimentary tails, paws and rearopening pouches, as well as a common ancestor that lived about 25 million years ago. Between 15 and 5 million years ago, several giant species of wombat evolved and the remains of some as big as cows and weighing 100 kilograms have been found from the Kimberley in WA to Bingara, New South Wales. The gradual drying out of Australia that turned threequarters of the continent from forest into semiarid desert led to the extinction of the giant wombats between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago. In the cooler, wetter highlands of southeastern Australia from Stanthorpe near the QueenslandNSW border south along the Great Dividing Range to the outskirts of Melbourne the common wombat continued to thrive, despite the clearing of forest for settlement and agriculture that shrunk its range. There are two subspecies, one in Tasmania and another on Flinders Island in the Bass Strait. But the lesserknown and much rarer hairynosed wombats, distinguished by their softer fur and longer ears, have fared less well since European settlement. photo caption photo When Epping Forest National Park was proclaimed in 1971 to protect the last population of northern hairynosed wombats, it was estimated that there were 35 animals, Matt Widt, rangerincharge of the 3300hectare sanctuary 100 kilometres northwest of Clermont in central Queensland told me as we stood in the sandy bed of an ancient watercourse, staring at a cluster of five burrows. Now there are Matt explained that the invasion of graziers and their introduced animals into the hairynosed wombats austere habitat precipitated a crisis they were unable to cope with. Sheep, cattle and wombats eat the same grasses but the wombats have narrower preferences, he said. It was no coincidence that the first wombat colonies to disappear were close to stock watering points, where grazing pressure was particularly heavy. A southern species of hairynosed wombat that once extended as far east as the Murray River is now confined to parts of the Nullarbor Plain and a few isolated colonies in southern South Australia. Northern hairynoses declined so quickly they first became known to scientists as a skull found in the Wellington Caves, NSW, in Fossil records indicate they were once widespread in Victoria, NSW and Queensland but by the turn of the century only two populations were known to exist, one near Deniliquin in southern NSW and another in the Moonie River area of southern Queensland."

        "text": "SOON AFTER the collapse of my last attempt at marriage, when it did not appear to matter much which city I was in, I passed through Sydney and called as always on my old friend Patrick, to tell him, among other things, that my Auntie Dot had died. Ah yes, he said. The bottle blonde. I thought youd like to know, I said, seeing you danced with her at my wedding. And you were fond of her, stated Patrick. Her hairdos, I said, were Wagnerian. Oh, come off it. They were She had all that hair piled up, and a big smiling mouth, and a great big beautiful bosom. All the things you lack, said Patrick, pulling out a chair for me. What did she die of The usual, I said. Cancer. We sat down at the table. Actually, said Patrick, weve got some news too. Remember those headaches I was always getting, that wouldnt go away I had tests. Theres something badly wrong. Inside my head. Now the contents of Patricks head were of more than normal concern for me, for Patrick recited my life like a poem he had learnt by heart and over the years of our friendship I had come to endure his version without open rebellion, since if in conversation I disputed even the most trivial detail of his discourse a date, a setting, a dream he exhibited signs of an existential alarm that verged on panic his eyes widened, his nostrils went stiff, he breathed in sharply and shoved his palms against the table edge and it was not only my lifes patterns, its events and landmarks and the proper ordering and interpretation of them that he needed to hold a monopoly on, but also its aesthetic, the aesthetic of me. In their back yard one day only a year before, under the wire on which their childrens clothes, stained with vehement activity, were drying in the breeze, Patrick, his wife and I had regretted the passing of our youth. I cant drink any more, said Patrick. It makes me dizzy and sick. I get headaches, real boomers that last a week. Night and day. And Im starting to forget things. Im losing my memory. That, I said, would be a blessing. There are so many things Id like to forget that I hardly know what would be left standing, if I ever got started. Patrick was appalled. But the past is what we are, he said. Its our duty to remember it. Speak for yourself, I said. Ill wipe it out as I go. Over my dead body, said Patrick. Getting old is worse for women, said Natalie, emptying the tea dregs on to a pot plant, because its our boring fate to be looked at. But imagine if we were beautiful, I said. Natalie is beautiful, said Patrick quickly. She means Beautiful, said Natalie. She means how terrible, if youd built your whole idea of yourself round the fact of being considered beautiful, to watch your beauty desert you. Ive never even been pretty, I said, so for me its probably less painful than it was for Ursula, for example. Tell me who Ursula was again said Natalie, but Patrick was already firing up. You were pretty, he said. You were You never had that feminine quality, mind you, that Nats got you were never composed but your face used to be vivid. Till it got hawklike. We were saying the other night, werent we, Nat, that youd become hawklike. And you used to have such pretty little breasts Of course, theyre sad now. Dignified, but sad. Sad I said. Theyre not so sad. Oho said Patrick. Now she wants to hear lies about herself Natalie laughed and made an exclamation of reproach, but since I had recently been led to believe that my life as a lovable creature was over, I said nothing. Solitude, I thought. Forgiveness. On Melbourne summer mornings the green trams go rolling in stately progress down tunnels thick with leaves the bright air carries along the avenues their patient chime, the chattering of their wheels but although I did not speak, Patrick knew the words I would have used and so even the thought of home at that moment was not a refuge. There must have been thousands of facts unknown to Patrick, ones I thought of as mine, but sweepingly he would correct me. He had mapped out the story of my life, and of the lives of everyone we knew, into a gridlike framework and nailed it down and everything done, witnessed, dreamed, heard of or read he had lined up under castiron headings, those terrifyingly simple categories of his. Only Dissatisfied Women become feminists. Lesbians are Heavy Drinkers. Derelicts suffer from Human Degradation. Some women Lack the Quality to make a man A Good Wife. Ursula, for example, Became an Alcoholic and a Prostitute. Hostile, I objected She was drinking, for Gods sake. She got a job in a massage parlour. I think youd be hard put, said Patrick, squaring himself and whitening his nostrils, to draw a distinction between drinking and getting a job in a massage parlour and what I just said. When I stood next to you, Ursula, at your daughters funeral, you were still wearing the gold ankle chain, the Indian ring on the forefinger. You said to me brightly, from behind your sunglasses, What a lot of people have turned up You dont often see so many people at a dotted line gathering. You told me about her, said Patrick. You were laughing and pulling faces. You told me that summer, remember When you brought your new bike up here on the train and rode around in those silk shorts. It was an Italian bike with an unnecessary number of gears. You said youd seen her at the swimming pool. Her face was red and coarse from the grog, you said, and she told you that the blokes she, uhm, serviced, that they all reckoned it was their wives fault, that they couldnt get what they needed from their wives. Did I say those things, did I grimace Forgive me, Ursula, as you stumble into the traffic on St Kilda Road. I thought of you yesterday when I stood too close to the tracks and a tram, keeling fast, clipped the tip of my shoulder. Unlike you, I stepped back in time but I was shaking, because now I knew what you had already found out the colossal weight of the thing, its dense rigidity, its utter lack of give. Patrick was by nature not a guest but a host, the kind of person who had his own chair and always sat in it. My houses and my life upset him because they were not fixed, as the past is I was always crashing, picking up the pieces and moving on, and he could not afford to be curious, because curiosity and its results might cause a shift in his taxonomy. He came into my room on one of his rare visits, stepping gingerly to where I was reading at the table with my back to the door, and peered over my shoulder at some lines on a card that was pinned to the window frame What are you waiting for What are you saving for Now is all there is. He turned away with a tongue click, relieved and vindicated. Oh, how shallow, he said. Im disappointed in you. I hung my head. I did I was choking with indignation, but I hung my head and fiddled with my fingers. The words on the card, no matter who said them first, were what Balanchine used to shout to his dancers a dare, a challenge, not a philosophical position to be argued and yet Patrick went home again happy, furnished no doubt with a fresh subheading hippy grasshopper clappedout party girl What do they say about me, when they lie alongside each other in their upstairs room, talking after midnight in their quiet, civilised voices He is my oldest, my most loyal friend, who loves me and seems to want the best for me but loyalty is not as simple as it looks, and the truth is that for the comfort of the contrast he needs to go on believing that my life is lonely, chaotic, wrecked, loose, without meaning a blasted heath. On that same last visit to Melbourne I took him to a coffee shop and we sat up at the bar. Patrick looked round him with cheerful pleasure. Its years, he said, since Ive sat on a high stool like this. It must be, oh, eighteen years ago, when Natalie and I lived over in Darlinghurst. I never knew you lived in Darlinghurst, I said. Yes you did said Patrick. Because you saw me there once, way back in the early seventies. You told me about it years afterwards. I dont think that can be right. It is he said. How can you forget these things Youd come to Sydney with some bloke or other, in a band, remember I suppose youd been taking drugs with him and so on anyway you saw me walking along the other side of Victoria Street with my shopping basket. You were about to yell out to me, but something made you change your mind. You didnt call out, and I walked on round the corner without knowing you were watching me. Funny, I said. I dont remember that at all. Its rather like a Poe story, isnt it, said Patrick luxuriously, unfocusing his eyes. A person sees the chance of a better life passing by, and he makes as if to call out he flung forth one arm in the imploring gesture of a soul in torment but something in his nature makes him hesitate. He pausesdotted linehe closes his lipsdotted linehe steps backdotted lineand then he slides down, and down, and down. I stared at Patrick, breathless. Who did I whispered. Who slid down, and down, and down He turned his full front to me and sang out, laughing, with both arms spread wide, You did, my dear You There was a lunch for those who rallied round, the day Patrick was to go into hospital. Rain was falling, birds flew low, air was damp and hair turned wavy. Another university relic of Patricks spotted me in the kitchen, nodded coldly, then said to Natalie with a sentimental smile, Patricks still looking after people, I see The phone kept ringing, people were drinking and laughing and taking terrible liberties with the unspeakable. Ive got a really good brain tumour story, said Max from where Patrick worked, an absolutely true and recent one. A woman I know, our age, lovely girl but never had much success with blokes well, she gets a tumour, a badlooking scan. Goes to a top surgeon, he operates. Every kind of treatment available, she gets it. He does a brilliant job on her. Off she goes. A year passes, they do another scan. She comes in to get the results, the surgeon sits her down and gives her the news perfect. Clean as a whistle. Theyre both excited, laughing and congratulating each other. Then the surgeon says, Would you mind waiting here for a moment He gets up and goes out of the room, closing the door behind him. Then he opens it again and comes straight back in, without his white coat. Im no longer your doctor, he says. Will you come out to dinner with me And theyve been together ever since. Later in the afternoon, when the other guests had wished Patrick well and departed, Natalie unplugged the phone and Patrick put to me a formal request. I want you, he said, to take two photos. One of me, Natalie, and our children, and the other of me and Natalie. Cheerful from the afternoons society I replied, Okay. Of course with pleasure. And then Natalie can take one of you and me."

        "text": "Telephone 4 Timbertop Street 074 456 592 NORTH BUDERIM 4556 20 January, 1994 The Chief Executive Officer, Australian Consumers Association, 57 Carrington Road, MARRICKVILLE N.S.W. 2204 Dear Madam, As a long standing Choice subscriber and more recently a panellist I am writing about a subject upon which I dont think you have ever written prepurchase home inspection services. I am writing to suggest that your Research Department report on the industry, and seek the assistance of your Customer Service Department on the awful mess in which I find myself as a result of dealing with the most widely advertised of these firms which operates in most States. A check of my own 074 Area yellow pages reveals eight firms advertising prepurchase home inspections under the heading Building Consultants pages 135 and 136 so I would assume there are hundreds more throughout Australia. A home is by far the largest purchase most consumers will make and they pay the large fee such firms demand to ensure that their purchases are sound. ARCHICENTRE, which claims to be a fully owned division of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, and whole full name is RAIA Archicentre Aust Pty Ltd A.C.N. 001 866 520, is a frequent advertiser, particularly in weekend newspapers usually with lowkey offers such as a DoItYourself Checklist for the Home Buyer. Such an offer appeared in a Sydney newspaper in May last year to which I responded and received dashThe Checklist which listed everything imaginable both inside and outside and concluded If you get into difficulties, or would rather have an expert do it for you, The Archicentre Home Inspection Service will carry out a complete inspection and report . dashA brochure promoting their Home Inspection Service a positive step for home buyers and home owners and offering expert advice . It described how the system worked with the use of a 300 point checklist to examine the house for, inter alia, faulty plumbing and wiring, signs of termites and borersdotted line dotted linethe confidence that an inspection report gives you, is worth the minor cost . Nowhere in the brochure is there any fine print or mention of exclusions. dashA covering letter saying A house is a major purchase and it is important to take the time to make sure that is a wise investment and not a financial disaster dotted line When you find the house of your dreams, we would like to help you make sure that there are no nasty surprises to spoil your happiness and comfort when you move in and offering a special discount of 240 instead of 275 for two months. At the time I was planning to sell my Sydney home and move to the Sunshine Coast of Queensland, In Feb 93 I selected my new home and, although it was only four years old, I took the precaution of requesting a prepurchase inspection with special regard to electrical safety. I selected Archicentre because of their literature, in particular their claimed association with the Royal Australian Institute of Architects. This has proved to be a major error of judgment as what I now have is the financial disaster from which they claimed they could protect me. The inspection was done by their Maroochydore Branch and, on the strength of their verbal report of 19 Feb, I completed the purchase. I received the written report after taking up residence and only then became aware of their Conditions of Inspection, 10 in number, which were the very last item on the report form. I would say that their forms are used throughout Australia as those I received originally plus the Inspection Report all bear the addresses of all their Offices. I feel very strongly that these alleged Conditions should be made known in advance in fact as part of the brochure, because of their extent. Some time later I became aware of inspection and reporting errors. These are NOT minor but very major i.e. dashThey said the electrics were without visible fault whereas the wiring from the house to the pool equipment shelter was unprofessionally and illegally done and when confronted with the matter hid behind Conditions 5 which says quite openly The report does not cover the condition or operation of swimming pools, spas and similar facilities. dashThey said the fences were sound, and dashThey said there was no evidence of termites or borers whereas 2 months later I discovered that the rear boundary fence, 3 large trees and logs used for garden edging were all termite infested because of termites coming from a very badly infested tree just 390 mm beyond the boundary fence. Their response to this was that the matter was properly the responsibility of the neighbour completely excusing their responsibility to report. dashThey said the front gutter on the street facing wall holds water and some joints show signs of rust but gave no explanation for the cause or the remedy. DEALINGS WITH TRADER As advised in your publication, the Complete Consumer, I wrote to the Head Office for Queensland and was contacted by the Manager of the Maroochydore Branch who informed me he had my letter. After inspecting the matters complained he denied all liability but offered to refund the inspection fee if I signed a waiver from further claim. I rebutted his use of the Conditions to evade responsibility for the wiring by reminding him that it was not the operation of the pool about which I was complaining but the WIRING from the house to the pool shed and they had undertaken to inspect wiring. He then proposed an improper and apparently illegal solution provided I still signed the waiver and paid my half on the cost in advance of the work being done. He brought a carpenter to inspect the fence and reported that it needed 20 new palings and that there were still active termites. As I was not prepared to sign the waiver or to pay in advance for a far from proper electrical job later confirmed as such by a SEQEB inspection negotiations broke down. He still accepts no responsibility for failure to report on the tree. Correspondence between us is attached. TRADE PRACTICES COMMISSION Acting on the advice in The Complete Consumer I wrote to the TPC because the firm is a national one with apparently nationally used systems as I felt that the problem should be dealt with at that level. Also I felt I had been deceived by misleading advertising which hid the exclusions until I had paid the fee, received the report and bought the house. My letter is attached together with the reply which directed me to Consumer Affairs At Nambour. It was stated that they would be able to advise you how to go about lodging an action for any lossdamage you have suffered . CONSUMER AFFAIRS I took the TPC letter to Consumer Affairs at Nambour on 15 Oct, the same day I received it and, after reading it, Mr Bromet handed me a Complaint Form to complete and return. I returned it personally on 18 Oct with complete attachments. On 17 Nov I rang to ask progress and was informed by Mr Bromet that he was preparing his report for Head Office. I asked how long it would take to get a decision and he said it could take a year but, in any case, it would not help me as I needed to take my own legal action. I reminded that TPC had said he would help me lodge an action and asked if a letter to the Minister would help he said it might. On 18 No I wrote to the Minister for Consumer Affairs and waited patiently for his reply until received on 13 January. This was no reply at all just a general letter without substance. I rang the contact person who informed me that dashTPC was in error and they could not help me lodge a claim dashAlthough the Minister said the Department attempts to mediate in disputes she could not answer my question as to whether mediation had been attempted or the result dashwhen I quoted from your book about the role of Consumer Affairs she replied it was very out of date and in any case did not have relevance to Queensland. So after waiting for 3 months Consumer Affairs did absolutely nothing to help. WHAT NEXT After 6 months of frustration I do not know where to turn. A Small Claim is not really applicable as the sum involved in greater than the limit. I am an Aged Pensioner with no resources to take Archicentre to court even though the case appears to be winnable. I am looking at losing my home if the tree falls on it and selling up seems the only alternative. I feel that Archicentre needs to be brought to book for their untrue advertising, the undisclosed exclusions, their unprofessional work and their refusal to even refund the inspection fee without the signing of a waiver from further claim. I dislike publicity but would be glad to cooperate with The Investigators if they wish to publicise the matter. Home buyers have a right to be able to put their trust in such bodies as the Royal Australian Institute of Architects and I feel this is bigger than just one branch of Archicentre and one unhappy client. I am trying to recover 13 photographs of the wiring and the tree and will send them upon receipt. THE TREE This is not just a danger to my life and property but to several homes nearby. I paid a tree surgeon for a report in Oct and he reported that it has definite white ant infestation, entrance at bottom most probably pipe running up centre. Large dead fork at top, approx height 30 metres, approx weight 9 tons. Possible danger to life and property at 4 Timbertop Street in cyclonic weather . Another tree surgeon was unwilling to report in case he was proved wrong as it could do anything including collapsing under its own weight. I have written to the owners requesting that they cease the hazard but they ignored the letter and havent even had termite treatment. I then sought the help of the Community Justice Programme but they reported that they sent two letters to the owners without response. I have been told by neighbours that a number of representations have been made to the Council over the years without success. I have been to the Council personally and by letter and they insist that even if the tree is a danger there is nothing they can do. Strangely, to illustrate the stupidity of the Councils attitude on the day I visited the Council about the tree I requested in writing permission to lop my own 3 trees in case they fell on neighbouring houses. The next week a Council officer inspected the trees and signed approval on the spot for the stated reason trees endangering dwellings . The termite infested tree is a far greater danger as another house on my rear boundary and within just a couple of metres of the tree has 3 little children aged 1 10 and even the owners of the tree have young children. This Council officer agreed that the tree is a danger but reiterated that there is nothing they can do. I asked the two tree surgeons with whom I discussed the tree to quote on the lopping of my own trees. Both refused to quote on the grounds that the trees are healthy having been treated and it is their policy to protect healthy trees. One said lopping was not the answer as it would ruin the canopy and he felt it better to remove them all together for which the approval could easily be amended. Both expressed the view that the Council could act regarding the dangerous tree. INSURANCE Having read with great interest your several articles on Insurance I am greatly concerned at the possible fall of the tree as it could destroy all or a large part of my home, swimming pool, contents and car which are presently covered by RACQ INsurance until the end of March when I will move to one of the companies you recommended."

        "text": "AUTOCAD photo RELEASE II Mark Casey draws on his background in computeraideddesign to preview the new release of the worlds topsellingPC CAD software. Its been over two years since the last release of AutoCad, the worlds best selling computeraided design program for PCs and workstation. In that time, user suggestions have been flooding in and the AutoCad development team has been working overtime improving what many believe is already an unbeatable product. The good news is that with Release II of AutoCad, they have improved the program, particularly in the areas of networking, solids modelling and drawing output. It has added a new programming language interface, enhanced the user interface and made many other smaller, user requested changes. AutoCad has some 10,000 users in Australia and New Zealand, and 400,000 worldwide, running the program on PCs, under MSDos, XENIX, OS2, Macintoshes, Sun, Apollo and DEC workstations. It requires a maths coprocessor, 2Mb RAM 4Mb is recommended and 20Mb of hard disk space. A wide range of mice, digitisers, displays, printers and plotters are supported. The difference in Release II is apparent at installation. Users are prompted to enter their name and the name of the dealer they obtained the system from. This information is embedded in the acad.exe file on the floppy disc and displayed whenever the program is run. Autodesk calls the process personalisation. The first and perhaps the biggest advance in the new release is its networking capability. Previous releases of AutoCad could be installed and used on a network, but unless the network administrator set up some advanced file restrictions, more than one user was able to open the same drawing file simultaneously. The problem here was that a user could inadvertently overwrite the changes made by another user. The new release introduces file locking as a standard feature and is suitable for any type of network. When a drawing file is loaded into memory a small file with the same file name but a different extension in created. So long as that file exists, no other user can load the same drawing. Users who attempt to do so are told the file is in use. The lock file is deleted when the user is done, freeing it for another user. excerpt If disaster strikes, Release II users will appreciate the new file recovery facility. Every byte in a drawing is subject to verification when the drawing is opened using Cyclic Redundancy Check CRC, an error checking mechanism. If a file is damaged, AutoCad will load the undamaged portion of the file, minimising the loss. As the file recovery option will only work with Release II drawings upwards, it would be a wise move to write a macro to load all nonRelease II files and save them in the new, recoverable format. Enhanced interface autodesk has made some excellent enhancements to the Release II user interface. AutoCad has a comprehensive menu system, with cascading, drop down menus and icon menus. Some of the menu titles and contents have been changed. Bonus files are now shown in a menu, so there is no excuse not to use them. Two of the new bonus Autolisp routines are dline.lsp which allows the creation of double parallel lines with corner cleanup and mvsetup.lsp for creating multiple viewports and preselected viewpoints. As menus are stored in the acad.mnu file they can be readily customised to any user. Dialogue boxes in Release II, used to set entity properties, layer characteristics, attributes, edit text strings and so on, have been improved dramatically. They now feature scroll bars, check boxes and text input areas. Where text extends beyond the left or right of an input area, a reverse photo caption video arrow indicates there is more than meets the eye. A new command called ddedit brings up a dialogue box which allows quick on screen editing of text and attribute definitions. Filename entry dialogue boxes can be configured to show a list of files alphabetically whenever AutoCad needs to access an external File for example, vslide or dxfin. Too many files No problem. The asterisk character and question mark character can be used to control which files are shown. Other wildcards put MSDos to shame. The and characters act as usual. But the at character matches a single alphabetic character the hash character, a single numeric character and the period . a single character of any other type. Character ranges can be specified too. For example, AJC will find files AC, BC through JC. The tilde character provides the logical not function. Command aliasing for those with an aversion to typing in lengthy commands, command aliasing will come as a welcome feature. In a file called acad.pgp, any AutoCad command photo can be assigned an abbreviation. When typed, the full command is displayed. Out of the box, AutoCad comes with several AutoCad commands already aliased. And for users who forget whats what, contextual help has been improved so that it provides an online assistant for the current command and also sub commands. Data entry has been improved in a number of small but significant ways. For instance, when entering 3D coordinates, cylindrical and polar coordinates can now be used. In addition to an X, Y, Z coordinate, a user can now specify points by their distance and angle in the XY plane and either an angle up from the XY plane spherical or Z coordinate cylindrical. A more specialised enhancement is the addition of a new entity type, a polyface or pface. It produces a general polygon mesh of arbitrary topology, allowing one object to be made up of several apparently unrelated lines or surfaces. Application developers might use a polyface to draw apparently complex objects which in fact have only a few entities, or to draw objects that have both wire frame and surface representations as separate layers that can be turned on or off. Dimensioning, the automatic annotation of AutoCad drawings, has been improved significantly in the new release in response to user demands and the need to conform with international dimensioning standards. Ordinate dimensioning is a new dimensioning method that allows a dimension to be specified relative to a fixed reference point. Designers whose work is ultimately used to drive tooling machines will appreciate this facility. excerpt Different colours can now be assigned to different parts of the dimension, such as dimension lines, extension lines and text. The dimension text can now be moved from its default position and rotated with the dimension extension lines able to be set at an oblique angle. To cap all this, dimensioning styles can be saved, as a named dimstyle, and applied to other drawings. This will save a considerable amount of effort in drawings which use dimensioning heavily. Text alignment has been made simpler, yet more powerful. With Release II, users can specify both horizontal and vertical alignments. Horizontal, left, right and centre justification is possible, vertically, text can be aligned to the top, middle or bottom of the text area, giving a total of 12 text alignment positions. A major addition to the AutoCad feature list is the ability to use external reference files. The insert command is still available but it has been supplemented by the xref command, which offers greater power and flexibility, particularly in managing large drawings. The difference is that with xref, the additional drawing does not become part of the current drawing and cannot be altered. Both drawings can be seen on the screen, but each is stored separately. Changes to the referenced file will be reflected in the drawing referencing it, and its entities and named objects will be temporarily added to the current drawing. Although a referenced file cannot be altered, it is possible to snap to geometric features of an object using osnap. The user also has complete control of layer visibility. An xrefed drawing can be made a permanent part of the current drawing with the xrefs bind command option. Conversely, the detach option removes the referenced drawing. Thanks to xref, a drawing can reference multiple instances of the same drawing or many external drawings can be included in one drawing. For anyone who uses AutoCad in situations where the same drawing components are used repeatedly, xref is a great enhancement. Release II introduces two new terms to the AutoCad vocabulary Model space and Paper space. Model space is the equivalent to the environment that preRelease II users have been using to create their drawings. Paper space is new. It is best thought of as wysbarwyg page design for CAD. Multiple views can be plotted on a single sheet of paper, with each excerpt view having its own scaling, its own dimensions, its own layer characteristics, its own position and size on the page. The paper space command, mview, also works for screen display, allowing much more flexible on screen presentations. Rectangular viewports can be overlapped, moved, scaled and specified just like any other entity. When modelling, the active viewport is highlighted with a thick border. mview options allow for hidden line removal during plotting and layer visibility in a viewport can be controlled by a new command vplayer. ads autocad application developers should welcome the addition of the AutoCad Development System, ads, which allows high level programming languages such as C to generate AutoCad applications. With ads, an external C routine can be accessed from within AutoCad and have access to the AutoCad drawing. Routines could be developed to access external database or spreadsheet files, linking drawing objects to a bill of materials application, for instance. The difference between ads and Autolisp is that the former uses compiled code, for better performance, whereas Auto lisp is an interpreter. Where a great deal of external calculation is involved, ads can out perform Autolisp by up to 700 per cent. External database access may not be necessary in all situations. The new release allows up to 16K of data to be linked to an object and stored in the drawing file Extended Entity Data. Compiled ads programs are also more secure than the Autolisp command lists, opening up opportunities for third party developers. Any Autolisp program can be converted to an ads program without too much bother. AutoCad has always been regarded as an excellent wireframe modeller. It has also performed well as a surface modeller, where the surface of an object is represented as a grid. But both these modelling methods have shortcomings when it comes to the 3D. Solids modelling is the best form of 3D modelling for many applications. Solid models are the most accurate and informationally complete representations of 3D objects. But solids modelling has traditionally needed very expensive software and has been difficult to use. With Release II, Autodesk ships an optional solids modeller called the Advanced Modelling Extension. It represents solids by constructive solid geometry csg, building up complex objects from simpler primitives such as cubes, cones and spheres. In addition, a models boundary information is stored. A Brep model represents a solid object as a collection of planes or surfaces. 2D profiles may be extruded or revolved to create complex solids. Before ame, AutoCad users would have turned to AutoSolid, currently version This product has now been effectively integrated into AutoCad as ame. Compared to AutoSolid, ame has more primitives and uses much of the power of AutoCad, rather than its own commands. ame is a powerful program in its own right with over 30 commands. Objects are built from primitives and profiles that can be extruded, solidified, chamfered and moved. Objects can be shown as wireframe, mesh or shaded solids with up to 256 colours. Separate objects can be combined with Boolean operators. When the primitives that make up an object are edited, changes are reflected in the combined object. And once a solid is constructed, excerpt ame can calculate its mass properties, areas, work out an objects centre of gravity, extract surfaces and create cross sections of an object in an instant. But while ame is an optional extra, included in every copy of Release II, there is also a subset of ame called Amelite."

        "text": "MR.BUTTHEAD Some of the army regulars had very strange ways of disciplining young servicemen. I am still convinced that the regular army guys resented the fact that we were national servicemen and they therefore treated us as if we were secondclass citizens. Some of the sergeants and sergeantmajors made us do some very unusual things. For example, we once were told that there would be a big inspection by some top brass and we therefore had to pick up every scrap of paper, every cigarette butt in and around the army barracks. This was not too bad, but one goon of a sergeant then made me sew these butts together with a needle and thread. I ask you Is this the way to win wars or to defend Australia Being young and willing, I did what I was told, even though I knew that the sergeantmajor must have been a sheep short of a paddock. It was a demeaning job and I never forgot the humility of sitting down with a pile of cigarette butts, needle and thread. Then, only a couple of years ago, I ran into this particular sergeantmajor. I was with Lynne and the Rex Hunt Fishing World crew in the international lounge, waiting for a Qantas flight to New Zealand. And who should walk in but this clown and his wife. To make matters worse, he immediately recognised me, tapped his wife on the arm and marched over. Do you remember me, Rex he smiled. Do I remember you, you little bastard You treated me worse than a dog and I wouldnt throw a bucket of water over you if you were on fire. I gave it to him in spades and told him exactly what I thought of him. He walked over to me stretching to his full height of 52, but by the time I had finished with him he looked like one of the Seven Dwarfs. I really cut him down to size, and he deserved it. I SCREAM FOR AN ICECREAM I always have been a great sports fan, whether it be football, cricket or tiddlywinks. If it was some form of competition, I wanted to know about it. If it was some form of bigtime sport, I wanted to be there. And, naturally, I wanted to be there when Australia played Test cricket against the West Indies in 1960In fact, my mates and I were among the first at the MCG for one days Test cricket and we made our way to the notorious Bay 13 area in the old Southern Stand. This particular area later became infamous for its beerswilling fans. However, I was just a kid and was more interested in icecreams. In fact, I am still a great icecream eater and if you put a carton in front of me Ill polish it off in no time flat. I had a few bob on me that day and, with the weather being very hot, I had my eyes out for the icecream boy. The big go in those days was what they called dixies icecreams in tiny cardboard buckets, and eaten with a tiny wooden spoon. There was no stopping me that day. I set a new Bay 13 record in eating 18 dixies between the lunch and the tea sessions. Not bad, eh My old Richmond coach Tommy Hafey also is big on the fang when it comes to icecream, so he would understand this story. What about it, Tommy How many dixies can you eat in one session TAR AND CEMENT I always appeared to be in one scrape or another and my mother must have thought I was cursed. However, she need not have worried. I was just a normal schoolboy with normal schoolboy habits and a propensity for mishap, as evidenced by the day I came a cropper in tar at Mentone. I was riding my bike home from school with a group of friends one day when we came across a particular schoolboys delight wet tar. It was perfect for a bit of skylarking and we rode our bikes through and through this tar just to see what marks we could leave with our tyres. It eventually was my turn to see how I could ruin the road makers day, so I therefore went back for the biggest warmup you could imagine. I almost disappeared from sight in my effort to build up a head of steam. I fully intended doing a huge skidmark on the wet tar. I pedalled and pedalled like an Olympian, the legs pumping faster and faster. The bike hit the tar all right, but one of my mates a real clown decided to poke a stick through my spokes. You guessed it I went head over turkey and went face first into the tar and skidded about 20 metres into a gutter. I then had to ride all the way home in my undies. My school uniform had been ruined and I still dont know what was worse the embarrassment of riding a bike in my old Yfronts, or facing my mother. Naturally, Mum went apedroppings and my punishment was mowing the lawns for the next 12 months. You now can understand why the Bearded Burbler does not like going near the mower. And I still get the heebyjeebies every time I smell tar. After all, my mother felt like throwing feathers on me that day to complete the job. UP A GUM TREE You might not believe it, but Yours Truly once was a cub, as a member of the Fifth Mordialloc Sea Scouts. And I took my cubbing very seriously indeed. In fact, I had just about every badge on offer, from one for seamanship to one for sewing can you imagine the Bearded Burbler with needle and thread. I needed just one badge to complete my collection and I was absolutely determined to get it as soon as possible. The badge was for treeclimbing and, Rex Hunt being Rex Hunt, I was not going to climb any old tree. I had to climb the biggest tree in the neighbourhood a massive gum tree. My task was to climb this tree and leave handkerchiefs on various limbs to prove that I had completed the task. Well, I got 30 feet up and then shit myself literally I kid you not There I was, up the proverbial pole in a real mess. To make matters worse, I froze and nothing could get me to move from the branch 30 feet in the air. The Fire Brigade was called and I had to make a most undignified climb down a ladder. Naturally, I never got this particular badge, but I didnt really care. I had had enough cubbing and my uniform went straight to the Op Shop. However, it was not in the best of conditions after I had made a mess of myself up a gum tree. And, talking of climbing, I was involved in a similar stunt one day when I went on holidays with my family to northern Victoria. It was in wheat country near Sea Lake and, being bored witless, I decided to climb a wheat silo. I climbed and climbed and got about 50 feet up a hell of a height for an 11yearold when I again found myself in difficulties. My uncle called for me to get down but, as hard as I tried, I just could not do it. I can remember my uncle standing there, like an ant below, bellowing at me as I inched my way down, step by precarious step. It took me just 10 minutes to climb 50 feet, but it took me two and a half hours to get down. Now, however, if there is no lift, the is no climb for Rex Hunt. I am averse to heights and even one floor up I get vertigo. FIELD OF DREAMS My childhood can best be described as something of a fantasy as I certainly lived in another world of football, cricket, fishing and horseracing. If it involved sport, I was into it in a big way. I would use a cricket bat to hit a ball against a wall all day during summer and, in winter, I would be down at the Parkdale Oval practising my kicking and marking. And, whether it be cricket or football, I would be practising my broadcasting. I would kick the football to myself and give a running commentary about a beautiful mark by Rex Hunt. Or I would describe, to myself, the maaagnificent century by Rex Hunt. As it turned out, I was far better at cricket than at football, even if I have to admit that I was not a natural football talent. I had to work very, very hard on my game and the fact that I eventually played at the top level was only because of hard work and constant practice. For example, I would be in my bungalow at home near the Parkdale Oval and, instead of hitting the books, I would tear down to the football ground to have a kick. However, I went to extraordinary lengths to do so. Much of my practice was done at night, so I would shimmy up an SEC pole and connect two wires. Then, bingo, the Parkdale Football Club lights would glow and I would have my own field of dreams. I would kick the ball high into the air and then run to get underneath it for a mark all done to my own commentary. Heaven knows how many Brownlow Medals and premierships I won. However, it was good for me as my football skills improved to the stage where I was able to get a regular game with the Parkdale Under 17s. I even won the competition best and fairest before moving on to play with the Richmond Under 19s and then graduating to the reserves and then the seniors. At one stage as a teenager I could not get a kick in a stable and was always one of the leftovers in school football. Then, just a few years later, I was playing at the highest level with the Richmond Football Club. And all because I had a dream. I was absolutely determined to become a League footballer and, through sheer determination, I made my dream come true. I did it through my own field of dreams and every time I see the Kevin Costner film of that name, I smile to myself and think of the times I shimmied up that SEC pole just so that I could have some light for my football practice. THE YOUNG BUSINESSMAN I was very young when I had my first business experience. As my family lived near the Cheltenham Golf Course, it was only a matter of time before I joined some of my schoolboy mates in finding and selling golf balls. The Cheltenham Golf Course had a pond adjacent to the first tee and although it was a difficult hole for the average golfer, it was a schoolboys dream. My mates and I would walk barefooted into the dam in efforts to retrieve golf balls. Golfers would ask us to walk around to find balls in the muddy waters. They offered us two bob 20 cents for each ball we could find. However, it was amazing how few balls we could find whilst the golfers were watching us. We would have to give a frustrated look and tell them that we simply could not find any balls. Then, when the golfers went to the second tee, we miraculously would find balls. We used to stand on them so that they could easily be retrieved when the golfer was out of sight. We later would sell the balls to the professional for three shillings and sixpence each 35 cents. We saw nothing wrong with this. If the old codgers had wanted to save money they could have waded into the pond themselves."

We appreciate IBMs generous support for our centre. The Model 80 will be used as a file server to enable establishment of a local area network in our centre. We propose to set up the LAN very shortly and IBMs support will certainly facilitate this happening. Enclosed please find our signed copies of Attachments A and B.. As you are aware, we are required to obtain valuations for donated equipment for audit purposes as part of our agreement with the Commonwealth Department of Employment, Education and Training. We would therefore appreciate it if you could send us details of the value of this donated equipment. Once again, we wish to express our thanks to IBM. We look forward to a strong ongoing and mutually beneficial relationship. Yours sincerely Steve Lawrence General Manager LETTERHEAD 28th June 1991 Ms Louise Davis Program Manager, Corporate Relations IBM Australia Limited PO Box 400 PENNANT HILLS NSW 2120 Dear Louise, IBM SPONSORSHIP FOR NATIONAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CENTRES ITeCS 1986 1991 As we near the end of the current 3 year sponsorship relationship with IBM I would like to take the opportunity to thank you and our other longstanding friends in IBM for your support not just over the current 3 year period but since well before the ITeC program was born. Without IBM assistance in the initial development phase during 1985 and 1986 it is unlikely ITeCs would exist today. I felt it might be useful if I took the time to review our progress and the role IBM has played for your consideration as we look at how IBM might choose to work with us into the future. I have not proposed the specifics for a continuing relationship but rather set the scene in the attached report for discussion within the ITeC network and within IBM. I look forward to discussing with you how we might then meet to take these discussions into the next phase. Once again our grateful thanks to you and our many other friends at IBM. Yours sincerely Steve Lawrence VICE PRESIDENT DIRECTORCORPORATE RELATIONS.

For some of the trainees this will be their first completion of a formal course of training and a very important person achievement. I look forward to seeing you on Thursday. If the computer is ready at that time you may like to formally present it to us at the graduation. Yours faithfully, Steve Lawrence General Manager LETTERHEAD 1 December 1994 Mr John Ford Manager Sponsorships Carlton United Breweries GPO Box 4050 Sydney 2001 Fax 281 7087 Dear John Re Newtons Restaurant Training Project This is to confirm our recent conversation regarding support for our innovative employment training venture to assist homeless and disadvantaged inner city young people find jobs and a career in Australias growing hospitality industry. We are seeking CUB support in donating and installing beer dispensing equipment in our lisenced bar to allow us to train unemployed youth, and serve beer on tap. If possible we would like to have both full beer and a light beer capacity. Peddle Thorpes Interior Design Division has donated their services to assist in the design and renovation of the restaurant premises in King St Newtown and a variety of other companies like your own are rallying to assist us outfit it as a very exciting and modern eating venue. Our principal sponsor is Mayne Nickless Limited, who have agreed to support the project as their primary community initiative in NSW for the next four years. Other current donors include OBriens Glass, Premium Cork Timbers, Coca Cola Bottlers, Bristol Paints, CSR, State Bank, Bayliss Blinds, MSS and Armaguard. CUB support will be acknowledged in project promotion and in our company annual report. We will of course serve and recommend your product Gifts to Work Ventures are tax deductable and we are also exempt from sales tax. I will enclose a copy of our company Annual Report for your perusal. We are very eager to have CUB participation in this positive venture which will assist young people find hope, in a workforce where much youth employment has disappeared. As the restaurant is due to open on 13 December we would appreciate an early response. I will call you again next week. Yours sincerely Steve Lawrence General Manager 10 August 1995 Mr Andre Kaspura Area Manager,Sydney Eastern Area Department of Employment,Education and Training GPO Box K764 Sydney 2001 Attention Colleen Bramble Dear Andre NEWTONS TRAINING RESTAURANT PROJECT This is to confirm our acceptance of funding for this pilot training program for disadvantaged youth as outlined in your letter of 10 November and our earlier submission, together with Colleen Brambles letter of 30 November. We understand funding of 36,400 will be arranged as a variation to our Maroubra Skillshare contract and that additional costs for Access assessment fees and ancillary costs for uniforms etc as requested in our submission will be reimbursed or paid on receipt of invoice from the supplier. The program will provide training and employment support to 30 job compact or at risk young persons approved as eligible by Newtown CES over a 15 week period. Newtown will be our supervising CES office. In anticipation of this program a number of selected participants have already been introduced to the project and are ready for signup as normal for FTA approved courses. We would hope this can be arranged as soon as possible. As requested some amendments have been made to our original submission outlining training program details. An amended version of the proposal is attached. On the Industrial Relations issue raised in your correspondence we wish to advise that discussions have been held with several Skillshare projects, the Industrial Relations Manager with the Restaurant Caterers Association and DEET Central Office. We understand that several precedents exist for unpaid onthejob style training in a similar manner to that proposed. Several other Skillshare projects are already operating on the same basis as that proposed by us with departmental support. Almost all Skillshare and other labour market programs offer Work Experience placements with community awareness and support its benefits are widely agreed to be critical to improving employment prospects for participants. The ACTU has agreed to allow up to 250 hours of unpaid onthejob training for participants of AVCTS programs in private sector workplaces for school students under TRACS courses. For our own program the following undertakings are given no trainee will be allowed to work on any task longer than is required to achieve proficiency in the competency in which they are being instructed, award rates will be paid for any work beyond this this project is being run with sufficient paid staff to do the work required without requiring the assistance of trainees except for the training role for which the project was created no individual will receive any financial benefit from income generated by the venture except unemployed participants. When trainees have completed the training modules of the program they will be offered parttime employment at the restaurant wherever possible unless they have already found paid work elsewhere. The individual plan which has been requested that we produce for each client and an assessment of clients and activities will be forwarded to Newtown CES after the conclusion of the program. A weekly attendance record for all participants will be faxed at the beginning of the following week. We look forward to working with the Area Office and CES staff on this innovative employment initiative and to seeing many longterm unemployed and at risk young people find work. We also hope some staff will join us at the restaurant from time to time to assess for themselves the skills being gained from the program. With best wishes for the Christmas Season and New Year Yours sincerely Steve Lawrence General Manager 10 August, 1995 Mr Greg Kent Assistant Area Manager Department of Employment Education and Training Dear Mr Kent Re Focus I am writing to indicate our willingness to undertake the Research Assignment you requested us to consider, to enable the department to assess and develop a training strategy for the proposed venture if it is found to be capable of offering sustained employment to LTU jobseekers as has been proposed. WorkVentures would engage Management Alternatives Pty Ltd to undertake much of the work under our oversight and with our assistance. Paul Bullen and Kinga Bissits the companys principal consultants are well known to us and have undertaken a number of successful projects on our behalf. Brief capability details on Management Alternatives and its personnel are attached. We would propose to undertake the project in the following manner Complete a company search on each of the participating entities to clarify details of their financial capacity and key personnel. Hold initial meetings, beginning as soon as possible, with principals to clarify details of the proposed venture, its legal and business management structures, as well as begin to clarify duty statements for people to be recruited. In consultation with CES staff and the principals, begin to identify the likely skill profiles of potential LTU recruits thought suitable for each of the primary occupational categories. Undertake a skills audit and training needs analysis to clarify the training requirements and develop draft tender specifications for Jobtrain or similar tender documents, drawing where possible on appropriate existing Jobtrain documentation. We would of course report promptly to the department at any point if we conclude the project does not appear viable in our opinion. At this point we would also hold further work as far as possible until the department has indicated if it wishes us to proceed further."

        "text": "Synopsis The depressing picture presented by the above quotation is what one might call the unpleasant human side of the plethora of government funded reviews, reports and studies of the problems faced by students in rural areas with regard to achieving educational and employment opportunities that are commensurate with their urban peers. In comparing rural Australia with urban Australia it is important to recognise that both are heterogeneous areas and in each community students face educational and employment problems. However, the additional educational disadvantages faced by students in areas classified as rural are well documented. The fundamental explanation for these problems is the isolation of the communities, and there are institutional, attitudinal and access inequalities that arise as a result of this isolation. There are however, identifiable education reforms that may help to overcome these problems. The problem of rural unemployment on the other hand cannot be solved by reforms to education alone. The limited employment opportunities experienced by rural youth, and described in Michaels frighteningly honest account, are a result of changes to the national and international economy which are drastically altering the employment prospects of all young Australians, but which leave rural youth particularly vulnerable. The most common definition of rural Australia is those areas outside the capital cities and the other major urban conglomerates, which in NSW would also exclude Newcastle and Wollongong from rural status. According to the federal governments Fair Go 1989 document, which uses this definition of rural, There are about 5,400 schools in rural Australia and in 1986, nearly 2 million students attended rural schools. This represented 39 of total school enrolments. Fair Go, 1989, p.4 It is the students in these schools that the essay invites us to compare with students in schools in the metropolitan areas. Prior to attempting this comparison two issues arise. Firstly, the metropolitan areas include a vast variety of unique communities. They include areas of affluence and high employment, as well as areas of widespread poverty and unemployment which are comparable with the worst rural economic circumstances. Further, they include areas dominated by people of Anglosaxon decent, areas dominated by people from nonEnglish speaking backgrounds, and areas with a significant Aboriginal population. Therefore, in discussing the problems of rural students in terms of equality between rural and urban areas we must focus on the aspects of education and unemployment which are specific to rural areas. These are the factors which make rural students experiences different from all of their urban counterparts. As we shall see, if there is one factor which covers all of these differences then that factor is isolation. Secondly, rural communities are also far from being homogeneous. They range from large rural regional centres like Armidale or Wagga, to very small and remote communities. As a result the degree to which they suffer from the inequalities associated with isolation vary greatly. As such, it is probably best to conceptualise rural communities as falling somewhere on a continuum, with small remote communities experiencing the most acute inequality and students in large rural regional centres having educational opportunities more closely resembling their urban peers. As stated by Merryweathers, You obviously dont need the same sort of support for Tamworth or Grafton that you need for Tibooburra or Coolarenebridotted line the range of programs dotted line tend to recognise that continuum.Merryweathers 1994 There are a number of statistics which have lead commentators to the conclusion that the problems associated with isolation have lead to inequalities of opportunity between rural and urban students. The factors that are pointed to are summarised in Education in Rural Australia,untranscribed quotation To this Henry adds that students in rural areas are, dotted line more likely than their urban counterparts to be forced into less prestigious unskilled employment. Henry, 1989, p.1. Finally, a telling statistic quoted by Baker in a case study of an isolated high school in NorthWestern New South Wales was that, A considerable proportion, estimated at about 1520 of primary school leavers, are sent to boarding schools outside the shire. Baker Proudfoot, 1989, p.2 This illustrates that many rural parents show their level of approval of rural education by voting with their feet. What is the explanation for all of these statistics which point to rural inequality It can be argued that all rural students suffer the problems associated with isolation to a varying extent. Isolation manifests itself in many ways which all contribute to the inequality between rural and urban education. These manifestations of isolation can be classified under three headings access, institutional problems, and attitudes. Firstly, the most obvious problems faced by rural students resulting from isolation, is their inferior access to education at primary, secondary, and tertiary level. This lack of access is both in terms of physical distances to be travelled and also in terms of the choices of subjects that students are able to study. Regarding travel, there seems to be little data published about the effects of school travel on students in NSW or Australia, but the following quotation reflects much anecdotal evidence, Parents and teachers commonly point to school travel as contributing to fatigue, reduced enthusiasm for school and homework and unsatisfactory behaviour. Students preparing for the HSC often seek weekly accommodation closer to the school to avoid travelling long distances. Listening and Responding, 1984, p.11 This quote refers only to those students who are within reasonable travelling distance of a school. Of even greater concern is the fact that it was estimated in 1989 that about 15,000 children in Australia did not have ready access to school, meaning that they were left the option of boarding away from home, or learning by correspondence, both of which involve obvious disadvantages for students. The second aspect of access is the fact that students in isolated communities often do not have the range of subject choices that are available to students in metropolitan areas or larger regional centres. For example, in 1980 the number of HSC subjects available to students in centres with a single small high school averaged 1, compared with an average of 6 available to students in centres with two or more high schools. Listening and Responding, 1984, p.17 This problem is of course one of economics. In a school with only 12 senior students, whilst class sizes will be favourably small, the school could not afford to have the staff available to teach a wide variety of subjects. It should be notes that the NSW state government has attempted to overcome the problems of access outlined above. In 1989 they announced projected expenditure of 22m entitled Access Initiatives in the Rural Schools Plan, 1989p. 6. A major review of the Distance Education Program was undertaken and, although there are as yet no written reports of the progress that has been made, in an interview with the manager of NSW Distance Education the following statements were made, One of the problems in, lets say, a small country high school is physically being able to do a range of subjectsdotted line Youve got the child who wants to do French at Coolarenbri Central Schooldotted lineobviously you wont have a French teacher in a school of that size dotted line then you can enrol a child in one of the Distance Education Centres or at the Open High School and the kid will get a quality educational service dotted line so much so that dotted line I think it might have been the 2U A French dotted line the top student in the state in the HSC last year was a student enrolled in Distance Education dotted linein Queenbeyan. Some of the small central schools across the state have traditionally only gone to, say, Year 10 dotted line If we can take Tottenham dotted line the fact is that the school numbers will never be sufficient to have a substantial senior school dotted line yet youve got kids within the district whodotted line should have the opportunity to go on. And they could go away to board or sometimes, with excessive travel on a daily basis, go to Dubbo or where ever. What weve set up in those cases is what we now call the Access Program where the kids will stay in their particular school, their community. We will network the schools. So you may have an English teacher at Tottenham who wants to do some senior work, by networking 4 or 5 senior schools and using Telematic teaching using telephone, fax, computer and modem dotted line the teacher will teach 3 kids in Tottenham face to face, 2 kids in Tullibigeal, 1 kid in Tullamore, 4 kids in Trange, who come in, sit in a room with the array of gear, and theyll do their 40 minutes of Englishdotted lineMerryweathers, 1994 Although the extent of these programs is limited by available funds and there are many arguments to say that such education is not as good as a classroom education with, for example, 20 other students and a teacher face to face, thoseinvolved with the Distance Education program are certainly overcoming many of the inequities that have existed. The materials produced by the unit are marketed by the Department of Education, sold to schools in Metropolitan areas and are of extremely high quality. Imaginative approaches are taken to ensure that students in isolated settings are able to learn the same concepts as their less isolated peers with the use of a the full range of available information technology, and specially designed kits containing such things as the chemicals necessary for science experiments. For example, instead of performing a dramatic piece in front of a class, a student might videotape the performance and it could then be shown to teachers and or other students obvioulsy learning skills that would not be available to many urban students in the process. Whilst such students have fewer opportunities to interact with their peers there are regular meetings of students from the area. Meetings with teachers have also been made easier since the decentralisation of the Distance Education department. Access to secondary education is also an issue and the low levels of rural students continuing on to tertiary level is often blamed on the lack of access. Again, this is a problem that has been reduced in recent years. Main university campuses currently exist at Wollongong, Armidale, Lismore, and Bathurst, with other smaller associated campuses being spread across the state. These Universities, along with their metropolitan counterparts, offer external study options, as does the system of TAFE institutions that are spread widely across the state. However, studying externally, commuting or moving to larger regional centres both have financial and educational disadvantages posing a definite though unavoidable problem for rural students. Many of the problems of access are realistically unavoidable in a large, sparsely populated nation. However, it can be seen from the initiatives of both the federal and state governments outlined above that the lack of opportunity experienced by rural students is a problem that is being addressed though the use of information technology, the expansion of the tertiary education sector, and the imaginative approaches of teachers and policymakers. The second group of problems associated with isolation have been termed institutional problems. This involves the problems of staffing and resourcing rural schools. Staffing is a major problem in rural areas. The following statements come from two case studies of isolated rural schools. When my wife and I first drove into Plains dotted line it was all brown and dead and dry. It was very disconcerting and besides which we drove straight through the town and thought God, theres got to be more than thisdotted line my wife said, Oh lets turn around and go back home, I dont want to stay here. third year teacher describing arrival as a first year out teacher Baker Proudfoot, 1989, p.203 dotted line a survey of final year teacher education students indicated that close to threequarters of such students would refuse a teaching post in the area Baker Proudfoot, 1989, p.196 Its a bit of a hole dotted line theres nothing here. This town stinks male I would never live here. Its a dump. Female Henry, 1989, p.17 The above statements illustrate a widely acknowledged problem that rural school are undesirable in the eyes of teachers. This has lead to difficulties in filling vacancies and a high turnover of staff, although the recent lack of vacancies in metropolitan and coastal schools has alleviated the problem to a large extent. The problems for a school of high staff turnover have been outlined by Hatton 1985, p.13132 can can include low instructional pride, discontinuation of sporting or cultural activities, difficulties in maintaining innovative curriculum initiatives, and large numbers of inexperienced and stopgap teachers. On the other hand, large numbers of inexperienced teachers has the possible advantage of bringing into the school new ideas and enthusiasm. However, it cannot be denied that experience is certainly something that is valuable to a teacher and in rural schools it seems to be in far shorter supply. It should be noted of course that there are also many metropolitan schools that suffer the same problem of being considered undesirable places to teach. Further, the state government spent approximately 12m between 1988 and 1992 in an attempt to encourage teachers into rural schools through a range of incentives. Rural Schools Plan, 1989, p.3. However, the success of this initiative is obviously difficult to measure. The second aspect of the staffing problem is that it is often argued that first year out teachers are inadequately prepared to teach in rural schools. Of course this is a criticism that is often applied to new teachers entering any school, and the corresponding comment is that new teachers learn more about teaching in the first month at a school than they could ever learn at university anyway. UNEs Graduate Dip.Ed. excepted The second of the institutional problems of isolation is that of providing resources to students in rural schools that are equivalent to those in metropolitan schools. These educational resources can be as tangible as text books, a video, or a school library, or as intangible as the range of cultural experiences that are often not available to rural students. These are problem that can be overcome by increased government funding to provide the necessary hardware as well as to fund field trips by students to more populous regions and visits by musical and drama groups etc. to isolated regions. Extra funding has come in the from of the Country Areas Program a federal government initiative and the Isolated Schools Grants a NSW government initiative. CAP and ISG funds have been used to fund excursions and field trips, regular visits by advisory and itinerant teachers with special skills, tertiary orientation programs for rural students, communication links between schools through the use of computer networking, satellite dishes and facsimile machines and a wide variety of other schemes. Country Areas Program, 1990, p.12 Unfortunately funding for CAP and ISG face the same constraints as many government initiatives. The funding for CAP did not increase in real terms between 1982 and 1990, despite the fact that there was a widening range of schools desiring assistance during that period Country Areas Program, 1990,p.15. On the issue of resources, two further points should be noted. Firstly, many rural students do have access to a wide range of educationally valuable experiences which come from the communities in which they live."

        "text": "Elaine Thompson is a Senior Lecturer and, at present, Head of the School of Political Science, University of New South Wales Democracy undermined reforms to the Australian public service from Whitlam to Hawke Since the Second World War the two challenges confronting government administration have been to ensure that the bureaucracy responded to the wishes of its political masters and to ensure that the bureaucracy responded with sensitivity to the wishes of the public. Directly related to these problems of responsiveness and sensitivity were a host of technical problems which arose from the organisational structures of government red tape, insensitivity, slowness, rigidity, time serving, conservatism, confusion, empire building, infighting, inefficiency, irrationality and high costs. There were seen to be problems of coordination, of implementation, and of information flows. The list seemed endless enough. Bureaucrats are portrayed as fearridden yet arrogant, as milquetoasts yet Machiavellians. Bureaucracy is rigid and at the same time expansionist1 First reform period 19731986 From 1973 until 1986 there were a succession of inquiries into and reforms of the Australian public service.2 All were aimed, overwhelmingly, at ensuring accountability to government, improving responsiveness to the people, and improving efficiency in that order. Both the Fraser LiberalNational government of 1976 1983 and the Hawke Labor government elected in 1983 attempted to assert supremacy over policy direction and to create a responsive, accountable public service.3 Reforms under Fraser Fraser introduced a series of major administrative reforms aimed at improving the lot of the individual citizen against the bureaucracy Freedom of Information legislation, a Federal Ombudsman, an Administrative Review Tribunal and an Administrative Court were all created. While these changes amounted to a revolution in the relationship between citizen and bureaucracy they were not the centrepiece of Frasers reforms. Frasers main concern was to ensure that the public service did the governments bidding. He was determined that as prime minister he should have greater control over policy areas and that key policy initiatives were implemented by the bureaucracy. To achieve those ends Fraser increased the power of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, expanded the role of his personal advisers, and organised cabinet to ensure the dominance of the prime minister and a group of senior ministers.4 Frasers ideological commitment to the expansion of the private sector and to cutbacks in the public set him on a collision course with the bureaucracy, especially because the ideology was combined with policies aimed at reducing the size of the public service rapidly and demands on the public service to continue performing all its functions quickly and efficiently. In addition, the government too frequently used rhetoric which attacked and denigrated the public service, viewing it as a parasite on the productive private sector of the economy. The remark of Sir Phillip Lynch that public servants had their snouts in the trough, burned deeply into the Canberra bureaucratic mind.5 While the control mechanisms selected by Fraser were not in themselves illchosen, the governments style resulted in a demoralised bureaucracy and, in some ways, a government ultimately ill served by its bureaucrats. Conflicts arose because Fraser was attempting to force policy responsiveness onto departments used to doing things in their own ways. Those departments resented public servants from the Prime Ministers Department overseeing, on behalf of the Prime Minister, what they were doing on their own turf Fraser attacked the cosy norms of the public service, and was in turn bitterly attacked.6 Tensions were exacerbated by Frasers authoritarian, domineering political style and a relationship of mistrust and hostility emerged between government and bureaucracy. The overall result was that Fraser failed to create a public service responsive to government. Indeed his attempts at control brought about a situation close to administrative breakdown, with the last period of the Fraser years marked by administrative scandals which seriously undermined the credibility of that government and contributed to its electoral defeat. Despite Frasers rhetoric of efficient and lean government, parts of the public service was found to be negligent and wasteful.7 For example, the Australian Wheat Board had failed to supply parliament with proper accounts between 1976 and 1978, and had handled 6000m of growers funds without issuing a single financial statement on its expenditure. The Department of Finance had on at least three occasions ignored the strict guidelines which controlled the expenditure of the special advances to the Minister of Finance. In 1982 the federal Health department was found grossly inadequate in responding to medical fraud and overservicing. The Australian Dairy Corporation was found to be engaged in illegal activities and its public service staff to be acting entirely to protect their own interests. On several occasions, files were not available to parliamentary inquiries and evidence was given that relevant information had been deliberately destroyed. Most damaging of all were the October 1982 revelations of the Costigan Royal Commission. The Costigan report on bottomoftheharbour tax avoidance schemes argued that dishonesty, gross negligence and incompetence in the Commonwealth crown solicitors office in Perth, had allowed a major fraud on Federal revenue through tax evasion, and that the governments failure to outlaw bottomoftheharbour tax schemes arose from the legal errors and incompetence of its officers. Fraser failed to gain control and the scandals that surrounded the bureaucracy helped create an atmosphere in which reforms aimed at control could be brought down. They also helped push a concern for efficient government up the list of priorities by highlighting the need for an efficient, lean public service. In so doing, they helped pave the way for the changes that were to come. The Hawke government The Labor party decided that the desired relationship between bureaucracy and government could best be created through coherent long term reform of the public service. They came to office with an energetic managerial elite made up of politicians, public servants and political advisers committed to administrative reform aimed primarily at ensuring that governments would be well served by their bureaucrats, and introduced proposals in an atmosphere of bipartisan support dotted lineboth sides know they need their own highly qualified boys sic in senior positions to ensure that the will of ministers prevails and is put into practice. There is a strong bipartisan feeling that the balance of power must be shifted towards ministers from the senior career public servants.8 In June 1984, a package of legislative measures was passed, designed to improve the responsiveness of the public service to governmental priorities, improve equity within its own work force and in the delivery of government service, and enhance efficiency. At this stage the governments concern was still overwhelmingly with public service responsiveness. Efficiency was seen as a process to improve the delivery of policy to the public. The government abolished the divisional structure of the public service, transferred the control of staff numbers from the Public Service Board to the Minister for Finance gave department Secretaries virtual autonomy on organisation matters provided they stayed within the staffing aggregates set by the budget and the positions classification guidelines established by the Board and consolidated administrative appropriations into larger votes effectively enabling secretaries to transfer funds across the range of functional inputs. A commitment was made to a Financial Management Improvement Program FMIP, the objectives of which were i in determining priorities all resources claims of the department are taken into account ii programs are consistent with established goals, objectives and policies iii objectives and program structures are oriented towards outcomes and are specific enough for subsequent performance to be measured iv performance indicators and systems to assess program performance and monitor resource usage are developed v responsibility is delegated to those held accountable. After a year, the coordination of staff numbers and financial controls were regarded as so successful that a Commissioner of the Public Service Board commented in retrospect it seems strange that they were ever considered separately.9 Other changes included greater openness in recruitment of senior executives a refocussing of public service management attention away from processes and on to outputs and an innovative approach to organisational change and, in particular, a move towards less hierarchical structures. The Senior Executive Service SES The creation of a Senior Executive Service was the fundamental change, aimed at changing the norms of the bureaucracy and strengthening the career services capacity for policy formulation and implementation. The reforms objectives were to develop a more distinctive senior public service with a broad commitment to professional service rather than a narrow loyalty to a single department, client group or policy area, and to make the senior ranks of the bureaucracy more open to all, establishing in the process new norms of equity and representativeness. The creation of the Senior Executive Service was justified as an attempt to improve the responsiveness of senior bureaucrats and enhance their capacity to understand problems as a whole, from a politicians perspective. The old Australian career service had ensured that most officials spent their careers within one department and developed a departmentallybased perspective on issues, rather than one based on a broad notion of the public interest. Because it was difficult for governments to bring in their own political appointees, or even outside recruits, and it was almost impossible to fire public servants, a government was often faced with a public service which resisted the political imposition of goals. There were also problems in that the people at the top of the bureaucratic pyramid were at times past their prime and the structures generally tended towards rigidity. This first reform period could still be seen as part of the overall tradition of reforms to create a responsive, accountable public service which ran its programs efficiently. The second reform period 1986 and beyond However a seachange occurred in the 198687 period. In response to the economic crisis of mid1986 and the 1000 million blowout of the budget deficit, the Hawke government imposed a freeze on staff numbers in the public service and gave approval for a razor gang to seek about 1000 million in new spending cuts. The previously projected growth in the public service for 198687 had been between one and a half and two and a half per cent 2000 to 3000 people.10 In August and September, it introduced by far the most radical changes in the history of the Australian public service mechanisms whereby public servants could, relatively easily, be dismissed on the grounds of redundancy or inefficiency. The Public Service Act was accordingly amended in NovemberDecember 1986 by the introduction of the Public Service Legislation Streamlining Act and the repeal of the Commonwealth Employees Redeployment and Retirement Act The Public Service Board was given the power to transfer staff within the public service in the interests of the efficient management of the service. Departmental Secretaries were given increased power to remove inefficient staff, and to switch monies between wages and other administrative expenses. In addition, for all but junior staff, the right of appeal over promotions was abolished. Departments and agencies were to submit staffing plans which indicated how the desired reduction in staff numbers could be achieved. As such plans were approved, the staff freeze was lifted. Finally an Efficiency Scrutiny Unit, reporting directly to the Prime Minister, was established to oversee an extensive program of scrutiny into selected areas of public sector administration. These considerable reforms prevailed despite objections from the public service union because there was a general feeling that in the economic circumstances the government had no choice the public sector had to be cut back, and made cost efficient. The agenda had begun to shift. In June 1986 the Public Service Board and the Department of Finance released a report reaffirming the objectives of financial management improvement. However, there was little comment on how new procedures would improve productivity and performance. Moreover Government did not provide departments with additional resources to implement FMIP initiatives. The 1986 FMIP report, like its predecessors, reflected an overwhelming preoccupation with efficiency in the management of programs rather than with the quality of policy advice. This preoccupation, which was associated with achieving savings in expenditure amounted to a fundamental change in the perception of public administration the tasks of public servants were now managerial rather than policy oriented."

The most striking feature of the most arresting application of the word in our language is surely its dotted lineimmodesty. Thus we define by opposites, and by indirections find directions out. But opposites may be said mutually to contain each other and are thus, by implication, modest. This is only the first of the ironies of modesty, the ironic notion par excellence. We might note that in Swifts A Modest Proposal for Preventing the Children of Ireland from Being a Burden to their Parents or Country, it is decidedly not the content which is modest it being indeed immodest if not outrageous. Rather, its form in its modest understatement simultaneously conceals and exacerbates the outrage of the message. A Modest Proposal is, then, an immodest triumph of tonal modesty I think it is agreed by all Parties, that this prodigious number of Children in the Arms, or on the Backs, or at the Heels of their Mothers, and frequently of their Fathers, is in the present deplorable state of the Kingdom a very great additional grievance and therefore whoever could find out a fair, cheap and easy method of making these Children sound and useful Members of the Commonwealth, would deserve so well of the publick, as to have his Statue set up for a Preserver of the Nation. Of course the irony, the immodesty of this tonal triumph is that its very modesty permits no disagreement Given the terms propensity for elusive ironies, perhaps it is time to establish definitions. MODEST. having or expressing a humble opinion of oneself or ones accomplishments or abilities. reserved or shy modest behaviour. not ostentatious or pretentious. not extreme or excessive, moderate C16 via Old French from Latin modestus moderate, from modus MODE. There was never any doubt about that, was there What I find more suggestive is that in my admittedly thirtyyearold edition of the Shorter Oxford Dictionary modesty comes insistently between the hyperbolic modernise and the undemonstrative modicum. Which seems just the right place for it. The argument between modesty and immodesty seems at times an argument between simplicity and complexity, allowing that we are talking about a deceptive simplicity. As a university teacher, I cannot help feeling that certain pedagogic situations which are regrettably reasserting their institutional dominance under current constraints favour the immodest and the complex, not merely as a performative mode but as an analytic mode. The large lecture privileges analyses of the Byzantine complexities of immodest texts the small tutorial a situation which is being eroded where it is not dying favours intimate investigations of textual minutiae. Contrastive example it is structurally easier, if not more appropriate, to address a large lecture theatre on the complexities of Ulysses, while it is structurally more decorous to discuss in a small tutorial to have the students by indirection find direction out isnt that what education means the function of the napkin ring which falls from the table at the conclusion of the disastrous Christmas dinner in A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. One might, indeed, trace a history of modernist modestysimplicity immodestycomplexity in Joyces paradigmatic career from the Lyric in both poetry and prose Chamber Music and Dubliners to the Epic Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. He himself articulated had Stephen Dedalus articulate the distinction between lyric, epic and dramatic in the final section of Portrait. Perhaps Aaron Copland had in mind some similar notions of the appeal of the complex to criticism, pedagogy, and hermeneutics at large when he observed, correctly or incorrectly, of Weberns music One gains the impression that it is not the music before which the commentators are lost in admiration so much as the way in which it lends itself to detailed analysis. And yet many would find Weberns music distinguished by its modesty. Thus modest art may provoke anything but modest criticism. With regard to modesty, the dictionary spoke of reserved or shy. modest behaviour . While it is not central to my purpose this is essentially a set of variations upon the modestyimmodesty of literature or, if you prefer the more modest current parlance, of texts to consider modesty in its anthropological and psychological aspects, it might seem in the undying words of Lady Bracknell like carelessness to ignore this dimension completely. In Civilization and Its Discontents 1930, Freud links modesty and shame, seeing these qualities as repressions indicative of the price paid for civilisation The fateful process of civilization would thus have set in with mans adoption of an erect posturedotted line This made his genitals, which were previously concealed, visible and in need of protection, and so provoked feelings of shame in him. In The Civilizing Process 1939, Norbert Elias catalogues displacements down the ages of this scene of urmodesty. One example, from the eighteenth century, must suffice It is strange abuse to make two people of different sex sleep in the same room. And if necessity demands it, you should make sure that the beds are apart, and that modesty does not suffer in any way from this commingling. Only extreme indigence can excuse this practicedotted lineIf you are forced to share a bed with a person of the same sex, which seldom happens, you should maintain a strict and vigilant modesty. La Salle, Les Regravegles de la bienseacuteance et de la civiliteacute chreacutetienne Implicit in both Freuds and Eliass accounts of the civilising process is the principle freedom implies constraint. This principle underscores both the moeurs represented in the modern short story a central concern of this essay and the strategies of the short story as a modest mode. Before turning to the modesty of the short story and the lyric, it might be chastening to consider the observations of Italo Calvino the most modest of postmodernists on the essential immodesty of literatures aspirations Over ambitious projects may be objectionable in many fields, but not in literature. Literature remains alive only if we set ourselves immeasurable goals, far beyond all hope of achievement...Since science has begun to distrust general explanations and solutions that are not sectorial or specialised, the grand challenge for literature is to be capable of weaving together the various branches of knowledge, the various codes, into a manifold and multifaceted vision of the world. Six Memos for the Next Millenium Multiplicity, written 1985, published posthumously 1988 I presume to think that Calvino had the totality of literature in mind when he recommended such lack of restriction if not of restraint. For some genres are less restrained than others. The novel is by nature immodest. Consider Tolstoys apocryphal ejaculation at the dinner table, War and Peace firmly locked into its frames at the printer Ive left out the yacht race . The short story does not share these encyclopaedic aspirations. And yet such is literatures multiplicity that Tolstoy could admire Chekhovs short stories though not his plays and love the man. Tolstoy told Gorki What a beautiful, magnificent man modest and quiet, like a girl. If short fiction, if brief, fragmented texts Fragments are the only forms I trust characterise the postmodern era, if Australia experienced an efflorescence and possible dominance of the short story in the 1980s, then where does this fit in literatureatlarges essential immodesty We may find in Samuel Becketts postmodern minimalism and irony a sort of terminal modesty modesty as eschatological understatement modesty rhetorically figured as litotes etymology frugality, as meiosis lessening. Literature may well be passing through a modest phase. Witness Beckett, Calvino, Donald Barthelme. After all, some postmodern Puttenham might redefine irony as a sort of immodest modesty modest immodesty . The ironic, minimalist modesties of the late Donald Barthelme like Beckett and Calvino and Carver, he too died in the last few years characterise the postmodern era The death of God left the angels in a strange position. They were overtaken suddenly by a fundamental question. One can attempt to imagine the moment. How did they look at the instant the question invaded them, flooding the angelic consciousness, taking hold with terrifying force The question was, What are angels. New to questioning, unaccustomed to terror, unskilled in aloneness, the angels we assume fell into despair. And speaking of falls, fortunate or otherwise, into being or elsewhere, there fell from this page of my copy of Barthelmes City Life 1970 an index card inscribed in my own hand KIERKEGAARD Marie often used to read me from the Bible. It must be difficult to believe all that. Later on I even read Kierkegaard useful reading for an aspiring clown, it was difficult, but not exhausting. Heinrich Boll, The Clown I can no longer find the file of which that card was a member. If I remember correctly, it was an Irony file. Yet another projected book Surely the essay, he comforted himself, was the discursive postmodern project par excellence, rejecting the false totalisations of the book, no less than the short story rejects the false totalisations of the novel, no less than the clown is the postmodern persona par excellence, modesty rejecting the blandishments of the ubermensch. Such selfserving aside, there can be no question that Barthelmes fragments represent the spirit of the age, while the Novel, as represented by the ages scourge, the great essayist Gore Vidal, signifies in, say Lincoln not so much the muchbruited death of the novel , as its petrification into a loose, baggydotted linebehemoth. The age demandeddotted line a new modesty. Consider the unfailing modesty of the lyric. Emily Dickinson modest and quiet, like a girl Oh really, Count offers a splendidly contrastive example to her contemporary Walt Whitmans barbaric yawp , to the sheer expansiveness of his epic urge. For her, everything is infinitely contractible. Being, Motion and Time become A Route of Evanescence With a revolving Wheel A Resonance of Emerald A Rush of Cochineal And every Blossom on the Bush Adjusts its tumbled Head The mail from Tunis, probably, An easy Mornings Ride And who in her heart of hearts, prefers the expansive, epic, novelistic Dr Williams of Paterson to the W.C.W. of this so much depends upon a real wheel barrow glazed with rain water beside the white chickens. Or prefers the albeit consciously hyperbolic, polymorphous, agglomerative Frank OHara of Second Avenue and In Memory of My Feelings to the OHara of the Lunch Poems, particularly the OHara of It is 1220 in New York on a Friday three days after Bastille Day, yes it is 1959 and I go get a shoeshine because I will get off the 419 in Easthampton at 715 and then go straight to dinner dotted line and I am sweating a lot by now and thinking of leaning on the john door in the 5 SPOT while she whispered a song along the keyboard to Mal Waldron and everyone and I stopped breathing Nearer to home, the sometimes blitzkrieg gestures of the Generation of 68 have led to the undervaluing of a certain quieter, less demonstrative, lyric impulse The sadness in the human visage stares out of these frames, out of these distant eyes the static bodies painted without love that only lack of talent could disguise. dotted line History has made artists of all these painters who lack energy and feature. But how some gazes cling. Around the hall the pathos of the past, the human creature. Vivian Smith, At an Exhibition of Historical Paintings, Hobart. If the age demanded Pounds epic, it demanded Marianne Moores lyric no less. Moore celebrated Pounds craft and learning, while lamenting his phallocentrism. She, of course, is the quintessentially modest poet see her two versions of Poetry, the poet who perhaps best understood the necessity of modesty. Note how, typically, she begins her definition with a hypothetical. Modesty prefers the subjunctive TO A SNAIL If compression is the first grace of style, you have it. Contractility is a virtue as modesty is a virtue. It is not the acquisition of any one thing that it is able to adorn, or the incidental quality that occurs as a concomitant of something well said, that we value in style, but the principle that is hid in the absence of feet, a method of conclusions a knowledge of principles, in the curious phenomenon of your occipital horn. Even her note to this poem is, by her own standards, modest Line 1 The very first grace of style is that which comes from compression. Demetrius on Style, translated by W.Hamilton Fyfe Heinemann 1932. Amen. And note that attribution is the mark of the modest. Could she have had Pound, the epic and the novel or certain novels in mind when she addressed a poem TO A STEAM ROLLER The illustration is nothing to you without the application. You lack half wit. You crush all the particles down into close conformity, and then walk back and forth on them. Modesty, particularly modesty experienced as humility, plays a significant formal role in the Christian lyric. It also plays a crucial dramatic role in the Christian novel in Dostoyevskys steamrollers, for example. But this is not the same thing. Eschatologically understood, formal modesty is one with plain speaking Who sayes that fictions onely and false hair Become a verse Is there in truth no beautie Is all good structure in a winding stair dotted line I envie no mans nightingale or spring Nor let them punish me with losse of rime, Who plainly say, My God, My King. That selfabasement is perhaps paradoxically its own poetic disproof, though not its own disproof as poetry. Yet George Herbert could affect the metaphysics with the best of them. The modesty of this anagram and the mere couplet explicating it somehow compound the outrageousness of the conceit. MARY Ana gram ARMY How well her name an Army doth present, In whom the Lord of Hosts did pitch his tent The short story rarely achieves such brevity and density. Is this why Octavio Paz claims that the poet sets his matter free. The prose writer imprisons his Quoted in Beverley Farmers A Body of Water. Calvino hoped to edit an anthology of tales consisting of one sentence only, to rival Borgess and Bioy Casaress Cuentes breves y extraordinarios 1955, but could not find any to match the one by the Guatemalan writer Augusto Monterroso Cuando desperto, el dinosauro todavia estaba alli. When I woke up, the dinosaur was still there. There is, admittedly, a North American anthology titled Sudden Fiction American ShortShort Stories eds Shapard Thomas, 1986 but, as some of these are four pages long, they are no match for the Monterroso. In his preference for short literary forms Calvino was following the true vocation of Italian literature, which is poor in novelists but rich in poets in his admiration of Borges, he underscores the merits of a sort of metaphysical cum metatextual modesty Borges achieves his approaches to the infinite without the least congestion, in the most crystalline, sober, and airy style. Calvino himself dreams of immense cosmologies, sagas, and epics all reduced to the dimensions of an epigram . Perhaps because of that true vocation of Italian literature Italo Calvino may have been so fortunate as to escape the deep prejudice against short fictions against modesty that characterises other cultures.

You cannot fail to recognise the unexamined prejudice little more than a novella, really . Henry James and Anton Chekhov would have recognised it, as would Helen Garner. Such an unexamined prejudice surfaced locally in the notorious, and notoriously philistine, Letter from Mt. Isa, for whose philistinism rumours of irony will not serve as a defence What I would really like to write about says our pseudonymous correspondent, unconsciously surely echoing Flaubert, whose works would be anathema to him and vice versa are the important issues in our society today. I would like to write about police and political corruption, about the destruction of the environment, about the power of the media and big business, about how the share market is manipulated, and so ondotted line The two most important pieces of new Australian writing I have experienced since I came to this country were both on television. One was called The Dismissal and the other was called Scales of Justice. Curious how this anticipates Tom Wolfes no less specious Stalking the BillionFooted Beast Harpers, November 1989. Which is not for a moment to deny the pleasures or importance of such works of fiction as Bonfire of the Vanities or The Dismissal or Scales of Justice rather it is to condemn the utter unnecessity of celebrating their undoubted virtues by denigrating Robert Coover or Frederick Barthelme as Wolfe does or, more egregiously, a generation of Australian fiction writers as the persona from Mt Isa does without having the courage to name them, or, more importantly, to subject their works to analysis."

        "text": "MATT KELLY Tut. S.Firth 9226319 Due 29494 extension granted. Topic IS AUSTRALIA TOO EAGER TO PLEASE INDONESIA The potential of attack from the north has been, since British settlement, the greatest fear of Australia as a nation. A feeling of geographic and political isolation has indeed been reflected in both popular sentiment and official Foreign Affairs and Defence policies. Indonesia has simply become the next in a long line of potentially aggressive northern raiders, that has passed through every large power on the globe. It is justified that Indonesia, a nation only after the end of the Second World War signalling the end of Dutch colonialism has become a regional power and as such is treated with such a magnitude of caution, if not respect. In looking at the official policy of the Department of Foreign Affairs and taking this structural framework in applying it to Indonesian actions in the South Pacific, I propose that Australia is looking to the goal it has always aspired to regional security.1 Looking now away from great and powerful friends but to regional alliance and cooperation and as such must include Indonesia. Australia is definitely attempting to please Indonesia, due to Indonesias crucial position in the region. The role though of any government and indeed its priority must be to protect its nationals and therefore Australia, by this definition, cannot be described as being too eager to please Indonesia. Security, or more correctly, the fear of invasion or incursion from the north has always been the factor exercising a condition effect upon Australias external outlook, virtually since the British began to colonise the continent some 200 years ago.2 As the Pacific, and in particular the Indonesian islands are Australias closest neighbours, then attack is perceived to either come through Indonesia or directly from it. The latter was not a serious concern before the Second World War and Indonesian independence, strongly supported by the Chifley Labor government. Instead Australia feared China, the sleeping giant of Asia and then the eventually justified yellow peril of Japan and was one of the most compelling arguments for the federation of the former seperate British colonies, in Australia in 3 Seemingly with a diverse cultural and political background and perceiving herself as being a bastion of Europe in Asia,4 Australia has feared Asian invasion more than any other. Although this is understandable, considering the isolated geopolitical position that Australia finds herself in. Australias reliance on socalled Great and Powerful friends,5 continued up to the present day but heavily to 1965, was not solidly founded. While being powerful, militarily and politically, globally they are not countries of the South Pacific and as such are not generally greatly concerned by its events. As a result alliance with these powers has left Australia in a hopeless position of isolation, in a country that is virtually indefenceable with an army volunteered from a total population of seventeen million. It is this Xenophobia of being attacked in an isolated and virtually defenceless position that has been the basis of Australian foreign policy that has seemingly been given no other viable options that a available in the present era.6 When the Indonesian republic was declared in December 1949, Australia had already been thinking about the possible scenario of the Indonesians, a hundred million or so just up there, potential friends, potential enemies.7 It seemed that with the coming to power of the Indonesian Communist Party PKI in a new Cold War framework that Australian Foreign Affairs and Defence policy nightmares were coming true in the most threatening fashion. In an era that was like no other the whole globe was divided into blocs, especially true just after the end of the Second World War, either East or West and there was no conceiveable means for bilateral action between members on opposing sides. This was especially the case with a conservative government, under Menzies that had come to power on the wave of the US, virtually forcing the Chifley Labor government from office due to a large extent the equality, nonprotagonist but suspected communist views of Foreign Minister, Dr Evatt.8 Indonesia therefore posed a severe strategic problem on the heavily US sponsored Conservative Australia in the South Pacific. With the disposition of the PKI and its leader Sukarno, by the right wing military government of Suharto in 1965, did not ease the anxiety that Australian policy makers were faced with in dealing with such a massive regional player, that had been feared for sometime, with the backing of the US. Due to the size of Indonesia and its geographic position that connects, for all intentsandpurposes, the North and South Pacific, the US would move to keep her new ally happy in the face of Soviet expansion, seemingly rampant in South East Asia. The US in following such a policy towards Indonesia would logically make moves to ensure that any allies of the US would allow this country a free reign. This was considered by Foreign Affairs and Defence as being a potentially horrendus event in the stability of the region. Shortly before Suharto came to power, the PKI government began programmes to expand their territory seen in the wars against Malaysia and Singapore, the Confrontation9 and made moves to incorporate West Papua. Although it was such actions that were to put the guard of Foreign Affairs and Defence up it was these very incidents that were to start Australian Indonesian relations. While I shall deal with these two issue later in this essay, it is essential to the overall question to explore the origins and nature of AustralianIndonesian relations and to what extent, if any, that they have changed. Changed fundamentally in a manner that can be observed as attempting, beyond what is necessary to please Indonesia. Under conservative leadership, the view existed that Australia, while wary of Indonesian movements in the region, had the power to impose its will on its Third World neighbour. To build amicable relations with South East Asia in this period was a direction that was not seriously considered, with Australia almost holding contempt for the region in the 1950s60s.10 The fear of Indonesia was definitely evident in the Defence spendature of the 1960s that purchased F111s the department had specifically in mind their strike range that was capable of reaching Indonesia.11 Nancy Viviani explains the myths that, survived from that aggressive foreign policy era, of Australias success in having significant impact on Indonesian policy and outcomes.12 Viviani quite quickly dispells the theories of the Menzies era as being, if implementated in modern times, negative to AustralianIndonesian relations and potentially dangerous. The Whitlam period, and following him Malcolm Fraser on becoming Prime Minister in 1975, was the first to realise the real power and strategic position Indonesian action should be tolerated, to maintain AustralianIndonesian relations at all costs. This was extremely pleasing to the Department of Foreign Affairs who had recognized this fact for a long time, whose official approach stated The maintenance of the bilateral relationship is the paramount consideration in policy even when Australian and Indonesian interests are in direct conflict.13 Such a policy was quite obviously referring tuo areas of public and political concern in Australia in the period, 19725 and beyond, namely West Papua and East Timor. It was in this period that Australian Foreign Affairs and Defence, seemingly to a lesser extent, realized that such a large ally to the US in the context of continuing USSoviet Cold War, was of greater concern to the US over Indonesian neocolonialism and alleged human rights abuses. Under no circumstances could the pospect of Australias largest ally, the US, acting against Indonesian action while it remained anticommunist under Suharto, in such a vital area as South East Asia is nothing less than being naieve to US Cold War foreign policy. Similarly it is to know nothing of Australian policy in regards to its belief in great and powerful friends that US policy in such an important issue would be ignored. Whitlams US friendly policy in regards to Indonesian actions, and to not recognize human rights abuses, reflected all astute advice within the bureaucracy.14 The next major occurrence in Australian foreign policy came with the third Hawke ministry of With the departure of Foreign Affairs Minister Bill Hayden, who became Governor General, came Senator Gareth Evans to the newly amalgamated portfolios of Foreign Affairs and Trade DFAT. Evans and DFAT exploded onto the scene, with a strong and allegedly new approach to Australias self perceived, traditional geopolitical isolation in the South Pacific. The actual content of the Evans policy is not that different from that of his predecessors, but had made a definite attempt to impose a coherent intellectual framework on Australian foreign policy.15 I say has made an attempt because the current DFAT experiment under Senator Evans is one that has not finished. DFAT during Evanss time as minister has publically issued concrete policy which has formally recognized what had been occurring in foreign affairs and security issues for over a decade. The official policy of Comprehensive Engagement, released in 1988, was the first to formally recognize Australia as being a part of the region in which it was located.16 The geographical fact that Australia was in South East Asia called for the fact that every attempt should be made for Australia to move into this area. This meant moving into close alliance with the Association of South East Asian Nations ASEAN and as such moving closer to the Associations largest and most influential power Indonesia. Developing closer links to the region can only be beneficial because it both reduces distrust and tension and brings about concrete achievements, additionally it will help ease the reality of Australia being literally locked out of the region.17 The fact that ASEAN works to the exclusion of Australia is one that the Australian government cannot scoff at, as was the case in the 1950s and 60s. Australia is definitely recognized as being of minimal importance to the region in the modern world, that as Nancy Viviani sees as being something that official policy falsely and dangerously was based upon in dealing with South East Asia. Reinforcing Comprehensive Engagement in Australias dealing with South East Asia is the Ministerial Statement onAustralias Regional Security, released in 1989, that called on Australias security interests to be promoted in the South Pacific.18 The political euphemism for this strategy, backingup the 1988 release is Constructive Commitment and Evans promises the public that this is similarly a revolutionary peice of foreign affairs. In both statements Evans looks to a changing world in the postCold War era, that looks away from the protective wing of great and powerful friends, but instead looks to regional cooperation. This cooperation moved away from being solely defence driven as in the past but to a multimensional approach.21 To go past strictly military capabilitiesdotted linethat will embrace diplomacy, economic and trade relations, as well as aid immigration, education and cultural relations20 The concepts of multidimensionalism and regional cooperation while not being new, are clearly masked with political rhetoric that attempts to sell ideas to the voting public, that date back to the Chifley administration of the 1940s and the Foreign Minister Dr Evatt.22 While the players have changed in priority for regional security, from ANZUS to ASEAN, the objectives have not changed. Similarly a multidimensionalism security approach was introduced in 1976 by the Fraser government and was continued by the Hawke government of Evanss documents are not new, but can be seen as the continuation of a long tradition, marked by an adoption of the very strategies advocated in the constructive commitment docterine.22 It is important to acknowledge, before analysing the empirical evidence of Australias actions in South East Asian and more narrowly in regards to Indonesia, that Australian foreign policy objectives have changed very little, although approach has. Due to contraints of space I shall look a Indonesian actions in West Papua and East Timor and Australian Foreign Affairs Policy, as a micro examination of this relationship. In doing this I shall show that Australia has acted in a way forced upon herself by her geopolitical position, that has attempted to ensure regional and therefore Australias own security. Australia has dealt with Indonesia in a way that has allowed the nation continued, and scope for improved viability in the region. This method has been to create Indonesianfriendly policy that can only protect the collective lives of Australians and the soverignty of the nation, that is paramount over any other concern in the region, or the globe, and is a fundamental for Australian Government."

        "text": "Child Support Scheme The Child Support Scheme aims to help custodial parents receive their maintenance regularly and on time. The Child Support Scheme was introduced in two stages and has different implications depending on the date of separation and the date of birth of each child. People receiving Social Security payments may be able to have their maintenance collected by the Child Support Agency which is part of the Australian Taxation Office or, under certain conditions, choose to collect maintenance privately. Stage 1 from 1 June 1988 Stage 1 applies to parents who separated before 1 October 1989 and who do not have a child born on or after that date. Parents may get a court order, register an agreement in court or make private arrangements to receive maintenance. Stage 1 of the Scheme also allows custodians who have court orders or court registered agreements dated before 1 June 1988 to apply for collection with the Child Support Agency. Social Security clients who are not already registered for collection with the agency may choose to collect their court order or court registered agreement privately. If the noncustodial parent stops paying the full amount privately at any time the custodian must apply to the Child Support Agency for collection of the maintenance. If the Agency collects the payments, Social Security clients cannot change to private collection at a later stage. Stage 2 from 1 October 1989 This stage applies to parents who separated on or after the 1 October 1989 or who have a child born on or after that date. Assessment of Child Support The person who has daily care of the child can apply to the Child Support Agency for an assessment of child support. The person does not have to be a parent of the child. The Agency uses a formula to calculate the amount of child support to be paid by using the income of the person who will pay child support in the following way The noncustodial parents taxable income Less an allowance for living expenses and for each natural or adopted dependent child living with the noncustodial parent Less the custodians excess income over average weekly earnings allowance is made for child care costs After making these deductions a percentage of the remaining income is paid as support. The percentage varies according to the number of children Number of children 1 2 3 4 5 or more Child support 18 27 32 34 36 The assessment is recalculated each year to allow for inflation and changes in income. If either parents income drops by at least 15, they can ask for a new assessment. The formula can work differently in some cases e.g. where the custody of the child is shared between parents or, from 1 July 1993, if the noncustodial parent has substantial access. Child Support Review Officers If either party is dissatisfied with an assessment they may seek an independent review by a Child Support Agency Review Officer. Applications are free and do not involve legal representation. If the matter is not resolved by a Child Support Review Officer either party may appeal to the Family Court. Child Support and Social Security Clients Stage 2 Social Security clients must apply to the Child Support Agency for an assessment unless they are exempt from seeking child support. They can make arrangements with the noncustodial parent for private payment of child support or have payments collected by the Agency. Before 1 July 1992 assessments had to be collected by the Agency. Where a Social Security client collects payments privately they must collect the full amount assessed by the Agency. If the noncustodial parent stops paying the full amount privately at any time the custodian must apply to the Child Support Agency for collection of the maintenance. If the Child Support Agency collects the payments, Social Security clients cannot change to private collection at a later stage. Certain Social Security payments may not be granted or continued to a custodian who has not taken adequate steps to obtain maintenance. However, there are reasons why a custodian may not have to take steps to obtain maintenance. Social work staff will assist clients who have problems with claiming maintenance. Child Support and nonSocial Security Clients If the custodian is not a Social Security client and can agree with the other parent on an amount of child support, neither the Child Support Agency nor the courts need be involved. However, registering the agreement with the Agency as a child support agreement does provide safeguards. In these cases, the Agency can collect the payments if the parties wish. Maintenance Collection Maintenance is paid to the Child Support Agency or directly to the custodian. When maintenance is paid through the Agency the liability may be deducted from the noncustodial parents wage or salary together with their tax or paid directly to the Agency. sHow is Agency Maintenance Paid Social Security arranges for payments which come through the Child Support Agency to go into the custodians bank, building society or credit union account. Provided that the noncustodial parent makes payments on time, the custodian will be able to receive child support payments on the third Wednesday of each month. If the noncustodial parent pays later in the month then the custodian may receive that child support payment on the first Wednesday of the next month. Maintenance Income Test Maintenance can affect Additional Family Payment if the amount received is higher than the maintenance income free area i.e. the amount of child support a Social Security client may receive before their payment starts to be reduced. Concession Cards and Child Support Social Security custodians with concession cards are able to apply for a duplicate card to give to the noncustodial parent to use for the children during access visits. To protect the custodians privacy, the duplicate card will not have any of the custodians details on it. It will only cover the children and not the noncustodial parent. CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE Child Care Assistance is a scheme to help low and middle income families with child care fees. Child care centres and family day care schemes approved under the Childrens Services program administered by the Department of Human Services and Health can offer reduced fees according to family income, the number of children in child care and the number of children in the family. Social Security assesses the income of applicants for Child Care Assistance and works out the percentage of fee relief to which each client is entitled. Application forms are available from child care services and Social Security. When an application is lodged at a Social Security office it should be accompanied by papers which provide proof of income. Social Security treats the details on the form as confidential, but provides the child care service with the childrens names and the percentage, so services can work out the fees for child care. Social Security is not directly involved in assistance for Occasional or Outside School Hours care. However, assistance for these types of care is based on the clients Family Payment status. The client should take the annual Family Payment advice which is sent in January to the child care service who will work out if the client can get assistance. More details about the scheme can be obtained from child care services or the Department of Human Services and Health. CHAPTER EIGHT Rights and Appeals Reviews and appeals Freedom of Information Social Security Appeals Tribunal Commonwealth Ombudsman Administrative Appeals Tribunal Privacy of Information Reviews and appeals Where a person is affected by a decision made about their Social Security entitlement, there are several steps they can take. They should first discuss the matter at the local regional office with the person who made the original decision. If, after this, they are still unhappy with the decision, they can request a review by an Authorised Review Officer at the area office. If they are unhappy with the decision of the Authorised Review Officer, they can apply to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal SSAT for a review. It is important to understand that the SSAT is able to look at a decision only if that decision has been reviewed by an Authorised Review Officer. If they are unhappy with the SSAT decision, they can have a review of the SSAT decision by applying to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal AAT. A request for a review of a decision should be made within 3 months of receiving advice of the original decision. This is because if the review is decided in the persons favour, arrears may only be paid if the request is lodged within this 3 month period. Requesting a review The first step in the review process requires the person who made the original decision to explain the disputed decision. This provides the opportunity to correct misunderstandings, present new information or evidence and to get an incorrect decision changed immediately. If the original decision is not changed, the person will be advised to discuss the matter with an Authorised Review Officer and of their right of appeal to the SSAT should they be unhappy with the decision of the Authorised Review Officer. Authorised Review Officer Authorised Review Officers are senior, expert staff located in area offices who work independently of the regional offices and look at disputed decisions. They may set aside a decision and substitute a new one, vary or affirm a decision. The Authorised Review Officer will bullet look at the information used by the person who made the original decision bullet where possible, talk to the person seeking review by phone to discuss the matter bullet check whether any new, relevant information is available bullet clear up any misunderstandings bullet correct any mistakes that were made bullet reconsider the original decision and bullet inform the person of the result in a letter explaining the reasons for the decision. Following the review by the Authorised Review Officer, if the person still believes that the decision is incorrect, they can then appeal to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal SSAT. However, it should be noted that the SSAT is only able to look at a decision if that decision has been reviewed by an Authorised Review Officer. Social Security Appeals Tribunal SSAT The Social Security Appeals Tribunal SSAT is an independent statutory authority established as the first tier of external review of Social Security decisions. It aims to provide a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. When reviewing a Social Security decision, the SSAT may affirm, vary or set aside a decision of the Department. When it sets aside a decision, it substitutes a new decision or sends it back to the Department with directions or recommendations. The SSAT is able to review a decision only if that decision has been reviewed by an Authorised Review Officer How to appeal A person may apply to the SSAT for a review of a decision by sending or delivering a written application to an office of the Tribunal or any Social Security regional office or by telephoning the Tribunal. Appeal forms are available from any Social Security or SSAT office. The SSAT can be contacted in all states and territories by writing to GPO Box 9943 in your capital city, or by telephoning 008 011 140 008 041 514 in the ACT. Office addresses are listed in Appendix VIII of this book. Applications are free of charge. The SSAT can pay reasonable travel and accommodation costs of applicants and will provide an interpreter when needed. SSAT members are drawn from varied backgrounds, and include lawyers, social and community welfare workers, medical practitioners and members who have a background in Social Security matters. The Tribunal has offices in all capital cities and also visits various regional centres from time to time. Applications are heard by a panel of three members. In medical cases, a medical member is added to the panel. Hearings are conducted in an informal manner. They are not like a court and it is not necessary to bring a lawyer."

        "text": "Decriminalising drugs least worst WHETHER to decriminalise the use of cannabis must inevitably come down to a blunt choice between crime and health. It is bizarre indeed that in a nation where 20,000 or so people die each year as a result of smoking and another 2000 or so in road accidents, we can contemplate putting another carcinogen on the supermarket shelves and another mindaltering substance within reach of drivers. But do we have a choice While cannabis remains illegal and possession of even tiny amounts can result in a criminal conviction, the drug trade will remain demanddriven and deadly. There is a growing conviction among some criminologists that decriminalisation of the possession and use of small amounts of cannabis is the course which governments will reluctantly take sooner or later. Some argue that heavy drugs such as cocaine and heroin will probably end up being legal too, even if their prescription is tightly administered. US economist Milton Friedman has suggested that if drugs had been decriminalised years ago drugs such as the highlyaddictive and deadly crack might not have been developed. His argument is that new designer drugs, some capable of causing appalling physical and mental damage to this generation and mental damage to the unborn next generation, were manufactured primarily because the high price of illegal drugs created a demand for cheaper substitutes. Demand and supply ever since mankind first felt compelled to control substances which alter our perception of the world, it has argued too about whether the pushers are really being pushed. And since then society has argued too about whether people should be free to inhale, inject and ingest whatever they like. Wherever crusaders rail against drugs, subterranean markets have emerged to conduct the business of altering peoples brains. Prohibition doesnt work. It makes purchase and possession more difficult, but it doesnt stop drugtaking. The higher risks drive up prices and the profits to suppliers, but wreak their revenge on society through a much higher level of crime by users. Today, most housebreaking and robbery is committed by people seeking money for drugs. Dealing with this crime, and with the distortions and corruptions of the system by those who profit from it, has fundamentally altered the criminal justice balance in the community. The real arguments against legalising drugs are health ones. It is not only brains which become altered but lungs, livers, hearts, reflexes and powers of perception, some temporarily, some permanently. The dilemma for legislators is to weigh the medical costs of drugs including damage inflicted upon innocent family members and strangers against the cost of maintaining and enforcing prohibitions which everybody realises have not worked. We live in a society in which dangerous drugs can be smuggled into maximumsecurity prisons. What hope can we entertain that drugs can be kept out of schools, bars and dinner parties Noone likes to admit defeat, but obviously even the most spectacular of drug hauls barely mists the surface of the drug trade. The medical argument against decriminalisation of drugs, from cannabis to heroin, ecstasy and a pharmacists shelf full of other abused substances, is powerful. At a time when the medical profession has put debate about smoking and drinking back on the news pages, the courts and the parliament, political parties, including both the ALP and the Liberal Party in the ACT, toy periodically with the idea of loosening the controls on drug use. And how do they justify the apparent contradictions of banning smoking in public buildings with one hand and decriminalising another dangerous form of cigarette with the other They dont. They are only too aware of the comparisons, the double standards, the inconsistencies. They can only repeat the single unchallenged fact that prohibition has not worked. LEGISLATORS must make a decision about the direction drug enforcement will take. Australia can follow the path of the United States and press more and more futile time and money into enforcement, or it can divert a fraction of that money towards education and a fraction more towards the provision of controlled doses of clean drugs to addicts and legal cannabis to smokers. Earlier this year the Victoria Police issued figures of charges which followed the states Operation Noah, a dobadruggie dialin held annually in most states, including the ACT. Of the 676 charges to arise from the phonein, only one was related to the supply of heroin. Almost 600 involved marijuana and 413 were for possession or use. If society thinks that is money well spent, so be it. If, on the other hand it sees cannabis as a drug no better or worse than alcohol in its power to numb, and no better or worse than tobacco in its power to wreak physical havoc, perhaps it is more realistic to move towards decriminalisation, meanwhile educating Australians against the abuse of all drugs. Cocaine and heroin might have to wait for another day. Decriminalising drug use, particularly at the milder end of the scale, seems like the worst alternative except for everything else. Everything else has failed the decriminalisation path offers more chance of breaking some of the evil nexuses than anything else. Accompanied by some sustained attacks on drug demand, via education, it may even reduce the corruption of the supply end of the equation. Health outside inquiry needed THE Governments move to initiate an investigation into what amounts to a 57 million budget blowout within the Department of Health is a welcome response to a very serious problem. However the investigator should a completely independent outsider, with a brief to review the entire health operational and accounting systems. The Governments decision to put the investigatory role under the control of the head of the Department of Health, Education and the Arts, Dr Eric Willmot, overlooks the need for all scrutiny not only to be impartial but to be seen to be impartial. There can be no doubting Dr Willmots experience and impartiality, but the Government asks too much when it thrusts such a role on the head of the department under investigation. Such investigations are better handled by officers specifically operating outside the particular Government department under investigation and unlikely to be influenced by professional or personal relationships. Public perceptions can be fundamentally undermined when allegations, no matter how untrue, can be made of vested interest or partiality. The Department of Health has long been a problem area for the ACT with perennial cost overruns requiring additional funding and failures to meet political and management targets. A siege mentality and some secretiveness have also long been evident. The problems have also been highlighted, but little seems to have changed. Of particular concern should be the nonpayment of 5 million in accounts dating back to last financial year.This fact, confirmed by the Minister for Health, Gary Humphries, implies that a serious breach of accepted Government accounting practices may have occurred. It should have been picked up on audit. It probably should have been picked up by Treasury. The concern is not merely about a technical failure it may also have meant that tradesmen and other hospital creditors, many no doubt under particular economic pressure in the present climate, have not been having their bills paid on time. One is entitled to expect better of a government authority. The department is no longer just dealing with the daytoday running of hospitals and health services in the ACT.Today it is vitally involved in a multimilliondollar hospital redevelopment project the success or failure of which will dictate the quality of health care to ACT residents for decades to come. There can be no room for mistakes or sloppy management. Mr Humphries issued yesterday an assurance that the redevelopment budget was on track, but in all the circumstances more than just a ministerial reassurance is needed. What is needed is not simply a reassurance that an annual appropriation will not be exceeded, but that the project will deliver what was promised of it at the beginning. The budgetary status and viability of the hospital redevelopment should also be examined. ACT residents need not be assured that the health bureaucrats have got it right and that the budget blowout identified last week is not just the tip of the iceberg. There could be devastating consequences if the hospital redevelopment budget were allowed to get out of hand. The Chief Minister, Trevor Kaine, leapt to the defence of his public servants in the wake of criticism levelled at them by the AuditorGeneral last month, but he must not allow his views of their competency or otherwise stand in the way of a full examination of the financial status of what is arguably the most portfolio area and what is the Governments most expensive and complex capitalworks undertaking. As each week goes by the hospital redevelopment project involves the commitment of more and more funds and, as yet, the bottom line has still not been clearly drawn. A full examination of the projects continuing viability is warranted if only to reassure the public, politicians and bureaucrats that they are on the right track. The recurrent savings identified as likely to result from the development of one principal hospital and the closure of Royal Canberra Hospital North were not large about 8 million a year. This makes it even more crucial that the numbers upon which the redevelopment has been predicated are not fatally flawed. THE task of the investigator on examining what had been going wrong in the health department will not be easy. He might well find a distinct lack of cooperation from some quarters. Many significant reputations bureaucratic and medical are riding on the health budget and the success or failure of the redevelopment project. There are those who are pursuing the task with what amounts to a missionary zeal and who will brook no criticism or legitimate questions. Their enthusiasm for the project is laudable, but they should not allow their hopes and enthusiasms to colour their judgement of its viability. It in one thing for doctors to have the very best and the very latest in medical technology housed in grandiose buildings, it is another thing for ACT taxpayers to meet the inevitable cost. It was significant that Mr Humphries chose to point out yesterday that some of the budgetary problems arose during the term of the Interim Hospitals Board. That may be true, but as much as Mr Humphries has had to rely on his advisers, his predecessor controllers relied on the same people. A lot of things have changed but the hands at the steering wheel have been much the same throughout, With something obviously wrong in the management, can Mr Humphries be certain that everything else remains on track Europeans query extent of unity THERE is nothing like a serious war to make nations fumble nervously for their constitutions and sing a few bars of the national anthem. It is time for conservatism and inhibitions. It comes as no shock then to see Britain reiterating its dissatisfaction with plans to fasttrack some aspects of European economic unity, particularly those aspects which would see the dozen member nations surrender crucial controls over economic policy to the European Community. It is almost as if Europe is having second thoughts about unity, now that real life has given member nations a chance to show how solid and confident they can be in terms of foreign policy and defence policies. Simultaneously, a world recession nibbles, bringing into focus all the what ifs about monetary union, industrial reform, government spending and government debt. To make matters worse, questions have been generated in areas such as law and order, immigration, even family law, with plenty more to come. A report on divorce from Brussels earlier this month showed that as Europe knits itself into an increasingly homogenous community, laws will either have to catch up or risk becoming ludicrously obsolete. Could there come a time when the law will allow Irish farmers to market their produce on a single, obstaclefree market, but will refuse to recognise a divorce between an Irish farmer and a Dutch spouse"

        "text": "LAND USE AND DECLINING WATER QUALITY Introduction Water is essential to life. It is an iron constraint on farming, and where farmers cannot expect reasonable rainfall they will try to augment nature through irrigation. Excess water can be just as bad as insufficient, and so drainage schemes, often using natural wetlands, have become essential in some areas. Drainage water carries a variety of contaminants that cause real impacts on the aquatic ecosystems that receive them. Streams are the main waste removal mechanism for agricultural runoff and for agricultural and industrial processing wastes. Of even more significance is the role of natural waters in the transport and transformation of sewage effluent. Water is essential for the survival of country towns which depend on an adequate supply of reasonable quality water for domestic use. To these traditional uses of water we now need to add the pressure to sustain various instream values. These include the need to protect the biological integrity of the water resource, to enable fish to survive and other organisms like frogs, tortoises and platypus to survive in our already degraded waterways. Waterways now have to support recreation, tourism, fisheries and nature conservation values and continue to meet the traditional demands placed upon them. We now know that the quality of the water in a river or a storage reflects the quality of land management in the catchment. The best measure we can have for the success of Total Catchment Management is the quality of the water draining from a catchment. There is an essential, unavoidable and direct connection between a catchment and the quality of water coming from it. Many people believe that water quality in Australian streams, storages and coastal areas is getting worse. The media regularly carry stories about the unacceptable quality of rural town water supplies, the increasing outbreaks of toxic algal blooms in storages, fish kills, increased turbidity and contamination by agricultural chemicals. We often do not have sufficient data to show the deterioration of water quality from our monitoring programs, but this is often because of inadequacies in them. In the systems that have been studied it is common to find increasing sediment, increasing nutrients, increasing organic contaminants and various undesirable changes in the biology of the water as a result of these changes. Some of these problems are caused by acute incidents where there has been a spill or misuse of some chemical. These incidents need to be minimised by more fool proof systems, better training of operators and better policing by regulatory agencies. These are obvious steps to reduce very obvious problems, and will not be further discussed in this article. The effects of normal agricultural and grazing practices on water quality are also important. Farmers know all too well the importance of nutrients like phosphorus to their agricultural production. Aquatic ecosystems, just like farmlands, are driven by nutrients. The phosphorus coming from land runoff has been shown to increase production in waterways markedly. Some increase in production can be tolerated, but aquatic ecosystems are effective at conserving nutrients, and if excess fertiliser enters waterways, then a new and much less desirable aquatic ecosystem results. Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra is a good example of the sort of changes that can take place in aquatic ecosystems. The lake has always had reasonably high nutrient levels due to sewage effluent from the upstream town of Queanbeyan. Lake Burley Griffin was productive from when it first filled and rapidly supported extensive growths of water weeds. These dominated the lake for its first 18 years. They were a moderate nuisance and were controlled by using an aquatic weed cutter. In the late 70s and early 80s the lake changed. The water weeds died out and were replaced by blooms of algae. The algae that appeared were the toxic bluegreen algae cyanobacteria which have been responsible for stock deaths in many parts of Australia. From time to time the lake was closed for swimming because of concerns that human health could be at risk. This switch from water weeds to toxic algae surprised many people, because thee was nothing obvious that had changed to cause the switch. It just happened over a period of three to four years without any dramatic changes in land use or land management in the catchment. This is a response to chronic pollution where waste discharges and runoff over time eventually overcome the assimilative capacity of the aquatic ecosystem and cause degradation. An aquatic ecosystem can often handle stress for some time without any very obvious or undesirable symptoms, but then suddenly collapses and a new and less desirable ecosystem emerges. The switching from one ecosystem to another is not necessarily because of some extra stress, but is due to the cumulative stress over time finally overcoming the lakes ability to maintain itself as a macrophyte water weed system. Understanding and being able to predict this switching from one ecosystem to another is a major current problem in ecology. There are many examples around Australia of significant degradation of waterways. In each case runoff from rural and urban lands, along with the discharge of effluents from sewage treatment works, abattoirs and intensive animal industries have been implicated in the problems. The Peel Inlet in Western Australia, Mt Bold in South Australia, Gippsland Lakes in Victoria, Hay Weir Pool and Carcoar Reservoirs in New South Wales and North Pine Dam in Queensland are all examples of water quality degradation because of catchment activities. These water bodies are contaminated by both point and nonpoint sources. Point sources like sewage treatment works, intensive animal feedlots and abattoirs are often the most evident source of contamination. Nonpoint or diffuse sources refer to the contaminants carried in the runoff from land surfaces. They are often less obvious than point sources, since they are much more variable. Contamination comes following runoff. But overall, the nonpoint sources may be very significant in their impact on water quality. It may be essential to attack nonpoint sources if we are to have sustainable water resources. Measuring NonPoint Loads When rain runs off land it transports both dissolved and particulate materials to receiving water bodies. Much of the material transported in runoff water is particulate, comprising soil particles, fertiliser particles, plant material and animal excreta. Some is in the dissolved form, and nutrients are important here. These materials exported from farmland must be seen as a loss of a productive asset by the farmer. Some of the materials lost have been put there at considerable cost to improve productivity. It makes no sense to a farmer to have expensive fertiliser and important organic matter washed down the drain. On top of these costs, the serious degradation they cause to the stream ecosystems by destroying fish and other recreational opportunities must be addressed. When considering how to measure nonpoint sources it is obvious that they operate mainly when rain is falling and runoff is being generated. The rain and runoff provide the energy that detaches and transports particles. This means that receiving waters are subject to intermittent pulses of contaminants. You can only predict these pulses to the extent that you can predict rainfall. The contaminants of importance are bullet Phosphorus and nitrogen, coming from fertiliser and animal excreta and promoting plant growth in the receiving waters. bullet Sediment, coming from soil erosion and causing turbidity in the receiving waters. bullet Organic matter, from plant material and animal wastes which, as they break down, can lead to a loss of oxygen in the receiving waters. bullet Agricultural chemicals, and their breakdown products, that can affect biota in a variety of ways. Microbial contaminants, from sewage and animal wastes, that might cause infection to users of the water. bullet Heavy metals, from road runoff that includes lead in petrol, material from tyres and from other sources. In comparing point and nonpoint pollutants there are three important differences that must be considered bullet Nonpoint sources are intermittent, while point sources often flow almost continuously. bullet Extreme runoff events transport huge amounts of contaminants to the receiving waters. An event like a one in 10 year flood may be more important than all the smaller events combined. bullet Nonpoint nutrients are generally in the particulate form and may be less available to promote plant growth than the soluble nutrients in sewage effluent. When thinking about the contaminants that enter a receiving water it is important to think of loads not concentrations. It is possible to have a high concentration but if the amount of water involved is low, the amount or mass of contaminant is low. It may not matter. Load is calculated by multiplying the volume of water in say cubic metres by the concentration in mgm3 and may be expressed as kgyr or as kghayr. To calculate loads, measurements of concentration need to be multiplied by a volume measurement. Since flow volume is measured continuously at stream gauging stations it is necessary to estimate how many measurements of concentration are needed to get a reasonable estimate of load. Since export of contaminants takes place during runoff events, sampling needs to be based on flow, not time. There is not much point taking a lot of concentration measurements during low, dry weather flow periods. The concentrations will not vary much the loads themselves will be minor in comparison with what is moving during high flow events. When using automatic samplers, decisions need to be made concerning at what stage or water height the sampler will be activated and what interval is appropriate for sample collection at each station. Practical considerations such as the number of sample bottles that can be accumulated before they need changing, and the staff resources to get to sampling stations during events need to be considered. The tradeoff between reliability of load estimates versus the cost of sample collection, transport and analysis is a critical issue. In studies of Lake Burley Griffin it was shown that flood events were responsible for transporting 69 per cent of the phosphorus, although they only occupied nine per cent of the study period Cullen and Rosich, 1979. The importance of high flow events is even more apparent from Table 1, showing some data on phosphorus exports found in the Monkey Creek study done by the Water Research Centre at the University of Canberra and the Sydney Water Board. It shows the total phosphorus coming off the catchment over the entire study, and the amount of phosphorus that came off in selected high flow events. These results show that 61 per cent of the phosphorus and 41 per cent of of the water moved down Monkey Creek moved in one per cent of the time during the study. Had these three days of high flows not been measured, then the export would have been underestimated by 60 per cent. This table shows some of the great difficulties in measuring nonpoint contamination. Measurements of pollutant exports are very expensive since facilities to collect and analyse large numbers of samples must be maintained for when the high runoff event happens. This requires a capability to get staff into the field within a few hours of the runoff starting, if automatic data collection devices are to be kept operational. The costs of these studies should not be underestimated. It is important to collect data from a range of runoff events. Since it is important to measure exports under flood conditions it may be necessary to collect data for several years to catch such high flow events. The Monkey Creek study was funded by the Australian Water Research Advisory Council, the Sydney Water Board and the University of Canberra. It cost around 350 000 for one year of data if the costs of stream gauging, sample collection, chemical analysis and numerical analysis are included. The Impacts of Variable NonPoint Pollutant Loads on Reservoirs There is a problem as to how we should think about these very occasional but very large flows. Some might think they happen so infrequently that they can be ignored. This is not true."

        "text": "Waterfront strike a threat to all THE wildcat strike by the Maritime Union of Australia, which has frozen all of Australias international shipping trade, smacks of selfishness and irresponsibility. The reckless action by the MUA which has stopped cargo getting into or out of ports is an international embarrassment which needs to be concluded as quickly as it began. Within 10 minutes of the union discovering last week that the Federal Government was proposing to sell off its 25 per cent share of Australian Stevedores, Australias 3000 waterfront workers walked out, sparking the biggest wildcat strike in years. By midday Thursday, all ports were shut, 500 million in cargo is stranded and more than 160 ships stand idle at sea. The strike has cost 55 million and another 9 million is lost each day it is allowed to continue. The economic fallout is worse than the daily cost of stranded ships and cargo, with business leaders claiming it enforces the view that Australias ports remain an industrial nightmare despite promising reforms. Not since 1956, when waterside workers went on a 23day strike over work practices and hiring, has the nations ocean transport industry been so devastated by a dispute. The MUA members response to the Governments decision was too quick and too extreme. The most disturbing aspect is that union boss John Coombs told the Industrial Relations Commission on Friday the strike was a political protest and not an industrial dispute. Just as Australia was beginning to haul itself out of the depths of recession, with the economy showing encouraging signs of recovery and positive job growth figures, the nation has been plunged back to the bad old days of industrial standover tactics. The MUAs actions are hampering Australias ability to compete internationally and disrupting the internal efficiency of the entire nation. The union members are effectively snubbing their noses at the people as a whole with the results of their actions reflected in higher prices, supermarket shelf shortages and increased costs to exporters. Todays delicate economic climate has no room for unions launching into strike action according to preordained battle plans. Conciliation is and must be the correct approach taken in these matters at all times. Australia cant afford the luxury of a union which decides to strike first and ask questions later. Union leaders will meet today with Prime Minister Paul Keating and Minister Laurie Brereton. We can only hope sanity will prevail and the union will see the error of its ways. Landmark decision for ALP THE Australian Labor Party yesterday made the biggest corporate change of its history by reserving 35 per cent of its parliamentary seats for women. In the process it argued that affirmative action is a valid and possibly essential system for any major organisation. Setting quotas for minority groups is a longaccepted equity measure. Setting quotas for a group which makes up more than 50 per cent of the population remains under debate the reason being that preference for women means an equal and opposite discrimination against men. The application of affirmative action depends on the function and conditions of the organisation, company or department and cannot be laid down as a requirement for all circumstances. It must be remembered that in itself, it guarantees a job and not the merit of the job holder its intent is to right a perceived injustice, not to improve a service or product. If used, it should be an adjunct to, rather than a replacement for, equality of opportunity and it guarantees that performance will win advancement, no matter the sex of the person involved. The ALP has decided it is suitable for its purposes, and no one can accuse the party of rushing its deliberations on the matter. It set itself the task of bringing balance to representation of the sexes in parliaments in 1979, and in the 15 years since, the idea has been put through every combination of assessment. Details of the proposal were rejected by the Right, embraced by the Left, refined by the Right and then questioned by the Left, and even has had its opponents among women. The partys final ruling is that increasing the number of elected women is a political plus, a matter of justice, and a factor which could improve the delivery of government. These are all sound reasons for change, and the Labor Party must be congratulated for establishing a groundbreaking policy and then smoothing the way through the thicket of objections and cautions to have it adopted. It is a landmark decision which will require the limits of factional cooperation to be successful. It also will require women to work to win preselection. The crucial test of the policy will be in the electorates. If voters believe they are being offered women candidates who have been given the right to stand as a gift, they will make their unhappiness know. If they believe they are being offered the best possible candidate, who has needed affirmative action to get through the party processes, they will signify approval in the ballot box. Telecom shows the way IN the context of the newly competitive telecommunications marketplace, Telecoms announcement yesterday of a record 7 billion net profit for 199394 is a remarkable achievement. While the result is reflective of lower corporate tax rates and of significant reductions in net interest expenses, Telecoms 6 per cent increase in revenues, struck in conjunction with a 5 per cent reduction in consumer prices, is indicative of outstanding business practice. Those are the key components of the result enhanced profits despite cheaper prices, leading to an improved dividend to the Commonwealth Government and hence, to the national economy. When indirect taxes are added to the equation, Telecoms total contribution to the Treasury for the year is in excess of 2 billion. Telecom also retained a sharp focus on improved capital efficiency, allocating 5 billion for new plant and equipment, most of which is sourced locally, during the year. Importantly, growth in operating costs was held carefully in check despite concerted pressure on the company for improvements across the spectrum of telecommunications services. As an example of freeenterprise excellence, the Telecom profit is an object lesson to the corporate community, and a valuable indication of the mutual advantages of wellrun companies. In this instance, the company and its employees have won through increased earnings the proprietors in this case the Federal Government has won through higher dividends and the customers have won through improved service at better prices. The result gives the lie to those who would have us believe that high levels of corporate profitability necessarily equate to a degree of exploitation of the customer. Our economy is driven by the incentive of profit. For it should be understood that competition in a deregulated free enterprise economy imposes a strict discipline of exemplary service on business operators which none can escape. In recognition of the need to maintain its competitive focus and to defend its influence in the marketplace, Telecom announced yesterday it will spend in excess of 710 million in three years laying fibreoptic and coaxial cable for the provision of paytelevision and other consumer electronic media. Withstanding fierce competitive pressures and devising strategies to maximise natural market advantages were the foundation stones on which Telecom constructed its record profit. Other firms would be wise to study the result and to work to follow the Telecom lead. Political quitters cheat voters FOR societies which value individual liberty, there is one unavoidable cost the cost of maintaining the democratic system of government. And most people who take freedom for granted do not begrudge the expense. Paying for the judiciary, paying politicians their considerable salaries, paying for the trappings of political office and paying for elections are accepted without question by the majority. But one cost stands out as a cynical outrage the cost of the endless string of whimsical byelections inflicted on a longsuffering electorate by MPs who have simply tired of the duties of their office. The latest to participate in this ignoble tradition is one who has admittedly served long and with undeniable distinction as an MP and one of whom better was expected the Federal Member for Kooyong, Andrew Peacock. On Wednesday, Mr Peacock declared his intention to resign his seat before the end of the year, thereby necessitating yet another federal byelection. Already in the life of this Parliament, there have been five byelections, all of them precipitated by nothing more serious than a disinclination on the part of the sitting Member to remain in the Parliament. In January, former Labor minister and onetime treasurer John Kerin departed to take up a spot as head of the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. In March, John Dawkins, another extreasurer, decided to call it a day, as did another former Labor minister Neal Blewett, who quit to take up the attractive posting of High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. In the same month, longserving Liberals Jim Carlton and Michael MacKellar decided theyd had enough. For each byelection, voters were left with a bill of more than 300,000, which adds up so far to a bill in excess of 5 million a figure which fails to take into account the advertising outlays of the major parties. By what right do MPs presume to put the public to this expense Having been chosen for the high office of a Member of Parliament, surely they are orally obliged, other than in the most exceptional circumstances, to see out their term. As he confirmed his decision to resign, Mr Peacock was reported yesterday as saying he didnt owe the Liberal Party anything, and that in turn, he was owed nothing by the party after all these years. But the people of Kooyong, who have remained fiercely loyal to Mr Peacock for 28 years, who endorsed him in 1993 as their Member until the next election, were owed something they were owed Mr Peacocks loyalty in return. Planning is key to urban culture FOR historical and geographical reasons, the demographic configuration of Australia is fundamentally urban. Despite the image we cherish of ourselves as sunbronzed natives of the outback, we are in fact a race of citydwellers and two centuries of European occupation has seen that population trend firmly and permanently entrenched. For more than 200 years, new arrivals have clung together on the temperate coastal fringe. While there are thriving towns and cities at a distance from the capitals, the overwhelming bulk of our population in fact more than 10 million out of a population of 18 million is concentrated in the five major cities, of which Sydney is by far the largest. Against the background of that minimal interpretation of our populataion densities, it is not surprising the capital cities, Sydney most particularly, are surrounded by sprawling suburban areas creeping inexorably outward. Noted architect Philip Coxs condemnation of that essentially unplanned process needs to be understood in its proper context. On Monday, Mr Cox was critical of what he chose to describe as the feral nature of suburbia on Sydneys western outskirts. Mr Cox also expressed dismay at the enthusiasm of some planners and politicians for projects such as the demolition of the Cahill Expressway when the pressing and obvious need was for better planning and more thoughtful development in dinkum Australian areas our suburbs. While it is of unquestionable national importance that our city shows its best face to the world, Mr Coxs assessment of the problems of our suburbs should not be ignored. His characterisation of the outer suburbs as dinkum Australian areas is instructive. The mainstream of our culture does flow richly through our suburbs. The people in them are very much real Australians representative of the themes and currents of the Australian way of life. In the past, as Mr Cox points out, suburbs on the urban margin have grown like Topsy unplanned and without a sense of integration in the wider weave of the social fabric. Too often, new suburbs are illserved for the range of social amenities necessary for a cohesive and integrated sense of community."

From time to time the only way that this obligation can be met is by the use of safety equipment or protective clothing. To meet this obligation, all Departmental staff who are exposed to risk as part of their employment will be issued with the appropriate safety equipment or protective clothing, free of charge, on either a permanent or needs basis as appropriate. As part of this policy, a Guide has been prepared which gives general information on Safety Equipment or Protective Clothing requirements, means of assessing risk and selecting the correct items and purchase, issue, replacement and recording procedures See attached guide. DEFINITIONS PROTECTIVE CLOTHING items are those which would be normally worn as clothing and which the worker is required to wear as protection from hazards which regularly arise as a result of hisher work. SAFETY EQUIPMENT items are designed to protect a worker against a specific hazard and would not be normally worn as clothing. SELECTION Every Manager and Supervisor of staff is responsible for assessing whether staff are at risk so as to require the issue of Safety Equipment or Protective Clothing and for selection of the appropriate items with reference to the Guide. The assistance of the Departments Occupational Health and Safety Section is to be sought as required. The participation of the Departments Occupation Health and Safety Workplace Committees in risk assessment and the selection of Safety Equipment or Protective Clothing is fully supported by the Department. ISSUE AND REPLACEMENT The issue of either Safety Equipment or Protective Clothing items can be on either an individual or a communal basis depending on factors such as frequency of use or health issues. Where items are issued on an individual basis, the cleaning and maintenance shall be the responsibility of the staff member to whom they are issued. The replacement of such items will be determined by the condition of the items and whether that condition is as a result of fair wear and tear this includes damage as a result of an accident. At each location the Manager, Officerincharge or other delegate will be authorised to make such a determination. Where items are issued on a communal basis, the issue and maintenance or supervision of maintenance of those items is to be undertaken by a person who has been authorised to do so by the Manager or Officerincharge. Where an item is judged to have been damaged through other than fair wear and tear, the responsible person must be made aware that not only is it an offence under the Occupational Health and Safety Act, but also Departmental charges could be laid. Where staff members are not considered to be at risk, they will still be allowed to purchase items through the locations supply system, for their personal use, provided that the requirements for the payment of sales tax are maintained. RECORDING All personal issues, replacements and purchases are to be recorded as to the date, name of the item, name of the staff member, signature of the staff member and the signature and name of the authorising officer. VISITORS TO ESTABLISHMENTS Any visitor to a Departmental establishment is to be either made aware of any Safety Equipment or Protective Clothing requirements before they arrive and required to suitably equip themselves before arrival or, where visitors are a common occurrence, issued with items held on site. ACCOUNTABILITY All Departmental managers and supervisors will be held accountable for the implementation of this policy. They are also to ensure that all staff members, particularly new staff members, are aware of their rights and responsibilities under this policy. No supervisor is to allow a staff member to undertake a task unless that staff member is appropriately equipped with the required Safety Equipment or Protective Clothing which is in a serviceable condition. Each person who is responsible for a visitor to Departmental establishment is to ensure that the visitor is property protected before heshe enters any areas of risk. All staff members will be held accountable for the wearing and use of all required Safety Equipment or Protective Clothing. Staff who refuse to use the required Safety Equipment or Protective Clothing will be subject to disciplinary action under the Public Sector Management Act, 1988 unless there is a good and valid reason for the refusal. Such cases of valid reason are rare, and generally have to do with the workers inability to use the safety equipmentprotective clothing. Manager are not relieved of the responsibility to insist on safety equipment being used and protective clothing being worn. If suitable alternative safety equipmentprotective clothing is not available, managers are to consult with the O.H. S. Manager. CONCLUSION The Departments responsibilities in the supply and maintenance of Safety Equipment or Protective Clothing are recognised and accepted. Providing and ensuring the use of such items is sometimes all that can be done to reduce the effect of accidents or prevent their occurrence. Such accidents, by depriving the Department of the services of staff, can detract from the effectiveness of the services that this Department supplies to the community and can result in pain and suffering to individual staff members. A GUIDE FOR THE SELECTION AND ISSUE OF PROTECTIVE CLOTHING OR SAFETY EQUIPMENT This guide is to be used by persons who have the responsibility of issuing protective clothing or safety equipment. It covers the following areas a. the assessment of whether a person is at risk b. purchasesupply procedures for normal issue, emergency issue or staff purchases c. issue d. record keeping for personal issue or staff purchase e. procedures for dealing with staff who refuse to use protective clothing or safety equipment f. legislative requirements and g. specific items. The information contained in this guide will not cover every eventuality. Further assistance in the selection of appropriate safety equipment or protective clothing is available from the Departments Occupational Health and Safety Section or from the Department of Industrial Relations and Employment in your local area. ASSESSMENT OF STAFF AT RISK Staff can be considered to be at risk and therefore in need of protection when the tasks which they are required to carry out andor the location where such tasks are to be undertaken are likely to expose them to either physical injury or adverse health effects. This is so whether the injury or health effects are immediate or cumulative. For example, staff who are working in a machinery workshop would require overalls and safety boots because of the risks associated with long term exposure to oil, with loose clothing or with heavy objects dropping onto feet. Persons visiting that workshop to deliver some items or to consult with one of the staff would not require such protection, provided that areas they could safely occupy were clearly marked. Conversely, where farm staff are spraying chemicals, all persons in that locality who may be exposed must be provided with protection. Similarly, all persons working in an area with wet, muddy or slippery floors are to have suitable protective footwear. PROCEDURES FOR SUPPLYPURCHASE The supply of protective clothing or safety equipment is to be in accordance with normal Public Service procedures. After the required item has been identified, by first determining a need and then consulting with the Departments Occupational Health and Safety Section to select the type which is most appropriate and approved by the Department of Industrial Relations and Employment, the Government Supply Microfiche should be perused to find out if the item is in contract. If the item is in contract and in Government Supply stock, it should be ordered through Government Supply. If the item is not in stock or there is an unacceptable delay before delivery, the item can be purchased direct from the contractor. If this is unsuccessful or there is an unacceptable delay through a staff member being either at risk or unable to perform hisher work through not having the required item then a local supplier is to be contacted. Where a temporary employee is to be taken on for a period, and the duration of hisher employment is to be short ie. five weeks. The delivery time for any safety boots etc may exceed the employment duration. Therefore the temporary employee should be advised to where he can purchase the necessary item before he commences duties. Heshe should then be reimbursed via petty cash on presentation of the item and receipt. Where a staff member is to purchase an item of protective clothing andor safety equipment, from personal preference, the contractor is to be approached to ascertain if they will supply the item at cost price. In all such cases however, any sales tax on the items must be paid as failure to do so is a breach of Commonwealth Government legislation. ISSUE The issue of Protective Clothing or Safety Equipment can be either as personal issue to individuals or as a common issue which can be used by any person either operating equipment or working in an area. An example of the above would be where persons working in a workshop, because of their constant exposure to risk, would be each issued safety glasses or spectacles, and persons who enter the workshop to briefly use one of the machines eg bench grinder would not require personal safety equipment but would use a full face shield permanently kept near or on the machine. IN the case of items which could be supplied for communal use, such as respirators, rubber boots, eye protection, disposable overalls or wet weather protection, the cleanliness, disinfecting and serviceability of these items would be the reponsibility of a competent person such as supervisor or storeman. RECORDING PROCEDURES Because of the need to regulate issues and purchases of protective clothing or safety equipment, as well as the possibility, for legal requirements, of having to prove that items have been issued, all purchases and issues of protective clothing and safety equipment must be recorded. The record must be readily available and contain the following information a. the staff members name b. whether it is a purchase or an issue c. the date of purchase or issue d. the name of the item and e. if on a card system, the signature of the staff member. STAFF WHO REFUSE TO USE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING OR SAFETY EQUIPMENT Any staff member who refuses to use the protective clothing or safety equipment issued to him or her may be in breach of not only the Departments Occupational Health and Safety Policy but also the NSW Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 and the Public Sector Management Act, Such an action could also adversely affect workers compensation entitlements in the event of a resulting injury or illness. As well, any supervisor who, being aware of such a situation, allows the staff member to work unprotected may equally be in breach of requirements. Any staff member who refuses to use hisher protective clothing or safety equipment is to be immediately removed from the task and the matter referred to the manager or officerincharge who will endeavour to find out if their is a valid reason for the refusal. If none exists, a further direction to use the protective clothing or safety equipment item will be issued in writing and if this is not followed, disciplinary action will be taken. Any staff member who reports for work without hisher issued protective clothingsafety equipment is to be directed to return home to collect the items with their attendance record being adjusted accordingly for the time absent. LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS The following items are required by legislation. If, however, managers or officersincharge feel that the supply of such items is impracticable or, because of the circumstances, hazardous, then an application, stating the reasons, can be made to the Chief Inspector, Department of Industrial Relations and Employment or the Secretary, Department of Health whichever is appropriate for an exemption."

        "text": "Sixteen QUITE SUDDENLY, AND WITHOUT A CHANGE in direction, the jet lumbered out of the cloud and into the world again. Scully who had not slept or rested his mind a moment, could instantly see past his sleeping daughters head, the harrowed stones, the great gullies, the expressionless mountain faces of the country below. It was late in the day and the land crawled with shadows. Only weeks ago he left Greece sad enough to feel he was leaving his homeland all over again, but now when he saw it he felt nothing, not even dread. Stewards came down the aisles smiling grimly. Billie woke, saw the sea looming beneath them as the plane banked. She looked at him with an expression he couldnt read. Greece again, he said. She put her hands in her lap and looked down on the brassy sea. He put his fingers in her hair and she shook him off gently. IN THE MAULING TRAFFIC, Scully knew theyd miss the days last hydrofoil to the islands. The light was going and the taxi got deeper and deeper into chaos, so he resigned himself to a night in Piraeus. He could smell the difference winter had brought to Athens. The stinking nephos was largely blown away by sea winds, and the place was only as foul as a regular city. The ubiquitous raw concrete was freshened with rain and Athens seemed subdued, humbled by the onset of winter. Near the Zea marina they got out and walked under the streetlights to a little hotel he knew. The wind put the hair in their eyes, but it was an easy walk uphill. Its just tonight, he said. The first boat goes early. Hungry Billie nodded. Behind them the masts of the harbour jounced in the weather, and the rain came on through them, chasing Scully and Billie to the hotel door. WELL SLEEP TOGETHER, WHAT DYOU THINK said Scully, pulling back the curtains to look down into the street. Billie sat on the double bed and looked at the fan of drachma notes beside her on the coverlet. Stops us being too lonely, eh Silently she began to weep, and Scully sat beside her, held her gently, and felt that first shaft of hatred return to him like heartburn. How could you do this, Jennifer Whats happened to you that you could do this to us He felt his teeth meet hard and shake his jaw, but the feeling receded. He looked about this cold bare little room. You can tell me, love. Rain sprayed against the long unshuttered windows and Billie said nothing. NEXT DAY THE SUN WAS OUT and the sea beyond the marina was choppy but madly lit and blue. The sky was clear, the air fresh as they went aboard the hydrofoil which idled grotesquely against the wharf. A few offseason tourists had taken seats in the strange aeronautical interior, but most of the passengers were islanders heading home with shopping. Their crates and bags were piled in the aisles. A bearded man guarded a stereo, and a woman, an islander he didnt recognize, had a German Shepherd in a pine crate. They sat astern and the craft backed out of the harbour past the forlorn yachts of the summer set and turned at the open water beyond the mole to rise up on its limbs like a great insect under the power of its diesels. Scully led Billie out into the rear deck into the fresh air as the hydrofoil charged out into the Saronic Gulf. He saw Lykavitos and the Akropolis clear against the sky. He saw the fluorescent weal of the wake. He hooked his fingers in the strap of Billies backpack. Greece. Just the colour of the water, the firm, plain outline of the stone and sky gave him memories. From the cabin came the solemn howl of a German Shepherd all at sea, and Scully managed a laugh. After half an hour they cut past the undistinguished mound of Aegina and turned for Poros. The dog went on like a siren. The sun lit the deck. At Poros the expatriate drunks and the Athenian rich were making the most of the sun on the terrace at the Seven Brothers and the sight of them caused Scully to think clearly of Jennifer for the first time that day. He hadnt planned anything beyond simply turning up. He didnt know what he would say, how he would proceed. Now he imagined her breakfasting at the Lyko or Pigadi, rolling up her khaki pants to get the sun on her legs. Or maybe the trousers wouldnt be fitting her now. A skirt. Yes. A couple of tourists disembarked at Poros, and an American Scully knew from Hydra came aboard. Scully was grateful that the man, a party animal with a rich mother in Boston, sat up front and promptly fell asleep. It looked like hed made a night of it. The pastel frontages, the flags and tired mules on the waterfront fell behind as the hydrofoil surged seaward again. Scully looked through the small tartan case at his feet. An optimists bag. A twoday trip bag. A Scully bag. And in the bottom, rolling about in lint and gum wrappers, three white candles. SCULLY FELT THE FIRST CHANGE OF NOTE in the big diesels and knew that Hydra was looming. He was facing sternward and couldnt see it, but he sensed the shadow of it falling on the water. He took Billie inboard and arranged the backpack on her shoulders, straightened her up a bit and kissed her. This is it, Bill, he murmured. Lets just take it as it comes. Well get a room and go quietly. Other passengers stirred now, and the German Shepherd began to vomit. A horrid stink arose. Handkerchiefs came out. The dog sounded like an old man trying to clear his throat. When the hydrofoil docked and the hatch fell open, there was an athletic scramble for fresh air, and the little crowd of onlookers parted in alarm as passengers bolted for the wharf. Scully strode out onto the smooth flagstones with Billies hand in his, and he saw the shuttered, wintry waterfront with its ragged pastel walls, empty balconies and idle mules. The water of the harbour was still, the moles bare but for a few men mending nets, and the yachts and cruise ships were gone. Up behind the harbour the island rose into the sky, its houses packed into the space between mountain peaks whose slopes showed patches of green he had never seen. The terracotta tiles of a thousand Venetian roofs blurred sweetly in the sun, and from the hills came a showering of goat bells falling on the breeze. A couple of tavernas were open by the water, but he was thankful it was still too early for the late breakfasters. He found the land past the bakery where the smell of dough and heat and carraway seeds was overpowering. There was a line of mules outside Pans Bar, and men were laying concrete on the corner, laughing with cigarettes in their mouths and ouzo on their breaths. Scullys heart jangled as he saw the familiar sidestreets and alleys, the bougainvillea, the little square with the lemon trees and their whitewashed trunks, the cats going through the garbage outside the pharmacy where even now old Vangelis stood coughing into his hands. Here and there a woman swept her steps or whitewashed her front wall, but there were few people in the streets and no tourists. They went up the long steps toward the little hotel he had in mind, somewhere discreet and back from the water a way. He wondered if theyd been seen already, if Jennifer had been standing by a high window or on a sunny terrace when the boat came in. What was she thinking Would she send a message, just appear, panic She could be packing her bags this moment. He paused halfway to the hotel on a little terrace from where he could see a strip of sea, and the mountain breeze caught about his ankles. In the house above, a woman sang in a deep, stern voice. He knew the song, but had never been able to follow the Greek well enough to understand it. Billie stood passive beside him, scuffing her feet on the smooth granite flags whose centres were hollow with wear. Scully hummed a few bars and caught himself shaking there in the sunlight. HE KNOCKED AT THE HEAVY COURTYARD DOOR and waited in the narrow lane. A small dark woman with an enormous bust under her black pinafore pulled the door back. With a broom in one hand, she regarded them. Kyrios Scully Scully stuttered, unnerved to be known by someone he didnt recognize. Was she someone Jennifer knew Er, neh, Kyria, kalimera, um, hello. The woman ran her hand through Billies blonde curls and ushered them into the courtyard where sunlight piled in through the bare grapevines and lit her hanging gourds and her stone stairs. Uh, Kyria. do you have a room dotted line domatio Neh, neh, poli She led them to the stairs where cats lay indolent in the light, not moving as they stepped over them. At the head of the stairs she opened a door onto a large room with several beds and wide doors opening to a balcony. Kala, Scully stammered. Kala, poli. Well take it. Efkaristo. Is very good place, you come back. Yes. Yes. Cheap for you. How about two thousand drachs The woman pursed her lips doubtfully but shrugged in the affirmative. Endakse. Okay, good. She brought them towels and soap, opened the doors and left the room, beaming. Scully took the pack off Billies shoulders and walked out onto the balcony. The fishhook of the harbour lay plainly below, and he looked out at the gulf and beyond it the mottled mass of the Peloponnese where the faraway smoke of charcoalers smudged the air above the peninsula. He wondered where she would be. Unless shed organized something from Australia, she wouldnt have a house yet. Maybe a hotel by the water or a spare room in one of the expats houses. He tried to think. Where would he go after bolting in some kind of panic God, the thought of her having a breakdown in some bare room twelve thousand miles from home. What else could make you act like that Surely it couldnt be a way of making a point. You couldnt be right in the mind to do this to people you love. Scully felt his fingernails in his palms and tried to shake it off. It was not time for macho bullshit. No breastbeating, no torrent of recriminations. Just be prepared to listen, he told himself dont go shitting in your own nest. He felt Billies hand on the back of his leg. One of her shoelaces was undone, so he knelt and retied it and looked into her troubled face. Were gonna go down now and look, orright Its a small place well probably find her before lunch and shell explain why it happened. Everythingll make sense somehow, and then I think well understand. I just want you to be brave and let us sort it out. Let her say what she has to say, okay Sometimes people having a baby can be very nervous flighty, you know, like a horse. Now are you sure there isnt anything you want to tell me first Billies eyes began to fill as she shook her head. Its alright. Im gonna fix it up. ON HIS WAY BACK down the jumbled steps to the harbour, feeling bilious and goosefleshed, Scully stamped through spokes of light that ran between the smooth white blocks of houses, and he only faintly sensed the brief heat of the suns concentration. He was lighter without all the northern clothing hed been wearing, and despite all this weirdness, he felt more himself because of it. Jeans, sneakers, cotton windcheater, the old Scully uniform."

        "text": "ON THE FEASIBILITY OF USING APPLICATIONSPECIFIC SPEECH TO DERIVE A GENERALPURPOSE SPEECH RECOGNISER TRAINING DATABASE M OKane and P Kenne Faculty of Information Sciences and Engineering University of Canberra ABSTRACT A speech database is easier to markup if what the speakers are saying is known before markingup commences. In a joint project with the court reporting services we have examined the feasibility of using court speech recordings and associated transcript to derive a generalpurpose speech recogniser training database. The first question addressed was the size of the natural vocabulary that was covered by daytoday court proceedings. The next question addressed was the frequency of occurrence of the various words and phrases in this vocabulary. We then turned to the issue of how much transcript had to be examined in total in order to get a reasonable number of examples of all the commonlyoccurring words in the vocabulary. All this work was done using automatic analysis of transcript text. Another important aspect of speechdatabase collecting is the overall time it is going to take to markup a database of known size. In order to address this issue we conducted markup speed trials in which several experienced speech database markers were timed for speed of markingup speech from associated transcript. A special software markup system was used which ideally requires only four mouseclicks to mark up and confirm each instance of each word entered in the database. Each marker was markingup at word level only. Quality of markingup was checked for each marker. While the exact minimum amount of data needed to train a very large speech recogniser is unknown, experiments such as the ones described here suggest that the concept of deriving such databases from applicationspecific speech is a very large but not an impossible task. INTRODUCTION Practical use of statisticallybased recognisers requires the generation of large markedup databases to train the recognisers. The collection and markingup of speech databases is a timeconsuming task. Investigating ways of speeding up the collection of speechrecogniser training databases, we examined court transcript data. Court and parliamentary transcript has been used by others for languagemodelling studies Brown, della Pietra, Mercer, della Pietra and Lai, 1992. In Australian courts essentially all proceedings are recorded and the recordings are retained for a statutory period. For most courts written transcript is also produced and retained. We investigated the issue of seeing if the combination of transcript and recording could be used to derive a useable database for training generalpurpose and applicationspecific speech recognisers. VOCABULARY SIZE In order to gain some idea of the vocabulary size and the number of repetitions of items in the vocabulary we considered eight consecutive days of transcript from one ongoing case in one court. The growth in vocabulary size as a function of the number of days of transcript analysed is given in Figure 1a. In Figure 1b this information is presented again on the same scale as the graph of the total number of all words processed as a function of the number of days of transcript analysed. It should be noted that the transcript size for different days varies. It can be seen that the growth in the vocabulary is quite small. In total after processing eight days of transcript 170,638 words the vocabulary is If all words were repeated equally often this would mean that the average repetitions per word was approximately Of course all words do not occur equally often. So we next investigated the highfrequency words and the number of times they were repeated. The ten highestfrequency words and their number of occurrences are given in Table Note that the word the accounts for 6 of all the words processed and the words ranked 210 in the top ten occurring word list together account for another 5 of all words processed. We were interested not only in the number of items in the vocabulary but also the number of word pairs, word triples, word quadruples and word quintuples that could occur in the transcript and how these numbers varied as each new days transcript was added to the collection. This information is presented in Figure For comparison with Table 1 the top ten occurring word pairs are given in Table The top ten words even though they do occur very often do not provide a very useful vocabulary, taken as a set. In order to see if there are enough repetitions of enough other words we considered, for the eight days of transcript, how many words had greater than 10000, 5000, 2000, 1000, 500, 200, 100 occurrences. This information is given in Table We were also interested in finding out how long it took to get a reasonable number of words of reasonably high repetition rate. Some idea of this is given in Figure 3 in which the total number of words processed divided by the number of words occurring more than 400 times is plotted as a function of number of transcript days. It is interesting that after day 4 102,255 words processed, the ratio starts to rise, indicating that the highfrequency words are occurring more frequently but not a lot of other words are occurring more frequently. GENERAL VERSUS SPECIFIC One would expect that collecting a lot of data from one jurisdiction would lead to a large number of jurisdictionspecific words. Accordingly we investigated for the top 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 occurrences of the vocabulary, the word pairs, the word triples, the word quadruples and the word quintuples what the ratio of general words or phrases was to the total number of words or phrases for each set. This information is given graphically in Figure The single words are almost totally general at this part of the file with the number of jurisdictionspecific phrases becoming more frequent as the phrase gets longer. SPEAKER VARIETY The number of speakers contributing to any given transcript can vary enormously. For the eight days considered in the experiment described above, only five speakers a judge and four counsel contributed to the first seven days while fourteen speakers contributed to the eighth day which was the day on which witnesses were called for the first time. HOW REPRESENTATIVE IS MATERIAL FROM ONE COURT In order to see if data from a single court was comparable to data from another source we analysed two days of conference proceedings and compared data from these with data from the two longest days day 3 and day 4 of the eight day sequence described above. This information is given in Table MARKUP TIME The issue that makes this series of experiments worthwhile is that a courtderived speech database is extremely easy and quick to markup using a special software tool in which the speech appears in one window and the associated transcript in another. To markup a word, the operator uses only four mouse clicks one to mark the start of the word, one to mark the end, one to press to play the word and thus aurally confirm the start and end, and one in the transcript window to save the marks. Markup trials by various markers on long speech files indicate that a skilled and accurate marker averages about 14 seconds to markup a word in this way. This allows for fixing errors and scrolling both windows when necessary. HOW FEASIBLE Although the returns are considerable, the markingup of court transcript is still a daunting task. For example it would take an operator 16 12 weeks to markup the eight days of transcript, assuming the markingup rate of 14 seconds per word and a 40hour working week. Where one starts to win however is by a bootstrapping technique, whereby initially all words are marked but when enough repetitions whatever enough means of any word or phrase have been marked these are used to train a statistical wordspotter which then marksup these words and phrases automatically. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This data analysed in this paper was provided by Auscript, the Commonwealth Reporting Service. REFERENCE Brown, P, della Pietra, V,Mercer, R L, della Pietra, S A and Lai J C 1992. An estimate of an upper bound for the entropy of English, Comp. Ling, 18, 31 DETERMINATION OF TRAINING SET SIZE FOR A STATISTICALLYBASED WORDSPOTTER M OKane, P Kenne and O White Faculty of Information Sciences and Engineering University of Canberra ABSTRACT Wordspotting in continuous speech is useful for automatically locating words for audio indexing purposes. Wordspotting is also the basic technology behind concept spotting, in which the location of enough members of a set of semanticallyrelated words and phrases in a particular segment of speech is taken as an indication that the concept represented by that set is being discussed. A set of experiments was conducted as a first attempt to determine the size of the database needed to train a statisticallybased wordspotter. False negatives and the false positives are both treated as errors in wordspotting. In the first experiment the size of the wordspotter training set needed was examined for the speech of a single speaker. Sufficient training data were collected until good wordspotting was achieved for this speaker. This experiment was then repeated for the speech of another speaker so that the variation of training set size as a function of speaker could be investigated. The training sets for the speakers were then pooled and the wordspotter was tested on test sentences for these speakers. The obvious generalisation experiment was then carried out in which the wordspotter was tested on testspeakers who were not in the training set. INTRODUCTION A computationally efficient wordspotter was developed to perform at over 99 recognition in speakerdependent mode. Results less good for the wordspotter working speakerindependently are also presented. THE WORDSPOTTER The wordspotter was constructed as follows. Twelve different 14band broad encodings OKane 1987 were computed from the fft of the input speaker. The bands for any one encoding are mutually exclusive. Each band receives one of the labels a,b,c,dottedline,n. Speech which has the word to be spotted markedup is then encoded using the twelve encodings. For each encoding a dictionary containing the encodings of the markedup target words is constructed. An example of the dictionary for the first encoding for the word crosstalk occurring 119 times in continuous speech is given in Figure If one examines the twelve dictionaries one sees that the entries in any one dictionary are generally close in some wordnearness sense. This can be quantified by formally developing measures which reflect the number of letters by which any two dictionary entries differ. Or it can be quantified by considering all word pairs, triples, dottedline, ntuples within the words of any dictionary. Table 1 shows the number of pairs to 6tuples encountered for the dictionary in Figure This table also gives the number of ntuples theoretically possible for n1 to nThe striking feature of these numbers is how small they are compared to the theoretical possibilities. That this holds for all twelve dictionaries can be seen in Table 2 which gives the 4tuple results for all encodings. This relatively low number of ntuples is used in the wordspotter as follows. The utterance to be tested for the presence of the word to be spotted is encoded using the twelve encodings. Each utterance encoding is searched for the presence of the allowed 4tuples for that encoding. Where two or more 4tuples occur overlapping a potential find is marked. Note that no word in the dictionaries is of length less than five. Also marked are cases of a 4tuple a letter 2 or more overlapping 4tuples and 2 or more overlapping 4tuples a letter a 4tuple and so on. This process is illustrated in Figure The potential finds for the twelve encodings are then ORed in time. Each potential find in each encoding is assigned a notional weight of When two or more finds are ORed the weights are summed. After the ORing process is complete, all portions of speech which have a weight of 7 or more it could be any number up to 12 are deemed to be the wordspotters best attempt at the word being spotted."

        "text": "Thursday 2nd June Dear Dad, Thanks for the letter hope you survived your busy week. Thanks for the tape, too. Ive listened to about half of it so far. Ive had 2 prac exams this week Chem and Biol. Chem was OK because we could take in our notes and all we had to do was identify 2 organic unknowns. One of mine was acetic acid which was quite obvious from the smell but I had to go through all the motions of identifying it anyway The other one was more difficult. Biology was a real killer 10 stations in 10 minutes and at each one we had to identify parts of a dissection or slides then answer questions about functions etc. I unreadable know one mistake I made identified cartilage for bone and then went on to answer all the questions for that part on cartilage, but I hope I went OK on all the other parts. After this 4 of us went to a cafeacute in Newtown complained about it for about an hour. Thats about all Newtown is good for, its coffee shops Weve had less lectures this week in preparation for exams. Ive just finished my B.S. assignment but I cant tell you if its good or not because its too soon after I wrote it to be objective. Did you read in Column 8 on Wednesday about the farmers who got a cheque in the mail for a couple of thousand dollars That was the parents of a College friend of mine, Kirsty Kreig. She lives in the corridor I used to live in in Langley. The sore on my ankle I told you about got worse after I started putting Peranyl on it. Its better now although the redness and swelling has increased, the scalyness has gone. Pretty tricky of you to do a diagnosis over the phone, I think Somebody asked me the other day what you did, and when I told them they said how is that different from a GP and would you believe I didnt know apart from the extra years of study. Ive actually often wondered that myself, so please fill me in or tell Mum to since shell probably be writing next. Glad to hear Graeme finally caught a fish and would he like me to take him fishing in the holidays Last day of lectures tomorrow and its hard to believe Ive been here nearly 6 months. In a way I fell like Ive been here forever but it also doesnt seem that long. Has Chrysilla or Annette had their baby yet If yes please fill me in Must go now to post before next lectures. Love from Stephanie xox xox P.S. Sorry about the messy fast lecturerstyle writing but its 45 pm next lecture is at 3 and I have to buy stamps. P.P.S. Did you send my Naprosyn yet Tuesday, July 19th Dear Mum, Not much time has passed since I came back to College, but I thought you could probably tolerate a short letter. I hope, with musical everything, that youre not too busy, driving thingsdotted line As you may remember, I was planning to take Ballet this semester however it is not going ahead due to lack of demand. Something much better is, though Bridge I will certainly enrol, even the time is convenient Tuesdays from 30pm 30pm. Massage is being run as a 2day seminar on 2 consecutive Saturdays, which means I can also do that. There is also a day of sailing on Sunday, September 17th during which you learn to sail then sail around the harbour or so the brochure says. This sounds good but from memory this is the day you are coming to Sydney and without a doubt I would rather see you Could you send me your times days of arrival departure please We are considering changing our BS topic to Adoption nobody could find much on domestic violence. I have got 3 results back so far for chem physics exams I got 73, for physics pracs 85 for BS assignment interviews I got 86 which I was very happy with. My tutor said of my assignment This paper is very good though you could have done a little more background research. You write with an impressive level of sophistication . Id be happy for you to read it but dont know whether that would be appropriate or not In our 1st Anatomy lecture yesterday we were given the following list of vaccinations we have to have Hep B Rubella TB Measles Tetanus Mumps Diptheria Polio Next week we are having a Mantoux test for TB if we are negative, we are then vaccinated. I assume I have had all the others except Hep B, which consists apparently of 3 needles then a blood test, so Ill have it at the Uni health service if possible. As well as new doors, Williams 2nd floor has also a new extra phone, at the other end of the corridor to me. This will cut the incoming calls by half, or more, because most calls are for the other end of the corridor I guess they have more friends down there So life in Williams is getting better better I enclose a copy of my semester timetable just for interest. Cant wait to come home again. Lots of love to everyonedotted line love from Stephanie xoxox P.S. I found this petrol docket in my purse from the holidays. P.P.S. Its freezing in Sydney P.P.P.S Liz. was very grateful for the law handbook xox Saturday, July 23rd Dear Mum, I know you only spoke to me last night but Im so HOMESICK that I just HAD to write a litterdotted line it was either that or ring you again I have done a very excellent thing, and that is changed my flight from Sunday August 7th to Monday 8th at 10am. So I can spend an extra day at home all I have on that Monday is 2 lectures since ICB pracs are not on and the BS tutorial is only once a fortnight. I also rang Alison, so here are the plans for tonight pick me up at 15 pm, go to Cronulla for dinner, then go to a dance party at Caringbah then go to Craigs house dont know where that is. Alisons phone number in Newtown is 5l99613 not that I want you to ring her but just in case. Its always difficult in College to find someone to tell them what you are doing so theyll actually remember the important details time you were coming back just in case you dont, which I think is quite important in Sydney especially. They said they will then drive me home in the morning on Sunday, which is not exactly what I want to do but I guess Ill survive itdotted line Kim Childs has got about 6 letters this week, her father must be the head of Australia Post. It is pouring today, the day I wanted to do my washing I did it anyway because in terms of undies I am in dire straits The most recent intercollege competition is sculling, ie. drinking a whole glass of alcohol in one gulp. It was on last wednesday night at the University Bar needless to say I did not attend. They chose the Womens team at the Sports dinner on Tuesday night we had invited Wesley Sancta girls and all the coaches to College and they had a special sports dinner with us. After dinner whenever someone made a speech or whenever a team was mentioned, they had to scull it was foul. They have this a rather rude song that people sing at and at the end they sing Down, down, down, down until the person has sculled their drink. Dad was college like this when you went Cant wait to come home Cant wait to come home Cant wait to come home I love you all this much Love from Stephanie P.S. Its your fault that Im so homesick, if I hadnt had such a good holiday I would have been glad to get back to Uni PPS Since its your fault, you have to fix it and that means lots of LETTERS andor PICTURES as the case may be xox Thursday, July 28th Dear Mum, Thank you for being so very nice to me this week, while I have been lonely. Im feeling better today especially since I decided to write to you. We had dinner with Andrews last night, I didnt speak to one guy the whole night. It was not very well organised most of the girls sat on one side of the room the guys on the other not really intentionally but not many people could really be bothered on a weeknight. Some people did mix, however, and went to the Andrews bar afterwards. In Anatomy tutorial yesterday we had our Mantoux text I dont have a red mark yet. Have I been vaccinated for TB Im also going to arrange my Hepatitis B vaccinations today. Have you got my other letter yet I washed my woollen skivvy yesterday the instructions said to roll in a towel then dry flat in the shade. So until this morning it has been drying on my bedroom floor, but I got sick of avoiding it so I hung it on the line. I dont remember you drying things flat, so I dont think Ill bother anymore. Im not starting until 10am today because we dont have every ICB lecture every week. I have a history philosophy tutorial which I really enjoy, the tutor is actually a Biochem unreadable lecturer but he knows a lot of history has been almost everywhere. He is very old he just rambles on about Rome, and the Age of Enlightenment. We did a quiz last week to see what our history background was I only knew 1 question our of at least 50 that was what do AD BC stand for My history is really very bad I didnt even know what the Magna Carta was, let alone who signed it when Next monday the editor of Cleo the womens magazine is speaking at formal dinner. It will be interesting because these speeches usually have a my advice to you young women segment I wonder what her advice would be Maybe shell distribute free Cleos. Please tell Peter Graeme GOOD LUCK for the musical, you wont get this until tomorrow but tell them anyway. Im sending it Express Post because I hate having a letter on the way over the weekend especially if you ring me hint, hint This weekend Im staying in and working, working, working so that next unreadable weekend when I come home I dont have to worry about doing work. Im looking forward to coming home so much that I cant stop thinking about it. Its very opportune that there is also a med harbour cruise on that weekend whenever someone asks me if Im going I can tell them that Im going home that weekend . Its excellent However, if they dont live at College they often dont ask why, which is the second important part, so I tell them anyway My brothers are in the school musical one of them has a lead role . In fact the way I say it I think it sounds like Peter is the big star in an enormous Broadway production, but never mind. People who dont live in college dont appreciate what a big thing it is to go home. Kim is going Crosscountry skiing with the bushwalking club this weekend near Thredbo. She unreadable asked me if I wanted to go but said no, I really do have to work this weekend. It costs 130 and its a beginners course, so it sounds good."

        "text": "BATTLE STATIONS When it launched the mighty supercharged XJR saloon, Jaguar struck a blow not just for the company, but for Britain itself. After producing the XJ220 supercar in conjunction with Tom Walkinshaw and laying claim to the Worlds Fastest Car title on behalf of England before the McLaren F1 came along, at least, and dragged the trophy a couple of counties away, Jaguar is now back in the business of building highspeed executive expresses. Capable, as the last eight years or so of Jaguar saloons have been, the chances of seeing one pound majestically past a BMW or Benz on a German autobahn were minimal. Smooth they were, and silent as well, but not particularly quick. Now that the rangetopping XJRs in town, theres every chance that Europeans will be invaded by trainloads of Henry Roots crossing the channel by tunnel and eyeballing them from the fast lane at the cars 250kmh artificially limited top speed. Such speeds are academic in Australia, although the XJR is not. Any diehard fans who remember the big saloons of the 50s and 60s and have 160,000plus for the fastest Jaguar sedan yet must be getting pretty excited by now. What theyll get is the new XJ series reshaped body which in essence harks back to Jaguars of yore arching, aggressive front guards, a curved rump, and that elongated, lowlying stance that mimics a cat stretching in the sun. In XJR trim add a few street machining tricks such as monsterfat wheels and tyres, a toothy mesh grille, in our cars case a showstopping metallic green finish and, of course, an Eatontype blower and buckets of kilowatts, and theres fun to be had. Jaguar claims the XJR wa designed to attract buyers who would otherwise go for the likes of the MercedesBenz E500, BMWs M5 or 540i. Fine, fast cars every one, but unfortunately only the latter is available in Oz. As it so happens the 540i winner of our Best Luxury Car award last year has come in for a subtle upgrade before the 5Series is totally replaced next year. For now it gets twin airbags, a memory function for the poweroperated seats, new alloy wheels, a CD stacker in the boot and a range of new colours. Mechanically, it is the same as before, meaning theres a fourlitre V8 driving the rear wheels. Yes, its smaller than the Jaguar, but compares favourably to the XJRs performance image. Like the XJR, the 540i has an automatic transmission, at least until a limited edition run of sixspeed manuals becomes available early in Jaguar will take orders for manual versions of any of its cars to replace the four speed auto, but expect a long wait while its built. And speaking of auto transmission, that brings us to our third contender, the HSV GTS 215i. What, you may ask, is a Commodore doing in such exalted European company Well for starters, there are the basic similarities between its four doors, largish boot and mighty engine which delivers power and torque figures comparable with the BMW and Jaguar. Up until now it has been available with a manual gearbox only, while Uncle Toms boys tinkered with the GM fourspeed auto so it would suit the 7litre Holden engines output. So, like the other two its a large, comfortable fourseater with oodles of effortless performance. The snag is, of course, that it costs about 80,000 less than the Bimmer and a full 100,000 less than the Jag. Could it be that much worse Could it be, in fact, a better car Could the classic Australian sedan with a relatively simple pushrod V8 match the technical might of BMW, and could the 540i in turn hold its head high against the plushness and supercharged muscle of Jaguars new spirit Are they all fourdoor sports cars or the best Grand Tourers money can buy With these and many other questions in mind, we wheeled all three onto the battle field. PRICE AND EQUIPMENT Starting with the newest and most expensive, the Jaguar XJR stops the cash registers at 166,980 thats about 20 grand more than the 0litre Sovereign and for that money its difficult to think of anything which is missing off the spec sheet. The XJR has a host of goodies to distinguish it from other Jags quite apart from whats under the bonnet monster 17inch alloy wheels with P Zero rubber, the chicken mesh grille and colourkeying of some but by no means all of the chrome set it apart. What you cant see is the XJRspecific suspension settings for roll bars, springs and dampers, the traction control, ABS and limited slip diff. Inside, theres acres of soft, creamy Connolly leather, plush carpets and Jaguars famous woodgrain trim, which in this case is a dark, greyish veneer made from smoked maple. Standard equipment includes the half leather, half timber steering wheel, a timberfinish gear knob on the Jshift lever, while for entertainment theres a sixCD stacker in the boot and a stalkoperated trip computer. Theres plenty more, and all the luxo gear youd expect including power windows, remote central locking, power seats with three memory functions, automatic climate control air conditioning with revised and far more logical controls than before dotted line the list goes on. The only options are a sunroof and metallic paint, the latter adding 2300 to the cost of our test car. The latest 540i has, as mentioned earlier, copped a passenger side airbag in line with the rest of the BMW range. The good news is that despite this and the other addons the price remains the same at 136,That includes leather seattrim, the airbags, alloy wheels, traction control, tripcomputer dotted linein fact, just about everything the Jag has except the power output and the bigger wheels and tyres. Our black test car also had the so called Shadow Line option which for 380 blacks out the cars chrome work. And just to show how competitive this business is getting, Holden hasnt changed the price of its GTS 215i in automatic gearbox form, which if anything demonstrates how much the six speed box must cost to import from America. So the GTS is 59,524 with either transmission, compared with the mechanically identical but slightly betterequipped Senator 215i. If that sounds like a lot for a Holden Commodore then take a look at what you get seriously more power and torque for starters, plus the automatic transmission with larger torque converter and recalibrated shift points, ABS and independent rear suspension, 17inch alloy wheels with appropriate rubber, and the Hydratrak limited slip differential. Its the interior that more clearly points out the GTSs sporting rather than luxury personality theres fairly lurid cloth trim with pink highlights, a good, thickrimmed leatherbound steering wheel, and Holdens extended dashboard with trip information on an LCD display. ENGINES Jaguars AJ16 technological tour de force is a significant step beyond where the twincam, 24valve 0litre straight six performed in the past. The block has been recast for extra stiffness and theres lighter aluminium pistons, the cylinder head is entirely new with reprofiled cams operating on bigger inlet valves, and even the exhaust is bigger, while the multipoint fuel injection is now sequential. In supercharged XJR form Jaguar has gone a step further, provided 10 pounds of boost to the revamped inlet manifold via an airfluidair intercooler. The compression ration has been dropped to 51 from the normally aspirated engines 101 to cope with the extra pressure, and allup the power output is a mighty 240kW at only 5000rpm and no less than 512Nm at just over 3000rpm. With the same engine capacity but no more boost than that provided by Gods clean air, the BMWs outputs shouldnt be in the same ballpark as the Jaguars. Still, BMW spares little in the way of providing the most technologically advanced engines possible, and this silky sweet, freerevving V8 is a case in point. Theres quad cams, four valves for each cylinder and the latest Bosch Motronic fuel injection and ultimate outputs of 210kW at a relatively high in this company 5800rpm and 400Nm of torque at 4500rpm. What the GTS lacks in sophistication under the bonnet it makes up for in sheer capacity. HSV has taken Holdens cast iron OHV V8 lump and stretched the stroke out to 88mm which when combined with the massive 102mm bore equals 7 litres and a whole lotta grunt. The crankshafts a propriety item on the 215i engine, of course, but it also gets unique cam profiles and a new timing chain, an 51 compression ration, new exhaust valves and valve springs and a tuned length stainless steel exhaust system with mandrelbent headers. Still, wed like to bet that the whole shebang is still considerably understressed and that the 215kW output is not the highest well see from the engine. Its the torque which is the key here, all 475Nm of it peaking at 3600rpm, although thats still somewhere short of the Jaguars maximum and, surprisingly, produced higher in the rev spectrum. Awards for underbonnet presentation must go to Jaguar for the sheer imposing nature of the straight six. It seems massively long, with the company name emblazoned on the cam cover and the supercharger nestled down on the left hand side. Theres even a little tool kit under there although goodness knows what the average Jaguar owner is meant to do with it and the fuse diagram, which just for starters gives the location of all five fuse boxes, is the most comprehensive in living memory. The BMWs engine bay is less congested, with most of the ancillaries tucked out of sight from weekend tinkerers, whereas the GTSs more humble Commodore origins are evident by the more apparent wiring and plumbing, although of course the GTS is identified by the HSV logos on the grey engine covers. PERFORMANCE Its worth pausing to reflect a moment on powertoweight ratios, because both kilograms and kilowatts have a bearing on acceleration. So while the XJR is by far the most powerful, its also the heaviest car at 1875kg, so its weightpower ratio comes out at 8kWkg, slightly inferior to the much lighter GTSs 6kgkW. What surprised us was that the 5Series carries so much weight in 540i guise its a full 1710kg, giving it at 1kgkW, the highest weightpower ratio of the three. Its a similar case when comparing torque to mass the much lighter Commodore has only 4 kilograms for every Newtonmetre, whereas the Jaguar has 7kgNm and the 540i 3 kgNm. It made all the difference on the drag strip, for in terms of standing start acceleration the GTS had it all over the other two. This is an engine with tremendous reserves of bottom end torque, and it was able to launch the HSV car to a solid speed while the more highly strung BMW was struggling to overcome its weight disadvantage, while the Jaguar also seemed to operate better at higher speeds. Take a look at the figures the GTS comfortably beat the XJR to 100kmh, taking just 64 seconds, compared with the Jaguars Yet by the time theyve reached 150kmh and, incidentally, the end of our Calder Park test strip theres less than 3 seconds in it. Wed suspect that by the time 200kmh was reached the Jaguar would be ahead. The same goes for the 540i. The V8 feels somewhat peaky compared with the Holdens hairychested oomph, but thats countered somewhat by the BMW having five gear ratios to play with, keeping the engine onsong more of the time. Again, it cant match the HSVs sprinting ability, reaching 100kmh slightly quicker than the XJR in 54 seconds but the two europeans are almost lineball to the 400 metre mark and catching the Commodore. The 540is relative lack of lowdown torque gives it something of a Jekyll and Hyde personality use the heavily spring throttle pedal sparingly and at lower revs it seems almost sluggish. Sink the right pedal past its false stop and theres a mellow yodel from the engine and it winds up like a turbine, then accelerates like a slingshot."

        "text": "Smith report airing could hamper probe By MARTIN SAXON POLICE investigations into possible criminal offences could be threatened by the release of a secret report detailing the private financial affairs of controversial Liberal MP Wayde Smith. Senior police and the Director of Public Prosecutions say that revealing the contents of the confidential document could seriously impair investigations and would also prejudice the hearing of any future charges. Police and the DPP have objected to the release of the report to the Sunday Times under the Freedom of Information Act. The DPP said disclosure of the document at this stage in the investigation was likely to seriously impair future investigation of possible offences which might have been committed. If charges do result, the publication dotted line is bound to have a prejudicial effect on any subsequent trial, it said. The report was prepared late last year for Premier Richard Court after questions about Mr Smiths personal finances and his business dealings with former Waneroo mayor Wayne Bradshaw. At the time, Mr Court refused to release the report, prepared by accountant Stephen Mann, but the Premier said that it disclosed no evidence of illegality or impropriety by Mr Smith. But in June, detectives seized the Mann report from the Ministry of Premier and Cabinet under a search warrant after earlier raiding Mr Smiths home and electoral office. Senior police now say the document is integral to ongoing investigations involving particularly sensitive issues. They have not elaborated on the nature of the investigation, but it is know that they have uncovered evidence that an alleged 50,000 councilrelated kickback to Dr Bradshaw was cashed through Mr Smiths personal bank account. The Sunday Times applied for FOI access to the Mann report last December, the day that the Premier gave Mr Smiths financial dealings a clean bill of health. In February, the Ministry of Premier and Cabinet said it was refusing to release the report and another related document, claiming they were exempt under various sections of the FOI Act. The claimed exemptions related to the deliberative processes of government, the disclosure of personal, business and commercial information and a possible breach of confidence. In March, the Sunday Times asked State Information Commissioner Bronwyn KeighleyGerardy to review the Ministrys refusal to release the document. The Commissioners review supposed to take 30 days under the FOI legislation dragged on for months and was complicated in June when police seized the Ministrys only copy of the Mann report. Six months after the review began, Ms KeighleyGerardy handed down her decision late on Friday. She has essentially rejected the Ministrys grounds for refusing to release the documents, but she considers the documents are now exempt because of the police investigation. I accept the advice provided to me by the Assistant Commissioner and the DPP about the status of the Mann report, she said in her decision. Taking into account that advice, and my own examination of its contents, I am satisfied that it is reasonable to expect that the disclosure of the report could reveal more than merely the fact that there was an investigation of some kind. Ms KeighleyGerardy, a former senior police officer, speculated about the effects of disclosure on the investigation. Several possibilities come to mind, she said. Disclosure may reveal for example the names of potential witnesses, sources of evidence, the nature of the investigation, the substance of the particular matters being investigated, the identity of possible offenders or other breaches of the law. She decided the Mann report and another document, still in the possession of the Ministry, were also exempt because their release could prejudice any future trials. Lodge fire sparks probe call By ANN TREWEEK ANOTHER fire this week in a rundown Subiaco boarding house with mentallyill residents has brought calls for a governmental inquiry. Claims of poor conditions at the Subiaco Lodge inspired Opposition health spokesman Dr Geoff Gallop to urge investigation and Subiaco Council is suggesting improvements and wants a meeting on the issue. This follows a fire on Monday night when a man was taken to hospital after setting his carpet alight and locking himself in his room. In July last year, two elderly men overcome by smoke were rescued from a fire causing 25,000 damage to one of the three Subiaco Lodge buildings. As a licensed boarding house, it is subject only to council regulations, not to State legislation on hostels for mentallyill people. The Coghlan Rd property advertises comfortable accommodation excellent home cooked meals. Dr Gallop wrote on Friday to the Health and Fair Trading Minister, Mr Foss, asking him to investigate if disadvantaged people not in a position to complain were being exploited. When the relevant authorities attended there was no fire extinguisher or hose, Dr Gallop said. He said problems with boarding houses were highlighted by the Burdekin report on the rights of mentally ill people, which urged stringent licensing and regulation by State governments. Dr Gallop said other concerns raised about the Subiaco Lodge were about the standard of food and facilities, and the supplying of medication by untrained people. Subiaco council chief executive officer Pat Walker made a brief inspection on Thursday afternoon after complaints. He said improvements were suggested and the council was interested in pursuing some other issues. Mr Walker said lodge areas he saw generally fulfilled minimum hygiene standards under regulations. It doesnt mean you and I and other members of the population would be happy there, he said. On Friday, lodge licensee John Nowicki and his wife installed two fire extinguishers in each building and smoke detectors in bedrooms. The lodge has 28 residents, including disabled people.Mrs Terera Nowicki said They have everything we can supply. The rate was 110 weekly for a single room and 100 for a shared room with all meals. Asked about the alleged smell in one house, she said Theyre not new houses. I go in every afternoon to clean them. But if someone piddled in the shower I cant spend 24 hours a day there. You cant stop them. Theyre not normal people. Insurers treat us like dirt, say victims By JIM POLLARD INSURANCE companies have been accused of emotionally raping injured workers through bulk referrals to controversial psychiatrists. The head of WAs Injured Persons group, Mrs Peggy Nilon, said she believed that hundreds of injured workers were being sent to psychiatrists for little reason other than undermining their compensation claims. People were being put through additional torment by being questioned about their sex life, past relationships, their childhood and personal habits which had nothing to do with a work injury, she said. Everyone goes on about victims of crime and while I sympathise with them, they at least are not shopped around among doctors and psychiatrists, Mrs Nilon said. What injured people are going through is absolutely appalling. They are treated like dirt, as though all of them are frauds. Insurance industry spokesman Tony Carter said if people believed that psychiatrists or medical practitioners were behaving improperly they should report them to the appropriate authority the WA Medical Board. If they are having those problems they should report it to the insurance company he said. And they could express their concerns through any service provider to WorkCover WA. Labor Relations Minister Graham Kierath said recently that WAs new workers compensation system had ended the controversial practice of doctorshopping when injured people were sent to numerous doctors or psychiatrists until one questioned a persons injury or capacity to work. But Mrs Nilon said the practice was still widespread, only now, insurers were referring people to specialists and psychiatrists far earlier than previously. The sort of psychiatrists theyre using are, quite honestly, dangerous and I dont use that term loosely, she said. Theyre dangerous people whether they are aware or not of the emotional damage that they do to injured workers. And I would hate to think they are not aware of the damage they are doing. People have committed suicide after seeing some of them here in WA. That means they are responsible for these peoples deaths, as are the insurance companies. They start off sending injured people to medical specialists whose objectivity we question. Then they end up sent to these psychiatrists and thats often the straw that breaks the camels back. Reports from one psychiatrist in the northern suburbs contained inaccuracies and dubious conclusions, she claimed. Theyre digging into peoples past traumas whether they were abused as a child, whether their parents were separated, whether they are bisexual. But whats that got to do with a persons injury Its like mentally or emotionally raping all these people. Mrs Nilon claimed it was a tactic, in the insurance companies eyes, to undermine a persons case. Mrs Nilon expressed frustration that there was public outrage over victims of crime, yet injured people were still being treated like dirt. PRISON PROBE INTO CONNELL By JANET WAINWRIGHT JUSTICE Ministry chief David Grant has ordered an immediate report into how Laurie Connell was given preferential treatment in Casuarina Prison Mr Grant learnt this week that Connell had been allowed selfcare in Casuarina just three months after he was jailed. Longterm prisoners in top security normally are considered for selfcare after six months. This lets them to do their own cooking from food supplied weekly by the prison and to do their own laundry. It gives prisoners more freedom to move around and have their meals when they wish. Selfcare is considered a perk, earned after being in a cell with meals supplied from a central kitchen at set times for the early part of their sentence. The inquiry into special treatment for the jails most publicised prisoner is the latest in a list of inquiries launched by Mr Grant. He is working closely with Director of Public Prosecutions John McKechnie QC and Police Commissioner Bob Falconer. Mr Grant vowed yesterday to stamp out any intimidation within the prison service. I will not tolerate any officers being intimidated because they are putting in place government policy, he said. There are a small number of officers who lost their access to apparently endless overtime under the previous government, and I will not stand by and watch others being threatened if that is what is happening. There are those who will see all this activity as a sign of chaos, but it is absolutely the opposite. It is the product of relentless determination to find any kind of inefficiency, illegality, maladministration or malpractice. I will make no comment on predecessors but I will not let anything lie, he said, indicating that a 1992 inquiry into millions of wasted dollars in the prisons building services division was not yet over. The inquiry was tabled in Parliament at the end of 1992 and a subsequent report upheld the contention that millions had been wasted. The problems go back 20 years and I inherited a WA Inc in miniature, Mr Grant said. bulletContinued Page 2 Connell jail perk probe Previously with the NSW Prisons Department, he was appointed to head the Department of Corrections in 1992 by former attorneygeneral Joe Berinson. He replaced longterm head Ian Hill, who now heads WAs Training Department. Soon after his appointment, Mr Grant commissioned the report into the departments building services division. Part of that inquiry has been with the Fraud Squad for 18 months but this week police handed their findings to the Director of Public Prosecutions. Senior Crown Prosecutor Gerard Overman is now considering whether any action should be taken. Mr Grants workload was increased when he was given the job of heading the new super Justice Ministry by AttorneyGeneral Cheryl Edwardes. He was given information in May alleging drug running in the jails and this was passed to the police. In July, Mr Grant was given a report of an interview with jailed Wanneroo councillor David King, which was passed to the DPP. The most recent report was from prison superintendent Peter Moore, who said there were allegations of standover tactics by prison officers opposed to the industrial reforms introduced on July 1 and narrowly agreed to in a secret ballot by the Prison Officers Union."

        "text": "The first chairman of the CSIRO, Sir George Julius, was renowned for something much dearer to Australian hearts than scientific research. Julius was a young engineer in Western Australia when a somewhat dodgy state election prompted him to invent a foolproof voting machine. It worked well enough but the politicians rejected his idea. The government changed the voting system anyway, so Julius decided to adapt his invention to become an automatic totalisator at the races. Although he had no particular interest in horses, Julius felt that he might be able to create a machine to replace the small army of clerks needed for the PariMutuel betting system, invented in France in the 1860s. This system was popular in Australia where it was known as the tote. There were already tote machines but they were far from automatic. As the ticketsellers took bets they called them aloud to a man at a board behind them. On this board was a series of numbers, each with a lever beside it. The man pulled an appropriate lever as the ticketseller called each bet. Julius wanted to make a fully automatic machine that would record the bets and calculate the dividends as well. In 1907, he moved to Sydney to establish his own business as a consulting engineer but he continued to work on his somewhat bizarre machine a maze of wheels, cogs, piano wires and lead weights. A proud possession of Sydneys splendid Powerhouse Museum is one of the inventors scale working models of an automatic tote with an electrically powered working mechanism, mainly of brass housed in a seethrough redwood and glass case. It has four betting windows with a brass keyboard to record bets of twenty shillings, ten shillings and five pounds. The six counters indicate various investment totals, surmounted by a further counter which gives a grand total of bet investments in half sovereigns. Julius first automatic totalisator machine was installed in 1913 at the Ellerslie track in New Zealand where his father had become an archbishop it caused some comment about the familys ability to work in harmony with both God and Mammon. Back in Sydney, Julius formed Automatic Totalisators Ltd and put his tote on the market. Gloucester Park racecourse in Perth installed the first tote in Australia in 1916 and the main Sydney courses installed them in 1917Melbourne held out until Julius improved and developed the totalisator but he had many other scientific and engineering interests. When the BrucePage Government established the CSIRO in 1926 it made Julius the first Chairman, a position he held until his death in First Portable Iron Lung In the 1930s, Mr Ted Both was known as Australias Edison. Among the many devices he gave this country were the first encephalograph, a humidicrib, equipment for testing heart beats of babies before birth, a totalisator odds indicator and Australias first electric tennis scoreboard made for the Davis Cup in Adelaide it had 10,000 light globes. It was also used at the Melbourne Olympics in But his greatest contribution, for which he was awarded the OBE, was the development of the portable iron lung. When the 19378 polio epidemic was raging the South Australian Health Department asked Ted and his brother Don, to develop a simpler less expensive version of the artificial respirator known as the iron lung. Ted Both made a more portable model from laminated wood at one twentieth the cost of the imported American model. During that frightening summer such was the demand that within an hour of each one being completed it was being used by a patient. In 1938, Both began making his respirators in London, which was also experiencing a polio epidemic, and Lord Nuffield ordered 5,000 units, to be donated to hospitals throughout the British Empire. In 1939, the Jamestown Hospital Board in South Australia made an application and received the one opposite. It was the 911th built. Ted Both no doubt inherited his determination and practical ingenuity from his Prussian forebears. Johann Heinrich Both, with his wife Joachime and family from Altona, SchleswigHolstein, arrived in South Australia in 1838 and ten years later took up land at Lyndoch. In 1853 he diverted a tributary of the Para River to drive water to power a flour mill he had built. This was the colonys first mill powered from a wheel of iron. Ted Both, one of Heinrich and Joachimes many descendants, was born at Caltowie, and educated at Caltowie Primary School and the Jamestown High School where he won the Burridge Medal in He went on to the School of Mines then joined the Adelaide University Physics Department as a workshop assistant. There he was under the direction of the illustrious Professor Kerr Grant who later financed Boths pioneering work with electronic medical apparatus. Ted Both lived and worked from Sydney but all the apparatus was made in the Adelaide factory of Both Equipment Ltd, managed by Don Both. In 1963 the complete organisation was sold to Drug Houses Australia. The Edison of Australia died at Mt Beauty, Victoria, in 1987 at the age of seventynine. Eureka Flag Most Australians have read about it, seen pictures of it, heard songs about it but few have actually seen it. Its in a corner of a museum in Ballarat and, when you do see it, its surprisingly large dotted line the flag that flew at Eureka, the most famous fifteen minutes in our history. In 1854 the miners at the Ballarat goldfields chafed under the harsh control of the troopers, and at the oppressive regime of Governor Hotham. Every digger had to pay thirty shillings a month, and this was more than most of them could earn in that time. The miners grew to hate the traps soldiers and police who collected the licence fees, often at the point of a bayonet. Resentment festered for months, and, after an incident at a hotel the diggers held a protest meeting at Bakery Hill, above the town of Ballarat. Under the flag opposite, which they had designed and made themselves, they burned their licences. Peter Lalor, a British engineer, and, interestingly, a moderate, was nevertheless elected leader and Raffaelo Carboni, an Italian who preached revolution, his deputy. With violence imminent the men decided to make a stand at a place called Eureka Lead. It was there they built their crude stockade and ran up their new Southern Cross. There is no flag in Europe, or in the civilised world, half so beautiful, one said. But, when the dreaded troopers finally attacked, the battle was swift and brutal. Twentytwo diggers and six soldiers died. Millions of words have been written about Eureka but perhaps the most apt come from the American writer Mark Twain It was a revolution small in size, but great politically it was a strike for liberty, a struggle for principle, a stand against injustice and oppression. A new regime was installed just months later. Soon the licence fee was abolished. In future, miners would pay just one pound a year for a miners right dotted line the right to dig for gold and the right to vote. After their historic few days together at Eureka, Lalor and Carboni went in widely different ways. Acquitted on a charge of high treason, Carboni returned to Italy, where he joined the Garibaldi nationalists and ended up making a name for himself as, of all things, a playwright. Lalor, whod lost an arm in the Eureka battle, remained a political moderate, and went on to become Speaker of the Victorian Upper House in the famous Diggers parliament. He retired, distinguished and conservative, on a pension of 4,000 pounds in come in spinner Twoup has been played just beyond the grasp of the long arm of the law since the First Fleet arrived in The game itself is derived from the convict pastime of pitch and toss its other name, the swy, is a corruption of the German zwei meaning two and it has resulted in a few more convictions since then. Thommos school in Sydney, founded by J. Thomas in the early 1900s, was regularly raided and the one day the game has been respectable outside of Kalgoorlie, that is has been Anzac Day when police traditionally turn a blind eye. At Gallipoli, its said the Turks refrained from shelling a big twoup school because they thought all those heads going up and down must be some sort of religious ceremony. Theres no doubt that the supreme venue for twoup in Australia is the school at Kalgoorlie a remarkable corrugated iron colosseum which is an Australian icon in itself. The Kalgoorlie school has been in use for decades but became officially legal only in The roof of the rude amphitheatre is open so that the traditional toss of up to ten metres can be observed come rain or shine the former being a fairly rare event in the Kalgoorlie desert. The galvo casino closes only for religious holidays Christmas Day, Good Friday and on every second Friday which is the miners hallowed pay day. The school has been run by the same family for many years. For a game based on two pennies chucked into the air theres a complicated set of rules and rituals. A professional game is controlled by the boxer. He gives a small flat piece of stick called the kip to the spinner. On it he places two pennies with the heads polished to help with identification and when all bets are adjusted he calls come in spinner, who throws the coins into the air. If the pennies show one head and one tail it is a no throw and the spinner repeats his toss until he gets a uniform result which determines all bets. The spinner can keep tossing while he shows heads. He must spin heads three times before he can take any winnings from the centre he is then at liberty to bet as he wishes or retire, whereupon the kip passes clockwise to the next person. The boxer takes a set percentage 10 to 20 per cent every time the spinner has dooked them or done a dook which means he has tossed three straight heads. After that the boxer collects his percentage on each separate spin. Its not a game of skill although folklore in Kalgoorlie has it that you should watch a certain taxi driver for great spinning and the old Chinaman for constant winning. Federation Pen With one stroke of this fragile but mighty pen Australia became a nation on the first day of the twentieth century 1 January Before a crowd of 60,000 Australias first Governor General, Lord Hopetoun, signed the Act by Order of Queen Victoria creating the Commonwealth of Australia, and supposedly ending our colonial status. Not many nations get the chance to celebrate their own birthday and we did it in style. It rained on the last night of the nineteenth century in Sydney, but the new day dawned bright and clear and full of promise. The biggest crowds in Sydneys history turned out to watch a procession of dignitaries, floats and armed forces that stretched for miles. It was the culmination of a tense time. The whole notion of Federation had caused bickering for more than a decade and, indeed, Hopetoun had stunned everyone on the eve of nationhood by attempting to install the wrong man as first Prime Minister Sir William Lyne, who had been an opponent of Federation. However, he couldnt form a government and the role went as it should have to Edmund Barton. The cartoonist Hop pictures Barton here as a rather frumpy mother with her newborn. Barton, a Member of the Legislative Assembly and a Liberal Protectionist, had been a long time advocate of Federation. A great patriot and judge, he was a muchloved but somewhat indolent man. He resigned in 1903 and was succeeded by Alfred Deakin. For most Australians Federation meant that at last we were being fair dinkum about becoming a nation."

        "text": "You dead, Newman. We kill you Cabramatta MP John Newman was attacking his electorates high crime rate until an assassins bullet ended his battle last week box by Larry Writer When, in April 1993, the then NSW Police Minister Terry Griffiths bolstered crimebeleaguered Cabramattas police contingent by eight officers, he did not waste the opportunity to blast local Labor MP John Newman. The outspoken politician had long railed against what he said were rampant killings, bashings, drug abuse, extortion and breakins in the ethnically diverse southwestern suburb of Sydney. But to Newmans claim that crime had grown to a level where shopkeepers were considering arming themselves with guns, the minister had scolded, The member for Cabramatta seems to want to recreate the kind of violent military society which so many of his constituents have fleddotted lineThis is scaremongering at it worst. But when Newman was shot dead in his driveway last week, Griffiths words proved mistaken. On the evening of Mon., Sept. 5, Newman, 47, addressed an alp branch meeting at the CabraVale ExActive Servicemens Club. He was in typical combat mode, again warning of the need to fight crime in Cabramatta, where substantially more than half the population were born overseas, almost a quarter of them in Vietnam. As he often did on such occasions, Newman claimed that crime was rife in the area and although it ran against what police maintain about the local crime rate cited statistics to back him up. Newman said that the incidence of murder, vehicle theft photo caption and drug dealing in his electorate was higher than the NSW average and that the rate of robbery, assault, sexual assault and breaking and entering was also higher than the rest of the state. But he left the meeting, say those who were there, in good spirits. Newman arrived at his home in Woods Avenue, Cabramatta, about The house is fortresslike, with an alarm system, window bars, movementactivated floodlights and a thick, high brick wall. He parked his white Ford Fairlane in the driveway and went inside. About 35, clad in pyjamas, he reemerged with fianceacutee Xiao Jing Lucy Wang, 28, to draw a tarpaulin over his car to protect it photo caption from enemies who had paintbombed it three times. He had more than the paintbomb attacks to worry about Newman had received three death threats in the past nine months. He took the threats seriously but a friend said he always scoffed that whenever a dog barks it never bites. So it was that ,silently, an assassin stepped from the shadows, aimed a .32 calibre pistol through the iron grille of Newmans 2mhigh security gate and fired four shots. Two hit Newman in the chest the second severed his aorta. He staggered and collapsed at his fianceacutees feet. Police say the assassin sped off in a green Ford XD Falcon as Wang screamed Hes been shot, hes been shot In the next tumultuous minutes police and paramedics converged on the scene, but John Newman was dead. The bastards are still out to get me, Newman had told old friend Ted Grace just four days before he died. Since 1986, when he won the seat of Cabramatta, the abrasive, singleminded loner had waged a hardline anticrime crusade that demanded more police, the formation of a special gangcontrol intelligence squad and harsh sentences and deportation caption photo for convicted Asian urban terrorists. And he knew danger came with the territory. In June 1991, a bullet slammed through the front window of his Canley Heights electoral office and, in November 93 and January and March 94, paint was splashed over his car. A threat was left on his office answering machine You dead, Newman. We kill you. But the threats merely spurred the MP to greater efforts to rid Cabramatta of crime. Said Grace last week I remember saying, For Christs sake, back off, John. But he wouldnt. He was like a tiger he just wouldnt let go. Newmans steely tenacity had been tempered by tragedy. Born in Austria to a Yugoslav father whom he never really knew and an Austrian mother, Helene, Newmans given name was Naumenko. The family were refugees who fled Austria following World War II and moved to Australia when John and his brother Peter were children. Newmans father later returned to Slovania, where he died several years ago. The boys attended Cabramatta Primary and Liverpool High and at 16 John anglicised his surname to Newman. He was fed up with being called a wog and a reffo, so he changed his name to sound like an Australian, says family friend Nick Gotovac, Newman studied industrial law at the University of Sydney and on graduation became a clerk. In 1969, he became an organiser with the Federated Clerks Union fcu, a position he held for 17 years. In 1961, he started delivering pamphlets for local members and former Wran Government minister Eric Bedford. That was his introduction to state politics. Another vital introduction came when he met his wifetobe Mary. They wed in 1973 and, says Gotovac. Mary stayed at home making sure things ran smoothly photo caption while John worked at the fcu. They were very much in love. The ebullient young man went on to be elected to Fairfield City Council in Two years later his world fell apart when Mary, 26, and son David, 4, were killed in a car accident. Mary and David were driving along Prairie Vale Road at Bankstown in a Mini Minor that John had bought, recalls Gotovac. They crashed with a white utility. It really tore John apart. They were booked on a trip to Disneyland that Christmas and were going to leave in a few weeks. He couldnt stop blaming himself for buying that little car. He said it didnt offer them enough protection in the crash and they could have survived in a bigger car. When I got home that night, John was at our house and he was crying. He said, Nick, Mary is gone Shes been killed. Hed just been to the morgue to identify them. Then Newman learned Mary was pregnant with their second child when she died. Mary hadnt told him she was pregnant again. She was waiting till they got to Disneyland, says Gotovac. It was going to be a surprise. He was sick with grief when he found out about it. At the funeral, says friend Roy Medich, apparently he tried to jump on the coffin when the two were laid to rest. When a tragedy like that hits you, you tend to work your heart out to forget, Newman later said. He devoted himself to politics and karate. Smithfield rsl Youth Club karate manager George Wilson says Newman threw himself into karate after the deaths because there was noone to go home to, so he became a workaholic virtually caption photo in everything he did. He became deputy mayor of Fairfield in 1985 and in 1986 entered state politics on the platform of a better lifestyle for the districts youth. After Marys death, he joined the Staysafe Committee and fought for the rights of bereaved families of road victims. But he really earned his public reputation as an implacable and fearless critic of Asian criminals. Work became his life, says Gotovac. He became a crusader for Australian law and order and Australian democracy. In between, Newman was becoming a fine exponent of karate. At his death he was ranked 5th dan, halfway up the scale, in the traditional Japanese karate Gujo Kai Seishikan, and between 1978 and 1993, as president of the Australian Karate Federation, he represented Australia as coach, referee and team manager. He also instructed a generation of children in karate and weightlifting at the Smithfield rsl Youth Centre, for which he refused payment. But while he kept up appearances, friends say Newman changed after Mary and David died. He didnt laugh, says Gotovac. He didnt want to discuss family life with anyone. Newmans friend and fellow alp member Sandra Nori, close to tears, says, John was very selfcontained he didnt socialise a great deal. It became clear to me that he had built up an emotional wall to protect himself. Indeed, his sharp tongue was notorious. Another colleague remembers him barking at a receptionist at Fairfield Council Put me through to someone with intelligence But his bluster was an act to conceal his pain, says mate and state Labor colleague Paul Gibson. After he lost his family, Johnny carried a lot of sadness around with him dotted line He was a loner and a tough guy and he didnt want anyone to know that he was suffering and ripping his guts out internally. It might be said that John didnt have a lot of tact, but he made up for it with sheer honesty and guts. And he was a lusty headkicker in the House. When then National Party leader Wal Murray called Newman stupid in a debate, Newman challenged him to repeat his remarks in the street. He constantly struck at the LiberalNational government by lambasting the police in his photo electorate as incapable of dealing with local crime. If I was ever at risk again, I very much doubt that I would call Cabramatta Police I would handle the matter myself or call some other station, he said in parliament in February. Later in the year, he alleged the response he received from police had been a little lousy. Newman saved his best blows for home invaders, hoodlums who burst into houses to bash and rob the occupants. A number of particularly violent attacks made headlines last year. This is a mode of crime unique to Asian people, he thundered in January. It happens in Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia and now in the United States and Australia. I call it systematic urban terrorism. It is caption photo caption Asian people attacking Asian families in their homes and literally terrorising them. They have no respect for our lawsdotted line They think they can virtually get away with it and, in a way, they can because the penalties are so low and they know they wont get deported. Police dont agree with Newmans oneeyed view, even now. Theyre horrific crimes, theyre terrifying crimes and, in a way, what happened to John Newman was a home invasion, says Cabramatta Patrol Commander Alan Leek. But theyre not native to Cabramatta and theyre not recent events either theyve happened since white settlement in this country. Still, karate administrator Allan Todd respected Newmans hardhitting style He said what he thought, he had no fear. And many found him intimidating. He did things his own way and had an aura about him that was, I suppose, for some people, eerie, recalls Mark Latham, Federal Member for Werriwa in Sydneys west. He didnt try to network and build alliances but operated in his own right. Noone had a longlasting political relationship with John. It was on and off, on and off. Newmans nickname was Fists of Fury because of his karate prowess. You didnt argue with him because a black belt is not someone to argue the toss with, says Latham. There was a lot to like about Johndotted linein the sweep of politics there are so many bland types who never make an impact. But for a minority he was too upfront. If he had a beef with you, hed go at you, in a verbal way, but if you were on good terms hed be very obliging. Everyone knew where they stood. And Newman had no qualms about koing peoples feelings. He was a worker rather than a talker, says John Halpin, national president of the Karate Federation. He wanted things to get done and got a bit frustrated when they didnt. He just kept pushing until they got done and consequently some people found him very abrasive. He upset a few along the way. But he also would come back and say, Im sorry if I was a bit strong there but Im just trying to get a job done. He and Newman lunched in Melbournes Victoria Markets the day before he died and Halpin recalls he was very happy and relaxed and talking about his plans for the future how he was going to marry Lucy, how much he thought of her."

        "text": "Knickers what about my free nights out By Richard Macey Mrs Sue McDonald could hardly believe her luck last November when she spotted a promotion for underwear at Grace Bros Burwood store. If she bought three pairs of Sloggi panties, a product of the manufacturer Triumph International, and posted off the docket and tags before December 31, she would get two nights free accommodation for two people at a Best Western hotel. Thinking that two nights away from home would make a wonderful anniversary present for her husband, David, the 20yearold mother from Concord bought the underwear, paying nearly When Triumph International approached Best Western last year with the promotion plan, everyone involved apparently thought it was a good idea. At least 60,000 pairs of knickers later, the Best Western chain formerly Homestead is now not so sure. The problem is that Mrs McDonald was not the only person to take up the offer. Best Western confirmed yesterday that at least 20,000 others had bought the underwear and applied for the deal. Even if the hotel chains, which has 12,000 rooms across Australia, used the entire pool of special purpose rooms to clear the backlog it would still take 2 12 years for all the Sloggi buyers to get their night away from home. We had only planned to give 300 to 400 roomnights away, Mrs Annie CliftonSteele, assistant to the chief executive of Best Western, told the Herald. We were getting 400 applications a day, she said, adding that her company had unsuccessfully tried to end the promotion at the end of October. She said the rooms had a face value of 40 to 100plus a night. However, Mrs CliftonSteele agreed that the promotional material put out in the stores had not said that the offer was strictly limited. She said Best Western intended to meet its commitments to all 20,000 applicants. At least 400 couples would be accommodated as originally prepared. The others would be asked to either postpone their hotel stay or accept another offer which she declined to reveal. Mr Ross Derrington, the executive director of Triumph International Australia, said yesterday Continued Page 9 he had been surprised that the hotel chain had allocated so few rooms for the promotion. Asked if he considered the success of the promotion to be largely a problem for Best Western he replied As I see it, yes. It was a very successful promotion as far as we were concerned. They Best Western were very enthusiasticdotted linenobody twisted their arms to be in it. In a written statement yesterday Triumph International denied that it or a Sydney advertising agency contracted to organise the promotion had imposed or had agreed to impose any limit on the accommodation. The company said 3,700 applications had been received in the first three weeks and 25,200 had applied by the time the promotion ended. The statement said Bests Western had instituted proceedings for damages against Triumph in the nsw Supreme Court to cover the cost of accommodation. It said Triumph would defend these proceedings and counterclaim for damage to its reputation and goodwill. A disappointed Mrs McDonald said yesterday that she wasnt concerned about how the mixup happened. She just wanted her two nights accommodation at the hotel of her choice The Alpine at Katoomba. Sydneys shame our street kids Aid for homeless left untapped By Catharine Lumby While the accommodation crisis for Sydneys homeless children deepens, the State Government still cannot find the 728,000 needed to unlock 4 million of Federal funds to help solve the problem. The funds are part of a 100 million emergency package announced by the Federal Government last August in response to the Burdekin Report on youth homelessness. nsw is the only State Government which has failed to respond. A spokesperson for the Minister of Housing and Aged Care, Mr Staples, said the minister wrote to the nsw Minister for Family and Community Services, Mrs Chadwick, on January 25 to express his concern but had not yet received a reply. The spokesperson said Were very concerned but still hopeful that nsw will take up the offer. It would be a real tragedy for nsw and its homeless kids if they dont manage to find the funds in time. The director of programs at the Department of Family and Community Services, Ms Margaret Bail, said the department was trying hard to match the funds but that it was very difficult to find the money. Welfare workers said lack of longterm housing options for homeless children had caused a bottleneck in shortterm crisis accommodation services. The policy and administration officer for the Youth Accommodation Service, Ms Lila Kirilic, criticised the State Government for ignoring the Burdekin Report. The Burdekin Report identified the need for more longterm housing for these kids last year, she said yesterday. Instead, the nsw Minister is proposing to set up more crisis and assessment centres. Whats the point of assessing the needs of these children if at the end of the day youve got nowhere to send them Ms Kirilic expressed concern about the Department of Housings failure to address the problem. Its practically impossible to get public housing these days let alone if youre under 18, she said. We deal with pregnant girls of 15 every day who have nowhere safe to go for longer than three months. At the moment, she said, most homeless children had to move to a different refuge every three months. Ms Bail defended the Governments strategy, saying the problem was not as simple as a shortage of beds. Experience shows us that the provision of longterm housing isnt enough, she said. Were planning a review in conjunction with the Department of Housing and we want to look at the way mediumterm and longterm housing services are delivered. Another raid and another apology from police By Deborah Cornwall and Richard Macey Sydney police have launched an investigation into yet another bungled police raid after two Sydney businessmen were hauled out of a campervan at gunpoint yesterday in a lunchtime police ambush at Surry Hills. The two men, who had met only just before the raid to discuss the sale of the Toyota van, said three armed Crime Squad detectives had come out of nowhere, pistols waving. The bungled raid, the second by Sydney police in two days, happened only hours before the Police Department issued a public apology to the Charalambous family, whose Mascot home was invaded by armed officers at 5 am Thursday. Still in shock last night, John Rahll, a 43yearold campervan hire operator from West Pymble, said the Surry Hills raid at the corner of Denham and Campbell streets had been like something out of a Bgrade police drama. Wed just set out to do a test drive dotted lineand suddenly in the windscreen there were two fellows in shorts and Tshirts with guns aimed at my head and Svens head, Mr Rahll recalled. They were yelling dont move, stop, put your hands on top of the van. I thought they might have been a hit squad dotted linethey were really hyped up, and I was worried it would get out of hand. Mr Rahll said the other businessman, 45yearold Sven Neilson, had attempted to drive off in the van because he thought he was about to be shot by street thugs. After police grappled with Mr Neilson, also a campervan operator, both men were handcuffed and forced to lie face down on the pavement. I still didnt know who they were dotted line I was waiting for a bullet in the head, Mr Rahll said. Sven and I had just met each other, and I thought it was a gangland slaying. DetectiveSergeant John Davidson, who lead the raid, defended the attack on the two men yesterday on the grounds that the van, a hire vehicle, was under surveillance for a major heroin operation. Asked why he had used ambush tactics, DetectiveSergeant Davidson said There are a lot of cops with bullets in them. DetectiveSergeant Davidson said once he had established the two businessmen were not involved, he had offered to take them to police internal affairs if they wanted to lay a complaint. Both Mr Rahll and Mr Neilson had declined the offer and accepted his apology. Mr Rahll said that while he would not be taking any legal action against the police, he was concerned there had been too many incidents recently where police had drawn guns first and asked questions later. I just think there have been one too many Gundytype killings dotted line and its not on, Mr Rahll said. David Gundy, an Aborigine, was accidentally shot in his bed during a police raid in Marrickville last year. I have got nothing against the police, but if I had been some poor old guy with a weak heart Id be on the slab by now. Regional Commander, South, Assistant Commissioner Bruce Gibson, called yesterday for a full investigation into the Surry Hills ambush only three hours after a 30 pm press conference at which he apologised for the distress the abortive Mascot raid had caused to the Charalambous family. Stavros Charalambous, a 25yearold Greek migrant, claims he was repeatedly kicked in the back by the police before they admitted they had the wrong man. Some mlcs to get golden handshake By Luis M. Garcia The Premier has agreed to pay a golden handshake to members of the nsw Upper House whose seats are abolished under a proposal to cut the number of politicians in State Parliament by Mr Greiner confirmed yesterday that those mlcs who were financially disadvantaged by the proposed reduction in numbers would be properly compensated. He said the amount of money to be paid out to each of the five mlcs likely to be affected would be decided by the State Parliamentary Remuneration Tribunal, which determines the salaries and allowances of all nsw politicians. It is understood that in some cases, departing mlcs could receive up to 100,000 each on top of their normal superannuation and pension entitlements. Under Mr Greiners proposal, unveiled on Thursday, the number of mps in the Lower House would be cut from 109 to 99, while the number of mlcs in the Upper House would go down from 45 to The terms of office of mlcs would also be reduced, from the equivalent of three terms of the Lower House or twelve years, to the equivalent of two terms of the Lower House or eight years. Mr Greiner believes some photo caption mlcs should be compensated financially because when they were elected they expected to serve their full term of up to 12 years. The proposal to reduce the overall number of politicians in Parliament has been opposed by the nsw Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and by most of the Independent mps. The Independents are worries that the redistribution involved would bring about the abolition of seats held by Independents like Ms Robyn Read North Shore, Ms Clover Moore Bligh, Ms Dawn Fraser Balmain and Mr John Hatton South Coast. But this has been strongly denied by Mr Greiner. He said the reduction in numbers, certain to be put to voters at a referendum this year, was in line with a commitment he made before the March 1988 election. The Opposition Leader, Mr Carr, said yesterday the referendum would cost nsw taxpayers as much as 25 million, including the cost of advertising and the printing, distribution and counting of an estimated 8 million ballot papers. Mr Carr questioned claims by the Premier that the reduction in politicians would save taxpayers 4 million a year. On the most generous analysis, the annual savings of reducing the Parliament by 15 members would be no more than 2 million a year, he said. Thus the overall result of Mr Greiners proposal would mean a 17 million over a fouryear parliamentary term. Mr Carr said the Premier should propose his plans and hold the referendum at the same time as the next State election, due in mid"

        "text": "GETTING AND SPENDING SIR ROBERT MENZIES remained in office for sixteen years, finishing in January 1966 as the only Australian prime minister since the First World War to retire at a time of his own choosing. This is a mark both of his political skill and the disarray of his Labor opponents, but more than either it reflects the economic buoyancy of the 1950s and the 1960s when political change came seldom. Apart form Western Australia no state government lost office between 1947 and 1965 except as a sequel to a split in the ranks of the ruling party. In political and economic terms Australia was a model of stability in a fastchanging world. To the extent that the Menzies government presented a reassuring image of resolute anticommunism and fidelity to great and powerful allies it could claim credit for creating an attractive environment for largescale investors of overseas capital. But it must be noted that Australias progress was matched by most advanced capitalist nations. Some did better. Nevertheless the Menzies era enjoyed in retrospect a nostalgic reputation for prosperity with only a few to cry it down as a time of limited personal affluence and public squalor.1 The fact is that when Menzies retired in 1966 most Australians, recently migrant or otherwise, seem to have thought themselves better off than they were fifteen years ago, and by most measures of material progress they were right. During each year of Menziess prime ministership the average weekly earnings of the Australian worker increased by about 4 per cent in real terms. This represented roughly five times the annual average rate of advance in living standards between 1901 and 2 Critics have argued that the increased ownership of consumer durables and housing was at the expense of increased leisure and was achieved by substantial increased in indebtedness,3 and indisputably too many Australians, not all of them Aborigines, missed out on the good things of life. When Ronald Henderson discovered in 1966 that at least 4 per cent of Melbourne families lived below the poverty line he was describing nothing new.4 But the comparable figure for the United Kingdom was 14 per cent and for the United States nearly 20 per cent, and unemployment was lower than at any period in Australian history, standing at 2 per cent in 1950 and at precisely the same figure in August In the years between, the figure climbed no higher than 2 per cent in late 1961 and early That was the only moment to shake the stability of the Menzies regime. It was understandable that in 1964, when Donald Horne published The Lucky Country,5 many readers took the name at face value and failed to notice the sardonic implication that Menziess economic success was the result of good fortune rather than good management. Australias good fortune during the 1950s and the 1960s was founded on a continually expanding world trade and a stable international monetary system, both largely the result of measures initiated by the United States to safeguard western capitalism. Between 1952 and 1965 Australian gross domestic product rose annually at a little less than 5 per cent, a rate somewhat greater than that of the United States or Britain, but barely half the performance of Japan or the German Federal Republic both recovering from wartime loss with American aid. Britain remained Australias major trading partner and largest source of investment, providing more than half the overseas capital for Australian enterprises until 1960During the next five years the United States drew level, each country then providing over 40 per cent. Coincidentally with Menziess retirement British investment slumped to 3 per cent in 196667, reflecting a sterling crisis in which Harold Wilsons government restricted capital exports from the City of London, giving preference to Third World nations in need of development. Even this was not much of a turning point. Britain was to bounce back as Australias major supplier of investment capital in the late 1960s and again in the late 1970s. The ties between Australia and Britain depended on much more than Menziess sentimentality about the royal family. Export growth was fostered by a vigorous demand for Australias traditional rural products they generated more than threequarters of Australias export income until 195657, and over twothirds until 1965Metals and minerals accounted for no more than 10 per cent of exports, rising to 8 per cent in 196566 with the departure of the first shipments of iron ore and opencut coal. Britains share of Australias exports reached a postwar peak of 4l.3 per cent in 195253 but then fell steadily. The shape of the future was sketched in 196162 when Britain sought unsuccessfully to enter the European Economic Community EEC, for although few foresaw how far European farm subsidies would eventually oust Australia from traditional markets it must have been evident that Britain would increasingly look for trading partners among its near neighbours. The quest for new export markets dominated Australian trade policy during the 1950s and 1960s when John McEwen as minister was backed by two very able public servants, Sir John Crawford and Sir Alan Westerman. Australian exports to the United States remained constant at between 8 and 10 per cent, leaving an unfavourable balance of trade which was rectified by probing new markets in South and East Asia. Even China, officially scorned as a pariah that might at any moment plunge the region into a major war, was trusted as a buyer of Australian wheat who could be granted easy terms. Japan, having embarked upon the Pacific war in 1941 partly to force open new markets and sources of raw material denied by the United States and Britain, now found itself welcomed as a customer. Trade with Australia resumed in 1949, and in 1957 the two countries signed a formal agreement under which Japan promised to admit Australian wool and cotton at favourable rates and Australia agreed to impose no discriminatory tariffs against Japanese goods without prior consultation. By 196566 Japan was taking 17 per cent of exports and would shortly overtake Britain as Australias best customer.6 Wool, more than any other single industry throughout the 1950s and 1960s, was the great mainstay of Australias export trade. Pastoralists and graziers benefited enormously from successful experiments in 1950 by CSIRO scientists in introducing myxomatosis, a lethal infection which wiped out a large proportion of Australias rabbit population. Spared this competition for good grazing, sheep numbers grew unprecedentedly. Between 1950 and 1965 they rose from 113 to 171 million, and wool production from 518 000 to 819 000 tonnes. Yet behind this expansion a nagging doubt lurked. The needs of wartime had accelerated the production of artificial fibres such as rayon and nylon which competed with wool on world markets. Drought, industrial disputes a long shearers strike in Queensland in 1956, and the uncertainties of the auction market could all have unpredictable effects on the price and quality of the wool clip, whereas the synthetics could be costed and quantified more reliably. Thoughtful authorities in the wool industry began to seek a more orderly system of marketing. In 1953 the federal government set up the Australian Wool Bureau to promote wool sales at home and overseas. Inveterate individualists, Australias woolgrowers were unwilling to cooperate further in marketing their product and, in 1965, despite the earnest advocacy of the industrys most prominent leader, Sir William Gunn, rejected a scheme for imposing a minimum price on wool sold at auction. Thus a major Australian export remained perilously dependent on the health of overseas markets.7 The profitability of wool nevertheless encouraged many wheat farmers to convert arable land into pasture. Of more than 5 million hectares under wheat during the late 1940s more than a quarter was put to other uses during the 1950s. The governments of South and Western Australia reacted by opening up light lands in marginal rainfall areas to attract new settlers. By the end of the decade wheat was recovering favour because of international price agreements. In 1960 China was opened as a market which by 196263 was taking half of Australias exports. Production leaped, reaching a maximum of 307 million bushels in 1962But the old dream of a smallfarming yeomanry was dead. The new breed of wheatgrowers were agrarian capitalists working large acreages and investing heavily in laboursaving machinery. Their clearing was done by bulldozers and hiball units, and their crops cultivated by large disc ploughs and harrows. The sugar industry of Queensland and northern New South Wales produced its own yeomanry because producers were restricted to quotas which kept farms small. Mechanization at first took the form of bulk handling for sugar, introduced at five major ports between 1957 and It was only in the 1970s that caneharvesting machinery was designed cheaply enough to do away with the traditional gangs of itinerant canecutters. Meanwhile, protected by a British Commonwealth sugar agreement lasting from 1953 to 1971, the Queensland growers enjoyed a minor boom when the United States boycotted Castros Cuba in But the longterm prospects for the industry were limited. British readiness to end postwar food shortages by longterm agreements also benefited Australias meat producers. Between 1952 and 1967 Australian beef and mutton found a guaranteed minimum price in the United Kingdom. From 1959 the United States surpassed the United Kingdom as an importer of Australian beef, and this market was secured by an agreement in The strongest demand was for hamburger beef as the openrange conditions of northern Australias cattle stations did not produce beasts of gourmet quality. Despite some American investment and the acclimatization of Brahmancross cattle, the 1950s and 1960s saw little improvement. Dairy cattle, on the other hand, improved steadily in quality and yield, but Australias butter and milk exports were vulnerable to overseas competition, and numbers stabilized in 1957 at around 5 million while farmers awaited Britains negotiations with the EEC. Smaller rural industries forestry, fruitgrowing, cotton showed no great potential for export growth, and some products such as flax and tobacco were in trouble despite substantial government aid. Other expedients would have to be sought if Australias export trade was to diversify. Many looked to mining as Australias economic saviour. Admittedly the traditional leader, gold, was going through a period of decline, but the ten years after the end of the war saw a boom in demand for base metals and strategic materials, private enterprise following the exploratory work of the Bureau of Mineral Resources. Foremost among the exploring companies was the Zinc Corporation later Comalco, whose director of exploration, Maurice Mawby, promoted investigations into oil, silverlead, pyrites, phosphate, scheelite and bauxite, as well as the companys established concerns with lead and zinc.8 No mineral in the early 1950s seemed to hold out so much promise as uranium, and no shadow of doubt clouded the quest for it. Radiation was little feared at a time when compulsory Xrays were standard practice and Australias major allies were building nuclear power plants. Labor politicians hailed nuclear energy as a clean source of technology which might eliminate the need for underground coalminers the veteran radical Leslie Haylen hoped that uranium would make Australia prosperous enough to support a population of 50 million and had to be reminded that Australia could not afford her own reactor for ten years.9 The Bureau of Mineral Resources actively promoted uranium exploration. Geigercounters ticked across northern and central Australia, and between 1949 and 1954 finds were announced at Radium Creek South Australia, Rum Jungle Northern Territory and Mary Kathleen Queensland. The federal government entrusted development to major mining firms and arranged for uranium sales to the AngloAmerican Central Development Agency. Meanwhile Britain, anxious to keep step as a great power, wanted to develop its own atomic weapons. Since the British Isles are too crowded for convenient testing Australian space was requested. The Australian government took advice from a recently arrived Englishman, Professor Ernest Titterton, who had made his reputation as a physicist serving the AngloAmerican atomic tests and brooked no doubt about the safety and value of nuclear energy."

Dear Jean, Today is the 37th anni. of dear Adelaide Roses demise, yesterday Ron Ws 66th, echoes of words, of wisdom, yesterday is a many spledoured thing but well gone. history, Hegal said, What history experience teach us is this that people and Governments have never learnt anything from history, or acted on princ2 lettersiples deduced from it. How are you are you Simon the likeable, the prodigal was here and danced, but in spite of looking pretty good to our plebian optics did not advance to finals in the advanced sector, his partner a beginner, Monica thought that the reason, in any case a rushed lesson behind the stage 1 letter curtains for us no avail, we excused the night he got back here 3 AM to leave 1030 AM amid the confusion about the floods necessitating a trip back again around the coast. Theres much water around, today again drippy. Also wettish over in Sydney ramparts isnt it Slightly recovered from last weeks exhausting couple of days where I couldve been excused for thinking time was up, Ill not be involved that way again Things around here pretty mundane, day follows day next SatySaty Saturday venue athsaths ahtletics begins for the summer season, Simon back for a talk to potential walkers for the Sunday, Im vaguely uneasy that the insularity of his contactscontinually shrouded from the real world at the A I SA I S Australian Institute of Sport and also he travels so much, there has been several interactions between us that makes me wonder if athsaths athletics KenjaKenja Ken Ja from Ken Janice who founded this selfimprovement organisation are his world. Im sure he Alison will need to know a few things about adjustments of married life, indeed as we all did, tho our approach had more realism attached to it. So be. Guiltily, slightly startled as well, I read an article on Clint Eastwood last week, 63, he is and ran alongside a car to play the part of a president protector, himself he did it, 63, and then th3 lettersere were names rattled off, Bogart Taylor, Cooper, Gable, Ladd, and a few more all dead under 63, and heres sister Jean her cheery phone call saying, I never expected to send you a card at1 letter 70 , and Bep FlopFlop Florence over 80 Irene, is it to do with Shannon genes, or genetic combinations, but so what. I suppose its better to live till you die rather than die while your alive, or is it, it really doent matter. do you think its a matter of conjecture, you are not saying much, in any case I hope I dont get A.D when Im you said to be careful of it, Ill start and panic when the turn of the century comes to pass. Irene rang Sunday she is back to Dunbogan, and may stay there I think as she sounded as though she was getting support, medical support there, I suppose she would feel better to be at home if her requirements were attended to adequatly, she sounded strong of voice as usual, a little tired, but what can one do The sun is out, just a spasm, but by this arvo it will probably be slightly warmer. I hope you are able to travel down for the 17th.. in the meantime keep warm. Love Monica Francis Thurs. 14th. After phone call, unsettling because temporarily I was in a venomous mood about the criticisym of you must remember this , but my irish hot blooded english cold blooded system soon level1 lettered out as I thought of the lack of comprehension of Les Ron the woman what wrote the letter to Helen, and at least the two boys were dear friends of Arch and need to have kindly explanations of their lack of understanding know him mainly Arch in their minds eye as was, and no real understanding of the indignity of the bloody disease, and its difficult not to think of the woman in the same way, obviously did not get the education of the stages of the disease could not envisage the empathy of the film makers. The thing is you and Helen know what has been what is, those who do not understand should have special invitations to support group meetings or to meetings which would let them into the secrets of travelling with everyone, carers patients, it would test educate them, even Derriere Hinch should be asked, Id dearly love to have him, wherever he is, put in some night work. In this one has to learn not to Judge not to Justify, you cannot judge people you need not justify yourself, keep thinking ahead use your experience to help, which you are doing be satisfied with what you do accomplish you will be a genius like your secondhand halfcousin Id like you to know it hasnt been a crash hot week for me, most times Im dying, the nights are dying nights, the morning I try to interfere with Monica she says this is too unprofessional as she is treating me as a medical patient she is the medicator, and she may be debarred, I mention the therapeutic effects of relaxtion she says have some cornflakes rolled oats Tasmanian honey some cod liver oil, Ive yet to find out statistically,the benefits, because I have a lot of cornflakes one can only give these things a try. As I mentioned, I have about 4 more or even 5 cut slicings to go, and Im beginning to think this cosmetic surgeon, tho she is good is making a good thin1 letterg of it, no expense to me, and one is deadened to it all, but its to go thru it all the time, Im not too bearable with it. I alpapologise, see how hard it is for not having sent the clippings will try to remember to do it this time, stop pestering Of course it would be too much for Bep Stan to get up to Maitland now, it makes one melancholy to think about it, I dare say if they were Margarets parents it would be different, I get the idea that Ron is too much in1 lettervolved in wo1 letterrk, and to see the scheme of it all his perspective too narrow, I mean the significance of it all to Bep Stan, they could be relayed to yourplace for an overnight stay to be relayed for a quick visit next day back to WGongWGong Wollongong, It would mean driving 200 miles from Maitland to WGongWGong Wollongong back, think about it as I hope to be up within a month and Ill do it if you like to put us all up etc, I think its about 100122 miles to Maitland, to go up and back in 1 day is too much, it seems as tho there is little hope of Ron Margaret getting there Of course they are too old now, Jesus everyone is too old. it all sounds to me as tho they want 1 last look at their kin. If it meant a two day go they would be quickly back to their safety patterns. think about it any thought. Your loving canine friend gazes wistfully through the window into Monicas eyes for his piece of rabbit, with a backdrop of pouring rain, everythink is green, it is cold, Im a bit of a zombie today, did you realize that Im nearly 60 bloody Those who count at the factory think I look marvellous. are they any good. Love from here. P.S. If we prevail with the idea of relocation for BS to the extent of valuation etc the idea of medical care being more available. I suppose you know that me being left handed leaves me susceptible to early death,schizophenia, multiple illnesses homo sexuality suicide, in that order, and thats only part of the problem.I only read about it last night, and consider that with all the other interruptuses I must be living on borrowed time tomorrow the ear slices grafters go to work. its only wednesday, and of course your latest medical report suggests that its going to be difficult for you to reach 69 and of course the stress of your kids waiting for their inheritance will hasten things anyway Ive had the wog you were talking about I think it was short circuited by me taking anti biotics for mey arm. So much for you trying to solicit some sympathy for being off colour. Ive just walked the dog, tears streaming continually from the eyes because the wind was icy its snowing in ballarat the cold will freeze the icijcles off a brass statue, the fire has to be kept going otherwise I cant circulate, the sun is also shining, unbeleiveable The dog knows things are bad, and will continue expects us to be on the dole soon because he keeps burying the food. It was most interesting to read your letter to the Professor, as it was to read his answer, yours full of intelligent observation over a protraction of time his short clinically academic not neccessarily recognizing you may have even open his brain to something that may not have occurred to his expertise, not to judge, but for you not a chasm but steadily climbing a mountain, you put the letter to him in such a clear manner and a reading most people would have understood. you will be heard of from in time to come I think, lets hope you are able to go on with it. About migraine, until mumsmums death I had one a week and none since, but the relief the day after was tremendous, used to look into space wonder why one felt so good after it, you may have something about the bodys resources still acting putting one on a high, they are bastards of things so hope they dont prevail. did you have premonitions of a sieeizure during the time, or have they gone completely. Im being distracted by these continual skin cuttings, and wonder what they will be cutting next, they are at least irritating, with the undertones of maybe they will get more serious as they did with Ch1 letterarlie, and tomorrows go is to give a young surgeon practice, I think that they do this often at Repat, but its supervised by the cosmetic surgeon, so here will be under her eagle eye, I can hope its the last for a while. After this is over and cleared Ill be over there for a visit so lets know if you are going to die or not, and if Bep and Stan have mentioned anything about tenambit Tenambit name of a town, not to force anything, I wont accept excuses about Ron Margaret and Im not passing any judgement, they do things their way. Florence rang on Sunday I mentioned to her had they come down to see Bep Stan she was full of excuses for them. Also if you dont want to trip up there well just forget it if there are any other problems let me know, it would be that being the multi media consultant you are becoming, one will have to make appointments eventually. Hope you are taking your cod liver oil vitamin tablets and coming around a bit. I did not ring Nikki as Ive recovered from her visit theyd have objected at me reversing the charges. I cant afford the cost. Love to youse From us. Cards from Anne, havent written because dont know what address. People are dying like autumn leaves and becoming memories, compost in the footsteps and we all get a share, rich poor humble and arrogant vain and conservative I could go on writing like this forever but Fred Astaire said Im bound to improve, and thanks for your quick reply address, Ill write to Anne but not for the reason I was going to, as Simon will flit thru England get the book, he drove down Saturday had some dinner, procratinated with time until I was in my usual franctic stayte then lift for Canberra by bus, he is in Darwin for some weeks, Im not like other people, but how hard it is to get the ones who know one to get to know themselves, I finish up going into a stupor of reflection, I dont balance up the best, but by hell neither do they, but Im buggered if Im going to finish with making continual excuses for my outlook"

        "text": "19 Browning Rd. Turramurra Nth. 17th April, 1992 HERBERT HUPDATE NO.10 Dear All, I have been inspired by Stephens newspaper style layout to try using columns myself. The advantage is that I will be able to see the whole paragraph at once when it is formatted, instead of having it go off the screen. You may think that I put the address and heading in this column to save space, but it is because it will take me too long to work out how not to have it in this column Time continues to charge on, as is its wont. We have just returned from a 10 day trip to Adelaide, which is not as exotic as Stephens wonderful jaunts, but you will get a blowbyblow description all the samedotted line all in good time though, I have to go back a bit. We celebrated Janes birthday with lunch here on 29th March. Robert, Lisa, Daniel, James and Ellenora came, and all went very well, except that Daniel did not sleep at all and did not seem to enjoy himself. It was lovely to have a phone call from Michael, and unfortunate that I am no good with phone calls. At least Jane talked to him and brought us up to date. Simon was not there as he did not return from Canberra until the Tuesday. On 3rd of April, we went to see Robert get his Masters degree at Sydney University. It is a Master of Applied Science Exercise and Sport Sciences. We were lucky that he was the second to go up, so we could vegetate afterwards. Daniel behaved extremely well, until the occasional address when he started to say he was a bit peckish Lisa said she poked him, so they went off for a change and a feed. The speaker was the president of the Medical Record Association of Australia, so I dont think one could even have expected it to be very scintillating. I was tremendously impressed with the Acting ViceChancellor, Professor S E Dorsch, who managed to smile and look pleasant while presenting vast numbers of degrees and diplomas. At least she didnt have to raise her cap to each one like the Chancellor of Charles Sturt University. What was more there were three ceremonies on the one day. I wonder if anyone has ever conducted a study into levels of family abuse by Chancellors and Vice Chancellors of Universities, associated with Graduation Ceremonies. They certainly should not be expected to smile for at least a week after. We had tea and very nasty sandwiches on the lawn afterwards and Robert carried Daniel who was much admired. The following Tuesday, I packed before leaving for school, Jim picked me up at 3 pm and we drove on to Goulburn. The motel I had booked had very steep stairs to the rooms, so he rejected that on sight and we went to a very cheap and very noisy Budget motel on the hill up to the Big Merino. To top it off we were too tired to go looking for a meal, so we ate a very nasty Budget meal The roast of the day which had curling up edges and mushy vedgies. However it was exciting to be on the loose, and we slept quite well in spite of the noise. On Wednesday morning we left early for Canberra and went to the National Film and Sound Archives to pick up a piece of equipment that Simon had left behind. We were able to see the work he had done, building a lot of studios with a total area of a small house. It looked very nice. We then went to the National Gallery to see the Reubens and the Renaissance Exhibition. It was magnificent, and we were glad that we had taken an audio guide, which involved Jim wearing a cassette player, and each of us having an earpiece. The commentary told us where to go and what to look for in each picture. It also told us when and where to have a cup of coffee in the middle, which was much appreciated. After this we met Helene at the entrance and had lunch together in the Cafeteria. It was lovely to see her and to find that things are going well there. Jess seems to be happy at school and Standish is working very hard. He goes to extra art classes on Saturdays and on Wednesday evenings which give him great pleasure. After lunch we travelled on to Wagga where we went to the motel James had booked us into a month earlier. Just as well Wagga was packed for 3 days of Graduation Ceremonies, 2 a day there wasnt a spare room anywhere. James and Ellenora came after work, so didnt arrive until 15 pm. It is a long drive to do under those circumstances. On the Thursday morning after breakfast we all went out to the University and waited while James picked up his academic gown and cap mortar board. As he was only allowed two tickets I thought I would be in the overflow hall watching the ceremony on video, but a woman sat down, by herself, next to Ellenora and Ellenora asked her if she had a spare ticket and she had, so I was able to get in, to my very great delight. There were even more graduands than there had been at Sydney, but once again it was all fairly efficient, though with a slightly bucolic flavour. Some of the new Bachelors of Applied Science Agriculture looked as if they had never worn a tie before, but it was very pleasant. James received his Bachelor of Applied Science Computing with distinction which was very exciting. He had certainly worked for it. Afterwards we went to a lunch in the students dining room. James had a friend whose parents were also there, and we all socialised happily. James and Ellenora were supposed to be going to a Dinner and Ball in the evening, but suddenly decided against it, so we all had an excellent meal together in the Motel. On Friday morning I collected my photographs which I had left to be developed, and then James and Ellenora set off for a weekend on the coast, and we set off for Mildura. Not, of course, before Jim had done his usual check of tyres, oil and water. It is a very long way to Mildura, but very easy driving and we averaged 96100 kilometres in every hour. The land after Hay was desperately bare and dry and I spent a lot of time mentally writing poetry and wishing I knew something about forms of poetry and what sort of shape I should put it in. Mildura is an extraordinary neat and civilised oasis of green in the midst of barren country. Very busy and citified. The motel had no dining room, but it did have a kitchenette so we picked up takeaway food and ate there. When we were packing in the morning, a helpful neighbour from the next unit pointed out that we had a flat back tyre, and when Jim did his routine checks he found that we not only had almost no engine oil, we also had almost no hydraulic fluid. I called the Victorian version of the N.R.M.A. who changed the wheel, which is something Jim now finds difficult and topped up the oil and hydraulics and seemed to think that all would be well. We took the tyre to be repaired and left Mildura at 12 md arriving at Tanunda in the Barossa Valley, when it was nearly dark, and feeling very weary. As Jim directed me into the car park in the motel he noticed that we now had a flat front tyre This time we changed it between us and I spent a lot more time on the phone, but no one wanted to repair it at that hour on a Saturday night. Eventually the S.A. version of the N.R.M.A. agreed to come and take it away and repair it, which he did and then we set off disconsolately to look for dinner. We found a delightful restaurant in another motel in Nuriootpa, about 7 km away which we booked into for the following night. Having 5 tyres we were then able to do the 70 km trip into Adelaide to go to church in Holy Trinity which I had attended for the year I lived in Adelaide. We saw some old friends, looked at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital and at Brown Hill where we had first been alone together, and then came back to Nuriootpa. In the morning there was a large pool of hydraulic fluid under the car, and none in the chambers where it should have been The service station across the road said they would get the part, but it wouldnt come until 4 pm and it would take an hour to put in, so we booked in for another night in Nuriootpa and had a very peaceful day, doing the washing, playing Scrabble in the sun and reading. When the part came, it was the wrong one, but the mechanic improvised and we set off again on Tuesday morning with an extra load in the shape of a dozen bottles of Saltrams Cabernet Sauvignon and 3 bottles of Bethany white port, which we had managed to pick up on the Sunday afternoon. Jim, being by now more than a little paranoid about the Volvo had decided that we would return the quickest way possible, so it was back to Mildura, where we had only a minor scare due to the fact that hydraulic fluid in S.A. is clear not tinted as in N.S.W. and so it was easy to think it wasnt there. We were able to have a trip on a paddle steamer down the Murray, passing through a lock, and having a most interesting commentary. Wednesday morning we were off again, this time heading for West Wyalong, which meant about 250 km of empty road after Hay. It was less dry than the earlier part, and I was delighted to see an emu running beside the road. I had never seen one in the wild before. The trip was accomplished quite uneventfully and we pulled into a motel at 50 pm. This time Jims discovery was oil all over the right front wheel. Once more to the phone, and the N.R.M.A. garage which was about to close said we could bring it in. They said that it was engine oil not hydraulic fluid which Jim had first assumed, and told us to bring it back at 9 am. We now feared we would spend Easter in West Wyalong, but they found a leaking oil seal, repaired it and we were on our way at 1050 on Thursday morning and arrived in North Turramurra at 6 pm. I dont think I will get Jim out in the Volvo again, but I found it a very interesting trip, and I saw parts of Australia that I hadnt seen before, and got a better idea of what drought means. Today is Good Friday, and we went to church. Last Good Friday, was the only one that I can remember that I hadnt been. We had lunch with the Leasks and ended up spending all afternoon there. Jane rang and said that Aunty Struan is in Hospital and very ill. It seems impossible because she has always seemed the most indestructible person I know. I am not going to post this until I get prints of my photos to send you all, so I will update you about her then. We also had a phone call from Jims cousin Meriel who is on her way back from Brisbane. She has not been able to contact the people with whom she was staying so she is coming here. I am kicking myself because I did not tell her to leave the bus at Hornsby, but I cant do anything about it now."

        "text": "REVIEW OF RELATED LITERATURE CEREBRAL PALSY Cerebral palsy is the result of a lesion or maldevelopment of the brain, nonprogressive in character and existing from earliest childhood. The motor deficit finds expression in abnormal patterns of posture and movement, in association with an abnormal postural tone tight muscular spasms or constant muscle tension. The lesion which is present in the brain when it is still immature interferes with the normal motor development of the child.1 Cerebral palsy is classified according to the nature and distribution of neuromuscular relating to nerves and muscles signs. There are five basic classifications according to type according to number of limbs involved according to time of onset according to degree of involvement and according to the extent and nature of the damage Stephen, 1958. There are three main types of cerebral palsy spastic, athetoid and ataxic. Spasticity is the most commonly encountered abnormality. The normal balance between the antagonistic muscles and the suppressors in the brain is absent2 causing a display of claspknife hypertonus a state of abnormally high muscle contracture, hyperflexia the tendency of muscles to flex beyond their normal limits and a tendency to contractures Cothers and Paine 1959. Diskinetic cerebral palsy includes a number of movement disorders, the commonest being athetosis athetoid, featuring slow writhing movements and fluctuations from hypertonus to total lack of muscle tone muscle tension. Dystonic disorders usually show distorting tone changes, often involving trunk and limbs. Ataxic cerebral palsy is a rarer case showing poor coordination, head tibulation and intention tremor, suggesting cerebral involvement, and usually includes lack of balance. Dyspraxia is a similar disorder resulting in poor coordination, especially handeye coordination and speech defects through bad tongue control.3 In addition to these three distinct types of cerebral palsy, many cases are mixed with a combination of two or more types. The mixed types are due to damage in more than one area of the brain. The number of limbs involved is the second way of classifying cerebral palsy. There are seven groupings Monoplegia, involving one limb Hemiplegia, involving the arm and leg of the same side of the body Triplegia, involvement of three limbs Paraplegia, involving both legs Quadriplegia, involving all four limbs Diplegia, meaning the lower extremes are more affected than the upper ones Double Hemiphlegia, the same as quadriplegia with more involvement on one side of the body.4 The third way of classification is according to the time of onset. Cerebral palsy may occur during the prenatal before birth, perinatal immediately before, during and after the birth or postnatal after the birth periods, although it is difficult to separate prenatal and perinatal factors. The degree of involvement, the fourth classification, may be seen on a continuum from mild to moderate to severe, as well as in relation to the associated disabilities of speech, hearing, vision, mental ability and learning. The extent and nature of brain damage is difficult to determine except as the damage is manifested in motor and sensory impairments. The extent and nature of the lesion causing brain damage is the fifth form of classification. The following conditions may cause cerebral palsy in the prenatal period blood incompatibility maternal infection such as measles and toxemia anoxia lack or absences of oxygen resulting from such conditions as anemia and shock maternal metabolic disturbances maternal exposure to radiation and premature birth.5 During the perinatal period cerebral palsy may result from anoxia, often due to twisted umbilical chord stressful birth, including prolonged labour, or difficult birth such as breech birth brain hemorrhage and brain injury, including injury caused by obstetrical procedures, like forceps delivery.6 Cerebral palsy may also be caused by conditions that occur during postnatal development childhood diseases and infections like encephalitis, meningitis, and influenza head injuries toxic conditions like carbon monoxide and lead poisoning anoxia resulting from strangulation and suffocation and neurological disorders.7 and8 For an understanding of the nature of the motor disability of a child with brain damage it is important to understand normal motor development in terms of the evolution of the automatic postural reactions which underlie a childs overt functional activities. These reactions form the background of posture and movement which the child adapts as he or she learns learns to perform any skilled activity, like sitting up and remaining sitting, rolling over, standing up and walking. For this reason such reactions have been called, by Schaltenbrand 1927, Principal Motility.9 Essentially, normal motor development is characterised by two sets of processes which are closely interwoven and dependent upon each other. They are The development of the normal postural reflex mechanism which is not present at birth and which in time will become highly complex and varied. Righting, equilibrium and other adaptive and protective reactions fall into this group. The development of these reactions is closely associated with a normal postural tone which allows for the maintenance of positions against gravity and the performance of normal movements. The inhibition of some of the responses of the neonate, a process which may be associated with the maturation of the brain. Examples of this inhibition are primary standing and walking, the startled reaction, and the tonic finger flexion response. It shows itself also in a change in the early total response, such as the total withdrawal response involving all the segments of a limb, also a change which involves inhibition. This process, sometimes referred to as breaking up of the early total responses, makes possible a resynthesis of parts of the total patterns in many and varied ways and, in association with the development of a normal postural reflex mechanism referred to in 1, allows for the performance of selective movements such as walking and especially for the perfection of manipulative skills.10 An important feature of normal motor development is the freeing of the arms and hands from their early role of supporting posture and balance. In time this function is delegated to the trunk and legs. MOTOR DEVELOPMENT IN CEREBRAL PALSY In cerebral palsy, as stressed before, the lesion interferes with orderly development. Symptoms of motor retardation are followed, sooner or later, by the appearance of abnormal patterns of posture and movement, in association with abnormal posture tone the normal tension of a muscle at rest11. With the gradual appearance of tonic reflex activity muscular spasms during involuntary response such as coughing or withdrawing of the hand from a hot surface, extensor stretching of the muscle activity become stronger while in the supine position lying on ones back, while flexor contracting of the muscle activity become stronger while in the prone position lying on ones front. The cerebral palsied child, therefore, does not develop postural tone against gravity as does the normal child, but develops abnormal postural reflex activity which will, in fact, cause his or her body to conform to the pull of gravity. If he or she is a quadriplegic child and the whole body is involved, he or she may, in time, develop a posture of total extension in supine lying and total flexion in prone lying.12 The rate and extent to which this posture develops depends on the type and severity of the case and on how much of the body is involved. Initially, unless the case is a severe one, extensor and flexor hypertonus will show themselves only when the child is handled. For instance, when the child is pulled up to sitting from the supine lying, the head may lag far behind, neck and shoulders may retract, the hips may resist flexion, and the legs may extend, adduct draw or pull inwards and sometimes even cross. The turning of the head to one side may not be followed by the rotation of the trunk neck righting reaction, as this is prevented by the retraction of the shoulders.13 These may be signs of a tendency towards excessive extensor activity in the supine position, probably the result of the influence of the tonic labyrithine reflex a complex series of muscle extension and flexions. In the prone position, on the other hand, flexor hyperactivity may show itself in the childs inability to raise its head, in resistance to passive raising of head and shoulders, and its inability to extend its arms for support when lifted up by its shoulders, since the propping reaction is prevented by flexor hyperactivity of the arms.14 Even in the case of fully established quadriplegia the clear posture of total extension in supine and of flexion in prone is not always the rule. A few of these children, usually the most severe cases, may show in the supine position strong extensor hypertonus with opisthotonus receding muscle tension and still show fairly severe extensor hypertonus when lying prone, though less than when lying supine. The head may still be retracted in the prone position as long as the childs trunk and legs are stiffly extended. There may then be resistance to passive flexion of the head However, if one flexes the childs thighs at the hips, or legs at the knees, or abducts pull outwards the thighs, the head will suddenly flex, and the child will be unable to raise it.15 If abnormal postural reflex activity is strong at an early age, or if, as usually happens, it increases during the first years, the child will not acquire many of the abilities of normal children. Hypertonus will develop either in the form of spasticity or rigidity spastic or plastic hypertonus, or as intermittent increases of postural tone in response to stimulation, so characteristic of the athetoid group of cerebral palsy featuring slow writhing movements.16 ASSESSING CEREBRAL PALSY Three factors at least, should be considered in every case of cerebral palsy. Together they will determine the individual picture. The type of strength of the abnormal muscle tone The type of disturbance of reciprocal innovation The distribution of the condition and the prevailing patterns of posture and movement.17 ABNORMAL MUSCLE TONE All cases of cerebral palsy have in common an abnormal muscle tone. This is classically examined by passively moving the segments of a limb and testing the resistance which the muscles offer to passive stretch. It is unfortunate that modern neurophysiology has not been able to explain the different types of abnormality of muscle tone seen in different types of cerebral palsy. Abnormal muscle tone is considered to be the result of the release of the gammasystem, or more rarely the alphasystem, from higher inhibitory control Rushworth, 1960. Presumably the release of a facilitatory mechanism within the brain stem enhances the sensitivity or bias of the gammasystem Magoun and Rhines, 1946.18 This becomes hyperexcitable and reacts to an adequate stretching or contracting of muscles in an abnormal maximum manner resulting in the total flexing of the associated muscles in either extension or flexion. These observations may be the explanation of the clinically observed phenomena of spastic muscle, ie. the exaggerated stretch reflex, the claspknife phenomenon and the lengthening and shortening reactions. Rigidity is difficult to explain and is very different from the rigidity of Parkinsons disease. This type of hypertonus is actually a severe degree of spasticity. Rigidity in cerebral palsy is better called plastic hypertonus,19 characterised by the unchanging resistance a muscle offers to passive stretch throughout its whole range in the direction of either flexion or extension. It is yet impossible to explain the the nature of the fluctuating type of muscle tone found in the athetoid group of cerebral palsy. The amplitude of fluctuation may vary widely in the individual case, either on the basis of general hypertonic condition or of a fairly normal postural tone. Hypertonia, flaccidity of muscle tone, is usually a transient phenomenon in cerebral palsy, occurring in the earliest babyhood, and followed sooner or later by spastic or plastic types of hypertonus or by the fluctuating tone of the athetoid group. These sufferers may show considerable increments of muscle tone under sufficiently strong, longlasting or repetitive stimulation."

        "text": "Too soon too late reading Claire Johnston, 197081 Meaghan Morris This is part of an essay about some fictions of historical time which have mattered to feminist criticism, especially feminist film criticism, when thinking about what action might mean for feminist work in the arts. It could also be about activism and professionalism, utopia and pragmatism, commitment and career paths, the shifts and the tensions between them as values for middleclass feminism. But those are very large terms while my framework may be a broad one, my aim is really quite narrow. I want to discuss the concept of activism in a few texts by Claire Johnston 194087, one of the earliest and most visionary of British feminist theorists working with film in the 1970s here, I only have space to make a framework for my discussion. I am doing this partly to understand why I find it hard now to read Johnstons essays, but mainly because I think her work in its very difficulty for me in, as she might have said, this specific conjuncture illuminates my present as a feminist critic. That is to say, I no longer have a retrospective relationship to Claire Johnstons work. I think I did when she died. By 1987, a sense of sharp distinction between the 1970s and the 1980s had been widely expressed for years in many areas of our cultural and political life. In the media, enormous debates about the future of Australia could be packaged as Hawke versus Whitlam. In the arts, this often took the form of an opposition of styles it was not uncommon for speakers at public forums to introduce themselves polemically as an eighties person, as though whole paradigms would neatly follow suit like credit cards hanging from a wallet. But beyond these testimonials to the enduring power of classical vanguard narrative, an experience of what Laura Mulvey in her essay on closure and the 1980s calls Changes was also real, intense, and necessary then for feminism as a movement.3 Claire Johnston committed suicide. She was not an eighties person. So in 1987, it was hard not to question her texts as though to find out what had gone wrong. Such reading told me nothing it was too soon for other questions, too late for an answer to matter. However, I kept on reading. As time passed, a more complex, less mythical sense of how texts work in history, over time her critical sense, in fact, began to reassert itself. Johnstons writing always historical, nervous of myth became more a part of my present than it ever had been of my past. It began to be important, not something to disavow, that I was actually reading many of her texts for the first time in my life. For I came late to Claire Johnstons work. In the 1970s, I learned very little from British feminist film theory I was not interested in psychoanalysis, and so my own work looked instead to Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault. Today for no apparent good reason, given the wider world in which feminism and the arts in Australia must now justify its concerns, the apocalyptic retrospectiveness of the late 1980s seems remote and stifling to me. I am not really interested, either, in reviewing early feminism too late for reminiscences, too soon for sober history4, and, impatient to get on with other things, I meant quietly to ignore the 197090 part of the Dissonance proposition. But language does have its imperatives it is amazing, as Deleuze and Guattari point out, how thoroughly politics works language from within 5 fleeing those dates I found myself wondering because of them why I could write about Johnstons work, at last, in These are very personal remarks, but they help me to clarify an issue about feminism and historical time that I want to explore. Whatever their differences, most feminisms have been marked at least in their creative political phase by an experimental approach to the present, a desire to shape the future, and an enterprising attitude to representing the past. In other words, feminism is skeptical but constructive. If this made feminism untimely for historyisdead and Shakespearesaidit versions of art postmodernism, it still sounds safe enough as a practical orientation although, I shall argue, it isnt. But at the same time, feminism is not easily adapted to heroic progress narratives. If most of the dreams of historicism from bloody revolution to millenarian community have been taken up at one time or another by some form of feminism, that basic skepticism about history has also made feminism at once resilient in surviving its failed experiments, and resistant to modes of argument that base their claims on necessity. This connection between a constructive social philosophy and a skeptical theory of history is ungrammatical not only for melancholic aesthetics, but for many of the leftwing political traditions with which feminism has been associated. It also makes feminism difficult to situate for most contemporary polemics about modernity, postmodernism, and standards in cultural life. Feminist discourse often stammers when it comes to validating action with a logic of events it is not that logic is renounced, or history deemed chaotic, but that there is a struggle to name a different temporality not the sort of revolution which is an event that takes two or three days ... that might make a feminist concept of eventfulness historically intelligible.6 More exactly, feminism makes political discourse stammer. To act as I believe feminism does to bring about concrete social changes while at the same time contesting the very bases of modern thinking about what constitutes change is to induce intense strain, almost a kind of overload, in historical articulation and sometimes, in feminists lives. For there is no easy split between a practical everyday feminism, and the relentless but specialised struggles of feminist theory. They can be separated, of course, but I doubt that the useful distinction now is between activists on the one hand and academics on the other, or even between the political and the cultural.7 Professionalism, for example, has come to bear quite as intensely on community and campaign groups as on the artists who sometimes work with them. Nor does professionalism map neatly on to matters of class and race it is not in itself a white middleclass feminist problem, although ease of access to it may be a white middleclass privilege. Under professionalism, something like a general specialisation of activities takes place it is no longer obvious that the difference between a politics and a job is one of scale, or quality of commitment, or even relevance to a community. Claire Johnston was a cultural activist in the 1970s sense.8 She worked collectively the London Womens Film Group, the editorial board of Screen. She organised the first womens film festival at Edinburgh in 1972 with Lynda Myles, Special Events at the Edinburgh Film Festival during the 1970s, a Feminist Film Festival in She wrote some twenty essays, several of them foundational for feminist work in cinema, none of them produced with a curriculum vitae in mind. She edited Notes on womens cinema 1973, Frank Tashlin and Jacques Tourneur 1973 and 1975, both with Paul Willemen, Dorothy Arzner Towards a feminist cinema 1975, and she coedited the legendary Edinburgh 76 Magazine PsychoanalysisCinemaAvantGarde featuring Rosalind Coward, Christian Metz, Geoffrey NowellSmith, Stephen Heath, Kari Hanet, Julia Kristeva and Peter Wollen. Her last published essay, Maeve, came out in She fought with the phantoms of psychosis, Thatcherism and solitude , as well as with money and housing nightmares.9 She wrote manuscripts, and destroyed them. She taught for ten years without tenure, and never published a book of her own. To read Johnston now is to confront an aspect of feminist history and feminist time that Lesley Stern, in her beautiful essay on Remembering Claire Johnston, calls simply, survival.10 Johnston often defined her work in intensely localised terms, as though she wanted to restrict its life she was intervening at a particular historical moment to have effects in specific situations , not creating a body of knowledge that would endure as feminist theory. There are problems and paradoxes in this fiction, but in its hyperpolitical restlessness her thought was profoundly undogmatic. It has a cantankerous energy it survives. She did not always sound undogmatic there is so much Latin in that British film theory prose, a mythic Latin saying I am an instance of rigorous scientificity as Lesley Stern says, the effect can be sombre, not to say tyrannical. But there is a fink streak in Johnston she had a way of using that Latin to make it sound like a fart in church. Dogma in the arts today is rarely sombre in presentation rabid, yes in the mainstream media, or cool, chic, smarmy in Sterns terms, hebephrenic .11 The dominant constraint on feminism now is not the sound of scientificity, but what an American critic has aptly called the look of corporate populism .12 In this context my problem is no longer, or not only, why Johnstons activism could not endure the 1980s, what went wrong. Now I also wonder how it survived the 1970s in other words, what went right. This means reading Johnston backwards in chronological terms instead of searching her early work for tragic premonitions, I have at last learned, from her skeptical history, to begin at the beginning. I want to study this remark of Johnstons by working through, digressively, a simple proposition. This is Deleuze and Guattaris claim in Kafka toward a minor literature that living and writing, art and life, are opposed only from the point of view of a major literature .13 This claim helps me to understand some aspects of Claire Johnstons life as a feminist critic, while Johnstons writing gives me a point of view on some aspects of the concept of the minor. In between, I can clarify the problems I have with both. Most debates about literary authorship have assumed the possibility of a lifeart opposition, whether affirming it, refuting it, or refining it authorsignature, biographytext, historyform. Even the poststructuralist critique of authorship was read against the grain, in American literary criticism, as a pretext for opposing art and life in the crudest form of this reading, if the real author didnt matter then biography, politics and history could be excluded from literary study. But in cinema studies where Foucaults What is an author, clearly asking how, not if, authors matter, was read a little more carefully, the advent of poststructuralism had , as Patrice Petro points out, the opposite effect on feminist criticism .14 It enabled feminists like Johnston to revise the auteur theory influential in the 1960s, to begin discussing the place of women directors in the Hollywood studio system, and to create that enormous field of research now called the female spectator .15 But as Petro says, Johnston was unusual in insisting that history, biography and textuality must always combine in such research. Now in Kafka 1975, Deleuze and Guattari were still attacking the psychological criticism that had infuriated Roland Barthes in The Death of the Author a tradition that saw art as a substitute for life, then analysed the author through the text. But their emphases were different from his. Where Barthes went on to theorise the work of the reader, Deleuze and Guattari studied the life of Kafkas writing Kafka is a biography of a particular mode of creation. It is also a manifesto for a literarypolitical avantgarde .16 The minor an idea taken from Kafkas notes on Yiddish literature in Warsaw and Prague Jewish writing in German is a constructive concept the books project is toward a minor literature . What is unusual about Kafka is that in place of an avantgarde negation of arts status in bourgeois society, Deleuze and Guattari offer an affirmative project based on a mass historical experience How many people today live in a language that is not their own 17"

        "text": "CHAPTER 3 Who should control schools Brian V. Hill Who should control schools The question does not merely pose a problem in management theory, amenable to quick solution by applying criteria of efficiency and economy. It obliges us to go to the heart of our social philosophy, because the school is a potent form of social intervention in the lives of human beings at a vulnerable stage of their development. In the words of respected internationalist Torsten Huacutesen, problems besetting the education system are in the last analysis social problems which cannot be solved simply by taking action only within the walls of the school.1 What is more, if we get the answers wrong, then the health of the whole body politic is at stake. When social change is running fast, the school is typically one of the first social institutions to be put under the microscope. But whereas in the past most schools catered only for the ruling classes, the last 200 years have witnessed the elevation of the school to prime importance in the education of all our young. This makes it all the more significant in social policy, and all the more vulnerable to public criticism. Most parents today see the school as the chief means for securing their childrens advancement in a knowledgebased society. All governments see it as a key player in the achievement of national goals.2 The expectations of the various interested parties do not necessarily coincide at all points. When discussion intensifies about the functions of schooling, as it periodically does, there is usually renewed questioning about who should control the schools. The issue of control is not a simple one, for control can be exercised by a variety of bodies, in ways which are sometimes obvious, but often disguised. One educational commentator, writing at the height of the debate in Britain about the criticisms publicised in the Black Papers, noted that If one wishes to raise standards or to shift the direction of the schools, it is necessary first to have control, or to exercise a powerful influence over such basics as the curriculum, discipline, the appointment of staff, the future of incompetent teachers and, of course, finance.3 At the present time in Australia, the question of who should control schools is highly contentious. Clearly, we have not yet got the answer right. An obvious indicator of difference of opinion is the fact that seventyfive percent of Australian schools are State owned, but the rest are relatively4 independent of such control. Most nonState schools are sponsored by the Catholic Church with Protestant secondary schools running a very distant second, but there are also some nonreligious foundations which, together with many alternative Christian schools under various kinds of local control, now account for over two percent of the national total. Finally, there are some parents, statistically insignificant but by no means invisible, who have felt sufficiently disenchanted with both State and nonState schools to take it upon themselves to school their children at home. Of those schools which are in the government sector, some still operate under fairly direct central control from their State departments of education, while others are adjusting to policies of decentralisation which put much more decisionmaking power in local hands than was the case a bare decade ago, except in the Australian Capital Territory, which has long operated a powersharing system involving local parents as well as staff. In Victoria, recent legislation has decreed that schoolcommunity councils be set up. Interestingly, some apprehensive teachers union strategists in that State are counselling their members to bid, in their capacity as parents, for places on the councils of the schools their children attend. Their intention, however, is not to promote community involvement but to minimise its effects on what they regard as their professional preserve. In short, answers in the Australian context to the question of control of schools are various and divergent, though debate on their respective efficacy has scarcely been joined. In the present analysis, I propose first to discuss the various constraints operating to complicate the question of control, and then to argue for a general policy which, I will claim, is the one most consistent with education in the kind of democratic and pluralistic society we are actually living in. Determinants of control of schools In broad historical perspective, there is considerable truth in the generalisation that two mainstreams of social theory have competed for supremacy in our understanding of who should control the education of the young. One American writer, James Skillen, describes this as a fundamental ideological conflict between the ClassicalRenaissanceEnlightenment assumption that the primary responsibility for educating citizens lies with the government, and the JudaicChristian affirmation that the primary responsibility and authority for educating children rests with parents.5 Translated into current Australian realities, these ideological legacies have become interlaced. Thus, a secular liberalism emphasising competitive individualism finds an ally in institutional Christianity, which sponsors traditional upper class schooling. By contrast, people of utilitarian and socialist mind find in the social conscience of many Christians, nonconformists in the main, a kindred resolve to press for equity through public provision.6 More recently, a third player has entered the game the trained professional. Decisions in the nineteenth century to make schooling universal and compulsory led to a voracious demand for teachers which could only be met by formalising what the community expected of teachers into schedules for mass teacher training. The thinking at the time was that this new force would rescue the poor from exploitative parents. From this pragmatic beginning a profession has evolved with a recognised body of expertise and a strong sense of occupational solidarity. Teachers, like workers in a number of other helping professions, have developed a masonry which cherishes its own professional secrets, tending to despise the lay person and be jealous of its jurisdiction over the client in this case, the pupil. These three parents, teachers, and governments via civil servants are the obvious players. Others also, however, have an impact on school practice. In particular, employers and institutions of higher education are highly visible players. Both have a major interest in the products of schooling, and both can be relied upon to criticise the product. The amount of direct access they have to educational decisionmaking varies from State to State, but since upon them depends the absorption of the school graduate into productive postschool activity, their power to influence policy is considerable. And then there are more shadowy influences, which, according to some theories, are more potent than the visible players, having macroeffects on both the school system and the players themselves. Marxiststyle analyses, for example, identify largescale class factors at work in society, leading to the domination of the body politic by a ruling elite which reinforces its values and wishes through such processes as economic management, the ownership of property and other assets, and the manipulation of conditions affecting the workforce, the health services, and schools.7 Traditional church schools, according to this kind of analysis, are to be seen less as the agents of religious ideology than as the reinforcers of social privilege, while State schools, and the whole paraphernalia of graded assessment, combine to provide industry with the submissive labour force it needs and to promote a consumer mentality which will keep the economy turning over.8 Such analyses are often circular, in that they provide a form of discourse which can absorb all objections by turning them into rationalisations which make the objection fit the model. That the mode of discourse renders the theory unfalsifiable, however, does not absolve us from taking seriously the intuition that broader social patterns and ideologies do affect the operation of schools, and some generalisations typical of this approach can be confirmed by empirical evidence. Social forces do, at least to some extent, mould and constrain us. In this connection, however, David Wardle advanced the thesis some years ago that though public schooling in the last two hundred years has been strongly motivated by social engineering objectives, it has nevertheless outflanked its designers by creating a more critical and informed populace than existed before. Wardle, while recognising the plausibility of criticisms advanced by writers such as Ivan Illich, and while acknowledging the potential of schools to oppress the disadvantaged and reinforce class distinctions, argues that, even so, schooling has had an inescapably liberalising effect on society as a whole. Granted, he says, that school authorities in nineteenth century England often perceived their role to be that of defenders of the status quo, one of the main results of their efforts was to raise their pupils levels of aspiration, while they conspicuously failed to prevent them from questioning the social and political establishment.9 Something similar can be said of those products of religious schooling a not inconsiderable number who have turned away from the faith which nurtured them. This last point is a belated reminder that there is yet another player in the educational policy game, often overlooked though clearly visible the pupil. Human learners are not totally bounded by the rules their elders make for them. They possess the potential to be selfdetermining, even if the conditions for the exercise of this capacity are so unfavourable that the only way they can do so is by resisting, either passively or subversively, the process to which they are being subjected.10 Conversely, much research suggests that teaching is more likely to be successful where the learner has had a meaningful say in the determination of the things to be learnt and the methods to be used.11 And thirdly, merely as human beings, children have rights that are easily overlooked. There are several other agents also who may be perceived to have, or want, some say in the operation of schools. The main players may be represented as lying somewhere between the three vertices of Figure The structural pull The figure suggests that answers to the question of control are constrained by three general factors the Personal, the Ideational, and the Structural. In these terms, we can interpret Skillen as saying that the pull to the Personal is particularly indebted to the Judaic and Christian influences in our Western heritage. It might then seem plausible, perhaps, to attribute to Hellenistic influence the pull towards the Ideational, and to Latin i.e. Roman influence the pull towards the Structural. This would, however, be overly simplistic, even as a historical deduction. In addition, it must also be weighed against a new phenomenon the mass industrial society, networked into a global economy. This applies its own additional pull towards Structural priorities and solutions. When issues of school control are discussed at this level, the usual tendency is to concentrate on secondary education, since it interfaces with both employment and further education. But it is almost more interesting at the present time to see what is happening to the primary school. The education of the child begins in the intensely personal setting of the home and, increasingly, the child care centre. Primary schooling brings the outside world into the childs life, but in a gradual way which fulfils the expectation that the primary school will act to some extent in loco parentis. In many countries, primary schools have had great freedom in recent times to adjust their expectations to the needs of the actual children who come to them, refracted through the professional judgment of their teachers. Typically, therefore, primary schools have until recently been strongly oriented to individual development. Thus the Plowden Report in England, with its recommendations for greater freedom in learning, was not so much a new proposal for English primary schools as a validation of what the best of them were already doing. Significantly, that same report is now under heavy criticism as the Thatcher Governments policies begin to bite.12 In particular, the 1988 Education Reform Act has decreed that there will be a national curriculum in the core areas and national testing at ages 7 and 13 This swing towards greater strucutural uniformity even between primary schools has been justified as giving English children more equal access to education and better portability of studies between schools, but it also reflects a marketdriven ideology of achievement in the national interest, leading to plans to make schooling fit better into economic strucures."

        "text": "Privatisation refers to the unclear transfer of production or unclear assets from the public sector to the private sector. This may be achieved via asset sales or the contracting out of publicly financed goods services to the private sector. Over the last few decades there has been an increasing trend towards prov privatisation. unclear This is because a there has been low economic growth in most oecd countries, with large budget deficits. Running a budget deficit is no longer viewed so positively as stimulatory to macroeconomic policy. As a result, many oecd governments have ha sold public assets to give a try reduce their budget deficits b Government intervention is now being viewed as less necessary not as efficient as private production c there has been a return to classical thinking with its approach to freer markets with less government intervention. The arguments against privatisation are as follows 1 It is believed privatisation would lead to increased costs prices. This is due to the fact that public production is not required to include a profit margin in the final price. However, private production does require that the final price is made up of the costs of production plus a profit margin eg diagram As a result of the transfer of production to the private sector, costs should increase due to the inclusion of the profit margin required. In practice this may not always occur as efficiencies may make the cost of production cheaper before the profit margin is included. 2 Unemployment may result from privatisation. Production processes may be rationalised become more efficient or capital intensive resulting in a loss of employment. 3 Privatisation may also result in an increase in private monopolies with larger firms creating barriers to entry for new firms restricting trade. The arguments for privatisation are 1 there is increased efficiency competition created. It is argued that public sector employees are subject to rigid labour practices, have limited management autonomy revenue raising ability. as the option of issuing shares to raise funds is not available. Private production theoretically leads to more efficient production processes 2 Privatisation also means that there is less government intervention in the markets. Less regulation freer marketsmore responsive to innovations competition would result. 3 There would be an increase in share ownership from privatisation. The sale of an asset through a share issue often raises means that the employees own part of the company. This can give them a vested interest in the performance of the company provide incentives for further efficiencies. 4 Finally, privatisation can help reduce budget deficits. This is only a short term solution but the funds from a sale of a publicly owned asset can be directed towards reducing the deficit. The issue of privatisation is very relevant to Australia today Certain arguments for privatisation apply to Australia but needs to be implemented in a timely coordinated matter rather than as an ad hoc firesale. The issue of increased efficiency is important because Australia has had several large companies privatised over the last few years, eg the Commonwealth Bank cba Government Insurance Office gio. Such asset sales mean that these enterprises are subject to more accountability scrutiny. Both are listed on the stock exchange are thus required by the Aus As Australian Securities Commission to provide detailed accounts in their company reports. They are also under further scrutiny are required to achieve a predetermined return on equity unclear. They have a greater responsibility unclear to their shareholders now tenet to maintain their market share value. As such there is a large strong push towards further efficiencies increasing production techniques market share, especially in the cba. These companies asset stock exchange listings has also facilitated staff share schemes. Staff unclear now unclear have incentives to see the companies perform well as they are their own funds are invested in them. Finally The funds raised from these sales have certainly been a fiscal bonus to the Federal Government which has been able to use the funds to relieve the pressure on the budget deficit finance other objectives. However as in the case with the cba, privatisation may lead to a reassessment of the objectives direction consequently a rationalisation particularly of staff. Therefore, the issue of privatisation is very applicable to Australia as it can increase our economys efficiency, the motivation of our workers relieve pressure on the budget deficit were running. However, the time for these asset sales tendering out of contracts must be carefully chosen. In the current situation of such high unemployment, privatisation may well be discouraged temporarily if unclear job losses may result. unclear In summary, each privatisation issue needs to be looked at in isolation its costs benefits weighed up. It may bring many benefits to the economy if it is done in a timely, organised manner not as an an ad hoc reaction to public pressure or overseas trends. Qu 4 The American economist Laffer theorised that increases in marginal Tax Rates mtrs reduce peoples incentives to work. He believed that tax unclear killed taxation. diagram According to Laffer w tax revenue increased with the tax rate at a decreasing rate. Revenue reached an optimum maximum level at the point C which related to an optimal level of taxation Past the point C, the same tax revenue could be achieved with a lower taxation rate, for example BD. He believed that in 1978 the United States was in the position x, past C. As a result he argued marginal tax rates should in fact be reduced in order to increase tax revenue. In theory, this relationship is very plausible, however 1 in practice it is very difficult to determine where a country is on the Laffer curve 2 empirical results havent supported the theory. Therefore In summary, Laffer would have believed that increased mtrs reduced work incentives resulting in decreased revenue raised. As stated, this has not been proved empirically so it seems that there are some offsetting occurrences Modern economy theory states that increases in mtrs will have both disincentives to work as well as incentives. Firstly Disincentives It is believed that increases in mtrs will result in disincentives to work due to the following a the substitution effect This relates the to the theory that workers will examine the extra pay they receive for working longer hours. If they decide that it isnt worth it value their leisure time more, there is a disincentive to work. ie increases to mtrs, create a workleisure tradeoff. This really only applies to people who can adjust their work hours, such as the selfemployed or people with second jobs. b unemployment benefits may be attractive enough for people not to work anymore. If the tax rates go up, people may leave the workforce live on unemployment benefits increase their leisure hours. This is a rational decision. c It is believed that in people with an inelastic labour supply curve, such as women, will be greatly affected by changes in the tax rates withdraw from the labour force. This is not supported empirically. The countervailing arguments say that the tax increases will not affect work incentives for the following reasons a people work for nonpecuniary reasons such as power, job satisfaction etc. Their decision to work is n not greatly dependent on their wage therefore their tax rates. b increased taxes may increase the cost of living for families. In a twoperson family with only one working, the other may be forced into the labour market to gain further income so maintain the families standard of living c The income effect may also mean increases in tax rates force people to work more. This is based on the idea that people need to achieve a set after tax income in order to meet financial commitments. If the tax rate rises, the people have to work more to reach this required after tax income. All of the previous points outline the effects of an increase in marginal tax rates. It appears that the income effect offsets the substitution effect but whether overall an increase in marginal tax rates increases the incentive to work is not known. However, empirical us studies have found 1 that the primary earner is affected this includes breadwinners singles in full time employment who have no choice but to work more to supportfa However, this is dissipated by the fact that 2 Secondary workers, such as wives, not working or on a parttime basis, arent affected. Therefore, Taxation revenue shouldnt increase as a result of increased mtrs. Increased avoidance evasion would be created occur in an attempted to reduce tax liabilities the basis of Laffers theory The income effect offsets the substitution effect as previously stated so any further revenue gained from the workers under the income effect would be offset by the workers who substitute unclear leisure fro for work withdraw from the labour force. Overall, there shouldnt be any substantial effect either way. Qu 7 Currently, Australia has many different types of outlay taxes. These include retail sales taxes, wholesale sales taxes excise duties. All have severe problems as they are distortionary inefficient. Sales taxes have many exemptions, wholesale sales taxes have various rates a narrow base while excise duties are focussed on several goods such as alcohol cigarettes. unclear Due to having a number of taxes with various bases assessment procedures, the revenue raising unclear from outlay taxes is a complex procedure. The introduction of a broadbased consumption tax would replace all the others with the one comprehensive tax. An example of a broad based consumption tax is a valueadded tax or goods services tax. At lea each stage of production, the producer would invoice the person he sells the good to with the rate amount applicable to the value he added at his stage of production. Hed then receive a credit for the valueadded tax paid on the input. As such, each stage of production wouldnt end up paying any tax until the final consumer arrow who cant pass the tax on to anyone. Having briefly described what Ideally, there would be no exemptions to the tax there would be just the one rate applied. In practice, both these conditions may not occur. Having briefly described what a broadbased consumption tax is, I will now examine its benefits Firstly, as already indicated it is a much more efficient form of taxation. This is the only irrefutable argument in favour of a broad based consumption tax bbct. It replaces many more specific type taxes with one overall tax. It is also nondistortionary unclear the mix of taxes result in effects on work practices production process whereas the one rate overall wouldnt affect economic decision making so much. Secondly, it has simplicity aspects. Once introduced, ideally with a single rate no exceptions, the compliance costs are low. Initially, there may be some administrative costs with new accounting procedures required however, this sould only be at the onset. After this, compliance should be easy relatively cost free. Even if the single rate no exceptions wasnt achieved, the simp gains from the simplicity would still exist, though to a lesser extent. Thirdly, avoidance evasion would be reduced. Currently, wholesales sales taxes creates a great deal of avoidance evasion as the tax is levied on turnover at 3 rates levels. As such it requires that records are maintained accurately sales arent understated. A bbct would reduce the ability to evade or avoid tax due to the recording procedures. The steps in the production processes are known if valueadded isnt included, no credit for the taxed on the inputs is gained. Thus, due to the increased standard of recordkeeping incentive to declare production in order to claim credits, avoidance evasion would be reduced."

        "text": "Chapter TwentyOne NATURE HAD DEALT Lilian a nasty blow in making her a female, but I was not going to be cheated of her. She was a chip off the old block in every respect but one, and I was going to make sure that one flaw did not spoil the rest of her. The first rule that I had made, which had caused Norah to sulk over her embroidery for days on end, was that Lilian was to have no dolls until she could read Mackies Primer, and the rule had paid off she had been a precociously early reader. I kept a close eye on the books that came into the house for her. She had to be allowed to open and look at the ones given on her birthdays by Kristabel and Mother, but I made sure that accidents happened to happen to all those winsome little pink and white books why should my daughters mind be wilted with pap So they were accidentally left out in the rain, or taken on picnics and accidentally left behind, or accidentally fell down behind the chesterfield. In their place I supplied the things that were worthy of her mind, the same things that had equipped my own the sum of mans knowledge lay at her fingertips on the shelves of her room. There was the Encyclopedia, there was the Dictionary, there was even the Bible, for although I discouraged God, I felt that an educated person should know who Noah was. There were Great Men of History, Man the Masterpiece, Men of Science there were the books on birds, insects, mammals, steam engines, levers, the circulation of the blood, the countries of the world, their principal exports, their mean annual rainfall and, of course, the matched sets of classics Milton, Dickens, and Byron. The Byron had been a cause of open conflict between Norah and myself. Norah knew a few lines from Byron, had charmed me, in fact, by quoting somebody or others declaration of love, from some poem or other, when we were courting, that day in the Gardens. It was only long after we were married that I had discovered that those few pretty lines were not a small sample of Norahs literary accomplishment, but the entire stock. Some nicely illustrated childrens book, perhaps, Albion, she had urged. Surely she is a little young for Byron. I had looked at her fidgeting with her embroidery, unable to tell me what she really thought not simply that Byron was full of long words, but other objections she knew I would have no patience with. Byron is rude, she was probably thinking. Byron is full of things that are not a bit nice. There was a particular thing she did with her nose when she thought unpleasantness might be arising, and she did this thing with her nose now. When I was a girl I had a lovely leatherbound Gems from the Poets, Albion. Just highlights, you know, much more suitable for her age. I gave her a look which caused her to shrivel somewhat. Yes, Norah, I said, with an exaggerated show of patience. I am sure it was just the ticket for you. But no daughter of mine is going to be offered mere emasculated fragments. Norah did not answer this, but went on sipping her tea and smoothing the fine hairs on her forearm. She was not good at much, but she had entirely mastered the art of sulking. diamonds It was a great satisfaction to watch my daughters mind develop along the correct lines. Like her father, she came to love a list. Rivers of Australia, Clockwise, she would announce, strike a pose, and launch herself. Oceans of the World. Parts of the Body in Alphabetical Order. Her father always applauded heartily, the more so for knowing that Norah did not care to hear about intestines over dinner. Like her father, she relished the lovely definiteness of numbers. Lilian, I would say, a human body, if baked until all moisture is evaporated, is reduced in weight as 1 to 10 a body that weighs 100 pounds living, will weigh how much when dry Her eyes would brighten with the chance to impress me, and she would stare at the wall above my head she had never been allowed to count on her fingers until, usually with an unfortunate blurt of overeager spittle, she came up with the answer. She had quickly grown out of her first little table and chair, and for her ninth birthday I bought her a proper desk and chair for her room, plus a desklamp the twin of my own. As I sat in my own study, with my silver lady beaming her light down on my page, it gave me great pleasure to know that, in her room, Lilian was sitting at her own desk with just the same glow on her page. She had the best pen that Singer Enterprises could supply Miss Cunningham had been quite flustered, blushing all over her pretty little neck, going through the nibs with Mr Singers daughter, as she had gone through them the week before in the stockroom with Mr Singer, and had had a little discussion with him later on but she had made sure that Lilian came away with the very best. In the drawers of her desk lay reams of best bond and bottles of best India, rubberbands, paperclips, manila folders nothing would come between my daughter and the cultivation of her mind. I did not permit flimflam of a purely decorative nature, so on her dressingtable were none of the frilly little things that adorned her mothers there were no china ballerinas here, or blownglass pussycats, or lace trimmed pincushions embroidered with pansies. Instead there was her plaster model of the brain, her bottled taipan, and her collection of lead soldiers. I had come up against certain ingrained difficulties on the subject of the soldiers. Her set was the one I had had as a boy, supplemented by new Boer War issue, and it was a beauty. However, it had taken me quite a time to teach Lilian how to play with it properly. At first she had been inclined to treat the soldiers rather as if they were dolls I would come in and find them leaning up together to drink tea out of a thimble, or on their backs under a handkerchief being put to bed. Teaching her was not easy, but I persisted. I supplied her with new forts and model landscapes but it was when I found some corpses and puddles of brightred blood that I got her interested. Finally she got the hang of it, and she even learned to do a rather snorty version of my own cannonnoise. diamonds Over the years I had got into the habit of coming up to her room after dinner to check on how she was getting along. On a particular night soon after her tenth birthday, I came in as usual, but instead of turning to me with a glad smile, and some amazing fact about aardvarks, she jumped when I came in behind her. Oh Father she gasped. I did not hear you come in, and was it my imagination, or was there reproach in her voice, as if she thought I should have knocked at the door Her fluster made me suspicious, but the things on her desk spoke only of innocent intellectual endeavour. Her geometry set was spread out, although I saw with disapproval that she was not trying out problems from the Euclid I had got her, but using the compasses to draw symmetrical flowers and colouring them in with her mapping inks. She made a move as if to cover her work with her arm, as well she might, wasting her time on mere decoration, but I jerked her arm away, off the desk. Something flew out from under the silly flower, and fell on the floor a book that sprawled facedown, buckling like a thing in pain. Even as I bent to pick it up, I could tell from her stiffness that it was something forbidden. Strictly speaking, it was not something forbidden. Norahs romances were so entirely vapid, so utterly silly, so completely lacking in merit, that it had never occurred to me to forbid them to Lilian. Yet here it was Lo, the Dawn is Breaking, open at chapter twentyseven How Strong Were His Arms. Lilian, how dare you read this tripe I demanded. I thought I had taught you to know better. And sneakily How dare you I suspended the flaccid little book by thumb and forefinger and stared down at her face, turned up to mine in the lamplight. She should have hung her head, should have been ashamed, should have mumbled something apologetically, regretfully, remorsefully. Instead she answered back very pertly, But why not, Father Mother said it would be all right. Ah, it was that woman behind it, undermining me at every turn Ignorant, illogical, bigoted and credulous, with a brain which had made sheer stupidity into an artform But ah, she was cunning, too, in a low animal way cunning enough to know how to seduce Lilian away from me, and to make her as silly and sentimental as herself. How dare you answer me back like that I exclaimed God Almighty, how quickly the rot had set in but she stared very saucily and said, I am not answering back, Father, just answering your question, and for an instant on her fat red face I saw the same smug expression I saw on Norahs when she thought she had floored me. It had always sickened me to punish Lilian, because I knew it was her triumph, not mine I could spank till my arm ached, starve her till she was as pale as paper, confiscate her best books I could do all this, yet I was impotent in the face of her impenetrable female will. She had long known the power of silence, and had many times endured being sent to bed at three in the afternoon through some enraging refusal to confess, or explain, or simply speak when spoken to. Where had such strength come from It was true that I myself was a man of iron will. But as a child, I had been fearful of punishment, and sly in devising ways to avoid it a small chronic fear like an ache had hung over my childhood. I had taught myself strength as another man might have taught himself ballroomdancing, had learned strength as a way of dealing with my weakness. But Lilian seemed to have been born with unbreakable will it was not something she needed to learn. How had such a fearless spark of a child sprung from between the glass of water of her mother and the hollow drum of her father Lilian, I roared, and heard my voice around the room. Lilian, how dare you In theory I did not believe it necessary to strike women, but I struck Lilian now. In a passion of outrage I slapped her so hard that she fell off her chair, knocking her plaster model of the human brain down with her to the floor. The plaster broke, but not my fat daughter, who lay under me, breathing loudly as I freed layer after layer the pinafore, the skirt, the white bloomers, and there at last was her dimpled white buttockflesh, quivering under my hands. There There There There I could not prevent myself braying with each sound of my flesh against hers, and when at last I stopped, the room continued to pulse with the echo of my cries. What indignation and pain she feigned then She roared and shrieked, wailed and wept and provoked me into slapping her more. On the cool whiteness of my daughters buttocks, the marks of my hand were as pink as a peach. When I stopped, she fell silent and stared at me from under her untidy hair with a pout that seemed to invite more of the same."

        "text": "Productivity of Cattle under Coconuts H. M. Shelton Abstract In contrast to many other plantation crops, permanent integration of cattle under coconuts is feasible because of the open canopy characteristics of coconuts. Factors such as soil type, fertilizer strategy and stocking rate affect animal productivity, and liveweight gains are reduced in plantations with low light transmission. Liveweight gains are enhanced by the planting of improved forages, particularly legumes. Longterm gains are enhanced by the planting of improved forages, particularly legumes. Longterm sustainability of improved pastures under coconuts will depend on the use of grasses, which will not only persist under low light and regular grazing but will keep pastures relatively free from the ingress of weeds. A unique quality of coconuts, compared to most other plantation crops, is that they can be intercropped on a semipermanent basis. Unlike rubber and oil palm, the light environment under coconuts is relatively constant and bright over the life of the crop which can be as long as 60 80 years. It is therefore possible to establish a permanent pasture and animal husbandry infrastructure and to develop a stable beef production enterprise with a consistent output of animal product. Only during the very early life of new coconut plantations less than5 years will grazing cattle damage the young palms Reynolds 1988. In order to successfully develop a coconutbeef enterprise, a knowledge of the costs of inputs and value of returns is required so that detailed planning can be undertaken, especially if outside finance is required. While development costs of pastures under coconuts are likely to be similar to that for pastures planted in full sunlight, the levels of beef production obtained under coconuts may be somewhat less as the productivity and persistence of pastures will be modified by a reduced light environment. The objective of this paper is therefore to review the data available on levels of beef production under coconuts and to estimate the influence of the reduced light environment on productivty and sustainability. Productivity Levels A summary of liveweight gain data obtained under coconuts is given in Table Animal productivity varied from a low of 44kgha Manidool 1983 to a high of 505 kgha Rika et al. 1981 this variation was associated with a number of Management and environmental differences across the locations although the relative influence of these is difficult to assess. There was variation in light transmission, pasture species planted, soil type, fertilizer strategy, and stocking rate employed. These are now discussed. Plantation palm density, and therefore light transmission, was clearly an important factor as liveweight gains were highest in the more open plantations where forages received the highest percentage of ambient radiation Table 1. A comparison of the productivity of shaded and fullsun pastures is possible in Solomon Islands where grazing trials were conducted concurrently in the two light environments on similarly fertile soils although at different locations. The mean optimum stocking rates and maximum liveweight gain per ha over three years and for several pasture types were 0 cattleha and 467 kgha for fullsun pastures Watson and Whiteman 1981a, and 7 cattleha and 352 kgha for pastures under coconuts Watson and Whiteman 1981b. The species present in understorey forages was also important. Both Reynolds 1981 and Manidool 1983 demonstrated substantial improvement in liveweight gain from improved over natural forages indicating the desirability of replacing natural with improved forages for maximum animal production. Although this conclusion was apparently not supported by the results of some other studies Robinson 1981 Watson and Whiteman 1981b Smith and Whiteman 1985, in all these cases there was a substantial proportion of naturalised legume in the pasture which clearly improved its quality for grazing animals. The importance of legumes to pasture quality under coconuts was demonstrated in Vanuatu where low liveweight gains were reported for animals grazing pure Stenotaphrum secundatum buffalo grass pastures Macfarlane and Shelton 1986. Subsequent measurements of liveweight gains of smallholder cattle grazing buffalo grass containing the naturalised legumes Desmodium canum and Vigna hosei showed average gains of 7 kgheadday over a 100day measurement period B. Mullen, pers. comm. 1990. Stocking rate was also an important variable in animal production although only four of the experiments reported comparative liveweight gain data obtained at different stocking rates. These were analysed using the stocking rate model of Jones and Sandland 1974, as follows liveweight gainhead abx, and liveweight gainha axbx2, where x stocking rate a yaxis intercept b slope and a2b the optimum stocking rate. In interpreting these models, it is emphasised that the optimum stocking rates calculated are simply the points at which liveweight gain per ha is maximised over the period of the experiment, and do not necessarily represent the optimum stocking rate where pasture persistence andor economic returns are maximised. Extrapolation and interpretation of results much beyond the measured points should be done with caution. Figures 1 4 demonstrate the importance of stocking rate effects on liveweight gain per ha and per head. Highest liveweight gains per ha were obtained in Bali at an optimum stocking rate of 7 cattleha in an open stand of coconuts Fig. 1, Table 2. Intermediate levels were measured in Solomon Islands Fig. 2 and 3, Table 2, whilst productivity was lowest in the experiment reported from Thailand Fig. 4, Table 1. Some care is needed when interpreting the data from Bali as calculated optimums were outside the actual stocking rates employed Rika et al. 1981. As previously mentioned, productivity was clearly associated with light transmission which was highest in the Bali experiment and lowest in the Thailand experiment. Other aspects of the productivity relationships were less clearcut. The intercept values a, which indicate the liveweight gains of cattle at very low stocking rates and therefore reflect the quality of pastures, were highest in Solomon Islands experiments Table 2. This may have been due to the higher legume contents of these pastures in Solomon Islands compared to the Bali and Thailand trials. On the other hand, the slope b of the regression line, which reflects the ability of pastures to maintain liveweight gain as stocking rate increases, was similar for the Solomon Islands and Thailand experiments range of 6 to 2 but much lower in the Bali experiment. This latter result may have been due the replacement of the sown grasses by more grazingtolerant grasses which were able to maintain animal productivity even at high stocking rates Table 2 Rika et al. 1981. Sustainability of Production The potential for sustainable animal production was given as one of the advantages of integration of cattle under coconuts compared with other plantation crops. However, in three of the four longterm studies quoted, the original sown grasses either did not persist or were greatly reduced as a component of the pastures Table 2. Sown grasses tended to be replaced by more grazingtolerant grass species such as Cynodon dactylon in Bali Rika et al. 1981 and Axonopus compressusSome of the sown legumes were initially more persistent than the grasses e.g. Centrosema pubescens but declined with time with a concomitant increase in naturalised legumes such as Mimosa pudica Watson and Whiteman 1981b. These studies demonstrate that persistent grasses are required to ensure that forage systems are sustainable. The control of unpalatable weed infestation in pastures under coconuts is another key aspect of sustainability of production Steel, 1977, and can be related to both level of management and vigour of pastures. Good management may involve not only correct choice of pasture species to plant, but also judicious weeding of intractable weed species, fertilizer application to forages on poorer soils, and control of stocking rates to maintain vigorous pastures. A survey of 610yearold Batiki pastures Ischaemum aristatum on Malaita Island in Solomon Islands showed an average weed content of 50 and a range up to 70 depending on the adequacy of weed management and light transmission Litscher and Whiteman 1982. Weed infestations were higher under lower light conditions, indicating the need for vigorous and persistent species tolerant of lower light levels. It is clear that nonvigorous grasses such as para grass Brachiaria mutica were associated with high weed content Reynolds 1980, while vigorous stoloniferous species such as buffalo grass showed low weed contents and therefore greater sustainability Macfarlane and Shelton 1986. Conclusions It can be seen that animal production varies among plantations with liveweight gains influenced by a number of factors, particularly incident light levels. Productivity is highest in open plantations where light transmission is highest. Animal performance is enhanced by the planting of improved forages and particularly by the presence of legumes in the pasture. However, longterm sustainability of production will depend on the use of species which will not only persist under grazing but maintain sufficient vigour to keep pastures relatively free of weeds. In the past, studies have shown that grass species have been less persistent than legumes. The reasons for this are not well understood. New species are required which are adapted to the lower light regime of coconut plantations and are able to persist under regular defoliation. Compatible legumes will be a prerequisite if high liveweight gains are to be achieved. Review of Forage Resources in Plantation Crops of Southeast Asia and the Pacific W.W.Stuulautr and H.M.Shelton Abstract Vast tracts of land in plantations in Southeast Asia and the Pacific sustain the growth of naturally occurring forages. The productivity of these forages under grazing is generally low, but most are persistent and well adapted to the local environmental and management conditions. No species is productive at light levels of less than 30 because of the limited production potential at lowlight environments. In plantations with light transmissions of 3050, species such as Axonopus compressus, Stenotaphrum secundatum, Ischaemum aristatum and Desmodium heterophyllum are successful. At light levels higher than 50,the more productive introduced species warrant consideration. A greater range of species is required which will persist and suppress weeds at moderate light intensities and low management levels. A brief description of the principal species currently used for forage supply in plantation crops is given. PLANTATION tree crops do not intercept all incoming light and consequently there is scope for the growth of natural vegetation or the cultivation of other useful introduced species. From an animal production point of view, understorey natural vegetation can be divided into species which are eaten by ruminants and those which are unpalatable. In this context, the latter will be referred to as weeds while the eaten species will be called forages. Undoubtedly, many plantation managers would use a different definition of the term weed. The vast majority of available land in coconut, rubber and oil palm plantations is occupied by naturally occurring species. However, there are considerable areas of planted cover crops and very limited areas of planted forages. This article describes the environment in which the three major plantation types coconut, rubber and oil palm occur, discusses the adaption and value of the most frequently encountered naturally occurring and sown forage species, and reviews the potential for making best use of existing forage resources in plantation crops. Distribution and Habitat of Plantation Crops The climatic and edaphic requirements of rubber and oil palm Purseglove 1968, 1972 are somewhat similar, while coconut has different requirements Table 1. Rubber and oil palm are grown mainly in the lowlands of the humid tropics, with high rainfall and no or only short dry seasons. While these crops can be grown on a wide range of soils they are usually found on acidic soils of low fertility. Coconut, on the other hand, is grown chiefly along coastal belts in areas with an annual rainfall of 13002600 mm. Long dry periods are detrimental but can be tolerated where there is a good ground water supply. Long sunshine hours are required for high productivity. Coconut is grown on less acidic soils than rubber and oil palm, and is often found on alkaline and saline soils. The fertility of coconut soils varies from fertile volcanic soils to infertile coralline sands. The latter soils may be deficient in potassium Macfarlane and Shelton 1986 and iron Gutteridge 1978. The root distribution of coconut and oil palm is similar with the majority of roots being concentrated within 23m of the trunk Purseglove 1972 Kushwah et al. 1973 Steel and Humphreys 1974, although some laterals occur."

        "text": "The Lizard of OZ The frillnecked lizard is one of the great symbols of Australia, along with the kangaroo and the koala. But until now little has been known about the lifestyle of this most distinctive animal. TEXT BY RICK SHINE bullet PHOTOGRAPHY BY DAVID CURL SQUINTING in the suns glare, I strained to focus on the small, slender gum tree by the roadside. For the third time Billy Moore pointed at the tiny sapling 10 metres away, and again he spoke Blanket lizard. His patient tone suggested he wasnt in the least surprised to discover I was effectively bushblind, like most nonAboriginal people of his acquaintance. I was discovering how a spectacularly distinctive reptile, measuring almost a metre from nose to tip of tail, can be so beautifully camouflaged as to be almost invisible to the untrained eye. Billy had spotted the blanket lizard, better known to most Australians as the frillnecked lizard, as our fourwheeldrive vehicle lurched along a dusty track about 20 kilometres from the town of Jabiru in Kakadu National Park. Frillnecked lizards frillies for short are predominantly treedwellers and extremely shy. To hide when clinging to a tree trunk, they sidle around it so that only the tips of their slender long toes are visible to a keeneyed observer. In theory, therefore, the easiest way to find a frilly is to look for these toes poking around the tree trunk. In practice its not so easy, especially when bouncing along a bumpy road at 30 kmh. But to the Gagudju people, the bemmung an Aboriginal reference to the folds of skin around its neck is a particularly soughtafter traditional food. Trackers like Billy are extremely adept at toespotting from a distance. The frillnecked lizard, with its huge Elizabethan ruff of loose erectile skin behind its head, is one of the most distinctive animals in the world. It must surely qualify as one of the great symbols of Australia, along with the kangaroo and the koala. For many years it was portrayed on our nowdefunct 2c coin, and toyshops are full of plastic models that have become popular tourist souvenirs, yet until recently noone had researched anything about the ecology and behaviour of this celebrated species. When I began my investigations in 1985, I discovered there was not a single scientific paper on the frillnecks biology. This lack of research is surprising, because frillnecks are common, often abundant, in the tropical savannah and woodlands of northern Australia. They were even found in the suburbs of Brisbane before urban development destroyed their habitat. So why havent they been studied Mostly, it seems, because reptiles in general have attracted far less scientific interest than our warm and cuddly mammals. This is a real pity, because Australias reptiles are every bit as unique and distinctive as our betterknown marsupials. What would we want to know about frillnecks Well, the obvious first question is Why do they have such enormous frills Display structures in the neck region, like skin folds and beards, are widespread among lizards, but no other species has anything even approaching the size of this magnificent ornament. Indeed, the frill must be one of the largest display structures, relative to body size, in any animal species. The frillys threat display is truly impressive. The lizard stands on its hind legs, gapes widely to reveal some very impressive teeth, and erects its large frill by means of Ushaped bones in the throat region. This complex combination of bone and cartilage works rather like the spokes of an umbrella. The frill itself can extend to be larger than a dinner plate, covering a diameter more than four times the width of the lizards body. The combined effect of this display is enough to startle any observer. While theres no doubt that the frill is used as a threat display to deter attacks, can this be its only function Its been suggested that it works as a parachute, allowing the lizard to glide from trees, or that it channels sound into the creatures ears, improving its hearing. Others speculate that the frills folds are used to store food, or to aid body temperature control, acting either as a parasol, a solar panel or a heatdissipating structure, like an elephants ears. Even without their frills these lizards are interesting, and there are other questions to ask about their natural history, the answers to which may, in the long run, prove vital in planning conservation policies for this remarkable species. I hope frillneck numbers remain high, but their disappearance from southern Queensland over the past 30 years suggests that we need to keep a close eye on their wellbeing. Should we ever need to plan frillneck reserves, well need to know what habitats they use, what they eat, when they reproduce, how many eggs they produce, how far they roam, and why they apparently disappear during the dry season, reappearing only at the onset of the wetseason monsoons. My involvement with frillnecks began in a roundabout way. I had researched the ecology of southern Australian reptiles especially snakes for many years, but my first visit to the Northern Territory was in 1982, when a government environmental agency, the Office of the Supervising Scientist OSS, offered me a research consultancy to study file snakes and goannas in Kakadu National Park. Kakadu is a very exciting place for any herpetologist, and it was all I could do to concentrate my efforts on the few species that were the subject of the consultancy. I promised myself I would return for a closer look at some of the other remarkable reptiles that inhabit the Top End. The frillnecked lizard was top of my list. These magnificent creatures would regularly hurtle across the bush tracks in front of our vehicles, scurrying on their hind legs to the safety of the nearest tree. There, however, they could be lassoed with the aid of a cord attached to a 6 m fibreglasspole and gently brought to the ground. After Billy Moores instruction course, I also became quite competent at spotting frillies clinging to small trees. Research assistant Rob Lambeck and I captured about 40 frillnecks during the two years of my consultancy. We weighed and measured them and flushed their stomachs with water to examine their diet, which consisted mainly of caterpillars, ants, termites, beetles and other insects. One stomach contained an estimated 1250 flying ants Incredibly, all the lizards we caught were adult males not a single female or juvenile was seen. Its not unusual to get highly skewed sex ratios when collecting reptile, especially during the mating season, but this seemed extreme. We spent many hours speculating on where all the females might be. Clearly, I would have to try to solve such puzzles. With grants from the Australian Geographic Society and the University of Sydney, and support from the OSS and Pancontinental Mining Ltd, we returned to Kakadu on three occasions in 1985, 1986 and Rob and I prepared for our field work by examining all of the preserved specimens of frillnecks in the research collections of the Northern Territory Museum and the Australian Museum. We got permission to disect them so we could examine their stomach contents and reproductive organs. We studied almost 200 specimens, and a few general points began to emerge. Frillies are highly seasonal breeders, the males testes enlarging late in the Dry and females probably laying two or possibly three clutches of eggs, one late in the Dry NovemberDecember and any further clutches during the Wet FebruaryMarch. The clutches consist of 415 eggs, with the larger clutches being produced by the larger females. Male frillnecks grow much bigger averaging over 250mm from snout to vent than the females, which average around 200mm. Our plan for that first field season was simple. We would observe the animals during their mating season, at the very end of the dry season, in November and December. Knowing the lizards would be shy and wary, we decided to implant miniature radio transmitters in three of them, each transmitter about the size of the cap on a ball point pen and weighing 15 grams, which is 26 per cent of the frillnecks body weight. This would enable us to monitor their movements and the manner in which they used various habitat. We could then watch their activity from a distance so they wouldnt be disturbed. Unfortunately, three things went wrong on that first trip. First, we still couldnt find any female frillies. Second, the weather was against us without regular rain, the frillies stopped most of their activity and third, observing them in the field was more difficult than wed expected. Instead of us watching them, they watched us Even if we moved so far away that they were difficult to observe through binoculars, any unwary move by us brought an immediate reaction from the lizards. Their eyesight must be phenomenal, and clearly we werent witnessing natural behaviour. The lizards stayed high in their trees, only descending to change trees after we had left. We never saw any of our three monitored lizards erect their frills for any reason. The solution was obvious we needed to use hides so the lizards couldnt see us. When Rob and I returned to Kakadu in 1986, we had an extra helper zoologist Tony Pople plus three folding stools and three small portable hessian hides, each just large enough to conceal one of us sitting inside, peering through small slits. This time everything worked perfectly. Light rain every day or two kept the lizards active, and we eventually caught more than Best of all, eight were females We implanted transmitters in six males and five females and began to observe them in earnest. It was soon obvious that wed planned it right and arrived in the middle of the mating season. On the first day of observation Tony located one of the wired males lying beside another male, as if they had fallen together from a tree. He watched them engage in a vigorous battle, displaying their frills at each other before charging with mouths agape to wrestle with interlocked jaws. From the outset of my work with frillnecks Id noticed that many males had badly damaged jaws. Sometimes the lower jawbone was snapped cleanly in half. Jawwrestling was the only likely reason for such terrible injuries. Recent studies on fossil water dragons from Riversleigh in northwestern Queensland had revealed one beautifully preserved lower jawbone with a healed fracture. My guess is that the fracture was due to jawwrestling, which means Australian male dragon lizards, the family group to which the frillneck belongs, must have been fighting like this for 15 million years The hides worked perfectly, with the lizards ignoring us as long as we remained quiet. Rob saw a male erect his frill several time, apparently in some kind of territorial display. After the weeks of frustration the previous year, it seemed we might finally be able to solve some of the mysteries that had intrigued us for so long. At first light the next morning, we were spread out in the woodland, crouched inside our hides as usual, eagerly waiting for the lizards to begin their morning activities. I had chosen to watch an unmonitored male we had found, but not disturbed, the day before. It wasnt long before the first rays of sunshine brought him down from the canopy to bask on the trunk of a small tree. Suddenly, he began lashing his powerful tail against the trunk, making a sound that could be heard for at least 20m. Then he pushed his body away from the trunk with stiff front legs and began bobbing. With each bob, he partly opened his mouth and began displaying his frill in a most impressive way. This frillwaving reminded me of soldiers waving a flag at the enemy. Clearly, territorial display was one function of the frill. The more I thought about it, the more it made sense. The frill is waved to let other males know that a particular area has been claimed."

I would urge members to give consideration to nominating as a Director. This is a very important period for the Association and Justices of the Peace as a whole. Please give it some thought. INCOME TAX We have received a further assessment from the Taxation Department for Notional Tax for the Years 1989This is for 3,00 due for payment on 30th July, 1990, but deferred until 17th December, 1990, when it will have to be paid in full. Thnk goodness that with the purchase of our own Administration Centre we will eventually see the end of the Income Tax Assessments. The total Income Tax that the Association will have paid out by the end of 1990 will be in the vicinity of 33,000 NO NEED TO READ OUT AT MEETING FOR SECRETARIES AND TREASURERS ONLY The Board of Directors has asked me to notify you that Phone calls on behalf of the Association are to be reimbursed at the rate of 22c as this is the current rate charged by Telecom.

I hope to see many of you at this Meeting. 1991 FEES The Board of Directors has asked me to advise you that the 1991 Fees are as follows Ordinary Membership 00 Branch 00 HO 00 Retired Membership 00 Branch 00 HO 00 The HusbandWife Membership has been reintroduced for those who agree to receive one Journal in February, May and August. They will have to receive two Journals in November as this one contains the Ballot Paper. The rates are Ordinary Membership HusbandWife 00 Branch 00 HO 00 Retired Membership HusbandWife 00 Branch 00 HO 00 The Board has asked me to point out that the increase in fees is in no way due to the purchase of the Administration Centre as this has been funded from Association Investments plus the loan from Westpac. Our repayments to Westpac are less than the rent would be at the Burwood Office. The increase in fees is due to the normal increase in running expenses. RENEWAL NOTICE IN JOURNAL The November Journal is now being printed and this will contain a Renewal Notice as a loose leaf inset. This means that Branches will no longer have to send out Renewal Notices and that every financial member will receive a Renewal Notice with the Journal. This should mean a saving in postage for Branches. Secretaries will still have to follow up overdue fees. There is a section for Husband and wives to agree to receive only one Journal except for November. Secretaries must pass this information on to me so the computer can be programmed. If permission is not given, or not forwarded to me two Journals will continue to be sent out. A Change of Address section is also included. I hope this new procedure will result in cost savings and increased efficiency.

        "text": "DOROTHY HEWETT THE TOUCHER C H A P T E R N I N E THEY SAT AT A TABLE FOR two beside the picture windows eating oysters and drinking Veuve Cliquot. Under the lights along Marine Parade, the sunburnt holidaymakers strolled in bikinis and swimsuits, cars pulled in and out of the parking lot, childrens voices echoed back from the dark edge of the sea where the surf broke in a long glassy roll. The bay was fringed with great crags and scrubby headland, black against the night sky. The lighthouse on Breaksea flicked on and off, making a path across the ocean. Its a heavenly place, Esther, Ern said, and it seems to agree with you. Ive never seen you looking so well. I came all this way to comfort a widow and what do I find His voice sounded almost resentful. What did you expect to find she mocked him. Grief, bitterness, I dont know, but youve always been unpredictable. Why did you really come To take you back with me. Really Yes, until you get on your feet again. Merle and I discussed it, we want you to stay with us. And then Whatever you like. Find a place, perhaps, on the peninsula. You always loved it there. And settle down amongst all those millionaires, she said drily. Christ, Ern, the sale of my house wouldnt even buy a hut on the peninsula. You could find something small. Anyway, that was the plan, and instead dotted line Instead, she said, you find me here at the end of the world, looking content. Not exactly content, more like overexcited. Whats exciting you, Esther Is it the new novel Perhaps. Writers are so selfsufficient, he grumbled, I can never make them out. She laughed. I thought you spent your life doing just that. Oh yes, I try, but I never really understand them. I just publish them. And God knows how long that will last. Esther looked up, startled. What do you mean Ive been taken over. For a moment she wondered whether this was some kind of diabolic possession. Taken over she reiterated. The multinationals have got me, love. But why she said, already knowing the answer. Going broke, cant keep my head above water, getting too long in the tooth for it, all the wheeling and dealing. I just wanted to publish good books. She thought of the prodigious, restless energy of this large fat man and mourned for its passing. Will it change things she asked him. Theyve promised I can keep my own show going under their umbrella. Ive got a good list and they know it and my writers trust me. Dont they She nodded and put her hand over his pudgy fist. Weve built up mutual relationships but when dollars rule the roost, trust goes out the window. He hit the table, making the glasses dance. I valued my independence, Esther. Dont we all. Oh well, cant be helped. Everything changes. Remember He grinned at her and gulped his drink down. Weve all got to survive, except for poor bloody old Matt. How long is it now since hedotted line went Seven months. Time flies, he said, does it for you I meant to come long ago. He placed his big hand over hers. Forgive me, but Im glad youre still looking so lovely. Oh Ern, she said lightly, Im old and Im overweight and youre the only man on earth who still makes me feel beautiful. Thats because Im old and overweight and I love you, he said simply. I always have, but I worry about you because youre too far away. Whats this new novel like A mess. You always say that. Well, its at the messy stage when nothing comes quite right. Title Love Letters to a Friend. Good. Are they really letters Sort of letters, musings, reminiscences. Whats the plot Its postmodern it hasnt got one. It wont sell. Its a love story with a sad ending. But shes reconciled. Thatll sell. He raised his glass. Well, heres to it. No good asking when you expect to finish She raised her eyebrows at him. Okay, he grumbled, but dont shillyshally too long. Its been three years since that childrens book and how long since your last novel There was that collection of short stories but no novel since The Fatal River, thats too long, Esther. He wheeled her down the road towards the beach, past the sign that warned fishermen about the king waves rolling in from nowhere to sweep them off the rocks into the sea. The crowds had thinned out, only a few children from the caravan park played on the promontories of seaweed thrusting out into the surf. A lone swimmer struck out for the little jetty, where the fishermen were unpacking their tackle. She sat in the half darkness, her white hair and silky dress phosphorescent in the light off the waves. Are you really lonely, Esther he asked her. Yes, but usually Ive got Clarrie with me. Your housekeeper Weve known each other off and on forever. We even went to primary school together, but shes away just now looking after her daughters children. So how do you manage Oh, people come in. Ive got somebody now, a temporary, but shes back with her family over Christmas. What about your secretary Hes quite competent. So youre all organised. He paused. But what about real people, people to relate to Theyre all real, Ern, she said gently. I know I sound like an awful snob, but you know what I mean. Intellectuals I dont know any of them any more. And dont miss them Of course, she said drily, but youd be surprised what you can find hidden away in a little town like this. A lover She grinned up at him. How did you know Its written all over you. She grimaced. As obvious as all that To me, yes. I hope he treats you well. So do I, she said, suddenly serious, and shivered. As the hire car sped up Ocean Beach Drive, she looked up automatically towards the mountain slope, checking on Bens windows, but everything was still dark. My eldest child lives up there, she said. Hes fortyfive years old and I cant believe it. How have I managed to survive for so long How have any of us he said. Do you see much of him No, but at least I know hes there. Do you ever see Stephen now No, I dont even know if hes still alive. I bet he is, Ern said. Stephen was tough. Dont you remember all those cases he won against impossible odds, when we were all communists together Stephen was never a communist, Esther said, he was too smart for that. He was always the fellow traveller hanging round the fringes. Whereas you and I and Matt were in it once, boots and all, Ern said. Do you know what annoys me most about my years in the party now That for so long we were apparently content to take the word of men who were our intellectual inferiors. Why did we do it, Esther Because we wanted to change the world, she said. Because we wanted to believe. Matt had been expelled from the communist party for criticising the leadership. Esther, Ern and Merle had left after the Hungarian uprising, although Esther had been under a political cloud since shed disappeared into Europe with Paul and hadnt come back to Australia for seven years. A responsible cadre didnt throw the party over for sex and travel. And now, Ern said, therere no communists left and were both members of the largest political party on earth, the excommunists. Matt said they were doing it all over again and theyd get it right next time. Ern grunted. Matt was a political optimist. They followed the turnoff to the point, past the golf links, the lake and the bird sanctuary. Youre hiding something, Esther, he said. Dont be ridiculous, what have I got to hide I dont know, but I intend to find out. A promise or a threat she said. As they drove into the garden, they could hear the phone ringing through the empty house. Do you want me to answer that Ern asked her, and, at her nod, went lumbering across the lawn with surprising agility for such a heavy man. He came back to the car looking puzzled. Its some girl, she wouldnt give me her name. Sounded a bit hysterical, I couldnt really make head or tail of it. I think I know who it is. Want me to head her off No, Id better talk to her. Better face the bloody music, whatever it is, she thought, but when she picked up the phone, her hand was shaking. Listen, bitch, hissed the thin, hoarse voice, y better get round ere quick an bail out y precious boyfriend. I beg your pardon Esther said. Beg y pardon, mocked the voice. Dont give me none a that posh shit an dont hang up on me neither. Either y come for im now or the coppers will, so take y pick. I dont know your address. Last house above the harbour under the mountain, y cant miss it. It looks like shit The phone clicked off in her ear. Whats the matter Ern said, his hand on her shoulder. Would you mind. she said, it seems as if I have to go on a rescue mission. Even with the map, it took them a while to find the place, a dark deadend tucked away amongst the scrub under a granite outcrop, a lockedup silent street except for one shabby little fibro set off by itself in an overgrown garden. The front door was wide open, blazing with nightlight and noise. A police car was parked out front. Stop here, Ern, Esther told him, and turn out your lights. Struggling between the meaty hands of two local police, Billy erupted onto the front porch, both arms bandaged and twisted up behind him, while Iris stood screaming abuse in the doorway. Whatve I done Billy wailed. Wherere y takin me Down to the station, Billy, well sort it all out down there. Billy sat down in the middle of the concrete path, his head buried in his knees. Better cool it, mate, the first policeman said. Billy raised his arms in a melodramatic gesture, the blood seeping beneath the bandages. Look what y done now. He turned his pitiful face towards Iris. I try t die for y an y put me inter the coppers. Iris tore down the path and threw her arms around Billys neck. Dont touch im she screamed, aiming a knee at the sergeants groin. Listen, missus, you watch out or Ill put you on a charge, he said angrily. It was you rung us up, remember. It was you charged im with assault in the first place. Let im go, Iris sobbed, I didnt mean none of it. Do y withdraw the charge then, madam Yairs, Iris wailed, I want im back. Okay, its your funeral. But dont go wastin our time again bringin us out ere on a wild goose chase or youll find yself in serious trouble. Grumbling, they climbed into the police car. The driver put his head out the window. If I was you, Billy, he said sardonically, Id get them wrists seen to in casualty. They might turn septic. They drove away down the dark street as all the curtains twitched back into place. I cant handle it, Iris, Billy sobbed, I just cant handle it any more. Cmon, Iris crooned, cmon now, love. She lifted him up and lugged him back along the path into the house. Lets go home, Ern, said Ether. Afterwards they sat out on the front verandah, smoking cigarillos, and sipping whisky and ice, listening in the stillness to the occasional plop and splash of bird or fish on the surface of the river."

        "text": "TOXOPLASMOSIS by Kathy Jacobs, Ringwood, Vic. IN GR 103 I discussed responsible cat ownership this time I will give you some information about toxoplasmosis and how to manage it. It is meant as a guide only and not the beall and endall. If you are at all concerned andor want further information, consult your vet or GP. WHAT IS TOXOPLASMOSIS Toxoplasmosis Toxoplasmosis gondii is an obligate able to survive only in a particular environment, intracellular protozoan single celled organism, in this case parasitic also. It exists in three forms. Three Forms Tachyzoites, which are oval, about three by seven millimetres in size, and invade virtually all mammalian cells. Cysts, which form within hosts cells and may contain thousands of organisms. Cysts can be from 10100 millimetres in size. They are found throughout the body but mainly in skeletal and heart muscles and the central nervous system. Cysts are the major method of transmission as they may be in animals pork, beef, lamb, goat, and then ingested. Oocysts are ten to twelve millimetres in size and formed only in the mucosal and intestinal cells of members of the cat family. It is the only animal which allows the organism to have a complete sexual cycle. Found in about one percent of cats, with a greater incidence in kittens. Different Types of Toxoplasmosis There is congenital toxoplasmosis when a baby is infected in utero and acquired toxoplasmosis which has two forms. By far the most common is lymphadenopathic, which tends to closely resemble glandular fever. There is also the disseminated type which can be very severe and affect all major organs. Symptoms in Humans The lymphadenopathic toxoplasmosis may be asymptomatic have no noticeable symptoms or have symptoms similar to glandular fever tiredness, headache, neck stiffening, swollen glands, nausea, fever, muscle pain and rash. The disseminated form can manifest by the above symptoms and pneumonia, inflammation of the coverings of the heart and brain, enlargement of the liver and spleen, brain abscesses, confusion, photophobia abnormal sensitivity of the eyes to light. It is extremely rare in healthy people. The congenital form is usually marked by lesions of the central nervous system, which can lead to blindness and mental retardation. The symptoms in humans are similar to those experienced in cats. How Toxoplasmosis is Caught Humans and cats catch toxoplasmosis through ingestion of raw or incompletely cooked meat which contains cysts. IT is believed that 10 percent of lamb and 25 percent of pork contains cysts. Cysts have also been found in beef and goat meat but statistics are not available. Toxoplasmosis may also be caught from the ingestions of oocysts from cat faeces, although these do not become infective for between 24 hours and seven days. Oocysts may also survive in the soil, under favourable conditions, for up to one year. Prevalence It is estimated that in Australia about 4050 percent of the poplation has been infected. Very few people are aware that they have had the disease. Who is Particularly at Risk People who are immuno suppressed, such as those receiving chemotherapy, or with diseases relating to suppressed immune systems. These may develop disseminated toxoplasmosis. Pregnant women It is estimated that if a pregnant woman catches toxoplasmosis while pregnant there is a 3040 percent chance that her baby will be affected. Of these babies about 15 percent will be seriously affected. However, effect is generally dependant on the stage of pregnancy. For example, the earlier in the pregnancy the less likely that the disease will cross the placenta 15 percent in the first trimester, however the effects are more severe than if caught later in pregnancy when the incidence is closer to 65 percent, but the disease is generally asymptomatic. Diagnosis and Vaccination Diagnosis is by a simple blood test, or more frequently two, to avoid the chance of false positive or negative. There is no vaccine available, but infection confers immunity in both humans and cats. Once you have had it, you are immune. Preventative Measures bullet Be very careful handling raw meat. Wear gloves or wash your hands well afterwards. bullet Cook meat well. bulletAvoid acquiring a new cat, especially a kitten, while pregnant. bullet Clean cat litter trays daily so oocysts do not have a chance to become infectious. A flush and good scrub with water is generally enough, but ammonia, bleach nonchloride or hydrogen peroxide can also be used. If possible, someone other than the pregnant woman should do this. bullet Wear gloves when gardening and wash hands afterwards this applies if cats have, or have had in the past year, access to your garden. bullet Wash all homegrown vegies. Heat of 60degreeC or boiling water destroys oocysts. bulletIf your cat hasnt had toxoplasmosis you can have it blood tested too or you dont know its status, you can take measures to prevent infection. bullet Feed it tinned or dry food or raw meat that has been frozen to at least 20degreeC for several days domestic freezers may not reach or maintain this temperature. bullet If meat has not been frozen it should be cooked. bullet Cats that do not scavenge or hunt are also less likely to catch toxoplasmosis as rats and mice are a source of infection. Treatment Lymphodenopathic toxoplasmosis, if symptomatic, is usually treated with a one or two month course of trimethoprim, pyrimethomine andor sulfadiazine. In more severe cases duration of treatment is generally longer and dosages are higher. Infected newborn are also treated and there is generally some improvement. I am not aware of any homoeopathic treatments, consult a qualified practitioner if you are interested. Toxoplasmosis is a fairly common infection, with about half the population of Australia having been infected. However, it is believed that less than seven percent of healthy infected people will exhibit any symptoms and these are generally very mild, such as tiredness and swollen glands which last a few days until immunity develops. As I stated at the beginning of this article this is not the beall and endall of toxoplasmosis, nor is it meant to be frightening. If you want more information, consult a qualified practitioner. Fairfield Hospital Vic should also be able to answer queries.

Everycat, Browning, Herb for Arthritis Relief By Russ Maslen, Mullumbimby, NSW I was weeding the plant out from around a tree in Brunswick Valley Heritage Park in Mullumbimby in 1989 when an unknown chap mentioned to me that if one chewed and swallowed two leaves a day for three months that arthritis would be cured or alleviated. I was not particularly interested but mentioned it to my wife who had problems with her hands her knuckles and wrist were swollen, fingers locking and painful and she decided to try the plant. By November of 1989 she put on her wedding ring again and now does not have any sign of previous symptoms. In March of 1990 I finally went to my doctor because of troubles with my neck and arm. After wearing a neck brace, Xrays, CAT scan, neurophysiologist and nerve conduction tests it was recommended that I have an operation on vertebrae in my neck because of sensory radiculopathy. I did not like that idea very much and started eating my leaves. I now have no trouble in the above and am able to look up or over my shoulder and have not had the operation. Numerous other people have used the plant since then and have had obvious, visible relief and in some cases have Xrays and so on of their previous condition which they state no longer exists. My wife and I have been using the plant for over three years and have not noticed any side effects, in fact it has been beneficial in a number of other ways. Most people to date have taken two leaves daily but as a result of additional information which I now have, my wife and I have commenced taking three leaves, about the size of a 20 cent coin, a day. We have used this amount for about six months. Since the active constituents are a percentage of the weight of the leaf take correspondingly more to make up the same weight if the leaves are smaller. Say, four or five of 10 cent size. Do not take more than this until further tests have been done. It does not appear to matter when leaves are taken, we have ours when we think of it. When the plant is found in the wild make sure to dig up the parsnip root as well as the fine roots along the runners and dont break off the runners. Plant the lot. Since three leaves a day is equivalent to 90 a month put the plants into a large container or into the garden bed. Watch out for snails they love it. A lot of plants are needed in order to keep up with demand. It prefers a sheltered situation out of direct sun but not too wet. Water the same as any other pot plant. GENERAL INFORMATION Two species of centella also known as pennywort and gotu kola exist in Australia Centella asiatica also occurs in Africa, Madagscar, India and the Pacific islands, and Centella cordifolia which from the very recent redescription of the genus occurs in the southern states of Australia. Originally one species was thought to be in Australia with an early name of Hydrocotyle asiatica. This was changed to Centella asiatica. The genus was then divided into two species with C.cordifolia being considered widespread. The very recent description shows C.asiatica as occurring in all states and C.cordifolia localised in southern areas only and uncommon. Based on the previous descriptions I had considered the plant which we have been using to be C.cordifolia. This is now incorrect as per the new description published at the end of It now appears that under the new botanical description it is Centella asiatica and occurs in all states, with Centella cordifolia being poorly known. Samples received from all over the country are virtually identical to the plant shown in the illustration. DESCRIPTION OF PLANT Both species are a creeping herb and like damper places but often grow in open locations including garden beds and lawns. It is also quite often found along fences, under trees or shrubs and along the edge of paths and garden beds. It does not like sandy soils close to the beach. Centella asiatica has a more or less circular leaf which is toothed around the edge, particularly near the slot in the leaf. It is quite often flecked with white blotches and may have reddish dots in the leaf. The leaf has a Vshaped slot with straight edges leading to the stem. These features are shown in the diagram. Leaf size varies from little fingernail size up to seven centimetres in more shelter. Plants in open locations are quite bitter to taste whereas ones in more shelter are almost tasteless but with a herby flavour. Centella cordifolia is described as having leaves longer than broad but otherwise very similar. A 10 centimetre long parsnip root occurs under the central part of the plant. Both plants root at the nodes, that is, where the leaves grow from the creeping stem. The flowers and fruits seeds form on a very short stalk about one centimetre long and are not usually seen unless you part the leaves and look closely. The flowers are minute and can only be seen with a magnifying glass. They have pink to red petals, but with the naked eye this appears as a pinkish tinge only. The fruits are a flattened disc about three millimetres across and are usually in a group of three. They sit up like toast in a rack. SIMILAR PLANTS There are a number of similar plants such as kidney weed, but if a leaf is placed flat beside the diagram and the shape is checked differences will be seen.

        "text": "Jean Palmer, 83 Carlton Parade, Punchbowl. NSW. Australia. Saturday, 13 June Dear Myrtle, Its only 45 a.m. on a cold, dark winter morning and I cant sleep, so why not get out of bed and send off a few words to you something I have been meaning to do for several weeks now. How are you Ive thought of you a lot since my return, and Ive wondered how your health has been. You seemed so optimistic about yourself when we spoke on the phone, and that is always a big plus where health is concerned. Since my return I have been busy, but I have found it hard to settle to the responsibilities. Some months ago I was saying to people who asked I think Ive gone through this long grieving period of ten years and now Im coming out the other side Famous last words. However, Ive been in the depths before and Ive struggled to the top, and Ill do it again. Every time Arch shows a further deterioration it affects me like this, then I grow accustomed to the deterioration and we go on. The last few days I have been spending many hours with Arch he has the flu, and is very uncomfortable, struggling with very nasty congestion on the chest and a fever. My sleep is fitful because Ive asked them to ring me if he shows any sign of distress. My head tells me that his quality of life is so poor that it would be a good thing if he died, but my heart says I dont want that. Its a time of mixed emotions. Now that I have told you the sad part, Ill look for some positive things. Our family and their kids lead very busy lives, but they are always there if I need them. Lynne and Nikki from Tasmania are due in Sydney early in July, and then I go to Melbourne and Tasmania for about two weeks in mid August provided Arch is O.K. of course. Some friends Jim and Betty are due to stay here for a few days next week Jim was Archs workmate they retired to a beachside area on the south coast of NSW, a three hour drive from here. Bettys health has improved since living there, and they are coming to Sydney especially to see Arch. Jim and Arch were very good mates. Then at the end of September we are expecting Archs cousin, Sheila and her friend from England. It is cold this morning, about 43 degrees at 5 am, and the sky is overcast, there is snow on the mountains, and everywhere you go people are complaining about the cold days we are having. Theyre not really cold days in your terms it just means that people are having to put on coats, and start the heaters going in the late afternoon. Les and Muriel Morgan are in regular contact with me, usually by phone at the weekend. Melbourne is 500 miles from here so we dont see a lot of each other every six months or so I go south via Melbourne to Tasmania to a part of our family down there. Les and Muriel keep fairly active. I wrote to Ruth Moore yesterday. Thats about the third letter since Ive returned, and Ive heard nothing from her. But Im hoping that all means that she is busy. She seems to keep fit most times. Well, Myrtle, thats all for now. Please put a few lines on paper when you get the time and let me know how you are faring. It was wonderful to talk to you by phone on both occasions when I was visiting your country not as good as meeting with you personally, of course, but it was second best. I dont know whether Ill get your way again, but I hope so, and then well meet up. Take care love from Jean. 83 Carlton Parade, Punchbowl. NSW. Australia. November 10, 1993 Dear Cousin Sheila, Hows my lovely English rose Its a while since Ive written, and thank you for your recent letter. I was interested in all the news. About 10 days ago I returned from a week in Melbourne staying with Francis and Monica a visit I specifically planned to be present at Les Morgans surprise 80th birday party and then 10 days in Tassie with Lynne, Tich, Nikki and friends all very enjoyable. It takes a while to settle back into routine when youve been away doesnt it I know I get a lot more letters than the average person and the letters take ages to reply to or do whatever the business letters are suggesting that I do. I spent a week in Brisbane some weeks ago, staying at a hotel for a few days it was wonderful it gave me an opportunity to look around at some of the history of the city, and then I stayed with an old workmate for a few days I hadnt seen her for 18 years. News is much the same. Arch still continues on, a little more deteriorated, but still able to walk so I bring him home four afternoons per week. All the kids are busy but very supportive. We have a new addition to the family. Arch and I are grandparents again. Rosie gave birth to a 10 lb. baby girl, Caesarean, on 4th November the 84th wedding anniversary of Tom and Margaret Robertson my parents. 2 names deleted dont have a good relationship unfortunately, but he is as supportive as he can be in such circumstances. The baby will be Miranda, and her second name MAY BE Margaret after Margaret Robertson. The last paragraph will be news to you, as it is to so many other people with the exception of some Sydney folk. At the time I was told about the pregnancy eight months ago name deleted was so distressed that my first priority was to try and support his emotional state, the second priority was to sustain my own equilibrium. We have a serial killer of backpackers in the state as you will probably know. The news has claimed headlines overseas I understand. The way such a killers brain works totally confuses me Im afraid. As I reread your letter I wondered how Rene is now. Is she still taking driving lessons And is Les going to have another operation Also your friend Ron what an experience for him to have. I find it hard to understand how June can look after three grandchildren with her disability your letter before last. I have major concern about Wollongong. The folks are not well. Stan battling on under great strain. Isnt it a fact that the older we get the more our cares and thoughts and conversation is centred on sickness and those loved ones around us who die A fact of life. So youre still getting up at 4 a.m. for coffee and toast As I read that I wished that we lived closer so that we could share some of that time. But actually my sleep has been more settled. Just one night recently when I was up from 2 a.m. to 5 a.m. thinking about a possible battle with the nursing home but it didnt eventuate. To ease the tension of death and dying, two bits of trivia for you which Kay and I discussed today Patrick aged 9 was given his first wrist watch for his birthday. Children many years ago learnt to read watches by about 6 years of age. It surprised me that Patrick bright boy was learning to read the time on his new watch, until I realised that kids these days read mostly digital clocks and watches like 15 written in such figures, and are unaccustomed to reading by the clock hands As Kay and I were talking in this back computer room she said theres the postman , and then remarked that in years gone by people would react Pavlov to the sound of the postmans whistle, now they react to the sound of his motorbike. So dotted line Id like to say that I am heading again to the U.K. soon, Id love to get back there for a short time short only because of Arch, BUT it will be some more months. After Christmas all the family are meeting with Lynne, Tich and Nikki in Hobart for a week. Ill probably return to the north of Tassie with the Ferenczs for a few extra days. Then in February THERE IS TALK from Bill Owen Los Angeles, and widower of Martha, who was widow of an old American Air Force mate of Archs and Les are you following me because Im going to ask questions at the end of this paragraph, that he wants to come to Australia again to travel on the Indian Pacific railway from Sydney to Perth and bring with him Marthas daughter, Debbie. How much time that will involve for me will only be determined when Bill concludes his plans. Now without referring to the last paragraph, how many days will we be spending in Hobart On the other hand have you and June given any more consideration to another trip to Australia Why dont you bring Ron with youYoull forgive me for neglecting my writing now that I have typed two pages to you, wont you I look forward to hearing from you again. My love to your little friend. Keep well, dear Sheila. Love from Jean. Jean Palmer, 83 Carlton Parade, Punchbowl. NSW. January 19, 1994 Hello Dear Francis, I am always pleased to be writing interstate on a Wednesday because it only takes two days to get there. I was glad to get a letter from you in this mornings post. However, I am unsettled about the envelope. Instead of doing crossword puzzles this evening, I want you to sit down and write out 100 times The Palmers post code is 2196 and send it to me. 100 times. Im answering the letter quickly because it is something that I can do without feeling bored. This morning has been a continuous ordeal of trying to take some action and get motivated. Theres plenty to do but nothing to inspire me. Im always tired in this humidity. Rowie said he is never coming back to Sydney in the summer time. It surprised me to learn that Chris and Jet will be away until 21st. I dont know why I expected them back sooner. Thank you Ron Neeson for your interest in my welfare. The anguish of the bush fires has been all pervading papers, radio, TV, people in the street, on the phone. Sheila rang from U.K. Gertrude Slany of Tibor and Gertie fame rang from Perth. I took eight calls from relatives and friends who couldnt get onto Joan and Gil, because their phone lines were out, so that they could get some news as Como was constantly mentioned. Joan and Gil were evacuated from their home but the fires didnt touch their street, although it was in the street running parallel to them. Glynn Bowen Thomas and his friend live at Bilpin Blue Mountains and they were alerted about evacuating. I havent been in touch with them since last week end. A long newsy letter from Bill Owen yesterday written before the earthquake. Ill try and get on to him sometime today. Yes, of course, it will be a delight to have you come and share my tomato soup and pasta. If it suits you to make it further into February would be better, as this morning I had someone on the phone to me trying to get an agreeable date for a number of us to meet, and the end of January seems to be the most acceptable for them. Also Kay and Patrick want me to fly to Canberra with them for a couple of days the last week end of January."

        "text": "State softens crime laws By JOHN McGLUE and MALCOLM QUEKETT THE State Government has been forced to make more concessions on its controversial juvenile crime legislation including moves to appease critics among MPs. The move is also a fresh bid to avoid breaches of United Nations guidelines on human rights. When the juvenile crime legislation was introduced in the Legislative Assembly late yesterday afternoon it contained significant alterations from the draft Bills released last week by Premier Carmen Lawrence. The concessions represent the second wave of backdowns by the Government on its juvenile crime laws, initially announced with considerable fanfare by Deputy Premier Ian Taylor. Last week, the Government was forced to remove clauses relating to the detention of serious repeat juvenile offenders at the Governors pleasure which, in turn, removed the potential for executive intervention in reviews of sentences. Yesterdays key changes are BulletInclusion of a sunset clause under which the new laws will lapse in two years. BulletEstablishment of a group chaired by senior Minister Ernie Bridge to review the legislation over the next two years. BulletExtension of the repeat offender classification, and the penalties which go with it, to cover adults as well as juveniles at whom the legislation was originally aimed. BulletA reduction in the maximum penalty for causing grievous bodily harm in the course of stealing a car from 20 years to 14 years. Several Labor MPs, including Mr Bridge, Jackie Watkins, John Halden, Julian Grill and Judy Edwards, have been concerned about the impact of the new legislation since it was announced by Mr Taylor last month. However, Dr Lawrence denied last night that she had softened the legislation or that the changes were due topressure from within the Labor Party. She said the sunset clause had originally been included in the draft legislation but then taken out. It was reasonable for Parliament to review the legislation after two years and the decision to extend the repeat offender classification to adults strengthened the legislation. Dr Lawrence said the reduction in the maximum penalty for causing grievous bodily harm while stealing a car had been suggested by Chief Justice David Malcolm to maintain relativities in sentencing. In her secondreading speeches on the two juvenile crime Bills in the Assembly yesterday, Dr Lawrence said the Government had yet to be convinced of claims that the legislation breached UN conventions. I should say, however, that the claims made by the Human Rights Commissioner that the UN conventions provide balanced protection of victim and potential victims of crime are frankly unconvincing, she said. In the light of the deficiency in the UN guidelines, the Government has had to apply its own judgment to balancing the protection of the public against the wellbeing of these most serious and dangerous offenders. Opposition Leader Barry MacKinnon told the Assembly the Opposition would support the legislation but questioned the Governments broader approach to juvenile crime. He said the questions included where would young offenders be held, what programs would be set up to deal with them and what was being done to tackle amphetamine use Explosion threat as big fuel tank roofs cave in By LIZ TICKNER and LEEROY BETTI BP refinery staff at Kwinana last night were working to drain eight tanks of crude oil and petrol after their floating roofs collapsed during record rains at the weekend, releasing highly flammable hydrocarbon vapour. Environmental Protection Authority spokesman John Ottaway said it would be another 18 hours before the place would be safe. It was a very tense situation. Until the tanks have been drained into sealed containers its literally a very volatile situation, Dr Ottaway said. Apart from the release of vapour into the atmosphere, one spark could result in the whole lot going up. Although it was dangerous, everything appeared to be well under control. BP health, safety and environment manager John Yates said the floating roofs collapsed into one crude oil tank and seven petrol tanks each with a capacity of about 4000 tonnes on Saturday night. There was no risk to the public. In the 24 hours to 9am yesterday, 215mm of rain was dumped on Kwinana. Perth had its wettest day since records began in 1876 with 6mm. The previous record was 99mm on June 10, The previous record for the month was 1 mm on February 17, Perths average February rainfall is a mere 12 mm. Jandakot received 173mm, Rottnest 141 mm and Perth airport 132mm. Medina received a massive 230 mm. Weather Bureau spokesman Chris Blackford said the freak deluge was the result of a very deep low which developed just off the coast overnight on Friday and early Saturday. Residents of some of Perths northwestern suburbs were woken to the eerie roar of an approaching hail storm about 30 am on Saturday. Hail the size of big tom bolwer marbles hit the northwestern suburbs, the worst affected area being around Glendalough, where windows were broken, cars damaged and trees uprooted. The Hills suburb of Roleystone was also hit hard. Some residents of the Amaroo Retirement Village in Gosnells had to be evacuated and were still in temporary accommodation last night. Banks of ponds at a wool scouring plant at Jandakot broke, spilling waste water on to nearby Yangebup Road and into backup ponds. The solid rain made driving conditions hazardous. A section of Brookton Highway was washed out after nearby dams overflowed and it is believed about eight vehicles were washed into fastflowing streams. On Saturday night, stalled cars, traffic lights out of action and flooded roads proved a nightmare for police. But despite a spate of accidents no one was seriously injured. The Fire Brigade said it was called out 49 times, mostly for false alarms. The SES received 350 emergency calls and the Department of Marine and Harbours also was kept busy emptying flooded boats. Saturday nights greyhound races at Cannington were abandoned when the lure mechanism became submerged. Other sporting events also were disrupted. Vandals ensured that the WA Symphony Orchestra was a victim of the weather twice. At the Quarry Amphitheatre, rain and hail on Saturday morning ruined amplification equipment worth 30,000 because vandals who took two extension cords worth 30 on Friday night did not replace covers. Then, Saturday nights concert was postponed because of the relentless rain. It will be held tonight and tickets are transferable. Houghton winemaker Paul Lapsley said the hail missed the Swan Valley vineyards but the grapes were very expanded and more rain would split them. Vegetable grower Laurie Sumich said market gardens could be damaged and the onion harvest would be delayed about a week. BulletIn NSW, 100 soldiers were flown to the flood weary central western town of Nyngan yesterday amid fears that the Bogan River would break its banks. An SES spokesman said the river was expected to peak at 5 metres early today. The 1990 floods, which forced a mass evacuation, peaked at 2m. Sydney and its suburbs were battered yesterday as torrential rain and wind closed roads, cut power, uprooted trees, ripped roofs off homes and caused a spate of minor road accidents. Most suburbs recorded more than 150mm of rain during the weekend, with Sydneys central business district topping the charts with 287mm. The Sydney Harbour tunnel was flooded with 500,000 litres and emergency workers stood chestdeep in water as they used pumps to clear the tunnel, which is still under construction. PhotoCaption Howe beaten on Medicare charge by PETER REES and DEANIE CARBON CANBERRA Federal Cabinet will dump the controversial Medicare copayment today in what will be a humiliating defeat for Health Minister Brian Howe. Mr Howe, the Deputy Prime Minister, yesterday conceded he did not have the numbers in Cabinet to keep the 50 charge which last year caused bitter divisions in the Government. Mr Howe said Prime Minster Paul Keatings wish to scrap the copayment was well known. I think the Prime Minister obviously has got a very clear view about that and his view will be very influential within Cabinet, he said. Government sources confirmed Mr Howes fears that the 50 copayment and the 50 Medicare rebate cut on scheduled fees, introduced on December 1, would be abolished after only two months. Mr Howe will offer Cabinet six options ranging from abolishing the Medicare changes to partial retention and full retention. But Government sources said these options would not be considered fully and, instead, Cabinet would confine itself to the decision to scrap the copayment. Mr Howe has fought hard to retain the charge despite strong opposition from caucus and community groups. The rebate cut and other changes to Medicare were originally expected to save 9 million in 199192 but this was reduced to about 90 million after Cabinet was forced to modify the copayment to head off a caucus revolt. The copayment became an issue in the Governments leadership turmoil last October when Mr Keating made it clear he was opposed to it. He later told Government MPs he would scrap it if he took over the Labor leadership from Bob Hawke. But Howe continued the fight after Mr Keating became leader on December 19 and persuaded him to take the matter to Cabinet for review. Yesterday, SA ALP Senator Rosemary Crowley called on Cabinet to scrap the copayment and restore the simple Medicare rules in force early last year. Its very bad policy and it has to be removed, she said. Senator Crowley, a member of last years ALP caucus working party on Medicare, said there should be no distinciton between patients depending on whether they were served by bulk billing doctors or between pensioners and nonpensioners. In a stronglyworded letter to Mr Keating yesterday, the Australian Medical Association advised him not to scrap the copayment. AMA secretarygeneral Allan Passmore said the AMA was annoyed that it had not been consulted about the possible changes. The AMA believes nonpensioners who are bulkbilled should make 50 contributions to their bills. Mr Passmore said it was unreasonable for these patients to get free treatment. This removes any incentive for either the patient or the doctor to show any restraint in the requesting of the provision of medical services, he said. Patients who were not bulkbilled should be entitled to a Medicare rebate of 85 per cent of the scheduled fee and should not make a copayment, he said. The AMA said that in August 1990, Mr Keating as treasurer supported a patient fee for pharmaceuticals and argued that a free system encouraged overuse by patients and doctors. Lawyer bowls at hit em for six law Criminal lawyer Richard Utting has a cautionary tale for the lock em up brigade who want repeat juvenile offenders jailed for a mandatory 18 months for serious crimes after six court appearances and convictions for lesser offences such as burglary and car theft. As State Parliament sits in special session today to debate tough new laws to combat juvenile crime, Mr Utting tells the hypothetical story of Janet who lived at home with her single mum, quit school at 15 and joined WAs 30 per cent of youngsters out of work. Her mother formed a relationship with a man and invited him to live in the family home but Janet did not get on with her new de facto father and resented his efforts to discipline her. Janet left home at 16 to live with her 18yearold unemployed boyfriend in a house he shared with other teenagers. The young couple started taking drugs and the boyfriend decided to break into houses to get money for their habit while Janet kept watch. They were caught and fined but repeated the offences. Eventually the boyfriend was sent to prison. By then Janet had appeared six times in the Childrens Court and pleaded guilty each time. She returned home to live with her mother when the boyfriend went to jail, quit drugs and formed a good relationship with her de facto father. She found work as an apprentice hairdresser, got her drivers licence and bought a little car."

        "text": "One tall pOppy BY MIA FREEDMAN The first thing you notice about Poppy King is her lips. Full, pouty and with a perfect cupids bow, theyre the kind of lips that look best bright red. And they usually are. The second thing you notice, or rather sense, is Poppys incredible energy and passion for her work. Simply asking her how it all began unleashes a flood of enthusiasm. I was just so sick of having to reapply my lipstick five or six times a day. Every lipstick I wore smudged, faded, bled onto my teeth or vanished altogether. When a friend gave me a matt lipstick from overseas, I knew immediately that this was what I had been looking for. But looking for a replacement uncovered a huge gap in the market matt lipsticks just werent available. So began Poppys twoyear trek from counter to counter with every query met with what would become an ironic response Sorry, we dont make a matt lipstick but if I had a dollar for every time a customer asked for one, Id be rich. The gap was so obvious, I thought I must be crazy. How could huge cosmetics houses overlook something that, to me seemed perfectly clear Women want matt lipsticks. Its that simple. The transformation from frustrated consumer to budding entrepreneur happened like so many things in Poppys life suddenly and by chance. I was reading Cleo and noticed an ad for The Nescafe Big Break Awards, offering six people under the age of 2l a 20,000 grant to pursue their area of interest. I immediately changed my attitude from why doesnt some company do this to Im going to do it myself. She was 17 years old, living at home and had just completed the first year of an arts degree. Up till then I didnt have a clue as to what I wanted to do with my life. After intense research for her submission, missing out on the award was a disappointment but not a great setback. A chance conversation at a party two months later was the break Poppy needed. I was chatting to a friend about matt lipsticks and how I wanted to produce them. She loved the idea and mentioned it to a friend of hers who was looking to invest in a business venture. A fortnight later, the friend called Poppy. They met, and in the space of a few hours Poppy had convinced him to back her ideas financially. Maybe I was ignorant or naive or overconfident or all of those things, but I just couldnt imagine it not being a success. After deferring university, Poppy threw herself into building a business from scratch. Everyone warned me that a recession was the worst possible time to start something, but in my case the opposite was true. When times are tough, manufacturers are forced to become more competitive and that made it easier for me to get a good deal. And Poppys research also showed her that a recession meant a boom in the sale of small luxury items. Women still want to treat themselves occasionally, they just have to do it on a smaller scale. A new dress or pair of shoes is too expensive, so they buy a magazine or a lipstick instead. The recession was an advantage for me in every way. After finding a lipstick manufacturer who was open to her ideas, Poppy began months of painstaking trialanderror in the lab. Creating the texture was the first and most important step I said to my manufacturer, Whatever amount of pigment youre used to putting in lipsticks, double it. No one had done that before. The result was a totally matt texture, designed to withstand endless cups of coffee and hours of social kissing. The second part of Poppys lipstick vision concerned colour and she managed to produce shades unlike any others on the market. The first seven were colours Id always looked for but could never find. If I saw someone wearing a colour I liked even if they were just walking down the street Id ask them what it was. Every time, theyd say they had to blend to get the shade they wanted. For me, that was further proof of a demand for lipstick colours that didnt yet exist. She began to collect petals, pieces of material, coloured paper, anything that matched the colours she wanted to recreate. I spent many afternoons mixing colours with my manufacturer, running back and forth to the mirror and applying different lipsticks while they were still warm. In January 1992, Poppy was finally happy with her seven colours. The next step was to name them. I didnt want to give them boring names like Poppy No.3 or whimsical, wimpy names like Tangerine Dream. I wanted to give them strong names that would show how far women have come and what we stand for in the 90s Ambition, Courage, Integrity, Virtue, Inspiration, Liberty, Unity. March saw the first production batch ready for collection and, as Poppy loaded 7,000 lipsticks into her car, she was thinking, Oh well, even if its a total failure, at least Ill have enough lipsticks to last the rest of my life. Soon after, Poppy convinced two of Melbournes leading fashion boutiques to stock her range and made a wishlist of 25 other stores she wanted to approach. But nothing could have prepared her for the flood of calls she received after a small magazine article on Poppy lipsticks appeared later that month. I was fielding around 300 inquiries a day from people across Australia. Thats when I realised my market was much broader that Id originally thought. From teenage country girls to 65yearold grandmothers, it seemed that all kinds of women wanted a lipstick that would last. Within three weeks, Poppys first production run was sold out and 90 per cent of the stores on her wishlist had contacted her. But all this was overshadowed by a call from the head buyer at MyerGrace Bros, who wanted to meet her as soon as possible. I went into that meeting as an ambitious 19yearold with a few thousand lipsticks and came out a nationwide operation. So staggering was Poppys success, that by June she was able to buy out her financial backer and appoint her older brother as codirector. Poppy spent the remainder of 1992 packing boxes, taking orders, meeting accountants, making instore appearances and developing her second range, The Seven Deadly Sins. Any spare time was devoted to renovating her huge studio apartment in central Melbourne, catching up with friends over a quick coffee or riding her bike. I let my gym membership lapse long ago so my bike is both relaxation and exercise. Not surprisingly, by Christmas Poppy was exhausted and decided to treat herself to a weeks break in New York after visiting a cosmetics trade fair in Paris. But her passion for business took hold, and she hadnt been in New York more than a few days when she began ringing department stores to gauge interest in her lipsticks. The brushoffs came one after another until she spoke to the head buyer at Barneys one of New Yorks most prestigious department stores, who agreed to meet her. Undeterred by the fact she had left all her promotional material in Australia, Poppy arrived at Barneys the following morning with nothing but her own halfused lipsticks. What followed was remarkable. This woman was blownaway. She adored the concept, loved the lipsticks and cancelled all her morning appointments so we could talk business. I was so overwhelmed I hailed a taxi and burst into tears. But Poppy Kings appetite for success is far from satisfied. Shes currently promoting her Seven Deadly Sins range and finalising the colours for Innocence, a range that will feature paler colours. Plans for an eye range Vision are well under way, with foundations, powders and a Poppy fragrance in the pipeline. Because of their thickness, heat resistance and rich colours, Poppy lipsticks are ideal for dark skin and hot climates. A Sri Lankan firm has already expressed interest, and expansion into the huge cosmetics markets of Sri Lanka and Pakistan seems just a matter of time. Meanwhile, in preparation for Barneys August launch, Poppy is flying to New York for a twoweek publicity blitz and Barneys is sending her lipsticks to some of the most famous lips in America, including those of Julia Roberts, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Madonna. And instead of letting herself get swept away in this whirlwind of success, Poppy is proving she has a business instinct as acute as the Material Girl herself. Im giving myself one more year to stand up and be the front person for Poppy Industries. For longterm profitability, its vital that I step back and let the product speak for itself. Besides, theres only so long I can maintain goodwill in this country before people decide Im doing too well and its time to cut me down. But jealousy and bitterness aside, right now, at the age of 20, everythings coming up roses for Poppy King. NATALIES STORY Within a fortnight of receiving the letter, we had Natalie on a plane to Sydney. Given the precarious nature of Natalies condition, the letter had said, you understand we have to act quickly. Wearing a black hat and a white ruffled blouse, she strode into the airport lounge. We had expected an invalid. What we got was someone brave, intelligent and funny. The flight from Melbourne to Sydney had been draining, the black hat covered a head bald from chemotherapy and the ruffled blouse hid a body thin from fighting illness. Yet she was exuberant. I cant believe Im actually doing this. For years Ive looked at the models and celebrities in Cleo, but I never thought Id be one of them, said Natalie, high on the excitement of being our star for a day. And a star is exactly what she was. More adept at dealing with reactions to her illness than we were, she put us all at ease. Will she be OK about being photographed bald asked the photographer. Perhaps wed better lead up to things gently until we know how she feels. As soon as we were in the studio, Natalie solved the problem. You wont be needing this in the way. Sinead OConnor, eat your heart out, she said, whipping off her hat. I used to be the kind of girl who was in the hairdresser once a month, always interested in the latest style. Nowdotted linewell, it doesnt help to be too sensitive. Its usually other people who feel more embarrassed than I do. Some stare, even call out things. Ive learnt to ignore them. Other peoples reaction to her illness had been an education all round. When it first happened, I received loads of cards and letters, but then everyone but my closest friends got on with their lives again. They started to forget. It was like time was moving on for them and just standing still for me, she said. Some friends just couldnt cope at all. One friends boyfriend couldnt even bear to come and see me because the thought that I might die was just too much for him. At 20, you dont think about death. Death is something that happens to other people, when they are old, years from now. When leukaemia struck Natalie, it came like a bolt from the blue. Her life was on a roll. Always keen on fashion, shed taken a twoyearfashiondesign and business course. Then, after a holiday job at Sportsgirl, she impressed the fashion chain so much that she was taken on permanently as a window dresser. It was job she adored. I just couldnt be at work long enough. Within three years, shed been promoted and transferred to a highprofile store in WA. My life had never been better. I had my new job, was sharing a house on the beach with two friends I loved, the future looked great, and then suddenlydotted line pow."

        "text": "A different shade of Done All his lucrative career, while the public have loved him, Ken Done has suffered at the hands of critics who dismiss him as a commercial artist. All his life he has wanted to be taken as a painter respected on walls as well as Tshirts.Now, at last, it seems it could happen. By AnnMaree Moodie Ken Done lightly tosses the selfportrait onto the floorboards of his waterfront studio where it settles amid a pile of unmistakably Done canvases. There, the paintings sombre colours stand out even more strikingly against the blues, yellows and reds of the familiar flower pictures and one of his favourite scenes the beach. If it were not for his trademark moustache, it would be difficult to recognise the selfportrait as Done. There is no boyish grin on this contorted face, no vibrant colours by which the artist has made his name. Shades of charcoal, brown and grey dominate, and Done describes it as a portrait of a face of a person who at that point in time was frustrated, unhappy, angry. The incident which created the black mood behind the painting is so private he will not even tell his wife of 27 years, Judy, who is also his business partner. But its not as dark as you imagine, he says. Its dark to you because you are so used to seeing brighter things from me. The selfportrait is one of a series Done has produced since he began showing his work in the early eighties. There is a file of them stored at his business headquarters in Sydneys innercity Redfern, and his most recent one has halfadozen faces on it because I am halfadozen peopledotted linethe private face, the sad face, the angry face, the media photo face, the unsure face, the confident face. These paintings havent often been seen in Australia because they dont fit the image of his multimilliondollar company. That selfportrait is a painting for an audience of one me. They are not the kind of things you would see on a calendar or a datebook. But one allows me to do the other dotted line To understand how beautiful things are, sometimes you need to understand how sad things are. He stresses that the selfportraiture doesnt signal any sudden change of direction. Its all part of what he has been doing all along chasing a childhood dream to be a painter. He just happened to be distracted along the way by his talent as a commercial artist and marketing man. The Japanese,with whom Done has had a love affair since his first visit to Japan in the sixties, admire him as both designer and artist. Now, he says, as part of his progression as an artist, he wants Australians to realise that his talents extend far beyond the simple linear drawings of Sydneys Harbour Bridge and Opera House which have made him world famous. He wants us to accept that its not a dilemma to be successful as both a commercial and pure artist. An exhibition of Dones work has been touring nsw regional galleries. From March 11 to May 21, his Redfern gallery will show the exhibition Paintings from The Cabin which, according to his assistant curator, Kirstie Davidson, intermingles earlier paintings and later more expressive and abstract works including seascapes, selfportraits and images of the interior and surrounding garden of The Cabin, Dones Sydney Harbourside property. And early next year, the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney will present a comprehensive, multimedia exhibition of Dones work, including the car he was asked to paint as part of bmws car art collection which put him in the company of bmws painted by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Alexander Calder. Dones interpretations of a glass fishsculpture, a Japanese beer can and an Arnotts biscuit tin are already on display in the Powerhouses permanent exhibition. All these exhibitions will include paintings immediately recognised as Done big, bold, bright canvases of flowers, beaches, tropical fish. But as well, they will reveal something of the other side of Done, a surprise, perhaps, for those who grumble that what he does could be done by a preschooler. Im doing many more complex things than you think, but I havent shown work here in Australia for quite a while I was always painting all kinds of pictures. Its just that the first pictures that people saw in the early eighties were very simple. I always accepted that in Australia it would be a long time before people understood there was more to it. But I knew that there was more to it. The time is approaching when Done, photo one of the countrys bestknown exports, may find a place in Australias established galleries as an artist a breakthrough for him and them. Some would argue that he deserves the break. Whatever else you might say, theres no denying hes worked hard enough. Done left school at 14 to become an artist. He studied design at the East Sydney Technical College but failed to graduate because, for his final assessment, he submitted graphics for the opening titles of the Bandstand television show instead of a book cover for The Picture of Dorian Gray Bandstand struck him as a more appealing project. His subsequent work as a commercial artist led to a successful career as a creative director for advertising agencies in Sydney and London. At 40, he left advertising to renew his ambition to paint. He drew some appealingly simple sketches of koalas and other classic Australian icons and had them printed on Tshirts. The freshness of his designs caught on. He set up a company to do his own printing and suddenly his creations were everywhere on bathers, sarongs, mugs, socks, bags, scarves, linen goods. Many of them were bought by tourists who believed they epitomised the essence of Australia. Done quickly became a celebrity, his goods spawned a chain of shops and he featured regularly in advertisements and the media. The man who wanted to be a painter found himself a businessman. Two years ago, when he turned 50, he decided to have another go at being what he really wanted to be. The business was encroaching on the time he wanted to spend painting. The company, employing 150 people and turning over more than 50 million in Australia annually, was contracted and renamed Done Art and Design. The 13 Australian shops, two galleries in Sydney Redfern and The Rocks and one in Surfers Paradise remained companyowned, but the overseas shops were licensed. The wholesale division was closed and licences were awarded to Oroton to make accessories and the Ink Group to make cards and calendars. Ideally, the new division of work means that Done now spends more time painting while Judy, 49, steers the company and does the fashion design. Nevertheless, Done, though without a formal title, is still effectively company chairman and appears to hold tightly to the reins. Because of his success, Done became a tall poppy. Over the years, his name has lent itself to a variety of denigrations of his work. His critics, especially those in art circles, have delighted in chanting OverDone, Done to Death, Been there, Done that. In 1987, there was Brett Whiteleys unforgettable response to his work Id rather take methadone than Ken Done. Dones paintings were not exhibited in any major gallery in Sydney or Melbourne and no art critic reviewed his work because it was widely regarded as too commercial and not pure. Times change. A decade on, the level of Done criticism has abated. He is studied in school as a contemporary artist and he lectures at galleries. His paintings have been bought by the Australian Embassy in Tokyo and showbiz collectors like Michael Caine, Reg Livermore and Jeffery Archer. He has had 44 solo exhibitions here and overseas, the last toured Japan to an audience of 200,His work fetches tens of thousands of dollars a recent painting sold photo for 30,And last year he was awarded the Order of Australia for his services to art, design and tourism. Done attributes his gradual acceptance to the current age, quality and experience of journalists whom he says have helped equalise the tall poppy syndrome. But can he yet call himself a painter in the eyes of the cognoscente While he has gained respect for cleverly exploiting his commercial art, he is yet to receive accolades for his paintings. The director of the Art Gallery of nsw, Edmund Capon, says the reason Dones more familiar work has not been exhibited by a major gallery in Australia is because he is perceived in the art establishment as being commercially oriented rather than a pure artist. The gallery has hung Done work only temporarily, in competitions such as the Archibald work Capon describes as a slightly more serious form of his more commercial expression. Still, Capon does indicate that if Dones work was to break the mould of its commercial reputation, he may be exhibited by leading galleries. He has a thorough and established reputation as an artist who has managed to marry art, design and commercial product. He is a master of two essential ingredients of art graphic facility and colour and he has a fundamental understanding of art such as graphic quality and the relationship and emotional qualities of colour. I would be the last person to say he did not have the facilities to metamorphose into a pure artist. So theres hope for Ken the painter yet. The director of the Powerhouse Museum, Terence Measham, says Done, whom he regards as a friend, is an Australian model of success for young people. The thing about Ken Done is that his mind teems with visual images. The paintings celebrate the Australian experience, lifestyle and expression through the colours and through the iconography, and he assimilates, in an intellectual way, the motifs and pictorial ideas of other artists, such as Monet and Gauguin. But art critic Elwyn Lynn thinks that although Done has developed as an artist since his work was first shown, hes still incipient and ubiquitous. I think Ken Done is a serious artist at times, but he is yet to be proven, says Lynn, who has only seen Dones art reproduced in magazines photo caption and competitions. I think he is becoming more expressive in his feelings for different subjects than those which are depicted on his shirts and elsewhere. But he is one of the few artists who are concerned with the hedonistic life. I think people have to realise that you can be utterly relaxed in your style and still be an artist. The Cabin, where Done produces most of his work, is a twostorey building at the edge of Chinamans Beach, a peaceful inlet tucked away on Sydneys north shore. It lies at the bottom of Judys welltended garden which is planted in blocks of colour and is a source of unending inspiration to her husband. Done first saw The Cabin when he was 14, began renting it in the early eighties, but was unable to buy it until His earliest paintings were born in a nowdemolished caption fishermans shack on the same beach which he rented from the elderly owner. I used to sit at the other end of Chinamans Beach, looking at this building, and willing the people who were renting it before out of it, he says. They were nice enough people, but they didnt love it. He knows Chinamans Beach intimately and has names for the rocks which protect its shores Point Rock, Turtle Rock, Bird Rock. Some of the names developed when his children were young and the family would explore the beach together. Other rocks have been named for their characteristics the Japanese Tree Rock is a rock upon which crouches a gnarled old tree and that reminds Done of a Japanese landscape. Is it monotonous painting the same view repeatedly Done leafs through a bundle of canvases to explain his answer. Its never the same."

        "text": "RESOURCES Bass gas tax bombshell By STEPHEN MAYNE THREE former Supreme Court judges dropped a bombshell yesterday when they handed down an interim finding which suggests Victorian taxpayers will be asked to foot a 1 billionplus Federal tax liability on Bass Strait gas. The threemember panel on the commercial arbitration ruled that BHP and Esso can pass on the cost of the Federal Governments controversial Resource Rent Tax RRT to Victorian taxpayers. RRT on Bass Strait gas was introduced in 1990 and is levied at 40 per cent of profit on offshore gas production. Treasurer Alan Stockdale last month said the present value of the liability created by the RRT on Victorian Bass Strait gas was more than 1 billion. EssoBHP has already paid about 300 million to the Federal Government since the tax was retrospectively applied to longterm fixedprice gas contracts EssoBHP has with the Gas and Fuel Corp and the former SECV. Generation Victoria, the new power station arm of the old SECV, buys gas from EssoBHP to run its Newport and Jeeralang gasfired power stations. Yesterdays interim finding related to the 15year contract between EssoBHP and Generation Victoria which expires in The bulk of the 1 billionplus liability relates to longterm contracts between EssoBHP and the Gas and Fuel Corp, but yesterdays interim finding for the smaller of the two commercial arbitrations is regarded as a pointer to the bigger one. Mr Stockdale last night said the decision would delay national gas reform and that the Government still believed the tax should be paid by the producers EssoBHP. RRT was intended to be a tax on the profit made by producers and we remain of the view that it should not be passed on, he said. The Federal Government is believed to support this view and could yet intervene. BHP Petroleum spokesman Bernie Delaney said the parties would need to examine the reasons for the finding which will be released later this month. It would appear that our contractual rights are being respected, he said. The decision will inevitably get wrapped up in negotiations between EssoBHP and the Government over the future ownership of Newport and Jeeralang and the renegotiation of a series of gas contracts which begin expiring in BHP chief executive John Prescott is aiming to negotiate new gas contracts at up to 10 times the present prices. While EssoBHP has been paying the 80 million annual tax to the Federal Government, Generation Victoria has been writing off its 1015 million liability each year. However, Gas and Fuel has only been noting it in the accounts as a contingent liability so it may be forced to make a 200 millionplus write down. MARKETS Share slide continues By Nachum Kaplan INTEREST rate concerns and large falls on overseas markets hammered Australian stocks yesterday with the market falling sharply for the second consecutive day. More than 6 billion has been wiped off the markets value over the past two days as the All Ordinaries index tumbled another 3 points to 8 yesterday. Austock senior analysts John Roysmith said It was pretty weak, the market had expectations of a rate rise which didnt come through and it was weak after a big fall on Wall Street. The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 67 points to 13 after the release of figures which showed strong earnings by the nations leading manufacturers. This sparked fears the US economy was growing quickly enough to create strong inflation which may need to be quelled with higher interest rates. Fears about rising interest rates, locally and in the US, caused the Australian December share price index futures which reflect market expectations to plummet 36 points to 1960, almost a 20 point discount to the physical market. Despite the markets weakness brokers said it was now reaching levels where it should enjoy reasonable support. The sharemarket is in a negative mood at the moment, but it shouldnt go much lower before hitting a plateau, said one broker. The gold index was hit hard and lost a hefty 3 points to 8 as many gold stocks felt the wrath of the bearish market. Delta Gold fell 11c to 67, Newcrest Mining was 14c weaker at 88 while Samantha Gold lost 23c to Many stocks were punished by the weaker market and BHP tumbled 32c to 06 just weeks after hitting a record high of Retail giant Coles Myer stumbled again and it lost 9c to 94 while flu company Biota Ltd plunged 45c to 20 as the market stripped the drug company of the impressive 80c gain it made on Monday. One standout performer in yesterdays market was Pacific BBA which powered ahead 27c to News Corporation regained some lost ground after Tuesdays stumble and gained 2c to Despite the drama on the equities market the credit market firmed slightly as yields on yardstick Commonwealth long bonds fell five basis points to 25 per cent. The Australian dollar regained some lost ground after Tuesdays fall and closed local trade 15 points higher at US BRANDS Holeproof looks for brief affair with younger men By Jane Schulze BELLS, the traditional Melbourne underwear and sock brand, has been relaunched by the Holeproof company to try and attract younger customers while retaining its position in the over 50s market. Holeproofs group general manager David Stevenson said new underwear styles and sock patterns would be introduced to make the brand more contemporary, but would not alienate their traditional older market. While brands such as Calvin Klein have dramatically expanded the younger underwear market, Mr Stevenson said Bells wanted to move into the 30s plus market from its traditional base of consumers aged over We are targeting the 30yearolds that are comfortable with a knitted brief as opposed to boxer shorts, the men 40plus aspiring to be 30 again and the 50yearolds who have known the brand for 20 years and want to make sure they are not totally alienated, he said. The high profile end of the market does not fit with the brands steeped in 80 years of heritage you cannot be all things to all people. Mr Stevenson said increased fabric choices and improved technology meant it was now easier to create more interesting sock patterns and underwear styles. Included in the new range are three new sock patterns, bicycle trunk style underwear and a full brief in different fabric combinations. The traditional athletic style underwear has also been retained but slightly modernised using ribbed and interlocked cotton. We have been developing the underwear side of Bells as it was languishing a bit in that its sales rested on one or two styles only, he said. Its definitely not aimed at the teenage market, but thats not to say there would not be appeal in the sock area and with some of our mens briefs. Packaging has also been updated from the burgundy colour to heritage green and for the first time similar labels appear on both underwear and socks. However the traditional three soldierlike hotel porters remain on the packaging. Mr Stevenson said the fact that Bells was only available through department stores and specialist retailers was an advantage as it meant marketing was able to be clearly focussed by those retailers. We wouldnt say its an aggressive marketing campaign, but we have aimed to keep the product in its defined position in the market place, he said. He said Holeproof brands, including Underdaks, Alfreds and Computer Socks, held about one third of the 160 million mens sock market and about 40 per cent of the 250 million retail underwear market. ECONOMY Survey finds firms very busy By Simon Pristel AUSTRALIAN companies are run off their feet with increased business, according to a survey released yesterday. And companies expect to boost sales, profits, jobs and investment before Christmas. The Metal Trades Industry Association survey of 290 companies found 60 per cent of them experienced busy or very busy production activity last month, the best result for five years. And activity is set to accelerate in the next three months, with three quarters of companies anticipating busy or very busy conditions. The survey also found THIRTYNINE per cent of companies boosted staff numbers in the past three months, but the pace of employment growth is expected to be slow in the next three months.MORE than 55 per cent of companies reported increases in sales and orders in the past three months and more growth is expected.ALMOST 30 per cent of companies boosted their export sales, while 9 per cent saw exports fall back. ABOUT 70 per cent of companies expect to increase their investment spending in the next 12 months, while 10 per cent expect to cut spending. SEVENTYTWO per cent of companies expect profits to grow over the next 12 months. The survey is further evidence that the economic recovery is entrenched and likely to grow strongly. But there are increasing fears among economists that the economy could be growly too strongly. This could cause inflation to rise, putting the recovery at risk. Economists believe these fears could prompt the Reserve Bank to soon possibly at its Board meeting today lift official interest rates to slow down the economy. Treasurer Ralph Willis yesterday said the Federal Government was committed to keeping inflation low by adopting a firm stance on monetary policy interest rates. Speaking at the interim committee meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Spain, Mr Willis said strong growth in East Asian economies, which was expected to continue, had boosted economic growth in Australia. But Opposition Treasury spokesman Peter Costello said Mr Willis was ignoring advice from the Treasury to rein in the budget deficit. Mr Costello yesterday said Mr Willis had privately told people he wanted to cut the budget deficit faster than planned, but that Prime Minister Paul Keating was preventing him from doing so. Mr Costello said unless Mr Willis cut the deficit faster than planned interest rates would soar and put the recovery at risk. SUNDAY TRADING Retailers work out deal By JANE SCHULZE Victorias major retail groups have hammered out a compromise deal on Sunday trading and will now lobby the State Government to increase the number of trading Sundays from 10 to Under the deal, all metropolitan stores would open the first Sunday of each month and the three before Christmas The five asociations, representing businesses of all sizes, put the plan to the State Government following continued confusion with the present rules. The Combined Retailers Association of Victoria, the Retail Traders Association of Victoria, the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry VECCI, the Australian Council of Shopping Centres and the Building Owners and Managers Association BOMA worked out the deal six weeks ago. The groups then requested a meeting with Small Business Minister Vin Heffernan. But the ministers spokesman said Mr Heffernan told them the government did not intend changing its Sunday trading policy in this term of government. Under the 1991 Shop Trading Further Amendment Act, 10 Sundays are allowed for trading, six of which are determined by the Government and four by the Shop Review Trading Panel. VECCI chief executive officer David Edwards said the groups would maintain their united front in lobbying the Government for a change. The proposal has the agreement of all the industry groups but in the past there have been different views dotted line this is a compromise position that everyone in the industry supports,he said. Retail Traders Association executive director Ron Thomlinson said he was not surprised the groups wrre able to find a united position. Irrespective of their diversity no one is terribly happy with the 10 Sunday rule, he said. Combined Retail Traders executive officer Tony Christakakis admitted the deal would disadvantage some of their members but would boost the overall retail sector. BOMAs executive director Brian Welch said the confusion surrounding Sunday trading made it difficult to market. Opening on the first Sunday of each month would benefit both large and small retailers as it would become an accepted thing just like Sunday shopping in the CBD, he said."

        "text": "1 Black movement, white stubbornness During the official bicentennial celebration in January 1988, a survey found that most Australians believed that Aborigines were better off than they were before white settlement began. Confidence in the benefits of white civilisation was strongest in those areas most closely identified with harsh treatment of Aborigines.1 The facts suggest that white complacency is inappropriate. In Australia today, an Aborigine is much more likely than a white person to be sick, undernourished, unemployed, uneducated, poor, badly housed, imprisoned or dead in traditional society, Aborigines ate better than the vast majority of Europeans in 1788, and normally had only to work three or four hours each day to maintain this standard.2 It is not just that the intrusion of whites upon the continent has been at the expense of the Aborigines land and livelihood, but the advantages of white society, such as they are, have not been distributed so that blacks benefit. Stark contrasts are everywhere. For example, in 1979 in the Kimberley area of Western Australia, the Aboriginal people employed at Gordon Downs, a pastoral station owned by Vesteys, lived in a few caravans and tin humpies, and the only water supply for the camp came from a single, intermittently working tap 100 yards away, which had caused the death of three children from gastroenteritis. At the same time, the managers lawn at Gordon Downs was being constantly watered by eight sprinklers.3 Ten years later, in 1989, the Wamba Wamba people on the VictorianNSW border live in a cluster of squalid and makeshift huts on the banks of the Murray, directly opposite a forty million dollar luxury country club estate.4 White society and the black movement A process of racialisation in white Australian society over the past two centuries has resulted in the continual oppression of Aborigines and a reluctance on the part of white Australians to acknowledge that oppression. Poor relations Jan Pettman argues that throughout postsettlement history, Australia has been characterised as white, Englishspeaking and male, as it is white, Englishspeaking males who have dominated the establishment and development of our modern nationstate. Aborigines were constructed as the Other in ideologies of race and nation and as part of the process of developing policy for their management. Aboriginal people were denied agency, for they were not seen as purposive or creative actors in their own right they were not considered a distinct part of the Australian nation.5 This process of assertive white selfdefinition and the associated repression of the Aboriginal component of Australianness was apparent in white Australian societys determination to commemorate the bicentenary of the white conquest of black Australia. For Land Rights News the celebrations presented the obscene spectacle of the brutality and arrogance of British colonialism.6 The black movement instead celebrated 1987 as the bicentenary of its last year of freedom and registered their anger the following year. On 26 January 1988 about 50 000 protesting Aborigines from all over the country nearly a fifth of their population descended on Sydney in freedom buses and by other means. Les Collins, coordinator of the Cairns Aboriginal Health Service, explained the black perspective by pointing out that Australians would be horrified if Germany decided to commemorate its crime against the Jews, yet Aboriginal people were witnessing the celebration with fireworks and fanfares, of the taking of their traditional lands.7 Whites at play are good targets for black protest. Much can be made of the contrast between black deprivation on the one hand and the amount of money poured into white festivities centred on profit or pleasure. Yet many whites react angrily to black refusals to respect the icons of white society. The Bicentennial Authority objected to the Aboriginal slogan, Bugger the Bicentenary, alleging it constituted a breach of copyright.8 And newspaper reportage of black protests against the bicentenary tended to present them as disruptive.9 The influence of the media on attitudes to blacks is considerable. Aboriginal people feel that the media incites racial hatred by constantly telling all the bad things and promoting negative images of Aborigines, encouraging stereotypes of Aborigines as criminals, drunks and always unemployed.10 The Aboriginal Advancement League newspaper, Koorier 3, admits some improvement in recent years, but Newspapers generally report biased sensational negative, inaccurate stories about Koori people.11 Throughout white Australian history, newspapers have reassured the interlopers of their rights to Aboriginal land now, in subtle ways, the media convinces whites that Aborigines have no right to ask for portions of it back. White commentators often denigrate the black movement by suggesting it is not representative or that sections of it lack authenticity. Frequently, when Aborigines stand up for their rights, we hear suggestions that the trouble is caused by a handful of agitators stirring up discontent amongst an otherwise happy people. Often, also, whites impugn the integrity of black leaders by questioning their racial redentials. In these instances we see a case of how racism upholds stereotypes by shifting the criteria of Aboriginality to create categories of convenience for the dominant race, to deny Aboriginal identity to educated, urban or nontraditional people when this can be used to ignore their political claims.12 Likewise, the resentment articulated by whites against those who receive benefits earmarked for blacks who are not, in the opinion of those objecting, really black,13 is a racialised thought process and accordingly illogical if the beneficiaries in question are not really black then animosity should surely be directed against whites for posing as blacks. Either the beneficiaries are genuine and black or they are white and fraudulent. They cannot be both black and fraudulent, yet this is the inference regularly drawn in white responses to blacks and the black movement. It is the police who most obviously express Australian race relations in practice, who form the front row for enforcing the prejudices of white Australians. Tiga Bayles, chairman of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, complained to the Human Rights Commission inquiry into racist violence My people constantly suffer racist abuse, and there is a perceived lack of interest from the police. In fact, some of the violence is perpetrated by the police themselves.14 On 27 April 1989 an Aboriginal man, Mr David Gundy, was killed during a police raid on his home. The police were looking for another man who was not at Mr Gundys house, wanted for allegedly shooting at police officers, one of whom had subsequently died. The state made no apology to the Gundy family for the shooting of an unarmed, innocent man in front of his nineyearold son, yet five state police forces sent senior officers to attend the policemans funeral. On 16 August 1989 the New South Wales coroner ruled that police should not face criminal charges over the incident.15 Black feeling that white police officers can maltreat Aborigines with impunity has clearly expressed itself during the hearings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The families concerned have been distressed by the Commissions reluctance to blame white police officers. One family described the findings thus Its just a whitewash, the same as the coroners verdict. We knew it was going to be like this.16 The Aborigines white problem Over two centuries, white Australians found various ways of dealing with what they defined as the Aboriginal problem the killing method of the days of pastoral expansion segregation on reserves from late last century until the 1940s assimilation from the 1940s to the late 1960s, fading into integration in the early 1970s and now selfdetermination or selfmanagement. At every stage, white people made the decisions that affect the lives of Aboriginal people. Even the bestintentioned plans of whites presumed to determine the fate of Aborigines. In February 1973 the Whitlam Labor government created the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. In December 1973 over 28000 Aboriginal voters elected fortyone Aborigines to this Committee and most Aborigines saw it as a representative body invested with power to participate in decisions on all Aboriginal matters.17 But it was merely an advisory body, with no power within the white bureaucracy, a fact which the black activists involved found extremely frustrating. Christine Jennett comments In Australia under Labor it was never really envisaged that Aborigines would have the power to make decisions, but rather that they were to advise the government on the decisions which it would continue to make.18 The Fraser government that followed was easily able to draw the few remaining, decaying teeth of this body and it ceased to function within a few years. In 1979 the Aboriginal Treaty Committee argued that Aborigines and Islanders remain disadvantaged. They listed the following reasons their affairs are controlled by whiteimposed structures and laws their requests for real selfdetermination are not being heard their lives are complicated by different and often conflicting policies at state and federal levels their wellbeing is dependent on the good will of the government of the day and their interests do not always prosper under government programmes because a significant proportion of funding is used to maintain the bureaucracy and inappropriate projects are often introduced without consultation with the people concerned.19 About threequarters of the federal government money allocated to Aboriginal Affairs goes into the pockets of bureaucrats.20 These people, not Aborigines, are the intelligent parasites of Australian history.21 Colin Tatz argues that the way money is spent on Aboriginal Affairs is symptomatic of the major problem in Australian race relations White society unilaterally defines the problems, prescribes the policy dicta, enacts the laws, creates the administrative machinery and determines the nature, content, personnel and flavour of remedial programs dotted line Aboriginal Affairs have always been, and still remain, a white activity. This tradition has become a deeply ingrained cultural norm. 22 The whole setup is based on the racist assumption that whites know best. The solutions favoured are typically welfare oriented, which, Pettman argues, tend simultaneously to increase Aboriginal dependence and white control.23 As Robbie Thorpe has put it from the black side How can we talk about selfdetermination when we are caught up in welfare dottedline While the government spends money on welfare for our people, and sets up its governing bodies, it is dictating the terms of our existence.24 Gary Foley argues that many white Australians find it very difficult to accept that Aboriginal people are capable of controlling their own affairs and doing it better than the white experts. This is why Aboriginal initiatives are so often perceived as threats by the bureaucrats.25 It is difficult for many whites, conditioned to think in racist ways and used to being in control, to accept the black movement as the legitimate expression of Aborigines desire to rid themselves of their very serious white problem. The particular problem of the black movement The black movement is the most particular of any of the new social movements in this study its support base is extremely limited. White Australians have themselves guaranteed this numerical isolation of black Australians. The main causes of the drastic decline of the 1787 Aboriginal population of possibly two million were smallpox and venereal diseases introduced by whites the economic and social effects of land loss which led to poverty and despair and direct killings by whites.26 The 1986 Census counted only 227 644 Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Blacks constitute, therefore, about 421 per cent of the population. In other words, they are electorally negligible, a lobby group not worth wooing, except insofar as they can mobilise broader support. Political parties can afford to ignore black voters, and in the main they do the circumstances of black Australians did not rate as an issue in the 1990 federal election. Living on the fringe of white consciousness, at election times they are usually forgotten. There has also been a long history of official political marginalisation of the few black Australians remaining, resented and opposed by Aboriginal political organisations. It was not until 1949 that some Aborigines were given the right to enrol and vote in federal elections, providing they were entitled to enrol for state poll some were, some were not or had been in the defence forces. In 1962 Aborigines in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory became entitled to enrol and vote in federal elections. Until 1967, black Australians were formally excluded from Australian citizenship and were not counted in the Census. In the Northern Territory it was 1978 before the provision for voluntary electoral enrolment for Aborigines was abolished, thus placing Aboriginal voters on an equal footing with white voters. In 1983, the Commonwealth Electoral Act was amended to make electoral enrolment and voting compulsory for Aborigines."

        "text": "9th July 1991 Glasgow PART ONE Hello everyone, Well, we are safely back from our Turkish sojourndotted line mind you that is no mean feat. We had a terrific holiday, Turkey was quite an experience. David and Elaine had arranged a package holiday to Bodrum, which is a seaside resort on the Aegean, midway down the Turkish coast. We agreed to go along with them for my first experience of a British package holiday. Here are my impressions The british have a different attitude to holidaysdotted line I can kind of see whydotted line they like to go away for a week or two, turn lobster red in the sun, experience a SMALL amount of foreign culture, mix with a lot of other brits and go home with a suntan. Throughout this they are molly coddled by their tour rep ie. picked up at the airport and herded off to the resort in a bus, taken on turkish nights and so on. 60 of the population is white, everywhere they go people speak English, give you chips with your Turkish meal, and invite you into tourist traps. Bodrum and many places like it around the Med is a very pretty place, but there is very little real Turkish culturedotted line almost everything is set up for the tourists, which in my opinion is rather saddotted line but the Brits on wur holiday lap it up. Fortunately Aileen agrees that thats not what travelling is about, and so she was as happy as me when we got somewhere and tourists were 1 of the population, they spoke little English and she is tut tuted for wearing a skirt above the knee Anyway, thats PART TWO. So, we arrived in Bodrum, tired after our overnight flight and bus trip and spent the next four days being lazy and avoiding the tour rep. The beach was crowded with alternately white, pink, red and brown bodies, mostly lying on wooden sunbenches, provided by their hotel except for the Turks who for some mysterious reason prefer to lie in the dirty brown pebbles We actually spent most middays in the shade by the hotel pool as a way of preserving our skins. I played lots of backgammon with David, it is the Turkish national game, they play it at a blinding speed. We took a boat trip one day, which was very pleasant indeed. Bodrum itself is very pretty, but the surrounding islands sparkle in the Aegean Sea and are quite a spectacle. We went out on a cruising Turkish yacht and spent a lovely day, admiring the islands, enjoying the sun and swimming in the deep blue sea. We also spent a morning looking around the 14th Century Crusader castle, which was fascinating. It is the dominant feature of Bodrum see Pete and Shauns postcard. Its very large and well built used to keep out the infidel many moons ago I dont know that the Crusaders would be very happy that the infidel are now running it... and is now used as a museum. Everything in Turkey is very cheap which reminds me Cath, I shall send you some Turkish money. Although as one TAKSI driver told us, Bodrum cheap for English visitor. Bodrum dear for Turkish. We had some good nights out, Turkish food is great varied and spicy despite the chips. The service is very good, they normally take you to the kitchen to show you the choice of meals, but there is one thing you would hate Dad, cats run loose everywhere and are accepted and fed in mostly outdoor restaurants. So you sit eating your meal, with about four cats prowling around your table, staring at you, meowing, in one case, pawing Aileens leg, and in another, jumping onto the table There is a large bazaar there which was interesting lots of local wares for sale mixed in with the touristy souveneirs. However you must run the vanguard of Turks extoling the virtues of their various establishments and trying to tempt you inside Excuse me sir , Hello, yes please and May I ask you just one question must be ignored every few steps or dealt with if you are unfortunate enough to make eye contact They never address the women, only the men. Turkey is a muslim country and women are one class below camels. I got a reputation for being impolitedotted line God knows why. Its actually very sad in parts, there are very few beggars but so many people on the street trying to eek out a living, from the flashy ones trying to get you into their nightclubs to the 5 year old kids with bathroom scales wanting to tell you your weight. There are also lots of shoe shine boys, one was very funny, he asked me shoeshine and when I said no thanks, he said look at your shoes, they are filthy only 1000 about 30 cents. So I laughed and said OK, he did a very good job and I have him The country gives the impression of being very poor, lots of manual labour, very poor housing and services. However having said that Aileen commented that it was not half as poor as Morocco or Kenya so I guess theyre not to badly off. The language is interesting, we tried to learn a few words, Merhaba hello and Tesekkurleh thanks but the pronunciation eg.Tehshehkehler isnt easy. Its a very phonetic language, TAKSI, POLIS and FERIBOT are all pretty obvious, that makes it a little easier. Well, I am running out of room. We sat and watched the sunset in an ancient Greek ampitheatre over a bottle of red wine that seated 5000 in its day and has a beautiful outlook over Bodrum and the surrounding islands. After which I went to the stage and recited The Man from Ironbark to A,D,E, a Turkish goatherd and his 30 goats. He he, Ive just read what I wrote some bottle of wine We saw some belly dancing and that about it in Bodrum. We arranged for a hire car, which we picked up bound for the Dardanelles and Gallipoli, 600 kms of right hand side of the road driving away But that was to be the least of the difficulties For more, Peter and Shaunaugh have PART TWO. Hope youre all well, 9th July 1991 Glasgow PART TWO Dear Peter, Shaunaugh wee bubs, Part Two you say Part One is with Mum Dad Ive told them all about Bodrum this letter is all about our trip to Gallipoli. We left Bodrum, aware that we may have difficulties with driving 600 km on the right hand side, but unaware that we would share the road with maniacs at every turn it wasnt so bad on the straight stretches, you could see them coming . The Turks are a very amiable bunch, but put them in a car and they obviously put their lives in the hands of Allah. The best way to describe them is that they drive like western teenagers, fast, rude, with no patience and no road sense. They overtake on crests, around bends, through towns and over bridges. They are mad, and it was with relief that we got to our first stop at Ephesus. Ephesus today is the ruins of a once great city. If you know the bible, the Ephesians were lucky enough to get Pauls letters. It was conquered by the Persians, the Greeks, the Romans and Alexander perhaps thats why they turned to Paul for help and is therefore quite a sight today, with buildings that reflect each of those cultures some buildings have been reconstructed mostly from the original materials and are very impressive indeed. There is an ENORMOUS ampitheatre there, still standing, built into the side of a hill. It held 40,000 people They hold rock concerts there now, and Jethro Tull are playing in a few weeks. Ephesus was well worth the visit. With hearts in mouths and foot hovering over the brake pedal, we made our way to Canakkale Chanackalee which is a port on the Dardanelles, across from the Gallipoli Peninsula. We went to the plushest hotel only 30 a night, which gave us a wonderful view across the Dardanelles and was 5 minutes walk from the ferry and the bazaar. Here there were no tourists, little English was spoken and we were finally starting to experience the real Turkey. We had a very amusing walk down the promenade theredotted line everyone seems to go to the water front to walk and talk, there are lots of market stalls, and the mountains of the peninsula across the water, all make a very pretty sight. Turkey is a Muslim country and many women were dressed traditionally. So when Aileen hit the waterfront, with a skirt 2 inches above her knee, the Turkswere a little taken aback. In Bodrum theyre used to bikinis, but in Canakkale there are few tourists, and the eyes of every man and nearly every person went from Aileens legs, up to her face and then back to her legs. I somehow got the impression they didnt approve The next morning we took the car on the feribot and made a short trip across the Dardanelles to the town of Eceabat. From there it was a short drive over to the seaward side and down to Anzac Cove. It is all very unspoiled, theres a small museum nearby and that is about it. It was very quiet, we virtually had the area to ourselves. There are cemeteries dotted all over the area I think the most moving was the one at Anzac Cove Ari Burnu. Perhaps because it was the first we saw. Perhaps because it is now set in such a pretty spot, wildflowers and green grass, hills behind, the graves facing the sparkling blue sea. It was very moving, and very saddening. So many young Australians, and all for nothing. There is an impressive monument down near the beach raised by the Turks with the words of Ataturk upon it. Ataturk led the Turks that held the ANZACS on the first morning and emerged as the most outstanding leader of the campaign he later created the Turkish Republic national hero.. The speech is in a very generous spirit see Mum and Dads postcard and is also very moving. Over the next five hours we made our way around the area where the ANZACS fought, stopping at each of the cemeteries, which are very well looked after, and are very peaceful, each with a monument, and a plaque describing the events that took place in the area. The cemetery at Lone Pine is hard to describe. To say moving is repetitive, to say beautiful is hardly appropriatedotted line perhaps to say that I have tears in my eyes as I think about it and write this is sufficient. Anywaydotted line we made our way around the battlefields, went looking for trenches in certain places and it was fascinating to find them half filled now of course and follow them. All the same it was hard to imagine it all happening. Hard to imagine hundreds of men rising out of trenches, running across no mans land and being cut down by machine guns at The Nek, over 300 Light Horsemen fell in the space of a tennis court. Now the area is a peaceful cemetery, surrounded by trees and with a beautiful view of the sea far below. Later we went down to Cape Helles and by chance bought a cold drink from an old Turk called Mutlu, who took us into his personal Gallipoli museum. He had some fascinating relics, and others he had donated to the official museum at Kabatebe but his museum was as good, if not better. He was a warm old man and it was a nice experience. Everywhere we went the Turks smiled when I said I was Australian or when they saw my hat they seemed to have a healthy respect for Australians, as I do for them other than their drivers."

        "text": "PERTH INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ARTS Donaldson Warns redevelopment of a historic building for PICA, reviewed by Simon Anderson of the University of Western Australia. THE OLD BOYS SCHOOL WITHIN THE PERTH Cultural Centre was offered by the state government to the Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts PICA in 1988, together with an initial capital works allocation for redeveloping the public areas and services to suit the fundamental artistic tenets of the PICA charter movement, sound, language and vision. The principal spaces needed to be flexible and responsive to unconventional use. The brief called for exhibition spaces capable of responding to a radical range of activities, and performance space that can be redefined by the addition or subtraction of lighting grid, acoustic panels and seating units. Accommodation for PICA Press, artists studios, sound studios, libraryresource centre, coffeeshopbar, bookshop, administration and storage made up the minor spaces in the brief. PICA had its origins as an institution in the Perth experimental art group Praxis. That the architectural experiment is not highly visible in PICA needs explanation, and ultimately appreciation. The idea that architecture is one of the fine arts is not a widely held belief. Architecture is thought to be just the container in which art is displayed. But one cannot blame the architects, since they made architecture highly visible in their first scheme and in their comments since.1 Indeed, the coolness of the built project is largely the outcome of the client groups beliefs, the politics of the conservation movement and budgetary restraint. The first scheme boldly opened up the interior by removing the interior walls forming the twostorey central hall, and supporting the remaining structure with a steel truss from which amenities and services for the visual and performing arts could be suspended. A bridge that linked the building directly to the adjacent CBD was also proposed in the first scheme. Indeed, the model made of the first scheme, showing much of the south facade removed to allow easy viewing of the interior, consciously hinted at an even greater exposure for contemporary art in the city. In the executed project, suffering from an emaciated budget due to government restraint, the bridge was lost, the truss became a frame on the balustrade, and removed walls remained, but with larger openings. In addition, the bookshop and cafe were not fitted out. The balance between the historic nature of the building and the aims of contemporary art was critical to the project. Conservation bodies such as the National Trust thought that the first scheme would destroy the architectural integrity of the original building by replacing loadbearing walls with a dominant and alien steel structure. Conservative critics suggested that the aims and objectives of a contemporary art space do not sit comfortably with this heritage building.2 Both groups have static views of history that heritage buildings are old and should be preserved, and contemporary art needs a contemporary setting. In the PICA project, the architects demonstrate that neither belief is necessarily true. The architects have shown more sensitivity to the original school than previous tenants. For, just as the proposed bridge was suspended just short of the original fabric so as not to disturb the exterior, so various traces of the original have been left to allow for future reconstruction. In the first floor gallery, for instance, smooth plasterboard walls are set off the pilasters to create appropriate wall surfaces for contemporary art while preserving the original walls. The various added elements like the cast iron trusses in the performance space used to support the gallery above after the removal of load bearing walls, the new stair, the steel frame to the balustrade in the central space were all designed in small pieces and inserted into the space for site assembly. There is no effort to conceal the additions. They are placed within and apart from the existing. They are positioned offaxis. They are finished differently. They show their newness, thereby allowing for their later modification, or even removal. The lack of a suitable loading dock is an irony that the conservationists must bear since it was brought about by their insistence that the exterior should not be touched. The buildings origin as a school, with classrooms around a central hall, seems not unsympathetic to contemporary arts. The craftsmanship in the cast iron trusses in the performance space is refreshing here as it would be elsewhere. Artists are using the spaces and the possibilities provided by the inserted elements. Future plans for the current temporary galleries on the first floor call for artistinresidence accommodation, sound studio and installation spaces. Hopefully the bridge will also be built at some stage. Interestingly, the first exhibition at PICA was a retrospective of WA sculpture, featuring many artists who have regularly exhibited at the neighbouring Art Gallery of Western Australia AGWA. This brought the relationship of PICA to AGWA into immediate focus. Clearly, performance will define this relationship for PICA, although for the visual arts PICA and AGWA were already alternatives. One must suspect that the alternative alternative art space is now forming somewhere in Perth, presumably away from the centralising3 pull of the Perth Cultural Centre. Notes Geoff Warn. Constructing a Place for Architecture in ARM AprilMay p. Andra Kins. A Glance at PICA in Art Monthly November p.The logic of centralising art institutions in the Perth Cultural Centre has been regularly questioned on the assumption that the centre is culturally dead. See, for example, Duncan Richards. Dead Centre in Fremantle Arts Review March 1989, pp. 3 Emerging architects Enriching the culture In Western Australia, flexibility means survival for young architects and the reward is a richer architectural culture, according to Simon Anderson SINCE ARCHITECTURE AUSTRALIA LAST looked at the work of emerging architects, in May 1990, the economic recession has made it almost impossible for younger architects to develop viable practices or indeed to build within established practices. In the last two years, architects have found it difficult to even find work in architectural practices. This presents an ideal opportunity to focus on young architects varied and generally nonbuilding activities, in part precipitated by recession and certainly magnified by it. If unable to enter the profession in the traditional way, young practitioners must turn to other activities. They can teach, they can take the opportunity to study in Australia or overseas, they can travel, they can turn to allied activities like project management, planning, urban design, landscape architecture, curatorial work or public art commissions. Architectural competitions can provide stimulation as can shortterm contracts with established architects. All of these activities have proliferated in Perth over the last two years, adding a new dimension to the architectural culture of the state which has always valued building over ideas and drawings about architecture. Surprisingly, in this recession there has been no movement to control numbers of architectural graduates. The emerging Western Australian architects featured in Architecture Australia in May 1990 are all still active in Perth. Robert Moore has joined the practice of R.J.Ferguson and Associates and is learning the art of working for the large educational institutions that support that particular practice. Donaldson Warn have completed significant residential Chauvel House, institutional PICA refurbishment and commercial buildings ANZ Bank West Perth, as well as continuing to enter competitions, recently winning two South Perth Library and Claremont Fire Station refurbishment. The practice continues to contribute to the teaching programme at Curtin University. Paul Jones of Philip Cox, Etherington, Coulter Jones has gone on to design major projects here and overseas. The State governments architectural office, the Building Management Authority BMA, has traditionally trained young architects who choose to work there because of the public nature of the projects offered. In an economic recession, only the very best are employed and many projects are not built, like the Albany Agricultural Offices and Bureauwest published in The Architect in Spring 1990. In this recession, the BMA is almost the only local practice offering attractive work to young architects. The bureaucratic nature of a large government architects office is still apparent, yet the BMA has been very supportive of its young architects, accepting that their engagement might be temporary or even broken by extended overseas travel. Jandakot Primary School, designed by Dave Gulland and Steve Parkin of the BMA, is a new nineclassroom school on an undeveloped site with allowance for eight classrooms to be added later. Colour and texture are used to code the activities of the various parts of the school, while a more urban approach to planning than is customary in schools is adopted. Sculptural elements are added for climbing on, sitting on, letting light in and encouraging breezes. In its legible yet playful design, the school suggests that the rational and the wilful can happily coexist in even the most institutional environment. Another young designer at the BMA, Mark Krynski, has designed new engineering workshops at a Metropolitan College of TAFE, and alterations and additions to North Mandurah Primary School. Krynski teaches at both schools of architecture in Perth a situation which was rare until recently and reflects the increasing importance of design education within the schools. The BMA wisely supports its staff in their teaching interests, as it is clearly a major beneficiary of quality design education. The lack of work in the established offices has seen the emergence of various graduate design cooperatives which have been assisted in professional, liability and registration matters by practicing architects through the RAIAs WA Chapter and the Architects Board of WA. For without that first job it is impossible to even leave Perth. The most active cooperative has been InHaus, founded by six UWA graduates at the end of The group has been involved in small commissions, competitions, mounting exhibitions of architecture and art within their own office, and curating exhibitions of collaborative work between architects and artists. Group members additionally undertake contract work for other architects, teach at the schools of architecture, and even produce radio programmes on the visual arts and architecture. Activities like these suggest that architects need to be flexible if they want to remain gainfully employed. Yet architecture is still the central concern. Sarah Cope of InHaus has designed a small house at York which has all the simplicity of a youthful designers work, and a restrained economy which is lacking in many houses by architects. Flexibility also characterises the practice of Richard Black. Black is currently teaching fulltime at Curtin University. Since graduating in 1988, he has worked with both Donaldson Warn and the BMA, as well as undertaking postgraduate studies as a guest student with Peter Cook at the Stadelschule Hochschule Fur Bildende Kunste in Frankfurt. Blacks practice is currently based in Perth, and his studies in Germany bring to Australia the issues of complex urban centres. At the same time, his projects have a clarity of vision that surely must interest Europeans. His work has been exhibited overseas in the UK, Europe and Japan, and locally in January 1990 at the Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts reviewed by Duncan Richards in The Architect Autumn 1990. The PICA exhibition featured successful international and national architectural competition projects by a group of recent Curtin University graduates, including Parkin and Krynski. Blacks City SpaceCity Room creates a sequence of elliptical external rooms within the Baroque city grid of Berlin, distorting traditional streets and site boundaries. The strong form of the ellipses corresponds to the grand city grid, yet local forces of viewing angles and light are absorbed. The outer ring of each ellipse is office space bounding an inner ring of, respectively, sports hall, hotel and living accommodation. A fourth scooped and ascending space connects the elevated activities to the street and the subway. K. R. Popper, in an essay titled Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition in his Conjectures and Refutations, mentions the difficulty of establishing a research tradition in a small and young university. In a similar sense, there are difficulties in establishing a rich architectural culture in a small and young state. This recession seems to have helped in founding activities that might establish such a tradition. Young architects are no longer fleeing overseas. They are receiving the support of the schools, the government architects office, the RAIA, the registration board. The state is probably architecturally richer for the recession definitely not financially, but certainly intellectually. Simon Anderson is Dean of the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Western Australia."

        "text": "LOOKING AT apples A GRAND PARADE OF THAT MOST TEMPTING FRUIT OUR OLD FAVOURITES, NATURALLY, AND SOME OF THE NEWER VARIETIES APPLES ARE THE LATEST INHABITANTS of the greengrocers shelves to begin appearing in interesting new varieties. Around now, you may see, alongside old friends such as Jonathans, the showy red Royal Gala and red and yellow Jonagold, as well as striped and russeted Coxs Orange Pippins the last not a new apple, but a famous old English variety that is more widely available than heretofore. Coming along any minute, in company with familiar Granny Smiths and red and golden Delicious, there will be Mutsu and Fuji. Later, as well as the now wellestablished Bonza which was itself big news some halfdozen years ago when it was launched on the market, there will be Sundowner and the big success among the new varieties, Pink Lady. These new names belong to those few that have made the grade out of innumerable possibilities. Since apples do not grow true from seed, new varieties appear constantly. The vast majority will remain nameless and forgotten, but once in a great while either an accidental seedling that appears in an orchard, or one of the thousands raised in breeding programs every year, will be chosen as a champion. Identical descendants can then be bred from this tree by vegetative propagation. Australia had many more apple varieties until half a century or so ago than we have now. Then the dreaded process began by which growers concentrate more and more on efficiency of operation than on giving the customer the best possible range. It was simpler for both grower and retailer to stick to just a few kinds of apple, and the choice at the greengrocer shrank to little more than the big three, Granny Smith, Jonathan and Delicious. In addition, as with much other fresh produce, those varieties that did survive were bred toward characteristics that suited the grower disease resistance, heavy cropping, standing up well to lengthy storage and transportation often at the cost of fine flavour and texture. Apples joined the list of fruits and vegetables that had lost much of their remembered charm. The turnaround began after Australian growers lost the UK market when that country joined the European Economic Community. Around the same time, on our own fruit and vegetable scene, the trend was beginning that was to become an explosion, introducing us to scores of new kinds, new colours, new shapes, new sizes of everything from lettuce to leeks, potatoes to pears, berries to beetroot. A good greengrocer now carries some 85 items on his shelves, compared to 45 a decade ago. Customers are inquiring and interested, and expect plenty to choose from. To capture its share of this interest, the apple industry needed to offer more variety and more of the characteristics that consumers, as opposed to growers, care about. It wouldnt work, the experts felt, simply to bring back the old varieties. Those apples might have tasted terrific, but they didnt on the whole have the perfect, uniform good looks that todays consumer has come to expect. They didnt stand up to lengthy storage as well as modern varieties do, either. Apples were more seasonal then, whereas today we demand good fresh apples all year round, and the industry meets this demand by keeping much of the crop in Controlled Atmosphere storage a precisely controlled condition that puts the fruit to sleep, so that, theoretically, it emerges as fresh as it went in. The ability to store well is an allimportant characteristic for a modern apple variety, although its obvious to any consumer that some still dont perform as well as they might. What the old apple varieties did have were flavour and marked individual characteristics, so that one would buy one kind of apple for making a good, tart jelly, another kind for roasting, making zesty applesauce or cooking in a pie, and another for eating, with plenty of choice according to whether one preferred a dense or juicy texture and a spicy, honeyed, aromatic or sharp flavour. The new varieties are undoubtedly handsome and industry spokesmen say that they combine the best of new and old characteristics, although there still doesnt seem to be a new one with the tang of a fresh Jonathon. Its fashionable to complain about what they have done to fresh produce, but the ultimate power lies with the consumer according to how discriminating we are when we go to the greengrocer, we get what we deserve. If we buy mediocre apples, we are encouraging the industry to keep growing them. If we want apples all year round, it is unreasonable to decry lengthy storage and remember that apples have always been stored in cellars to last through the winter, long before newfangled science took a hand some kinds, indeed, are too sharp to be palatable when picked and need some storage time to mellow. The apple industry is listening again its up to us to decide which varieties, new or old, deserve our support. STORING APPLES Dont keep apples in the fruit bowl they will remain in much better condition if kept in the refrigerator, in the crisper or a perforated plastic bag. Dont wash them until you are ready to use them. Bonza A Jonathan sport a sudden, spontaneous deviation from an established type found at Batlow, NSW, about 25 years ago. Hailed by the industry as the successor to the Jonathan since Bonza remains juicier and crisper after lengthy storage. A midtolateseason apple with firm flesh and good flavour, although it does not have quite the piquant tang of its parent. Braeburn A new midtolateseason variety with cream flesh, sweet and with a touch of sharpness. Coxs Orange Pippin An old English earlyseason variety with dense, sweetsharp flesh, good for both eating and cooking, although apple fanciers say that some of the character has been bred out of it in recent years. Fuji A major new Japanese variety that has become popular internationally, this lateseason apple is available from April to September. Texture is extremely dense, so it bruises easily. This juicy apple with a distinctive flavour also cooks well. Golden Delicious Originating in a chance seedling found in West Virginia, USA, around the turn of the century, this is a midseason to late apple with creamywhite flesh and a flavour that has the typical aromatic quality of the Delicious family, but is insipid to many tastes. It performs well in cooking, its slices holding their shape well for decorative tarts. Granny Smith An old variety originating from a chance seedling at Ryde, NSW, and now popular worldwide. A late apple, appearing in the shops in April. An excellent cooking apple whose flesh falls to a pureacutee. Good eating, with tart, crisp flesh, when eaten fresh, but often disappointing as an eating apple out of season. Jonagold A new variety descended from Jonathan and Golden Delicious, this early apple was preferred, in a recent test, by the consumers who sit on the CSIROs sensory evaluation panel, to all other early varieties, including Jonathon. Jonathan An old variety originating in the USA in the early 19th century. It is an earlyseason apple with crisp, juicy flesh and, when eaten fresh, an outstanding sweet and tangy flavour. Although a popular apple, Jonathan does not come through lengthy storage well, so is in danger of being phased out of production. Not recommended for cooking. Lady Williams An old variety, the result of a chance cross between Rokewood and Granny Smith in Western Australia. A very late apple, appearing in the shops in July. Very firm flesh, extremely tart in flavour when picked but developing a distinctive sweet flavour and generally improving with storage. Pink Lady A new Australianbred variety descended from Lady Williams and Golden Delicious, it has had great success both here and overseas. A late apple, harvested in May, with dense, firm, fine flesh and flavour somewhat reminiscent of Golden Delicious but with more character. Sundowner Another descendant of Lady Williams and Golden Delicious, but with more Lady Williams characteristics than Pink Lady. A late apple which, like Lady Williams, is very tart when picked but whose sugar level improves with storage to make it sweet and flavoursome. Fairly firm but easily bruised. Red Delicious A midtolateseason American variety which began to be grown in Australia in the 70s. Although it dates from last last century, it has been considerably modified in more recent times to develop more colour, better storage qualities and a more distinctive, elongated shape. Its flesh is firm, creamyyellow and juicy, flavour is sweet and aromatic but a little flat. Nevertheless, it is Americas most popular eating apple. Not recommended for cooking. Royal Gala This new variety, developed in New Zealand, is the brightest of the Gala strains, which run from pale yellow with a blush through to this crimson beauty. An early apple, harvested in February. Densetextured, juicy and sweet. Makes good baked or poached apple, but not good for good apple puree. Tassie Snow An old variety from Tasmanias Huon Valley, this is a midtolateseason apple with cream flesh and sweet, subtle flavour. treadinggingerly USED IN COOKING, SWEET AND SAVOURY, SINCE ANCIENT TIMES, GINGER IS SYNONYMOUS WITH STRENGTH AND VITALITY IN MY UNCOUTH YOUTH I CONSIDERED GINGER a robust and rather crude flavouring. I heaped large quantities of old fibrous ginger root into deranged stirfries, and marvelled at the pungency. For morning tea at work we were given a biscuit so oversaturated with vulgar industrial ginger powder that it could not be mellowed even by dipping in stewed coffee. I decided ginger sweets were off my menu when sold a rancid dish of preserved ginger topped with artificial cream by a restaurant that had no shame. I was so misled by these experiences that when I did encounter a sublime dish with exceptionally clean spiciness, I failed to recognise that ginger was the star flavouring. The dish that changed my view was a simple, perfect fishfry. And it was cooked by a Malay significant because Malays have had more experience at cooking ginger than perhaps anyone else on earth, centuries of it. Ginger is the undersoil stem of a plant native to tropical Asia and thought to be first cultivated in Malaya. Malays consider ginger essential when cooking fish, because it subdues strong fishy odours. An aroma of sweet clean heat hovered over the wok. My fish tasted distinctive and pure. Of course it is all a matter of balance, and good quality ginger. Australia and New Zealand ginger is usually sold more mature than the prized young ginger sold in Southeast Asia, which means that it is not as sweet and subtle, but it is mild compared to that grown in West Africa, yet stronger than that grown in the Caribbean. If you are using an American cookbook, the ginger referred to is probably Caribbean. In an English cookbook, it is probably West African. You will have to make adjustments to these recipes. The best ginger races from the Portuguese word raices, or roots are hard, with taut almost translucent skin it does not need peeling. Good luck, because ginger that good is hard to find. Try the Asian markets, or pick over the ginger at your greengrocer looking for the best of the batch. Reject roots with heavily wrinkled skin and paunchy flesh its useless. You may not be able to avoid ginger with a few wrinkles, but make sure its firm. Slightly less than perfect ginger will yield good results but you will need to use a little more to obtain a good depth of flavour and you will certainly need to peel it. A salad of young, fresh ginger and tomatoes is used in parts of India like a sorbet to clean the palate. Ginger icecream is popular in some parts of the USA warm flavour within the icy confection is surprisingly pleasant. In China, I have been served a dish of cat and ginger that Im sure was perfectly flavoured, although I have to confess I only pretended to eat it."

        "text": "C.N.Denton 3 Chelmsford Ave CROYDON, 2132 93 Photo Savers PL Attention Tony Khourey Re Damaged Fujichrome film Dear Sir, During late November I purchased two rolls of prepaid Fujichrome slide film for a job related to my work. I used both these films during an inspection of a construction site on which I am working. The films were used consecutively in the same camera and within an hour of each other The camera was an SLR type, owned and used for several years by myself. Both films were exposed under similar conditions and identical camera settings. After each film was exposed it was wound back fully into its canister. Both films were sent away for processing within a day or so. They were received in your laboratory on the This was subsequently verified by the Operator on your 008 807162 number. I received one set of slides after a week or so. They were in good condition and correctly exposed. The slides were from the second role of film I exposed. Nearly three weeks after I received the first set of slides I called up the 008 807162 number and inquired about the outstanding roll of film. I was told the role had been received and the operator would try to locate it. She took my phone number and said she would call back. This was towards the end of the week a Thursday or Friday. I heard no more from the Operator. On Monday the next week, I received a role of exposed film that was completely clear. There was a note on the paper packing stating FILM RECD DAMAGED. I examined the film and it was slightly damaged where the feed sprockets initially engage the film and there were some staple marks from where the film was attached to the spool in the canister and another set at the beginning of the film that I presume resulted from your in laboratory procedures. While the damage may indicate the film was not wound on properly this was not the case. While I have been known to mess up films I believe I learn by my mistakes and take particular attention to load films carefully and ensure they are wound on correctly and fully wound off. I handle the film with care and do not force any of the mechanisms. I believe the film was not physically damaged either in the camera or up until the time it entered the post. I feel it was unlikely to have suffered damage in the post consistent with the physical damage to the film nor its exposure. I have had years of experience with print film and I have used a variety of cameras. I am not so acquainted with slide film. I referred the matter to an acquaintance of mine who is a lecturer in photography at Sydney Tech. His opinion is that the film has been fully exposed outside the camera. Evidence exists that the exposure occurred with the film completely removed from the canister. I called the 008 807162 number again and asked to be connected to your Customer Service Manager or equivalent position. The Operator said she was the contact person. Accordingly I identified the problem. She said there was nothing she could or would do and I should write a letter. I then called Hanimex as they were nominated as the company who would do the processing by Fuji. They were more sympathetic to my position but thought the responsibility lay with your company. I agreed, but I reminded the person that Hanimex was the processor nominated by Fuji and so any poor service would reflect on Hanimex. She then offered to pursue the matter further and presumably gave my name to you. You subsequently called me. I suggested to you that as the film is fully exposed including that portion that would have been in the canister whatever happened almost certainly occurred in your laboratory. I can only feel that there has been a concerted effort to mislead me on what happened to the film. While I can accept that people make mistakes and processes fail from time to time I cannot accept being deliberately deceived. There seems to be some indication that this has happened. My suspicions have been raised due the inordinate time delay in getting the film back. If the film was received damaged why was it held at the laboratory for such a long time Surely there was nothing to be gained in retaining it There was a benefit in ignoring the matter. Is it entirely coincidental that the film appeared such a short time after I made an inquiry Why did the operator not call back I cannot even feel confident that the film returned to me is the one I sent in. I note the order number on the packaging carries a different number than on the film. You suggested the film and packaging are not matched using these numbers but rather other identifiers. This may be the case but could I suggest that the identifiers on the film and package be checked to see if they were used on or about the date of processing. You may also like to comment on the fact that the identifying tag is not securely attached to the film and it is damaged in a way consistent with being relocated While the material on the film was not indispensable, I now have a gap in the photographic record I was keeping of progress on the project. One slide may have been used in a case against one of the project parties for nonconformance to the specification. I may not be able to gain this evidence again. The loss of the film is of lesser importance than the contempt for customers that events to date seem to support. I consider this a very important issue. I doubt that I will ever use your services again but realistically that is not likely to cause you too much concern. However, unless the matter is resolved in a reasonable time, I am prepared to formally make my experiences available to both Hanimex and Fuji for their information and action. The ACA is also appreciative of background information on the performance of suppliers. Hoping to hear from you in the near future, Yours faithfully, As requested, the film and packaging is enclosed at my cost.

Attached are copies of 1 my letter detailing the matter, 2 Photo Savers reply and 3 my subsequent reply. I hope these letters are self explanatory. My intention in sending these letters to you is to make you aware of a problem I have experienced with the service supplier Photo Savers. Should it be an isolated case then I assume nothing more will come of it. Should it be symptomatic of a larger problem my experiences may be of use. Forwarded for your information. Could I also raise another matter that you may find relevant. Unfortunately it is somewhat dated now but a principle that I consider important is raised and you may chose to give it some consideration. It concerns the actions of RENTOKIL Environmental Services. For some considerable time the people who owned the premises before us contracted Rentokil to carry out a service on an annual basis. This was continued given that there had been a ongoing problem with birds and rodents in the roof. On the last occasion, in late 1992, Rentokil said their service was due and I made arrangements to stay home to let them in the house. On all other occasions my wife had stayed home. Unfortunately I was called in to work on short notice so made arrangements for the key to be left next door. The service man came, completed his service and left a report. I was horrified to note that he had sprayed the premises with unidentified substances without any approval as required by their own form. I wrote to the firm to register my concern copy of letter dated .92 attached. Unfortunately I have misplaced the reply but it said, in essence, the chemicals were harmless and the firm had been doing it for thirteen years so what was the problem. This only prompted my concerns further. While Dursban PC is a dangerous chemical, what was used thirteen years ago may well have been even worse. Accordingly I took a soil sample to standard methods from my small garden plot where I grow vegetables with the children and sent it away for analysis. The analysis was not very encouraging. There was evidence of OrganoChlorines, DDT and various other toxic chemicals. According to the Dutch standards the levels were at the threshold where more testing is justified to verify the initial results. Given that my sampling methods did not concentrate at the soil near the fence and the deep cultivation of the ground the results could be expected to err on the low side. Further testing was too costly so I did not pursue this course. Unfortunately I have misplaced the laboratory results also. As I became involved in other matters including a large work load I neglected to follow the matter up with Rentokil. In reality I cannot positively say that Rentokil is totally responsible for the questionable condition of my soil as I do not know what the previous owners may have applied. From my knowledge of them I doubt they were responsible. However on the balance of probability it is likely they contaminated the soil. My problem is that Rentokil had applied chemicals to the property for a very long period without any regard for the buildup of chemicals, without permission on the last occasion and on previous occasions obtained a signature after the chemicals had been applied, provided no information re precautions that needed to be taken after the chemical had been applied, gave highly incorrect information, gave false information and did not seem to be concerned about what had occurred. I find this totally unacceptable. I have no particular vendetta against Rentokil as I assume their actions may well by typical of the industry as an aside the other day I noticed a vehicle from another pest control company in green livery and friendly environmental messages written over it carrying a large tank permanently affixed to it clearly marked Heptachlor . I would not like to guess how many people there are having dangerous chemicals routinely applied to their property without their full knowledge and without any or accurate advice on proper precautions. Again I do not suppose that this letter will lead to direct action but it may serve the purpose of raising an issue that I feel strongly about. P.S. I was a long term subscriber to Choice but with the change in direction taken by the magazine a number of years ago it gradually became less significant to me, and I did not renew the subscription. However I still support the intent of your organisation and the work you do in raising issues on behalf of consumers. Regards, A.N. Denton and B.J.

        "text": "LIVE FUEL WATER CONTENT Brian Tunstall1 Abstract Factors affecting live fuel water content are discussed with a view to its prediction with an accuracy adequate for fire hazard modelling. Live fuel water content varies with plant organ, phenology and environmental conditions both within and between species. When expressed as a ratio to dry weight, it is affected equally by changes in water and dry matter. Being affected by a multitude of factors, it has only been documented where strongly seasonal climates produce regular patterns. The challenge in Australia is to predict changes in live fuel water content where climatic variability has as much influence as seasonality. Of the plant organs, leaves show the greatest changes in water content. Within species, water contents depend on leaf and plant histories as well as current environmental conditions. Water contents can readily be measured but results obtained may be unique to the particular circumstances and hence be difficult to predict. It is suggested that live fuel water content would be better predicted through modelling soil water balance than by relating it to an evaporation index derived from ambient temperature. In principle, this requires the estimation of small changes in tissue water content against a background of large transpirational flows. In practice, this can be circumvented by scaling the results within predefined limits established through analysing longterm climatic records. In the future, surface temperatures derived from thermal imagery may be used to upgrade water use predictions or provide moisture indices. More remotely, surface moisture may be measured using satellitemounted radar. Introduction Live fuel may act either as sink or a source of heat during fires it has the potential both to slow a fire and to increase the rate of combustion. The transition from sink to source depends on water content while the magnitude of the effects depends on the amount, size and distribution of the fuel elements. While the combustion of dead fuel is affected by the same factors, the fuels differ in response to the environment, particularly with respect to water content. The objective of this paper is to provide information which will assist in the formulation of a simple means of predicting live fuel water content with an accuracy adequate for fire hazard modelling. Live fuel water content varies with plant organ, phenology and environmental conditions within and between species and, when expressed as a ratio of dry weight, is affected equally by changes in water and dry matter. Being affected by a multitude of factors, it has been documented only where strong seasonal climates produce regular patterns. The challenge in Australia is the prediction of changes where climatic variability has as much influence as seasonality. Between Species Variation Plants are normally grouped according to physical characteristics when modelling fuel because definition of the characteristics of all species is impractical. The broadest groupings are herbs, grass, shrubs and trees with additional categories such as mallee being recognised where required. However, there are large temporal variations in plant water relations related to phenology rather than structure grasses and herbs may be winter or summer growing, annual or perennial. Moreover, apparently similar plants may vary greatly in water relations and response to fire. The general principle in forming such groups is to ensure variation within groups is less than between groups. The complexity in species composition is usually avoided by basing groups on abundance, neglecting rare or uncommon life forms. This limits application of such models to similar systems, a largely unavoidable constraint because of the wide spectrum of vegetation and environments to be encompassed. Within Species Variation The tissues of most higher plants exhibit an increase in dry weight with age associated with the lignification and suberization of tissue. Gravimetric water content, as a ratio of dry weight, therefore decreases with age. This pattern of change is shown by organs having a finite number of cells, such as leaves, but it varies with species. Specific leaf weight dry weight per unit area of oak remains relatively constant following an initial increase but with pears there is a continuous increase until approaching senescence Ackley 1954. However, for cotton, the age of the plant is a much greater determinant of leaf water content than is leaf age Weatherly 1950. The main changes in dry weights of mature leaves arise through changes in the levels of carbohydrates. Generally, the balance between photosynthesis and translocation is such that carbohydrates accumulate in leaves during the day and become depleted during the night but this pattern can vary depending on plant phenology. Much of the seasonal change in water contents of mature gymnosperm leaves has been attributed to patterns of carbohydrate accumulation Kozlowski Clausen 1965 Pharis 1967 Gary 1971 Chrosciewicz 1986. Stems of herbs show similar patterns to leaves but woody stems continue to expand through the production of new cells. The old cells become lignified and die and the water content is then lower than in developing tissue. Stem water contents are usually characterised in relation to stem diameter to accommodate the change in the ratio of live to dead wood associated with stem growth. Age effects for stems are accounted for in the diameter classes but age effects in leaves are usually neglected for all except deciduous and annual plants. Water contents are usually determined for representative samples and this involves the assumptions that the samples are either homogenous or representative of the leaf populations. The former assumption is valid with oak leaves throughout most of their lives and the latter is valid with many mature coniferous trees. The applicability of these assumptions to Australian woody vegetation is unknown. Most Australian evergreen species drop leaves after, rather than before, the development of new leaves and leaf populations also vary through drought and predation. As it is probably not feasible to stratify the foliage of Australian evergreen species according to age, fluctuations will be unaccounted for and will remain a source of variance in measurements of leaf water content. Typical values of water content for mesophytic plants, on a dry weight basis, are leaves 4OO, roots 800, stems of annuals 4OO and trunks 100 Barrs 1968 but typical values are of little use because of the large variations associated with species and weather. Typical values for leaves of eucalypts are 150 range 100400 when wet and 60 range 5080 when droughted but alive. Water contents of leaves of eucalypt seedlings tend to be double those of adults. Stem water contents of eucalypts range from 40 to 90 with most of the variation apparently being related to species rather than environmental conditions. Environmental Conditions Water loss from both live and deal fuels depends on the vapour concentration difference between the surface and the atmosphere and the resistance to flow. This similarity occurs because of the common sink, energy source and transport processes but dissimilarities exist because of differences in the water sources. Water lost from dead fuel comes largely from within whereas water lost from live fuel comes largely from the soil. Prediction of live fuel water content from environmental conditions therefore involves the estimation of small changes in leaf water content against a background of a large flow of water through the leaves. Water flow from soil through plants is along water potential gradients developed through evaporation of water from leaves. The magnitude of this gradient is largely controlled by the resistance of leaves to the transfer of water vapour Cowan 1972. Herbaceous plants and many grasses cannot completely prevent water loss but the resistance of sclerophyllous leaves can be sufficiently high so as to effectively stop transpiration. This control of leaf water content through stomatal closure appears to be organised so as to optimise the CO2 gain in relation to water loss under the prevailing conditions Cowan 1982. It is therefore a function of, inter alia, temperature, irradiance and water supply. The result is diurnal and seasonal changes in leaf water content related to temperature, evaporative demand and water availability but modified by irradiance and plant development. Leaf water content is most closely related to soil water availability at dawn or following a period when evaporative demand greatly exceeds the availability of water, i.e. at zero transpiration. The extant soil factors that determine water availability to plants are soil water content and the relationship between this and both soil water potential and hydraulic conductivity. These relationships vary within and between soil profiles. Their definition requires considerable effort and is seldom attempted, particularly because use of the information requires a detailed knowledge of plant root distribution as it affects water uptake. Fig. 1 illustrates some of these aspects. Compared with trees, dawn water potentials of shrubs were higher when conditions were wet but lower when conditions were dry but there are large differences between shrub species plants modify their environment. The seasonal range of dawn water potentials was from around 1 to 6 MPa zero water potential is rarely measured. Dawn water potentials of droughted Eucalypts and brigalow Acacia harpophylla are around 7 and 8 MPa respectively. The magnitude of the diurnal change in plant water potential and its dependence on plant water status is given in Fig.2 for brigalow. Initially, the diurnal change increases with decrease in water availability reflecting the increase in resistance to flow of water in a drying soil. With further drying, the pattern reverses with the plant controlling the degree of desiccation. The maximum diurnal change of 5 MPa is appreciable when compared with the seasonal change 5 MPa. Relationships between leaf water content and leaf water potential are usually given with water content being expressed as a ratio of the saturated water content this reduces the variance associated with differences in leaf specific dry weight. Such relationships are summarised in Table 1 for Australian woody species where the published data allowed the calculation of absolute water contents. For simplicity, linear relationships have been assumed but this is a poor approximation for some species. However, there are many other sources of error, the most notable of which is the estimate of saturated water content. The relationships may not relate well to field measurement Fig. 3. The vapour equilibration technique appears to overestimate water content. The pressure extraction technique provides more realistic estimates, albeit a little low. The relationships in Table 1 are therefore largely unique as they vary with the measurement technique and the ecotype, stage of development and drought history of the species. Moreover, estimates of water content derived in this manner do not include variations due to changes in specific leaf weight. However, the higher the saturated water content of the tissue the greater the absolute and relative loss of water with decrease in water potential there is a convergence of leaf water contents with drying. Changes in water potential affect stem water contents much less than leaves. Eucalypt stems with the low water content of 43 showed less than 1 change in water content for 1 MPa change in water potential Myers et al. 1987. Prediction of Live Fuel Water Content From the above it is apparent that the measurement of live fuel water content is much simpler than its derivation from related variables. This is of little comfort however, where the information is to be used in simulation. In practice, the complexities are avoided to varying degrees by deriving empirical relationships between live fuel content and indices derived from environmental variables. The simplest approach is to regard live fuel a lagged dead fuel Burgan 1979 leaves were classified as 10 000 hr dry fuel and water content varied over specified ranges in relation to rainfall and an evaporation index. The next level of complexity is to predict soil water content and establish empirical relationships between leaf and soil water content. Soil water content can be calculated using a mass balance equation such as Sc Sa P I S D Ea where Sc and Sa are the current and antecedent soil water contents, P the precipitation, I the interception of water by vegetation, S the surface runoff, D the drainage or deep percolation and Ea the actual evapotranspiration."

        "text": "A NEW JAPAN Thats the only certainty IT is high irony that what seems to have saved the corruption soiled Liberal Democratic Party from outright defeat in Sundays Japanese general election is the collapse of the socialist vote. While in these postCold War times the drain of support from the Left is understandable, and perhaps inevitable, it is a fact that had the socialist vote held, the antiLDP coalition would have won. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said at his postelection news conference yesterday The LDP has won as the leading No. 1 party, so it has the duty to continue the nations government. Mr Miyazawa is unlikely to survive as Prime Minister beyond the holding of a special parliamentary session to be called within a month. What his country undoubtedly faces is a period of some uncertainty at least so far as formal government is concerned and most likely rampant and unseemly horsetrading for power. Sundays result is not the worst that might have occurred. But it goes close to it. Japan is likely to have even after next months parliamentary meeting its weakest government in decades. Any new leader, LDP or otherwise, will have to battle the powerful bureaucratic structure to implement new policies. The people voted for change or, at least, a majority of the 67 percent who turned out did Japan like most democracies does not have compulsory voting. It is now up to the political process and the politicians to ensure that they get it. The old corruption must go. What will take its place is the most puzzling question. None of the parties many of them new that contested the election spelled out firm or even particularly formed policies on anything much at all. In that environment, on the policy front at least, more of the same seems the most likely outcome, however prettily that same is dressed in new clothes. The Japanese business community welcomes the result. The chairman of the powerful Federation of Economic Organisations, Mr Gaisha Hiraiwa, says he expects the LDP and other conservative parties will swiftly strive for stabilisation of the administration. There are substantial problems to be faced the final outcome of the Uruguay Round of trade talks, the building economic confrontation between the United States and Japan, the thorny question of stabilising the stock market and the yen. The election was, rightly, viewed as a major turning point for Japan and its democracy. The LDP had held power unencumbered by coalition since It presided over the great swelling of Japanese industrial and commercial might. That it did so is to its credit. That it became in the process enmeshed in institutionalised corruption and money politics is regrettable, worthy of punishment, but also, sadly, probably inevitable. Parliamentary democracy is served best by a system in which there are electable rivals a lesson not lost on Australians at this time so that within reasonable timescales there is a turnover of power. Something of that sort happened in Japan on Sunday. But the shape of the eventual coalition, and the strength of the new commitment to electoral, political and economic reform, are as yet a long way from being clear. What emerges, and how it emerges, will be of crucial interest to Australia, the region and the world. PLAIN LOCO A plan that doesnt add up WHY the railways should consider that, in the interests of downsizing, Queensland taxpayers should meet the cost of continuing to employ people for whom there is no work is an interesting and expensive question. Why the Government, in the person of Transport Minister David Hamill, should insist on the scheme is even more interesting. Why either is prepared to acquiesce in the face of political and union pressure to look after people is the most interesting question of all. According to confidential documents, Queensland Railways have been advised to sweeten redundancy deals or come up with more creative packages so that those selected for the tap on the shoulder will go quietly. The objective, it seems, is to provide a profitable bottom line for a corporatised railway system. There are two separate issues at stake here. One is efficiency, represented by a leaner staff list and much higher productivity. The other is the Governments plan to shut down socalled uneconomic lines. On both fronts, the people the ultimate owners of the railways and payers of any sweetheart redundancy deals are being sold pups. Private enterprise could not operate on the basis the railways apparently plan to proceed. The shareholders would revolt and the directors would be sacked. In the long run, unions do their members a disservice if they succeed in winning arrangements that are plainly economic nonsense. They save jobs now at the expense of effectiveness and longterm viability. If the railways and the Government are determined to shut down large sections of the network and slash employment, they should have the courage to do so on the most economic basis feasible, and be upfront about it. Few people would doubt that the railways could be made vastly more efficient. It is inevitable that technological change will reduce formerly high levels of employment. It is not inevitable that it should result in shutting down all but the coal lines and the coastal trunk routes. The Government, on the question of line closures, seems to be proceeding on a basis that shows it to be the victim of its own propaganda. Figures purporting to show the viability of certain sections of line relate to freight and passengers delivered to destinations hence the rationalisation, for example, of closing down Quilpie. They do not take account of outward movements that gets credited to the destination, too so that livestock from Quilpie say or apples and stone fruit from Stanthorpe, heavy users of the railways, are simply ignored in the calculations. This is madness and it is time the Government was told so loudly, clearly, unequivocally. The people of Queensland should not accept at face value the unsubstantiated claims of any side in this dispute. The railways have their own objective, corporatised profitability the unions have theirs, another version of that tried and failed Australian public service standard of jobs for life and the Government has either embraced political cupidity or social stupidity. On neither choice do its actions give Queenslanders much cause for confidence. None of the participants in this sorry pantomime emerge at this stage covered with glory what seems to be attaching itself to their persons is much less pleasant. SHAMBOLISM We must all act on jobless ONE million unemployed is a symbolic figure. It is, as well, shambolic it symbolises the shambles that this aspect of public policy has collapsed into under the weight of the recession we had to have. It is very much a political issue in the sense that politics necessarily governs how we live as a nation but much less a partisan question than some would have us believe. The bottom line is not who caused it and anyway, the people will have their say on that on March 13. It is how we can get out of it as quickly and effectively as possible. In their comments yesterday, a range of political leaders got it right, or at any rate partly so. Treasurer John Dawkins, on the hustings in Brisbane, said there was a ray of hope. The trend has stabilised and we are hopeful it will head in the right direction, he said. His view unsurprisingly was echoed by Prime Minister Keating. Opposition Leader John Hewson said of explanations that the January figures were raw data awaiting statistical attention You cant seasonally adjust people. Premier Wayne Goss was sourly most sensible This country has got many years of hard work, years of blood, sweat and tears, in front of it, irrespective of who wins the federal election. In Queensland, job growth is keeping roughly in step with population growth. It is doing very little to cut back on the pool of longterm unemployed most new jobs went to the new jobseekers and it is profoundly unclear and the State Government would like it to remain so what proportion of new jobs are productive, longterm employment prospects. There is only one way out of this dreadful maze. Granted to take up Mr Goss point that real economic growth will have to wait for a revival of the global economy, governments everywhere must finally grasp the fact that real productive employment exists in and is created in the private sector. Until official policy at every level of government recognises that fact and implements changes to promote private enterprise, no solution will be found. The fact is, unemployment at the level Australia has been experiencing is simply unacceptable. Worse, it is dangerous. A whole generation of young people is coming on to the job market with bleak prospects indeed of finding productive, careerpath employment. A swathe of middleaged Australians, still in their prime, are being thrown on the scrapheap. Governments answer is to provide training packages. Training for what It should be no ones proud boast that we have the worlds most retrained dole lines. Or else they create jobs by spending public money money we do not have on bringing forward projects that provide temporary jobs or makeandmend schemes. As we note above, Mr Goss is right. It will take a long time and a lot of hard work to rebuild a productive employmentgrowth economy. He also understands that job growth is statebased. Why then does his Government fail to act energetically to promote productive projects greenfield as well as in the resource sector that will lead to real economic growth Queensland is leading Australia at present. But it wont for long if the toohard baskets remain overloaded and the razor gangs ARE unable to see the downstream benefits of spending money on productive projects. JURY FEARS Free speech is the question THE jury system is perhaps the finest benefit of English law. It exists in Australia and other places as a result of British settlement. It should not be regarded as so frail that it might be placed at risk by the screening of a television program. That it is, by the Criminal Law Association and the president of the Queensland Bar Association is, to say the least, a somewhat disturbing curiosity. Mr Michael Quinn of the Criminal Law Association says the ABC docudrama Johs Jury is the first step towards the destruction of the jury system. Mr Bob Douglas QC of the Bar Association says it should not be screened. Not to be outdone or to be seen merely wringing its hands the State Government has threatened legal action if the program interferes with the administration of justice. It is hard to see how it could, though. The program concerns the trial of Sir Joh BjelkePetersen for perjury. That trial is long over. It ended in a hung jury and a subsequent decision by law officers not to continue action. After the trial, it was revealed that the jury foreman had a connection with the National Party. It was alleged by jurors who chose to speak out after the trial that some of the jury room proceedings were disquieting. It also sparked a Criminal Justice Commission inquiry into the jury selection process, still under way. The position of the Criminal Law Association and the Bar Association appears to be that jurors should forever forgo their right to free speech on matters they have heard. While a trial is in progress, of course jurors should be left free of impediment inside or outside the jury room and the media in general, and The CourierMail in particular, have absolutely no problem with that. A juror, however, is a juror only while empanelled. Particularly in circumstances where some doubts exist in their minds as to the conduct of a case they have heard, they should speak out. This is a free country. It is supposedly a place where free speech is an absolute right. There is no place in a democratic society for inclub decisionmaking or cosy arrangements made behind closed doors."

The Departments recruitment and selection procedures observe the principles of Equal Employment Opportunity EEO, which means that the major consideration is merit. All applicants with the necessary experience and qualifications should be given equal opportunity to be considered on the basis of merit that is, their capacity to meet the essential and desirable criteria for the position. The contact officer It is important that you provide quality information and assistance to prospective applicants. Your help will boost their perception of the Department as a potential employer. You should help callers assess the responsibilities and duties of the position, and offer any other relevant information. Once the position has been advertised, you must be available to accept enquiries. These may come from all sections of the community be receptive to those enquiries, so that corporate aims and objectives are conveyed in a fair and equitable way. The following information should be made available to each applicant see your Administrative Officer for copies bullet Handbook for job applicants bullet Structure NSW Agriculture flow chart bullet position description statement bullet Application for Employment form, for applicants who are not with the NSW Public Service bullet Details of functions, responsibilities and goals of the DivisionBranchRegion Remember You may be a callers first point of contact with this Department. Make a positive contribution to our image by being helpful and efficient when handling any enquiries. The Selection Committee A Selection Committee is a means of selecting an applicant for a vacant position. The Committee has the task of recommending the most efficient applicant to the Department Head. Selection is a serious responsibility, which affects the efficiency of the Department and the careers of individuals. So it is important that each Committee member understands the procedures and techniques involved in selection, and knows how these relate to the principles of equal opportunity in employment. See your Administrative Officer for details of courses available, etc. The Committee members The Selection Committee must comprise at least three members bullet a Convenor This person chairs the Committee. The Convenor must be from the Department, and must have completed Selection Techniques training bullet an Independent Impartial selection is enhanced by the inclusion of an independent Committee member a person from another government department State, Federal or local, or from private industry for some specialist positions. The independent should not have been an officer of this Department within the last 6 months. Generally, independent members who are not employed by a government department are not paid for their service on the Committee bullet a Departmental representative. Remember Your Committee must include bullet at least one male and one female bullet a person of relevant background, where applicable for example, ethnic background, disability etc. Eligibility Generally, Selection Committee members are at a grading or salary above that of the vacant position. This particularly applies to the Convenor and the Departmental representative. The convenor The role of the convenor is to direct the conduct and activities of the Selection Committee so it may find the most efficient applicant for the vacant position. Choosing the other members The convenor is generally responsible for choosing the other Committee members. The convenor should pick members who are experienced in a similar area as the advertised position, so they can readily recognise the necessary skills in the applicants. Preparation for interviews The convenor should bullet ensure that no member of the Committee has a close personal relationship with an applicant, as this relationship might influence that member during Committee deliberations bullet ensure that applications are correctly culled, in the manner prescribed in this booklet bullet check all printedwritten evidence of qualifications and experience bullet ensure that applicants have completed the correct application form and, in particular, ensure that applicants from outside the NSW Public Service have provided date of birth, place of birth, full name and any former names. Conduct of interviews The convenor should bullet be welcoming and encouraging to all interviewees bullet ensure that the interviews are conducted in such a way that Committee questions and comments do not suggest favour or discrimination. Types of discrimination include race, marital status, sex, age or physical impairment bullet ensure that questioning or assessment of applicants is fair. Do not ask an applicant about his or her marital status, spouse, spouses employment or salary, childrenother dependants, child care arrangements, credit status, age, home ownership, sexuality, racialethnic origins, religious beliefs or political affiliations unless any of these are expressly relevant to the job. The report The convenor should bullet complete all the clerical work associated with the Selection Committees report. This includes the provision of supporting details if a higher commencing salary is recommended bullet obtain referee reports verbal or written if the recommended applicant is from outside the NSW Public Service. Applicants from within the NSW Public Service are subject to a conduct and service report, to be undertaken by the relevant Administrative Officer. bullet ensure that any dissenting members complete and submit their reports. The Committee members All panel members should make a roughly equal contribution during the interview. All members must know how interview panels are conducted, and they must be familiar with the details of each interviewees application form. If a Committee member has a close relationship with a candidate, that member must tell the convenor. The convenor may then ask that member to withdraw from the Committee. Any member who believes the Committee is guilty of malpractice at any stage in its deliberations, may seek to have the Committee suspended. Another option is to submit a dissenting report to the person who is to approve the appointment. Malpractice may include prejudice or unfair questioning at interviews. Independent members must ensure that their views are solely based on the evidence presented by applicants. Independents must not be unfairly influenced by the opinions of the other Committee members. The cull The culling of applicants is only to be conducted by the Selection Committee. All members of the Selection Committee should participate in all stages of the selection. The members must ensure that bullet no candidate is unfairly excluded from the opportunity for an interview members must be thorough in assessing applications, never offhand. For example, they should not dismiss academic qualifications gained overseas, or communityvoluntary work that appears irrelevant to the advertised position bullet all Committee recommendations are based on the relative merits of applicants in the context of the jobs requirements that is, the essential and desirable requirements as expressed in the advertisement and the position description statement. Criteria of cull The purpose of the cull is to exclude those applicants who, on the basis of their application bullet do not satisfy the essential criteria of the advertisement bullet are ineligible for appointment for example, outside applicants for a job available only to those in the NSW Public Service, or applicants who are ineligible for permanent residency. If a further cull is needed, make a total comparative assessment of the eligible applications, based on the following criteria bullet those who do not meet the desirable criteria andor bullet those who show evidence that their qualificationsskills and experience do not compete with those of other applicants Late applications If it is decided to accept any late applications, these have equal status to all other applications. But applications received after the cull must not be considered. Caution needed Do not exclude bullet applicants with overseas qualifications, before the qualifications have been checked for local accreditation. If necessary, contact the Ethnic Affairs Commission, Overseas Qualifications Unit, telephone 02716 2222 bullet applicants whose job experience may be unusual but nevertheless relevant to the requirements of the advertised position. An example could be communityvoluntary work bullet applicants on the basis of assumptions about the physical attributes required for the job where applicants include a photo or details of their physical build. Remember Do not approach the cull as an exercise in achieving a set number of people to be interviewed. Reasons in writing The reasons for culling are to be noted on the Cull criteria evaluation form. The reasons must relate to the essential and desirable requirements of the advertised job. Putting the reasons in writing demonstrates that all applications were thoroughly considered and ensures that any enquiries from unsuccessful applicants can be answered. A bare statement such as failed to meet essential requirements is not acceptable. Selection criteria, questions and assessment The Committee must be guided by the advertisement and position description statement to determine the criteria for selecting the best applicant. The Committee should also decide on the interview questions and the specific responses sought. This includes any written test required. Remember Only the members of the Selection Committee are permitted to cull applications.Under no circumstances may anyone else take part in the cull. Preparation for the interviews Notification to interviewees The applicants selected for interview must be advised of the names and designations of panel members. The location of the interviews should be readily accessible to any applicant with a disability. Remember Applicants must be given a minimum of three days notice to attend an interview. Planning the questions Every interviewee must be told the same information about the job and asked the same questions. Devise questions that draw out relevant information about the candidates capacity to do the job. The questions should focus on the job criteria and any special requirements of the position. For example Do you foresee any difficulties in meeting job requirements such as bullet country travel bullet working overtime for stated periods bullet limits to when leave can be taken The Committee must not devise questions that are irrelevant to the job. In framing its questions, the Committee must not be influenced by assumptions or hearsay about family ties, study plans, physical endurance, etc. Conducting the interviews It is customary for the convenor to welcome each applicant at the beginning of the interview and introduce himselfherself. Other Committee members are then introduced. Begin the interviews on a subject familiar to the applicants, such as their current work responsibilities. Check that application forms are up to date regarding address, current position and salary. The convenor should cover the selection criteria in a preestablished order of importance. Each area should be thoroughly probed before moving to the next. Clarify a question or line of thought if it appears to be unclear to the applicant. If an applicant gives an obviously wrong answer, the panel might mention the correct one, especially if further questioning is intended on the topic. Do not embarrass an applicant by implying that the answer given is wrong or that the correct answer was obvious. Closing the interview When closing the interview, the convenor must give the applicant an opportunity to ask questions, or to add any relevant comments or facts that were not aired during the interview. The convenor should also tell the applicant when shehe will be told the panels decision. Also, applicants outside the NSW Public Service should be asked to provide the names and telephone numbers of two people who are familiar with the applicants skills and abilities. These referees may be contacted later. Applicants from within the NSW Public Service are subject to a conduct and service report, to be undertaken by the relevant Administrative Officer. Effective communication and notetaking An effective interview is dependent on a good understanding between an applicant and the Selection Committee. Applicants respond best to a receptive Committee and, in turn, the Committee members gain a more accurate understanding of the applicant. Interviewers should be aware how nonverbal communication can affect an interview. Eye contact, facial expressions, posture, gestures and voice level are important. The head nod, preferably while looking at the applicant, is a useful interviewing gesture which indicates interest and understanding. A system of notetaking during interviews is important, but dont be distracted by it the aim is to keep adequate notes wile maintaining effective communication with the applicant. So, confine the notetaking to memory triggers. For a better interview The convenor is responsible for bullet greeting the applicant bullet introducing the applicant to the panel bullet relaxing the applicant with a brief preambleconfirming the position the applicant is being interviewed for, and asking some familiar questions eg, correct contact address, recent work experience"

        "text": "Susan Geason AN OLD HUSBANDS TALE FOURTH GRANDDAD SLAIN the headline screamed up at Virgo Lonergan from the morning newspaper. The granddad murders had been all over the front pages for months, dominated the evening news and had the police dumbfounded. The police followed promising leads, rounded up the usual losers, doorknocked, and had even imported an American FBI psychologist to prepare a profile of the serial killer. POLICE BAFFLED thought Virgo. It was obvious they didnt have a clue who was killing off wellheeled, wellrespected retirees in Sydneys exclusive North Shore suburbs. Virgo, who was following the case avidly, had been fascinated with serial killers since shed done a diploma in criminology after her law degree at Sydney University. She could almost recite the names of Ted Bundys victims by heart, and was well versed in other famous serial murders, from John Wayne Gacey to John Wilder. Drinking the first cafe latte of the day, she skimmed the potted history of the crimes. Four senior citizens Norman Baines, sixtyeight, Roger Harris, seventytwo, Arthur Prentice, seventy, and Donald MacPherson, seventyfour had been hit from behind with a heavy object and killed in broad daylight between their homes and nearby shopping centres. Arthur Prentices dog, Ruff, had also been dispatched to the afterlife. Virgo conjured up a vision of the two pottering around heaven, with Ruff scattering angels like frightened seagulls. Another victim, Victor Herbert, seventyone, had survived the bashing, but was still in hospital, weak and confused. The police were pretending hed cough up valuable clues when he came around, but reading between the lines where all the best stories lay Virgo got the impression the doctors didnt expect him to regain his wits. The murders were all carried out on Mondays or Tuesdays, which probably meant the killer was a shift worker of some sort. The police hinted heavily that they were keeping back valuable clues, but Virgo doubted it. This looked like the most difficult sort of crime to solve it was random, the victims didnt know each other, and there were no witnesses. Unless hes caught in the act, the only way theyll catch this one is if he boasts to someone or kills himself and leaves a confession note, Virgo mused. In the famous fit of remorse. But she wasnt being paid to ponder juicy murders, so she spilled her intray on to the desk and sat looking at it without enthusiasm. Virgo Lonergan had started life as Virginia. After seventeen years of being asked if Santa Claus existed, and five of smutty puns, she decided she might as well go the whole hog. Anyway, her birth date was on the LeoVirgo cusp, so it seemed appropriate. Two years with a city law firm had immunised her against naked ambition and a stint at Legal Aid had dimmed the stars in her eyes. When she realised shed heard every recidivists hard luck story three times, she decided to leave the criminal classes to the tender mercies of all the other middle class dogooders. After some R R in the Maldives, shed returned to Sydney, acquired a private investigators licence and put up her shingle. Now she spent her working hours in a tiny, minimally furnished office at Crows Nest, on Sydneys lower North Shore. So far she was surviving on a mixture of legal work for old clients and friends, insurance surveillance work, and the odd character check for companies. Very occasionally someone walked in off the street and asked her to spy on an errant spouse. This was dull and demeaning, but no worse than real estate conveyancing, she rationalised. Today was dedicated to paper work her Leo badly wanted to throw the intray out the window, but her Virgo worked its way doggedly through the bumf. The accounts were instantly forgotten when that endangered species, a live customer, rang the doorbell. The client turned out to be a typical North Shore matron about forty, wellgroomed and dressed in an expensive duncoloured skirt, blouse and blazer the kind of woman who mistook dullness for good taste. And who thought sex was something you did in bed on Friday nights for the first three years of your marriage, thought Virgo, uncharitably. The womans eyes popped slightly at the sight of Virgo. One hundred and seventyeight centimetres and slim, Virgo had blueblack hair sweeping back dramatically from a widows peak, navy blue eyes and skin the colour of skim milk. Today she was wearing a yellow linen miniskirt and jacket with a black bustier and black shoes which put her over one hundred and eighty centimetres. It was like a chance meeting of a sparrow and a cockatoo. Nyree MacPhersons immediate impulse was to bolt, but shed been taught at school to be polite and to finish what she started. Virgos schooling had taught her to suss out the openings, grab the ball and run. This she did here was a client, a warm body. It might even be interesting. She slipped between the hesitant woman and the door faster than an Argentinian goalie, ushered her into a seat and offered a cup of coffee from a pot that perked all day. Her escape route cut off, and needing something to do with her hands, the woman accepted the coffee. Virgo chatted amiably, dropping enough social and cultural references to put Nyree MacPherson at ease. When a relaxation in her victims shoulders signalled defeat, she began to question her gently. It seemed Nyree MacPhersons father was one of the murdered granddads, and she felt the police were not doing enough to find the killer. Enthralled as she was by the prospect of poking around in a mass murder, Virgo had to be honest Mrs MacPherson, the police have been all over this case like hives. If they cant get a handle on it, I dont see how I could. Theres no way I could get access to the evidence, for a start. The woman paused, hesitating on the brink of a disclosure she might live to regret Im not absolutely certain he was killed by any mass murderer, Miss Lonergan. She could be right, of course, thought Virgo. Copycat crimes were common in cases like this someone seizing the chance to off gramps and blame it on the ghoul. What makes you think that, Mrs MacPherson The woman became so distressed Virgo thought she might faint. Dying of curiosity, she murmured Everything you say within these walls is absolutely confidential. Finally the woman pulled herself together and blurted it out I have reason to believe my stepmother might have had a hand in his death. Appalled by the enormity of the charge, she lapsed into a handkerchiefshredding silence. What makes you think that probed Virgo They were married after my mother died about ten years ago. Phyllis married him for his money, Im certain of it. I didnt like her from the start, but dad seemed happy. Until he retired, at least. Then she was always complaining about him being around the house. I mean, where did she expect him to go The womans voice had risen, angry all over again at the injustice I dont think poor old dad realised what a harridan hed married until it was too late. They did nothing but squabble in the last two years. Virgo was disappointed just the ugly stepmother syndrome. Mrs MacPherson, lots of married couples go through a shakedown when the husband retires, but it doesnt usually result in murder. The woman sighed I knew you wouldnt believe me. The police acted as if I were just some menopausal housewife with too much time on my hands. Im sorry I bothered you. She began to rise. Wait a minute, said Virgo, galvanised by the threat of losing a client. Im not saying I wont take the case, but youve got to be prepared for the likelihood that I wont come up with anything. I mean, you obviously dont like your stepmother dotted line Shes a brittle, conniving, golddigging dotted line bitch said the woman and stopped, aghast at her lapse of taste. Virgo, who hadnt relished working for such a cold fish, warmed to her client a little. Let me look into the details of the murders first, then Ill get back to you and well talk more about your fathers case. Is that OK Nyree MacPherson smiled for the first time, and nodded. Virgo drew up a contract, the client signed and wrote a cheque for a retainer, and the women parted. Time to activate the networks, thought Virgo, dialling Kyrie Kateriniss number. All hell had broken loose in the Katerinis household when daughter Kyrie had announced she didnt want to be a doctor like her parents and her brother. When shed obtained a cadetship on a newspaper after her BA, her father had suffered a mild heart attack, and when shed taken up crime as a specialty, hed disowned her. Virgo and Kyrie shared an upbringing on the northern beaches, a high school education at North Sydney Girls High, and a fascination with human nature, particularly of the deviant variety. Kyrie was middle height, with dark yellow, very curly hair which she wore short, topaz eyes and a strong Greek nose. She wasnt interested in clothes, and almost always wore vampires wedding black and Doc Martens. Virgo had given up nagging her about her appearance long ago. If you were in Greece, youd bloody well refuse to wear black, woman, shed said once, but Kyrie had her own agenda. It had more to do with winning journalism awards than hearts. Kyrie was happy to share her material on the granddad killer with Virgo, but warned her against getting her hopes up. If you ask me, hes got clean away, she said from behind her desk in the Broadway newspaper office. Im a bit disappointed, actually. I was hoping hed move to Newport and get dad off my back. Virgo laughed, then got down to business Is it definitely a he The police arent even sure about that. The victims were old, and they were jumped from behind and brained with a pipe or something like that, so it could have been a woman. Do you really think it was random Virgo asked. Are you sure theres no connection between the victims Kyrie showed Virgo a chart shed make As you can see, theyre private school educated Knox, Scots, Shore, another Knox, and the old boy who survived went to school across the bridge at Grammar. Schools were very important on the North Shore. Virgo and Kyrie had attended the sort of selective public school favoured by the ambitious working class and leftleaning parents who wanted the best but were ideologically opposed to private education. Where do you suppose Ruff went to school asked Virgo. Oh, probably the North Shore Canine Academy. Anything else connecting the old boys quizzed Virgo. They all had plenty of money all were retired all married all living in the MosmanCremorne area. I checked and found out two of them used the same dentist and another two had the same doctor. No two of them belonged to the same club. They all had children and grandchildren. In a word, zilch. What about Donald MacPherson Was there anything different about his death Not that I can see. Why does his daughter think the wife did it Says shes a golddigger. Kyrie snorted Thats hardly a motive, otherwise wed have to build a new womens prison in Sydney. Look, K, Im going to need to talk to Nyree MacPherson, and maybe some of the other victims wives, do you mind dotted line Kyrie threw up her hands Hey I dont care what you do, mate. Just dont tell me about it, OK Next day, posing as Kyrie Katerinis, Virgo set out on her first assignment, an interview with Phyllis MacPherson. Shed dressed down slightly and wore flat heels, remembering the horrified look Nyree MacPherson had given her yellow ensemble."

        "text": "Fifteen Thick blackness blanketed them, closing them in. There was a seconds absolute silence, then an eruption of sound from the sitting room a confused babbling and wailing, and a couple of ominous thuds. Birdie instinctively stretched out her arms and stepped forward, her fingers tangling in the heavy folds of the curtains, her elbow bumping something solid that grunted and swore. Take it easy Edwinas voice was gruff but gloriously familiar in the enveloping dark. Sorry. What the hells dotted line Id say the powerlines have come down. A falling tree, probably. Not surprising in this weather. Birdie heard a rustling sound as Edwina calmly felt her way to the window seat and sat down. She was a cool customer. The door across the hall clicked open. Edwina Verity Alistairs voice echoed across the vast space. Are you OK Yes they chorused plaintively in unison, and laughed. Stay there, he called unnecessarily. Ill go out and start the generator. Wont be long. Hold on, Betty Hinders reedy voice carried as well as Alistairs shout. Im coming with you. There was a scrape and a bump. Betty, stay where you are Dont be more of a fool than you can help You cant go wandering around out there in the pitch black by yourself. What if you fall over and break a leg What if the ting doesnt start Then were all in a fine mess. Ill go out and get William, then. Alistair was weakening. Birdie grinned to herself in the darkness. Bettys snort was eloquent. By now shed obviously reached him. Hed be as much use as a pocket in a singlet. Here, hold on to me. I can find my way round this place blindfolded. And as for generators dotted line well, since Georgd rather sit in the dark twiddling his thumbs any day than get his feet wet, I can handle them too. Now, lets go. Alistair gave in. All right, now, everyone just sit tight. Itll be ten minutes or so. No Another voice rose through the blackness, high and whimpering.I cant stay here Ive got to get out Stop it Let me dotted line There was a scuffling sound, and a clatter as something hit the floor. The voice squeaked in panic. Belinda thundered Alistair. Sit down Have another biscuit Josie the candles on the sideboard OK Go on, Alistair. Well be right called Josie. She sounded quite cheerful. Famous last words, grunted Birdie. She felt cautiously around, located the window seat somewhere down near her knees, and lowered herself gingerly onto it, beside Edwina who hastily moved along to accommodate her. They perched together uncomfortably for a moment. The darkness was complete, in the room and outside the window. The valley walls rose up, enclosing them. No light, not the faintest glow in the sky, relieved the blackness. Birdie hadnt been aware of the hum of the airconditioning, but now that it had died its absence created an eerie sense of absolute stillness in the house. Outside, the rushing water of the swollen creek, the splashing of the rain on the rippling ground, were the only sounds. She held her hand in front of her face and squinted, trying to make out its shape. But the darkness was total. It was like being blind. With a shock, she remembered Dan Toby. He hadnt called. Why not And now he couldnt call. The internal phones needed electricity to work. Involuntarily she caught her breath. Theres nothing to worry about, said Edwina beside her. Birdie shook her head, realised her companion couldnt see her, and spoke aloud. Its not the dark. Its Toby and Milson. I think I should go up there. Try to take them a light. The proper lightsll be back on in ten minutes, said Edwina reasonably. Theyre big boys, arent they They can look after themselves. Of course. Why then did Birdie feel this sense of foreboding The picture of Toby, waving so cockily at her from the head of the stairs kept coming into her mind. And it was dark, so dark that she could see nothing else. She pushed herself to her feet and felt for the desk. Maybe dotted line What are you doing Edwinas voice was amused. If there are cigarettes, said Birdie, there might be a lighter. If there are cigarettes, Edwina replied, please give me one and pray theres a lighter. Birdie felt around the polished surface, trying to remember what had been on it when shed been in the room last. Her fingers brushed paper the timetable and a small pile of cardboard the guests files nearly upset a vase of flowers dotted line yes, thered been an ashtray and an enamelled box near the vase. Her hand brushed a corner. That was it She grasped at the box and opened the lid. Cigarettes dotted line and tucked into one corner, a small, slim lighter. She flicked it, and the tiny flame appeared, bright in the darkness. Edwina exclaimed and stumbled over to join her. They both lit cigarettes. Ive given up, Edwina remarked seriously, after a moment. She exhaled a plume of smoke, and watched it dissolve into the darkness with satisfaction. So have I, said Birdie. She took one last, long drag, sighed, and stubbed the cigarette out. Poison, she said. Edwina murmured muffled agreement. Birdie flicked the lighter again, and dimly the rooms shapes appeared. The doorway was directly in front of her. Im going upstairs, she announced. I think theres something wrong. Youre crazy. With that pathetic little light youll break your neck. Im going. You stay where you are. Not bloody likely. Edwina leaned over, felt for the ashtray and crushed her cigarette into it. If you go, I go. Im not sitting here twiddling my thumbs in the dark. There are limits. They edged cautiously towards the doorway and out into the hall. Flickering light from the sitting room cast a dull glow on the marble tiles. More than enough to see by, now that their eyes had adjusted to the dark. But the stairway rose in front of them, disappearing into pitch black about halfway up. They moved silently, by unspoken agreement. Neither wanted Josie and Belindas company. They reached the stairs and began to climb, one behind the other. Soon they were in darkness. They moved stair by stair, feeling their way, holding tightly to the banister, as if to a lifeline. The silence and the dark were think around them This is madness, whispered Edwina. She was so close that Birdie could feel her breath on the back of her neck. Birdie flicked the lighter and held its tiny flame out in front of her till it got too hot to hold, straining her eyes to see. Were nearly there, she said. Four or five more steps. Her heart was beating hard, somewhere up near the top of her chest. It was as if she could feel it in the base of her throat. She felt like choking. Something was wrong, she could feel it. The blackness at the top of the stairs was infinitely menacing. But she dragged her feet on over the thick carpet, grateful for the sound and warmth of Edwina behind her. She almost stumbled when she reached the top, though shed been waiting for the moment when her raised foot met empty air. She heard Edwinas exclamation as she faltered. Its all right. Were at the top, she murmured, edging around the balustrade to give her companion room. They looked down at the vestibule below. From here they could see the faint glow from the sitting room. Well edge around the gallery, facing this way, whispered Birdie. So well be able to see the light from Josies candles. The thought cheered her. Oh Edwina grabbed her arm. Ive just remembered. I think theres a candle on a table just here. You know, by the couch A candle in a silver candlestick. I saw it yesterday. Yes Birdie flicked the lighter and they edged away from the safety of the balustrade, holding onto each other, free hands outstretched, bodies tensed against unexpected bumps. Birdie found the side chair and sank into it while Edwina stood clutching the arm. She reached across to the corner table. Here shed found the pink envelope, the anonymous letter. It seemed weeks ago. The lighter cast a tiny pool of light on the polished wood, and at the back of the table a silver candlestick gleamed. Birdie grabbed it with a hiss of satisfaction. It was heavy. She pulled it towards her and lit the candle. The wick caught, and a big, yellow flame rose up, pushing away the darkness, lighting up the little sitting area, the stainedglass window in shades of grey, the door to the staff stairway. Ah Thats better Edwina gave a long sigh. Birdie looked up at her and grinned. Lucky you remembered it, she said. Lets go. They walked slowly along the gallery, towards Eve. No need now to feel their way, or turn to the secondhand light from the vestibule for reassurance. With the candlelight, Birdies panic had eased. Now she wondered what Toby would say when he saw her with Edwina in tow, too. Ten to one shed just get to him and the lights would go on. Damn She should have waited, like Edwina said. But she knew she couldnt have waited. It was very quiet, except for the rain pattering on the roof above them. They reached the corner of the gallery. Helens door was ahead. Birdies arm was aching with the weight of the candlestick. She lowered it slightly as they reached the door marked Eve. There was no sound from inside. She glanced at Edwina, standing tall by her shoulder, lifted her free hand, and knocked. The door swing open under her hand. Inside it was black as pitch, and in the blackness, someone was breathing. Dan Birdie thrust the candlestick high in the air before her. The flame blew back, faltered, recovered and flared up once more. Edwina gripped her arm. Dan Are you in there Nothing. Just breathing, hoarse and deep, in the dark. Birdie pushed the door wide and stepped forward. No, Verity Edwina was trying to hold her back, but Birdie pulled away, holding up the light. Toby lay sprawled on the couch like a bulky bundle of old clothes. His arm was thrown over his face, as if to protect it. Birdie crept towards him. The candlelight threw shadows around the room, picked out something white lying on the floor beside the desk. Milsons shirt. Milson, lying crumpled, long legs sticking out under the desk chair. Verity Edwinas voice penetrated the paralysed silence of her mind. Edwinas urgent hand plucked at her sleeve. She made herself turn around. Helen was sitting on the side of the bed. Very upright, very still, her hands in her lap. As they looked, she turned her head. Her eyes gleamed. Theyre asleep, she said softly. Just asleep. Birdies scalp prickled. She backed away till she reached the couch. She held the candlestick high, like a weapon. She felt for Toby with her left hand. He was warm. Breathing. Breathing heavily. It was Tobys breathing she had heard from the door. She pushed at him, shook him, but he wouldnt wake. Wouldnt stir. Hes been drugged, she said. Her voice sounded loud in her own head. Birdie saw the tray on the low table by the couch, its silver coffeepot winking in the candlelight. She saw one cup still on the tray, unused, one still a quarter full on the table where Toby had put it down. Where was the other Of course. On the desk, where Milson had been taking notes. She could see it now. She skirted the coffee table and sidled over to the desk, without taking her eyes off Helen. Crouching down, she touched Milsons cheek, felt for the pulse of his neck. She could hear him breathing too, now."

        "text": "Overview of Hydrologic and Water Quality Modelling I.D.Moore and J.C.Gallant Centre for Resource and Environmental Studies, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT This paper describes hydrological and water quality models, why they are needed and the different ways of classifying them. The concepts of model calibration, validation and verification are discussed and the likely predictive accuracy of water quality models is outlined. In general, water quality models have relatively poor predictive accuracy in an absolute sense, but perform quite well in a relative sense. The historical development of scientific hydrology and water quality modelling is presented. In the future, there will be an increasing linkage of remote sensing and geographic information systems with water quality models. This will rely heavily on sophisticated computer graphics and other technologies to display and interpret model results and outputs. A major need is the development of stochastic or combined stochasticdeterministic water quality models to deal more readily with spatially variable input parameters and provide results in terms of probabilities. INTRODUCTION Hydrology is part art and part science. The art is in being able to make the appropriate simplifying assumptions to allow physics principles the science to be applied to the solution of complex processes. The real world is simplified in all hydrologic and water quality models and so it is important that potential users are aware of these simplifications and approximations and that the right model is used in the right way. In a discussion of research directions in hydrology, Burges 1986 quoted Artemus Ward as saying that it aint so much the things we dont know that gets us in trouble. Its the things we know that aint so. For example, some hydrologic models assume that Hortonian overland flow, where rainfall excess is generated by a soils limiting infiltration capacity, is the dominant runoff generating mechanism. Others assume that the saturation overland flow mechanism, produced when rising water tables intersect the soil surface, dominates. The former mechanism is common in agricultural and semiarid regions, while the latter is common in forested catchments. There are many instances where the wrong runoff production mechanism has been applied, even though we can now mathematically describe both mechanisms quite well. Applying the wrong runoff producing mechanism may still allow the total catchment runoff to be predicted quite well, but it is probable that spatially distributed runoff rates and amounts and water quality processes will be predicted quite poorly. This highlights a dilemma in hydrology. There is a perception that the predictive performances of hydrologic models have not substantially improved in the last twenty years, even though there have been major advances in the understanding of hydrologic processes in that time. Most assessments of hydrologic model performance are based on comparisons of observed and predicted runoff at the catchment outlet. Even a simple blackbox or inputoutput model may perform quite well in such circumstances. Distributed measurements of runoff, flow depth and flow velocities are needed to validate the new generation of hydrologic and water quality models. These types of data are not commonly available, and are very costly to obtain. This paper has two main objectives 1 to describe the various classes of models that have been applied to hydrologic and water quality prediction and the advantages, limitations and problems with each approach and 2 to provide an historical context for discussing hydrologic and water quality modelling and the state of the art of chemical fate modelling at this workshop. CHARACTERISTICS OF HYDROLOGIC AND WATER QUALITY MODELS What is a Mathematical Model The American Society for Testing and Materials 1984 defined a mathematical model as an assembly of concepts in the form of a mathematical equation that portrays understanding of a natural phenomena. The following are alternative definitions of mathematical models that can be found in the hydrology literature. A simplified construction of the real world that seeks to explain and predict events Pierce, 1961. The symbolic form in which a physical principle is expressed, an equation or formula, built by consideration of the pertinent physical principles, operated on by logic, and modified by experimental judgement and plain intuition not simply chosen Snyder and Stall, 1965. A simplified representation of a complex system in which the behaviour of the system is represented by a set of equations, perhaps together with logical statements, expressing relations between variables and parameters Clarke, 1973. A symbolic representation of an idealised situation that has the important physical properties of the real system Woolhiser and Brakensiek, 1982. All these definitions encompass the idea that a mathematical model integrates existing knowledge into a logical framework of rules and relationships. Hence, it is simply one method of formalising knowledge about how a system behaves. Mathematical models range from simple empirical relationships such as linear regression equations to sets of complex partial differential equations derived from fundamental physics. The factors that are included in an equation and the relationships between them involve simplifying assumptions concerning the relevant physical processes. Because hydrologic systems and water chemistry are so complete, it is impossible to represent most of them exactly using the exact laws of physics. It is important to know what simplifying assumptions are appropriate, and therefore, what methods of analysis or models are appropriate for the problem at hand. Furthermore, for a good mathematical model it is not enough to work well. It must work well for the right reasons. It must reflect, even if only in a simplified form, the essential features of the physical prototype Klemes, 1986. Why Develop Mathematical Models In addition to the reasons for developing hydrologic and water quality models identified above, models can assist in identifying critical gaps in fundamental knowledge and in planning experimental programs. Field water quality monitoring programs and their associated laboratory analyses are extremely expensive. For example, the cost of a comprehensive chemical analysis of one water sample can exceed Hence water quality models can maximise the effectiveness of experimental programs and ensure that the right kinds of data are collected. Models can also help set priorities, giving broader and longer term perspectives, and are important tools for developing and evaluating economically viable ways of minimising surface and ground water pollution. Water quality models are being commonly used to assist in providing advice on conservation practices, land treatment and farming practices, including chemical management Meyer, 1990. Land systems have highly diverse climate, topography, soil and crops and are subject to many different management systems. A wide range of chemicals have potential use in these production systems. It is not feasible economically for agencies responsible for approving and registering the use of these chemicals to run field trials of each chemical under all possible conditions. Water quality models provide a powerful tool for evaluating the likely behaviour and fate of chemicals in these differing environments on the basis of chemical characteristics such as solubilities, degradation rates, etc. supplied by manufacturers and known or typical climate, topography, soil, crop and management. Hence models can provide a costeffective extrapolation function. Meyer 1990 believes that the ultimate utility of a model is determined by its ability to conform to known or accepted scientific facts, its flexibility to accommodate new data and knowledge, and the fact that solutions identified by the model must be confirmed by experiment. From his background in an application oriented agency, Meyer stressed that models should never become an end in themselves. Model Classification There are four principal ways of classifying hydrologic and water quality models 1 deterministic or stochastic 2 mechanistic or functional 3 lumped or distributed and 4 research or management Woolhiser and Brakensiek, 1982 Donigian and Rao, 1986 Vachaud et al., 1990. With a deterministic model a given input condition or event will produce a unique outcome, whereas with a stochastic model the outcome will have a random component. Most chemical fate models are deterministic Donigian and Rao, 1968. In recent years there have been attempts to combine the two approaches to better reflect the uncertainty associated with estimating model parameters and the high degree of spatial variability that occurs in many hydrologic and water quality processes that can not be adequately captured by a completely deterministic model. Stochastic models that present model predictions in a probabilistic form may be particularly attractive for use by regulatory agencies. Deterministic models are often used in water resource assessment to provide quantitative information on the magnitude, quality, distribution and timing of available water and extend this knowledge by using the model to predict water effects, both direct and indirect, of mans influence on this existing water resource. Generally, deterministic models are used in two ways 1 assessment of the existing state of the water resource for the prevailing hydrological response of the catchment, based on historical meteorological and hydrological records and 2 prediction of future conditions or behaviour in response to such influences as urbanisation, intensification in agriculture and forestry land use, climate change, or any physical alteration of the land surface due to natural or man induced causes. Mechanistic models attempt to account for most fundamental mechanisms of the hydrologic and chemical processes involved. Many of the mechanistic models being discussed at this workshop can be classed as linkedprocess models that consist of a series of mechanistic process descriptions that are linked sequentially or in parallel to describe the behaviour of the total system. Beven 1989 discusses the strengths and limitation of these models in considerable detail. It is not possible to include within a single model descriptions of all possible processes that might occur because of the complexity of the natural system, computational constraints, and incomplete knowledge of many processes. Therefore, it is not possible to develop a truly general mechanistic model that is applicable in all environments. It is because of this that much confusion has arisen in the use of mechanistic models. Potential users of such models must be aware of the limitations and the constraints under which particular mechanistic models can and should be used. Functional models incorporate simplified treatments of an individual process or groups of processes using some form of transfer function and make no attempt to physically describe the individual processes. The well know unit hydrograph method is an example of a transfer function approach for predicting catchment runoff directly from rainfall. Many chemical processes, and particularly pesticide transformation processes, are simulated using this functional approach. Rigorous descriptions of many physiochemical pesticide processes are not possible and success in simulating pesticide runoff is affected by the ability to cope with the diverse chemistry of pesticides Leavesley et al., 1990. Distributed models attempt to represent the spatial variability of hydrologic and water quality characteristics and processes across a catchment, whereas lumped models spatially aggregate these processes. The main concern in using lumped models is that it is probably not possible to obtain a single value of a spatially variable parameter that allows a model to predict the mean response of the modelled area. Addiscott and Wagenet 1985 warn that, when applying leaching models without accounting for parameter variations in the horizontal plane, gross overor underestimates of solute and water movement may result from ignoring these variations, and observe that dotted line although the mechanistic numerical models have a solid theoretical base and have been the most widely used of all soilwatersolute models, their predictions can be misleading unless their inputs are well characterised in terms of variability. It is not yet established that they give more reliable or more accurate simulations of water and solute movement than the simpler, lessmechanistic functional models dotted line The traditional method of handling spatial variability in water quality models is to divide a catchment into subcatchments, each of which is treated as being internally uniform. This simply reduces the scale at which lumping occurs. In recent years models such as AGNPS Young et al., 1989, SHE Abbott et al., 1986 and ANSWERS Beasley and Huggins, 1982 have been developed based on a cellular structure in an attempt to represent smaller scale variations in catchment characteristics. As the scale at which catchment subdivision is carried out decreases, the data needs of the models increase. Recent advances in remote sensing, digital terrain analysis and geographic information systems have great potential for overcoming the data acquisition problems associated with the use of fine resolution distributed models. However, much work remains to fully integrate these technologies into distributed hydrologic and water quality models. These types of models still have fundamental problems related to the lack of a theory of subgrid scale integration, practical constraints on solution methodologies, and problems of dimensionality in parameter calibration Beven, 1989. Many hydrologic and water quality models should only be classified as research models because they have never been fully developed orsimplified so that they can be used as management tools by action agencies, extension personnel or individual farmers. Research models are developed to better understand the physical processes and how they interact, test hypotheses as to how systems work, or for determining appropriate simplifying assumptions as a first step towards development of management models. A large amoun of effort is required to transromrm a research model into a userfriendly model that can be effectively used by action agencies."

All nations must adhere to this earth charter. The content of the Earth Charter should build an Agenda 21, the major document produced at the 1992 Earth Summit, as well as the original Earth Charter drafted by nongovernment organisations rejected in the preliminary stages of the Earth Summit. More importantly, it should contain strategies which address the shortcomings of previous documents, including the development of specific and quantitative timetables for unreadable the implementation of recommendations and the development of an internationally coordinated mechanism for ensuring that the statement of the Earth Charter are adhered to by all nations. The New Charter should retain the categories addressed by the Rio Declaration the issues discussed under sections on the role of major groups, means of implementing environmental programs, the economic and social dimensions of environmental protection and development, and the conservation management of resources for development. In addition, the new Earth Charter should be broadened to include questioning current models of development for which the previous Earth Summit advocated managing resources to sustain. A range of alternative models should be presented for discussion, including alternative technologies. The current barriers to environmental protection should be clearly outlined. This should include clear statements on the environmental impact of current world politics and economics. How these systems affect all nations and people should be documented e.g. the effect of trade, unreadable and access to resources on the environmental activities of third world countries. It should be made clear which nations and people control financial resources and international economies and how this control affects the environmental directions adopted by other less powerful countries. The Rio Declaration dealt with sustainable development in terms of developing nations but ignored the absence of sustainable development in developed countries. It is important that developed countries be seen as part of the problem on a greater scale due to their greater resources than countries with less resources. For any suggestions to lead to implementation, the new Charter needs to discuss systems for a more equitable distribution of wealth between and within nations, and less private control of resources which can be used to preserve the global future. It should adopt a unreadableplan for global sustainable development unreadable and discuss the need for its implementation regardless of its impact of on trade and profits factor which could be minimised if the program was globally implemented. Sustainable development should include an integration of economic and environmental needs but not in terms of the environment being managed to serve economic needs recognition that environmental assets need to be given a true value in terms of their contribution to the biosphere, not to economics acknowledge that environmental resources do not exist for the use of one generation and only those groups with the ability to utilize them, but should unreadable be preserved for intrinsic reasons recognize recognition that current knowledge of the environment is limited and that we are not capable of accurately assessing the risk human activities place on the environment proof of this risk should not be needed before preventative actions are taken and finally that all environmental programs must be implemented globally and the facilities distributed by all nations accordingly so that this can be achieved. The new charter should unreadable not only advocate the need for unreadable international financial cooperation for environmental goals and the exploration and implementation of more sustainable modes of development, but should address the urgent need for an internationally powerful regulatory body which could work towards ensuring all countries move towards better environmental practices and adhere to Earth Charter guidelines. This body should have the ability to regulate not only environment behaviour, but also the supply and distribution of funds to allow countries to meet goals set. While none of these suggestions will produce results immediately, the first step to any solution is defining the problem and having this definition accepted and understood by all parties. As the original Earth Summit showed, the groundwork for further progress may be all that can be achieved in the immediate future, but without this being defined, no further progress will be made. The first item which I would like to raise in this PREPCOM is to address the nature of the Charter itself, before its unreadable contents are discussed. One of UNCEDs most visible shortcomings was its failure to agree on any legally binding conventions. If this Earth Charter is to be an advance on the Rio Declaration, we must first take steps to ensure that nations are more than merely morally bound to it. We must also address in this Charter the complex forces that have created the crises we face as well as working towards their improvement. I am sure that all other representatives here are aware of the need to reduce our reliance upon fossil fuels and to lessen the rate of global deforestation which are in part responsible for the environmental problems we face. However, we are slower to accept the reasons why these destructive forces have been created. These forces are a response to a global economic system that condemns humanity to seek survival and success through exploitation of our materials. An inequality exists between states in terms of trade that forces poorer nations to follow an environmentally damaging course if they are to survive. Poorer nations are hampered by a large foreign debt that they are obliged to repay and the only means they have to repay this debt is to exploit their natural resources. For the environmental damage this entails to stop, the debt crisis that afflicts the Third World must be addressed. Within states too, a cycle of poverty creates environmental problems. The link between population growth and environmental destruction is well understood but how can we reasonably expect poor people to reduce the size of their family when it is the labour a large family provides that maintains their survival The Rio Declaration was correctly criticised for being nothing more than a general statement of principles. If we are to avoid the same criticism from future generations for failing to act, we must make this proposed Earth Charter a toothed tiger. Its principles must be legally binding and we must debate possible ways of enforcing them. We must also address the larger issues responsible for our environmental crises, not just the crises themselves. By acknowledging the economic roots to these crises and finding ways to address them, we will be better placed to confront these crises. These crises will affect both rich and poor nations, so all must combine to accept appropriate responsibility and address the causes, not just the problems. Below is an outline of the content that I would like to see in the Earth Charter to be debated at the 50th Anniversary session of the United Nations in asterisk That the commission on sustainable development CSD should play a greater role in establishing broad guidelines for sustainable development in individual countries work in cooperation with the Global Monetary Fund unreadable and government to help ensure that sustainable development is achieved. asterisk unreadable Nations acknowledging that there is a clear link between population numbers and environmental degradation. And that those extremely populous countries would take steps to educate their people on family planning the availability of contraceptives and the consequences of continued high population growth. Wealthier nations could assist in this education process by donating aids of contraceptives, and the like. asterisk In provisions regarding pollution, deforestation and the like, clear timetables statistical commitments would be required by all signatories. asterisk A clear cost of implementing each provision would be made, for which the wealthier signatures of which would be required to pay for, once committing themselves being legally and morally bound to meet their commitments. asterisk Greater recognition of the indebted problems of third world debt, world trading patterns and financing enviromentall initiatives. For example ensuring that aid packages by wealthier nations are not just loans or other means of exploiting less developed countries further. The GMF could be responsible for ensuring that such deals are reduced. asterisk Greater committment of technology transfer by wealthier nations multinational companies whilst a body an existing U.N. body should be used to monitor ensure that such technology is going to be of benefit to the recipient country, considering their culture climate etc. asterisk Commitment to ensure that cultures of individual countries are to be maintained, if they are not in direct conflict with the environment. asterisk Greater input for NGOs, the representation of major Multinational Companies that have vested interests in many 3rd World countries a greater committment by them to assist in all aid packages, technology transfers etc. asterisk Aim to ensure that capacity building takes place in all provisions. asterisk Earth Charter should also be specific in its principles and aims. asterisk Greater committment from nations for management of resources, that have important world resources eg BrazilAmazon, wealthier countries to give aid etc. for lost income. asterisk Government to subsidise companies to find develop more environmentally friendly products. Regardless of the hesitation of nations and economies to impliment any changes to their activities, particullarly less profitmotived changes I would like to see an Earth Charter, to which all nations are legally and morally bound, set up something as follows It must recognise humanity as part of, not above the environment, with all of its, cultural, political, ecconomic and religeous factors taken into account, somehow consolidating the worlds peoples and cultures and dertermining rights for all people, regardless of nationality or religeon, or race."

        "text": "51 Rickard Rd Warrimoo NSW 2774 Australian Consumers Association 57 Carrington Rd Marrickville NSW 2204 13th June 1994 To whom it may concern, I am writing to you to let you know of a problem I am having in resolving a fault with my 1992 Mitsubishi Magna. I purchased the car second hand from Penrith Mitsubishis Kingswood branch in January this year for 26,000, but noticed hesitation and misfire problems. I advised Penrith Mitsubishi who said it would be rectified under warranty. The accompanying documentation details the ongoing problems I am having in getting satisfactory action to resolve the complaint. Basically Penrith Mitsubishi have stated that there is a known fault with both the TP and TR models, and that they can do no more for me. They say it is a problem which Mitsubishi Australia will have to fix, if and when they can find a solution. I have been given a litany of excuses for the inaction by the area manager to contact Penrith Mitsubishi, and when I advised Penrith Mitsubishi of my decision to escalate the problem by writing to NRMA, ACA and Mitsubishi head office once again, I was told that was probably the best thing I could do. I have not spelled out the complete story in this letter to you, as the accompanying documents do that. If you could find the time to read through this and advise me what action is possible I would be most appreciative. I will send a copy of this letter to the Department of Consumer Affairs also, as I do not know what courses of action are available for me to follow. Thank you for any help you might be able to give. Yours faithfully Terry Wahlen 51 Rickard Rd Warrimoo 2774 Ph 047536190 Steve Miller Penrith Mitsubishi Great Western Highway Kingswood 2747 28th February, 1994 Steve, Thank you for your recent letter asking about the car. It is comforting to note that you and Penrith Mitsubishi regard aftersales support to be a high priority in the purchase of a car. As I discussed with you when I came in to get the petrol cap release fixed, there are a couple of things which need attention. These are The radio antenna has been bent and restraightened and is therefore loose The air vent control does not move to its full extent, thereby limiting the amount of external air that can enter the car The chip on the windscreen was, I thought, to be looked at before I picked the car up. The chip is still there, and I would like it repaired if its not too late There is some hesitation when slowly accelerating through 90100kph along the freeway and I have felt it at other speeds too. One other thing, the car has a parcel shelf mounted stop light. The bulb was blown when I purchased the car, but I only discovered it on the evening I bought the car when a work colleague pointed it out in the car park here at work. I bought a new bulb the next day from Penrith Mitsubishi spares, at a cost of I understand this is a warrantable item and would appreciate it if you could arrange reimbursement I still have the receipt. The car will be due for its 50,000km service soon, so I would like to arrange for the abovementioned items to be fixed under warranty when I drop it in to Penrith Mitsubishi. Could we arrange that the service section is made aware that some warranty items will need fixing obviously Ill need to let them know when Ill be getting the service done. Please dont feel I am complaining in any way about the car, it really is a pleasure to drive, and a step up in the luxury department. I am very happy with it to date. Id just like you to be aware that there a couple of things that will need attention. Please feel free to contact me if I can expand on any of the points raised in this fax. Once again, thanks for your assistance. Oh, you forgot to include the business cards with your letter. Ill be happy to distribute them if you send me some. Best Regards Terry Wahlen 51 Rickard Rd Warrimoo 2774 NSW Customer Relations Manager Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd 4 Cavill Avenue Ashfield 2131 NSW To Whom It May Concern, I am writing to notify you of a fault condition that exists in my 1992 Magna SE Sedan. I purchased the car second hand from Penrith Mitsubishi at Kingswood in January this year with 46,220 km on the odometer. Shortly after taking delivery I became aware of a problem with acceleration when driving along the motorway. It appeared that the car was reluctant to accelerate from around 8090kph when the accelerator was depressed smoothly, the car hesitating before and then during the period of acceleration. I have also had similar problems when driving uphill at 60kph. The effect is similar to a misfiring engine. I notified the salesman, Mr Steve Miller, that I would wait until the car had 50,000km on the clock before taking the car for its service, and then have the problem rectified, as I considered it may be due to dirty injectors or filters. There were also a couple of other minor problems which I would get fixed at the same time under warranty. On March 29 I took the car down to Penrith Mitsubishi for its 50,000km service and advised Mr Richard Davidson of the acceleration problem. The car was serviced document number MICS30070 and the air filter was changed in an attempt to fix the problem. It didnt. I made arrangements to have the car looked at again and took it to Penrith Mitsubishi again on the 11th April. The document number was MICS This time the mechanic changed both fuel filters and checked the injectors for cleanliness. After road testing they agreed the fault still persisted. The mechanic had a second opinion from another mechanic who, I was told, described it as behaving like a dog. When I arrived to pick up the car Richard advised me that they had been unable to fix the fault. He then told me that there have been a number of cases where due to some engine design manufacturing defect or computer design fault, certain cars have exhibited this same problem. One story he recounted was where a car had needed the cylinder head replacing before the fault was cured. Another involved the replacement of the computer with a newer version. He described an apparent problem in the location of the knock sensor which confuses the onboard computer under periods of acceleration. The computer is fooled into thinking that there is a knock in the engine, it then retards the timing accordingly. When the throttle position sensor relays the fact that the car is under acceleration the computer then decides it will allow power to the engine. Richard also mentioned flame front problems on some cars. I do not know whether the problems Richard described are related to those Im having, but I do know that I have traded in a good 1988 Magna for one which is performing poorly. I would not have faith in the car reliably getting me out of certain situations where quick power is required, and consider it as potentially unsafe given the wrong set of circumstances. I would appreciate your help in having the problems rectified quickly, as I would not like a protracted situation. I was advised by Richard that the fault would indeed be fixed somehow, him not knowing the latest with Mitsubishi Motors rectification of existing faults, and that I would not have to pay for any rectification costs. He told me Mitsubishi Australia and Penrith Mitsubishi value customer relations and pride themselves with providing good service. I have no doubt this is the case. Could you please advise me what steps you can take to provide an early resolution to this most frustrating problem. Yours faithfully Terry Wahlen 51 Rickard Rd Warrimoo NSW 2774 NRMA Technical Department 151 Clarence St Sydney 2000 15th April 1994 Attn Mr Bob Hudson Dear Mr Hudson, I am writing to you with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. You see, I have just spent 26,000 on a 1992 Mitsubishi Magna SE sedan, and have been having a problem which I notice you refer to in the last issue of The Open road. I am having engine hesitation and misfiring under acceleration and load. You mention these points as things to watch out for when purchasing the TR Magna. Had I known there were faults of this nature with this particular car then I probably would have opted for a different car altogether. I called the NRMA technical section prior to purchasing the car with a view to getting advice on the purchase price given the level of optioning that was on the car. At no time did the person I talked to mention a problem with this model that perhaps I should look out for. Given that I could be in line for protracted negotiations with Mitsubishi over the rectification of the fault, could you please advise me of any information NRMA or you might have about the fault condition, and what steps have been taken by Mitsubishi to rectify the fault. I have had discussions with Penrith Mitsubishi about the car, and have been advised by them to write to Mitsubishi Motors to get the rectification process under way. The service department advisor, Mr Richard Davidson of Penrith Mitsubishi, told me Mitsubishi have replaced cylinder heads and computers on some cars to fix the fault, but he was unsure of the latest methods for fault fixing, a situation I find amazing. I have included a copy of the letter I sent to both Mitsubishi Motors Australia and Penrith Mitsubishi for your perusal, as it describes the fault in more detail. Also, I would be very interested in your opinions of modern car manufacturing, when a model can be released with such a known fault existing. You say in your article that most bugs were ironed out before 1990, but I find it ridiculous that I have spent 26,000 and bought a car with another known problem. I am awaiting an answer to my letter to Mitsubishi, but thought I may as well gather as much information as possible in order to arm myself for any possible negotiations with Mitsubishi. I would appreciate any assistance you may be able to give. Yours faithfully Terry Wahlen Member Number 2583202 51 Rickard Rd Warrimoo 2774 NSW NRMA Limited 151 Clarence St Sydney 2000 NSW 7th June, 1994 Attention Mr Peter Bylsma cc Mr Bob Hudson Dear Mr Bylsma I am writing to you at the request of Mr Bob Hudson after I described to him a fault with my 1992 Mitsubishi Magna TR sedan. I have enclosed copies of the correspondence involved with this problem for your perusal. The car has constant hesitation and misfire under acceleration or load which makes it very annoying to drive, and, I feel, potentially dangerous given the wrong set of circumstances. Basically Penrith Mitsubishi have told me that yes, there is an acknowledged fault in my model of Magna, but that they cannot fix the problem themselves. It requires their Head Office to come up with the necessary fix, which has previously involved anything from computer replacement to cylinder head replacement. I have had the car in three times for diagnosis and repair, but have been given only one excuse after another for the lack of satisfactory rectification. Mr Richard Davidson of Penrith Mitsubishi service department has told me they have checked the fuel injectors, filters and pump and have changed the air cleaner, at cost to me, and that it now awaits Mitsubishi to come up with an overall fix for the problems, rather than try a problem by problem approach."

        "text": "The Creative Camera Creative camera work starts from behind the camera, not in front of it. By John Clutterbuck. Being creative with a camera does not necessarily mean rushing out and buying a truck load of filters, matte boxes or trick lens attachments. To take full advantage of the creative potential offered by the camera and the photographic process it is important first to understand the process of taking a conventional photograph. That means being able to focus properly, set the correct exposure information and, when these elements are right, to release the shutter button at the right moment. Conventional results contain maximum information and detail about the scene or subject and show elements in the picture in good relation to each other. Conventional or standard photographs make no pretence to being creative or clever. The technique of making a standard photograph is fine for the majority of picture taking situations, but there are times when we want to produce something more than just a static record of a scene or subject. Some pictures demand our attention because there is something different about them. This difference could be for any number of reasons more often than not it is because the photographer has created a visual impact by altering or departing from one or more parts of the conventional photographic process. By taking the humble snapshot into another plane, removing it from the confines of merely recording into an area of visual statement with its own grammar and conventions the final image becomes a story with feeling, understanding, humour, design and interpretation. The key to creative camera work is in being able to see the subject and to translate it into an interesting picture. However, pictures that are all technique and lack an interesting image are usually very dull and ineffective. The essence of good, creative camera work is blending both the technical with the interesting. The most boring, commonplace items or scenes can take on a totally new appearance simply by being viewed in a different way. The interpretation placed on a subject will dictate the final results. Time And Motion The controls on a camera are there to consistently produce correct exposures and well defined images. You can also choose to alter these settings to obtain images that are a little different, more interesting and interpretative of your view of the world. Every photograph involves a time factor time for the light passing through the lens and aperture to expose the film correctly. This light can be seen as arriving in two ways. Firstly it can arrive over a short period of time, ensuring that the components of the image are recorded sharply and are welldefined. Or the light can arrive over a long period of time, causing any objects that move during the exposure to blur, while any static objects remain sharp. Most modern camera systems offer a choice in controlling the time it takes to make an exposure, either through fast shutter speeds and large aperture settings, or slow shutter speeds and small aperture settings. One method of working with these techniques is to divide the different shutter speeds into two categories those that can be handheld usually any speed above 160 second and those that require support or a tripod usually anything below 160 second. In still photographs motion is recorded as a continuous blur. Depending on the shutter speed used this can range from a slight blur to a sharply frozen image. If the desired effect is to freeze the subject in motion during a point of action, then the fastest possible shutter speed should be chosen. If the subject is moving parallel to the camera this movement should be followed by panning the camera until it reaches its peak or its slowest point before making the exposure. With any moving subject there is usually a point at which it can be photographed with greater clarity, even when slow shutter speeds are used. As mentioned before, it is possible to combine electronic flash with slow shutter speeds to stop action. The key to stopping motion when working with slow shutter speeds is to anticipate the transition point. There is a point with a jumping subject when for a fraction of a second, there is no movement either up or down because it becomes trapped between its own upward motion and the force of gravity. This applies with most moving subjects. Full extension or contraction of arms or legs are the peak times of the transition stage. A galloping horse can be recorded more sharply at the transition point when all four legs are either on the ground or off the ground, rather than somewhere in between. This transition point can be found in most action situations. Even the most modest camera can capture and record moments of movement and action that cannot usually be seen with the naked eye. A slow shutter speed combined with panning will blur a fixed background while the moving subject will remain sharply defined as long as the speed of the subject and the panning speed of the camera are equal. The blurring of the background adds a feeling of motion and speed. The technique with panning is to use a tripod by slackening off the panning lock and following the subject in the viewfinder, making sure that the camera continues to keep panning during the moment of exposure otherwise you defeat the purpose of the exercise. If handholding the camera, stand with your feet slightly apart and follow the movement of the subject by swinging your body from the hips. With this technique, shutter speeds of between 115 and 130 second usually provide good results. These speeds provide enough time for the panning action to blur the background while maintaining subject sharpness with perhaps only a trace of blur. The speed of the subject is important. For most sporting events such as running, jumping and swimming, shutter speeds of between 115 and 130 second give good results. For other activities like cycle racing, skateboard riding, surfing, horse riding and car racing, shutter speeds of between 130 and 160 second provide sufficient blurring of the background. This technique does not work well with subjects that are moving either away from or towards the camera position. Handling Focus Along with shutter speeds, you also have control over the aperture. The size of the aperture controls the amount of sharpness that extends before and beyond the actual point of focus. The degree of sharpness increases as the size of the aperture is decreased. With an aperture setting of f2 the plane of sharpness will be rather shallow, in some cases only a matter of a few centimetres. With a smaller aperture setting larger aperture number of say f16, the area of sharpness will be much greater. With a standard 50mm lens, depthoffield can extend from one metre to infinity. The further the subject is from the camera position the greater the depthoffield becomes. By using depthoffield, it is possible to lead the eye to a specific point in the picture, effectively throwing anything not required out of focus. This produces pictures where the object of your interest becomes the dominant point being the only point of focus, thus forcing the viewer to see what you want him to see. The rest of the picture becomes just so much blurred tone and colour. Shallow depthoffield and selective focus can be critical factors when creating pictures with feeling and mood, producing images that leave something to the viewers imagination. At the other end of the scale it is possible to create pictures with enormous depthoffield, with everything in the picture sharply focused. One point to remember is that depthoffield is not distributed evenly either side of the point of focus. Depthoffield is greater behind the point of focus than in front. As a rule of thumb, you can approximate the actual difference as onethird in front and twothirds behind. Playing with Exposure Photography gives you the freedom to choose, to alter and to interpret a scene from the way it appears in reality to the way you would like to see it in the final picture. One method of altering reality is with deliberate under or overexposure. The majority of photographs are faithful reproductions of the original scene and unless the original scene is very dramatic or moody, photographs taken faithfully tend to be a little dull. Deliberate underexposure can give a picture an edge. Colours become more saturated, shadow details become less distinct and the tonal range is compressed. Pictures produced with this technique carry a sense of drama. With deliberate overexposure, the final image has a romantic light quality as colours are slightly washed out, becoming soft pastels and delicate tones. The methods used to achieve these results are very simple. One is to take a normal average meter reading of the scene and simply increase or decrease either the aperture setting or the shutter speed by one position. Another method is to alter the film speed indicator plus or minus one stop, thus fooling the meter. A change of one stop will not necessarily produce major changes in the final picture. You might need to use one and one half to two stops to produce more noticeable effects. Filters and Effects One truth holds good for all filters and optical devices they cant create what is not already there. All manner of optical devices fall under the general heading of filters. Basically filters remove things. It doesnt matter what sort of filter youre talking about water filters, air filters, petrol filters, or for that matter photographic filters. Most photographic filters allow certain wavelengths of light to pass and remove others that are not wanted. Other filters will add stars, coloured halos, mixup or multiply the image, make it soft, give it a hard edge, split it in half and so on. Filters let you select those parts of the light you want. You can therefore make better pictures by selecting the best elements of the scene and choosing a filter to emphasise or balance these. Corrective use of filters allows the elimination of degrees of colour, sharpness or unwanted detail which threaten to spoil or detract from the final image. On the other hand, filters can be used creatively to add colour or effects, but it is important to remember filters dont actually add they subtract quite the opposite. The use of filters with colour film is somewhat limited, more so than with black and white film, as colour film reproduces colour literally. Any coloured filter that is introduced will affect the whole image and produce an overall cast on the film. Daylight colour film is designed to reproduce accurate colour and optimum results at a colour temperature of 5000 degrees Kelvin based on the colour temperature of noon sunlight. However few colour films are manufactured to precise tolerances and they can, in any case, change colour with age or through poor storage conditions. These changes in colour temperature can be seen on the film as a shift either towards the blue or red end of the spectrum. Shifts in colour temperature can be corrected through the introduction of colour correction filters CC filters. These filters alter the actual colour of a picture by very subtle degrees and correct deficiencies in either the film emulsion or the quality of the light source. When correcting a colour cast, use a filter of the opposite or complementary colour. The blue cast resulting from an overcast sky, for example, can be corrected by introducing a light magenta or a yellow filter. On the other hand, a blue filter can be used to correct the yellowish cast of sunset or sunrise. Colour film is extremely sensitive and therefore colour correction filters are made in increments of 5 of a factor. A filter factor of two is equal to a one stop decrease in exposure, therefore a filter factor of 5 has little effect on the exposure."

        "text": "MASONRY CRACKING 1 Introduction Masonry cracking is relatively common in domestic construction. It is difficult to generalise on the significance of cracking, as provided the cracking is not structurally significant, the assessment of the aesthetic impact of a crack is subjective and influenced by many factors. For example, a 1 mm crack in a rendered and painted wall will be much more obvious than a crack of similar size in the joints of a face brickwork wall. Some guidance to the significance of crack size is given in the Residential Slabs and Footings Code 3. These guidelines are summarised in Table 1 and at least form the basis for some objective assessment of damage. An extensive study on cracking in brick and block masonry was published by Sorensen and Tasker in 197510. Cracking types were identified as vertical extending through perpends and masonry units horizontal along a bed joint stepped through bed and perpend joints or cogged following bed and perpend joints in a vertical direction or combined any combination of these. These cracks are shown diagrammatically in Figure The cracking pattern is influenced by many factors including the relative strength of the joints and the masonry units, the presence of openings or other points of weakness, the degree of wall restraint, and the cause of the cracking itself. A more detailed description of the causes and effects is given in the following Sections. 2 Cracking Due to External Effects Cracking in this category is caused by excessive movement of foundations resulting from external ground movements. These mechanisms are shown in Figure If the extent of these ground movements can be predicted, the footing can be made stiff enough to accommodate the expected movements and thus avoid subjecting the masonry to excessive deformations this is the philosophy adopted in the Residential Slabs and Footings Code 3, 4. In a similar manner, the Concrete Structures Code 24 limits the deflection of beams and slabs supporting masonry walls to span500 where provision is made to minimise the effects of movement, or otherwise spanAlternatively, the masonry itself can be designed to act as a deep beam and span across the displaced area. The danger in this latter approach is that if the masonry does crack, the size of the crack is likely to be excessive. If the masonry walls are articulated and thus able to tolerate some foundation movement, the stiffness of the footings can be reduced. The main causes of ground movements are categorised in Sections 1 to 1 Moisture Movement in Reactive Soils Reactive or plastic soils are clays and very fine silts that shrink and swell as their moisture content decreases or increases. These movements can be quite large. Sorensen et al., 10 indicate that movements of 50 mm are not uncommon, and in extreme cases, movements as high as 100 mm have been recorded. The soil moisture content near the surface is influenced by seasonal changes in rainfall, watering of gardens, leakage from water pipes, the presence of trees and shrubs, and solar radiation. The moisture content of the soil beneath a building will not be uniform. In particular the moisture content around the edges of a building will vary considerably with time due to the affects described above. If the soil is reactive, large relative movement could be expected in the soil producing either a dishing or doming of the soil profile under the building See Figure 3. Doming will occur when the soil around the outside of the building shrinks on loss of moisture. Dishing will occur when the soil around the edges expands with moisture. If the footing is too flexible, distress would be expected in the masonry. Cracking related to this distress can be vertical or stepped depending on the wall geometry and the presence of openings. Because the segments of masonry between cracks will rotate as rigid elements with the footing, the varying width of the crack should be consistent with this rotation that is larger at the top or bottom depending whether dishing or doming has occurred. Typical cracking patterns are shown in Figure The presence of a horizontal dampproof course near the base of the wall has an important influence on the above mechanism, as it acts as a plane of weakness. Recent tests at the University of Newcastle 2 on typical domestic masonry walling systems have shown that with increasing beam curvature the masonry cracks and separates along the plane of the dampproof course, with the courses below this joint deflecting with the foundation beam. If the masonry is capable of spanning across the void created by the beam deflections, no further distress occurs. Otherwise the wall will crack and follow the curvature of the beam in the manner shown in Figure To eliminate the effects of soil reactivity, either the levels of moisture variation must be stabilised, or the foundations be supported by some form of underpinning or both. Variations in moisture content can be reduced by the removal of offending trees, suitable drainage, and the placement of an impermeable ground moisture barrier around the building. If desired, a vertical barrier can also be installed to a depth at which the soil moisture content is constant. 2 Differential Settlement of Foundations Differential settlement of foundations can result from a variety of causes including nonuniform consolidation, the construction of the building on variable ground conditions, andor local shear failure of part of the foundation. Cracks resulting from uneven settlement could be of several forms, usually a combination of stepped and vertical, and similar in many respects to the mechanisms described in Section 1 although the extent of the distress will depend upon the location and nature of the differential settlement. 3 Mine Subsidence There are several significant areas of Australia where coal mining has occurred, or will occur, under residential areas. The traditional method of coal removal has been by the bord and pillar system, where initially only 3040 of coal is mined with substantial pillars of coal left to support the strata above. These pillars may then be removed later as part of the secondary extraction process. Subsidence of the surface will occur shortly after this secondary extraction is complete. A more recently developed alternative process is retreat longwall mining in which the complete coal seam is removed progressively with the strata above the removed section of the seam being temporarily supported by a moveable propping system. This temporary propping system advances with the longwall, with surface subsidence occurring progressively 11. Mine subsidence can subject houses and their footing systems to severe movements. The ground movements include lateral strains, settlement, curvature and tilt. A typical sequence of events as a house is undermined by the longwall process is shown in Figure It can be seen that the ground strains and curvatures change as the subsidence wave progresses under and beyond the dwelling. Cracking in masonry walls resulting from mine subsidence will often have a form similar to that resulting from soil shrinkswell, as upward and downward foundation curvatures are involved. In this case the influence of tensile ground strains can also be significant, particularly if the footing system is not isolated from the effects of these strains the effects of ground strains can be minimised by keeping the footings as shallow as possible to avoid keying into the ground, and incorporating slip layers to isolate the footing from the ground movements 12, 13. In order to reduce the effects of curvature, the same philosophy of footing design should be adopted as used for footings subjected to soil shrinkswell. That is, the stiffness and strength of the footing is designed to accommodate the expected curvatures so that distress to masonry walls above the footing system is kept within acceptable limits4. 4 Extreme Loading An additional potential source of cracking in masonry housing is from severe loads from an unusual event such as a severe storm or an earthquake. Although the likelihood of these events in the life of the structure may be small, the consequences can be expensive. For example, the total cost of damage from the recent Newcastle earthquake is now well in excess of 1 billion dollars, with the bulk of this damage being to masonry 14, 15. Although it may not be economical to design domestic structures to emerge unscathed from this level of loading, the extent of damage can be minimised by good design, detailing and construction practices. This was illustrated by the Newcastle experience, where a significant proportion of the damage to masonry in housing was the result of lack of tying of walls, bad workmanship, poor detailing and general building deterioration 16. 3 Cracking from Dimensional Changes in Masonry Masonry will undergo changes in dimensions due to variations in temperature, cycles of wetting and drying, and long term dimensional changes associated with moisture. If the wall detailing is such that these dimensional changes are restrained, then cracking can result. The main sources of movement are briefly described below. Further details are given in Reference 9. 1 Thermal Change The thermal expansion of masonry units varies with the material, the method of manufacture and the colour. The value of thermal expansion is likely to be in the range of 008 to 01 mmmoC. Cracking from thermal effects can result from the differential thermal movements from temperature fluctuations between the external and internal components of the building. Temperature gradients through the wall thickness may also produce flexural cracking. 2 Wetting and Drying Change All masonry units expand on wetting and contact on drying, clay less so than concrete or calcium silicate products. This is a reversible process which normally does not require consideration in practical masonry. 3 Long Term Permanent Expansion in Clay Products Brick Growth All clay products undergo a permanent long term expansion which for practical purposes is irreversible, and is the result of chemical reactions between water and certain minerals in the clay. This moisture expansion, or growth, occurs at a high rate initially and gradually diminishes, with approximately 50 of the 5 year growth occurring in the first 6 months. The bulk of the growth will have occurred after a period of 510 years. Cracking patterns from brick growth are usually quite distinctive and reflect the mechanism of differential movement between walls, the restraining effects of surrounding elements, and relative movements between sections of the same wall. Expansion occurs both horizontally and vertically, so that restraint in the vertical direction can also be critical. The rate of growth in restrained walls is also less than in unrestrained walls such as parapets. Cracking patterns characteristic of brick growth include vertical cracks or distress close to corners of long walls, oversailing of upper portions of walls over lower parts, bowing and arching of parapets or walls where expansion is restrained, and distortion of window and door frames and diagonal cracking adjacent to openings due to differential movements within different sections of the one wall. In recent years, a more complete understanding of the mechanism of brick growth has been obtained. A 4 hour accelerated test can be performed to predict the 5 year characteristic unrestrained expansion value for brick units em. This value can range from less than 6 mmm for a low expansion unit, up to 8 mmm in some extreme cases. Once this unrestrained value is known, the spacing, size and location of suitable control joints can be determined to ensure that the expansion of the brickwork can occur without distress. These procedures are well documented in the literature 9,17,18 and described later in this report in Section 4 Long Term Permanent Change in Concrete and Calcium Silicate Products Drying Shrinkage All concrete and calcium silicate products including AAC will undergo a long term, irreversible drying shrinkage created be the chemical reaction involved in the curing process. Much of the total shrinkage will occur in the factory during precarbonation, autoclaving or steam curing. However, the total shrinkage will be affected by the rate of drying and additional moisture that may be acquired during transportation and site storage, deliberate wetting of the units before laying, and rain on unprotected walls immediately after laying."

        "text": "Wed 17 Feb London Dear Fam, Well just a quick note to let you know I made it to London. All is going well at this stage. Singapore was Okay, you can take it or leave it. More time would have perhaps allowed me to chase up the Military History side of things. London is cold 46degree overnight with colder forecast and possible snow on the way. I am off to Camberley this afternoon to stay with friends. I shall try to see more of London this week. Probably go to Bath next week. I called Pippa Burton and will try to catch up with her on the weekend. Mum as I mentioned on the phone can you see if you can change my Telecard to Unrestricted ie International calls allowed please. Speak to you soon Lots of love Your Son brother John Puckapunyal 31 July 1994 Dear Dad, This letter is just to let you know that I love you. I love all of our family but sometimes it is hard to say or show it. I also know that both of us have a problem communicating our thoughtsfeelings to each other. Hence this letter. I really do appreciate both yours Mums concern for me. This has not been a particularly easy transition for me back to Australia. I had so much looked forward to coming home only to find things do not often go according to plan. That is my lot, and in a large part, of my making. I accept this, albeit begrudgingly. So whilst I may not be as buoyant on the phone, please be sure that I am well on the way to overcoming this hurdle. Thankyou both for your thoughts and more importantly your love throughout my years. I take great comfort in knowing that it will continue no matter what circumstance we find ourselves in. I can only hope that I will be able to provide the support, as selflessly as you both have done, to you, should you ever require it. Well that is really all I wanted to say. It is much easy to say it in writing where no offence to our machoistic manners can be caused I look forward to seeing you all for the weekend in Bowral. I remain, as always, your loving also nonsmoking son John Brussells 10 March 93 Dear Mum Dad, It was good to talk to you yesterday on the phone. Suffice to say I am missing you all and Australia. I do hope your recovery will be a speedy one. Holland was good. Danielle Marcel really looked after me and made me feel very welcome. I visited Arneham and the Airborne Museum which was very interesting. I also took the opportunity to visit Connie Bens Slaphoes or temporary home. I left them a letter which in short stated my disbelief that they were not in Holland to meet their godson. No doubt they will read it in May when they get there. At the moment I am waiting in Brussells for some bank papers to arrive from London. As I mentioned on the phone there appears to have been some stuff up with the New York Bank formerly Barclays and my cheque books were not sent to the MacLeans place in Camberley as instructed. I faxed New York just before I left for Europe. New York then sent to the MacLeans what would appear new application forms. Lynn Maclean is sending these to me in Brussells. My great concern is that this is the account that the Aust Govt was to deposit approx US12,000 for my allowances for M.E for 4 months. Via the embassy I have faxed Central Finance Office a letter not to deposit the money until I can confirm the account details. Needless to say without this money I will be in dire straits in the Middle East. There may be something you could do to chase it up from your end. The original account was arranged by a Miss Kerrie Crossan Snr Investment Officer Private Banking Barclays Bank Aust Pty Ltd Tel 07 232 888 FAX 07 221 9955 PO Box 5778, Central Plaza, BRISBANE QLD 4001 She was the one who informed me that my account number was 6300498653 with the BANK OF NEW YORK previously Barclays 300 Park Ave NEW YORK, 10022, USA. PH USA 212 418 4600 FAX USA 212 758 She also instructed New York to forward my cheque book to the MacLeans in Camberley you have their address. You could probably call her to find out what the hell is going on. I mean I sent all the paperwork to her including a cheque for AUD100 to cover her admin fees and a bank cheque from Westpac, in my favour, of US100 to open the account The more people I have chasing this up from 3 continents the better Maybe a threat of the Australian Banking Ombudsman might have the desired effect. You can stress to Miss Crossan the importance of this account and the need to expedite account finalisation. Stress to her that the monies that will be transitting through the account are in fact Australian Government funds and if any of it goes missing then there will certainly be some investigations Ill leave the Australian negotiations with you. I have also worked out a rough plan for the remainder of Europe, pending my departure from Belgium BrussellsMunich 2 nights, MunichKitzbuhel 24 nights pending skiing and Margie Slattery, KitzbuhelVenice 2 nights VeniceFlorence 2 nights, MonarcoLivigno near Tirano Italy for 23 nights maybe for skiing, TiranoGeneva 1 night, GenevaVerdun 23 nights battle field tours of the region, VerdunParis for maybe 3 nights, ParisLetterveCork Ireland 34 days then Ireland back to UK Camberley approx. 74 But I stress that this is a very rough guide I shall let you know, if possible, of any other major deviations. Well that is about it for the travel plans. It was a real spinout seeing Peter on the flying doctors in Holland, so I guess you can say that he is world famous, and all this time he has been understating his notoriety I hope all goes well with his court casedotted line I know the feeling. Mum Dad look at your two younger sons eh both bloody felons eh Well give my love to one and all. I miss you all more than you imagine. I hope this letter finds you well, or recovering, and that dad you havent worn out the jogging tramp yet Love your son John xx P.S. I will write to someone in the clan soon Cheers J.H. 10 May 93 EL MELIZE AIRFIELD Observation Post Sierra Mike Dear Mum, Dad Family, Well I am currently on my second last day on OP SM which is located in the central Sinai near Bir Gathata. My OP buddies are two Americans, Jim a US Marine Major and Tony a US Army Major. We have been out here for six days and are due for relief tomorrow dotted line all things being equal Our deployment to the OP was by Air, which after refuelling, breakdowns and the like took 3 hours, had it been by road it would have taken only 1 12 hours. However the UN insists on doing Air Reliefs to maintain our air entry routes into the Sinai dotted line all very political As by now you are aware I am working for OGE Observer Group Egypt which has it headquarters based at Ismailia about 100 kms NW of Cairo. There are 3 OPs in the Sinai, this one, and one at El Arish on the Meditterean coast near GAZA, and St Catherine in south Sinai. My next OP is at Seerra Alpha El Arish in 7 days time. Out on OP we do mainly vehicle patrols through the Sinai. Some of the driving is very interesting to say the least, dunes, wadis etc. Also of interest is all the battlefield junk to be found, old tanks, artillery pieces and even minefields. This whole region has been fought over that often its not funny. Driving through it one wonders what they were fighting over as it is an absolute wasteland and frankly they can have it. However, the people are interesting. Driving through some of villages you would be amazed at the squalor that most people live in. On the lowest end of the scale you have the Bedouins who live in tin and sandbag shacks and try to eek out a meagre living herding goats and farming. Despite their obvious hardships all the people in general are surprisingly happy friendly. To give you some idea of the standard of living dotted line An Egyptian Army Major earns about 400 Egyptian Pounds a month roughly Aust 200 and that is considered a good wage So if you want too you can live extremely well for not much at all. However if you want any western goods the more western, the higher the price it will cost you fairly dearly. Also shopping in an Egyptian souk or the equivalent to Paddys Market, is a culture shock. Cheap sure, but I was almost dry retching during my first visit. Its not a task I look forward to Australian Health Inspectors would have a field day. Personal hygiene is something that is obviously not on the Egyptian school syllabus However I am still alive and have not, touch wood, had any illness of any kind since leaving Australia almost 3 months ago Only another 12 months to go eh I have managed to find an apartment in Ismailia. From my window you can see ships cruising down the Suez Canal. I am due to move in when I get back from this OP. It is three bedroom, fairly new, air conditioned with dishwasher and washing machine so I am not doing too badly. Eventually I should have a phone on and Ill give you a number. I am not sure whether Ill be able to call you from home as international lines take forever to be put on, but you should be able to call me, Lucky eh However I am able to make calls from the headquarters which I get billed for so you will here from me eventually. All my gear has arrived from Australia, Im yet to unpack the main shipment but I think it has travelled well. I also have received your letters and bday card. Mail will probably take about 1421 days to reach me and vice versa, however I still think that this system is more reliable than Egyptian Post Hopefully Shona visited you when she was up in Sydney in early May, and she might have told you about my experiences in Jerusalem so I wont bother writing it. If not let me know and Ill tell you a story or two I was dissappointed to hear that Aust Customs are going to charge her 100 to release her jacket. What that means is that any presents in future Ill hold on to and bring them home with me in my main removal. How was your holiday And unreadablehow is everyone back at home. I will eventually get around to this writing habit a bit better. But I am starved for news at home and am especially keen to find out what everyone is up to no matter how inconsequential it may seem to you. Mum I was going to call you for mothers day but found out from Shona that you were away so dotted line happy belated Mothers Day I found out from a Aust. newspaper that Norths are doing well. Last info I had was that at Round 5 Norths had drawn 1 and won the last four and were at 3 on the ladder. Any further updates Please feel free to tape any Rugby International or state games, any league state games and Norths games that you can and send them over."

        "text": "Australia Dismantling the Walls of Fortress Queensland Satirists run short or work as Wayne Goss brings the Sunshine State back into the nation By Matthew Ricketson Brisbane It was all the fault of the jealous southern media. Queensland had been criticized unfairly but had weathered the petty blows and gone on to win anyway. Im surprised you can look me in the face, Wayne Bennett, coach of the Brisbane Broncos rugby league team, told Sydney journalists after his teams semifinal trouncing of Manly. It was stirring stuff vintage Joh BjelkePetersenspeak, even though Bennett later described it to Brisbane reporters as his Churchill speech. The Broncos were eliminated in the next round, and Bennetts antisouthern outburst remains remarkable only for its dated rarity in Queensland in 1990, only ten months after the end of 32 years of National Party rule. There has been a sea change in Queensland Labor Premier Wayne Goss has quietly dismantled the us and them fortress mentality that BjelkePetersen built over many years, which made antiQueensland ogres of a series of Prime Ministers Whitlam, Fraser, Hawke and scorned dissenters within the fortress as unQueensland. No more. Dissenting views are encouraged. Recently, officers of the postFitzgerald watchdog body, the Electoral and Administrative Review Commission, eagerly handed out leaflets for an allday seminar on The Role of Peaceful Protest in the Democratic Process. Goss has abolished Queenslands imperial honors system, making it the last state to break with this colonial tradition, and his administration is taking a lead in the push for such goals as uniform defamation laws. Queensland, in fact, has joined the rest of Australia. Its politicians no longer keep comedians in work. Says humorist John Clarke The kindest thing a satirist can say about somebody is nothing. And Goss has given cartoonists scant ammunition to do more. The media has been similarly affected. Gone is the steady diet if itcouldonlyhappeninQueensland stories and the stream of corruption allegations that led to Tony Fitzgeralds landmark inquiry and the epilogue of the BjelkePetersen years. Goss is still enjoying honeymoon popularity. Opinion polls show his approval rating at 73 compared with 14 for Nationals leader Russell Cooper. Goss is no populist. Rather, he is still enjoying the sun let in by the collapse of the Nationals fortress. Says historian and author Ross Fitzgerald Its a tremendous relief not to be separated from the rest of the Western world except South Africa, because for years and years we lived in a state of siege here. Nowhere is this relief more evident than in Brisbane and southeast Queensland, Labors new heartland since the December 1989 election. The outrage or testy defensiveness that dominated conversation among ordinary people about endemic corruption has dissipated as the Fitzgeraldinspired bodies the Criminal Justice Commission and the Office of the Special Prosecutor have set about their tasks. As the tension eases, corruption has even become funny. Tony Bellino, brother of Gerry Bellino, committed for trial following the Fitzgerald inquiry on six charges of official corruption, has just released a record album cheekily called Shame and Scandal in the Family and is flogging it in garish television ads. Brisbanites are free again to enjoy the balmy weather and the annual Warana arts festival, where the outspoken antiJoh poet Bruce Dawe has just appeared for the first time in several years. The economic endoftheworldisnigh gloom pervading much of Australia, especially Melbourne, is absent in Brisbane as people stroll through Queen Street mall photo caption at the end of the working day. Gold Coastbound bus drivers cheerfully agree to drop passengers wherever they like along the route. Says one southern visitor I reckon if you asked them to get out ahead of you and put on the kettle for a cup of tea, theyd agree. This is not to say that Queenslanders have been radicalized. A shopkeeper in the small Gold Coast town of Tugun is angry about the introduction of a needleexchange program to combat the AIDS threat. She says many addicts are able to get new needles without handing in used ones. Rural Queenslanders, traditionally the driving force behind the states economy and stout supporters of the National Party, are upset by Gosss decision to introduce daylight saving and at the prospect of higher rail freight charges. But their worries about Labor are overshadowed by the rising fuel prices, to as high as 9 cents a litre in some places, because of the Persian Gulf crisis. Says Peter McDonald, a stock agent with Primac Association Ltd I dont think they Labor are as bad as people thought they would be. But, to tell you the truth, we are not as much worried about them at the moment as we are about the new road freight charges that will follow the Commonwealth Governments hiking of truck registration fees. That will kill us. In less than a year, Goss has won his political spurs. Sitting in his large, handsome office, the walls of which are adorned with Donald Friend and John Passmore art, he is impressively in command and, unlike most of his alp colleagues interstate, he brims with enthusiasm. His attitude appears to be that any issue can be resolved by implementing the right policy. But this is oversimplifying the man because Goss already has shown a pragmatic streak. Everything he does is aimed at a long term of office. He seems to relish the dawntomidnight working days and speaks of carving out one day a weekend to spend with his wife Roisin and their children. Loss of family time is the downside of the job that and missing half the Broncos games this season. On a wallunit shelf sits a Broncoscolor rugby league ball. Personally autographed No, says Goss, the signatures are printed by a computer, and, showing the wry humor familiar to his staffers, he adds I wouldnt want to be seen to be using the influence of this office for personal gain. Gosss record to date is sound. He moved swiftly to continue implementing Fitzgeralds blueprint for expunging the states notorious electoral gerrymander and cleaning up corruption. To have done otherwise would have been electorally suicidal. He has fed the chooks the media but he has been careful not to repeat BjelkePetersens open contempt for them. He has introduced reforms without beating his breast. And, most notably, ha has abolished the feared police special branch, reduced 27 government departments to 17, and overhauled the tertiary education entrance requirements. Despite being the newest state premier, Goss has clearly signaled his distaste for the annual Premiers Conference at which Federal Government financial offers are pushed under the premiers hotelroom doors at 6 a.m. More important than any personal offence, Goss believes duplication of federal and state services drains the economy, and says he will be strongly arguing this point at the conference on federalstate relations at the end of the month. He has put troublesome issues out to pasture via a swath of inquiries. Hard to keep track of but estimated to number between 70 and 90, they are on issues ranging from logging on Fraser Island to education and homosexual law reform. Two forces are at work here. Opponents argue it is a deliberate strategy to defuse political minefields and gain time for Gosss political credibility to cement. There is truth in this. Gosss first edict on election night last December was for his zealous colleagues to take a cold shower. Earlier this year, ministers were advised to avoid controversial publicity at all costs. But he was simply being shrewd, given the wellremembered misadventures of the Whitlam Government and, more particularly, the deeply conservative nature of the Queensland electorate. Voters expelled the shattered Nationals last December rather than elected Goss, and he knows he has only one chance to convince them that the dreaded socialists of Labor can succeed in Queensland. The other force is democratic. It is easy for Australians in other states to forget the oppressiveness of life under the Hillbilly Dictator, as BjelkePetersen was described by awardwinning journalist Evan Whitton, who was recently appointed a reader to Queensland Universitys journalism school. Life in the political wilderness endured by the Queensland Labor Party was qualitatively different from Whitlams, and it is clear Goss and his colleagues still keenly feel earlier injustices. Matt Foley, a former social worker and now Labor chairman of the parliamentary committee overseeing electoral system reform, told parliament earlier this year that a bill to restore lost superannuation benefits to workers in the bitter, mid80s dispute at the South East Queensland Electricity Board was not only a significant humanitarian reform it was part of an important healing process for the body politic in Queensland. Labors chance to do this is dogged by a sense of political insecurity. Even now, says Foley, we wake up in the morning sometimes and say, Yes, we are still the government. In order to keep that dark period behind us, it is necessary to be very disciplined. The numerous inquiries also flow from lawyer Gosss insistence on due process, not favoritism. Nowhere is this more obvious than in his terse treatment of environmentalists, who had campaigned for the alp in the election and expected to exercise influence. High on their agenda was the cessation of logging on Fraser Island. Goss neatly sidestepped this political running sore by announcing an inquiry and appointing as commissioner the man whose public standing in Australia is higher than almost anyones Fitzgerald, qc. Says Australian Conservation Foundation executive director Phillip Toyne The greens have very high expectations of the Goss government and are becoming increasingly frustrated by the protracted inquiry into Fraser Island while logging is continuing. People are wondering whether the greener regime that they expected will eventuate. Gosss adherence to due process occasionally has been brought unstuck by pragmatism, most notably over reform of abortion laws an alp imperative, particularly among the six female Labor M.P.s. Goss has said, categorically, that the issue is off the agenda. Pressed, he says Queensland women already have access to reputable abortion clinics. The need to reform the law is outweighed by the nowin prospect of sanctioning parliamentary and community debate on the issue. Former Liberal leader Terry White believes the alp will be in power for at lest two terms. The first Goss budget was not bad for Labor and the National Party, still shellshocked by its crushing defeat last December, has yet to adjust to being in opposition. The chairman of a 20million chain of pharmacies, White says Goss has been generally well received by a business community that was tired of contending with National Party cronyism. White and Professor Ken Wiltshire, a Queensland University political scientist, are critical of Gosss shakeout of the public service. Many senior public servants were sent to Stalag 17, a dilapidated building on the fringe of the city, and left to rot while a series of Laborsympathetic appointments were made to head the bureaucracy. It is true that the old public service was heavily politicalized, but, says Wiltshire, its been a pretty shabby exercise. Perhaps the heaviest cloud on the horizon for Goss is the gathering perception that, according to the cyclical theory of politics, Labors wheel is turning and Goss may be rolled out in late 1992, just after Joan Kirner in Victoria and before Carmen Lawrence in Western Australia, Michael Field and the greens in Tasmania and John Bannon in South Australia. The last three face elections in Lawrence is battling to overcome the stench of WA Inc., Bannon holds power by the narrowest of margins, the Laborgreen accord has soured in Tasmania and Kirner is seen as virtually dead in the water. Add to this an increasingly beleaguered Labor Government facing a poll in early 1993 and it is understandable that several Queensland Labor backbenchers are privately worried the contamination will spread. On this question Goss is tense beneath his casual air, saying it is easy to be wise about the mistakes of other Labor governments."

        "text": "MPs force inquiry in ICAC head crisis By CINDY SCIBERRAS A PARLIAMENTARY committee will investigate whether Justice Barry OKeefe is fit to head the ICAC after it was alleged yesterday that he campaigned for the Government in the Parramatta byelection. Labor MPs and the nonaligned Independents combined in Parliament yesterday to use their numbers to force the Government to reconsider Justice OKeefes posting. The parliamentary ICAC committee will now take the unprecedented step of investigating whether Mr OKeefe is fit under the terms of the ICAC Act to be the States leading corruption fighter. The move came after Opposition Leader Bob Carr produced a copy of a letter Justice OKeefe wrote to National Trust members on August 19 praising the Government for a 675,000 grant to revamp Old Government House in Parramatta. He alleged that the letter, signed by Justice OKeefe as National Trust president, went exclusively to members living in Parramatta a week before the byelection. Mr Carr said it raised serious doubts about the independence of the office of the ICAC commissioner. The byelection was won by ALP candidate Gabrielle Harrison by 6 per cent of the vote from Liberal hopeful and Parramatta councillor Wendy Jones. Ms Harrison stood after her husband and sitting member for Parramatta Andrew Ziolkowski died of cancer earlier this year.Ms Harrison was sworn into State Parliament this week. Last night, Justice OKeefe refused to comment. Key independent MP and ICAC committee member John Hatton labelled the incident as a crisis of the ICAC.I cannot see how this appointment can survive under the circumstances that we saw in the Parliament today, he said. In Parliament, Mr Carr claimed that the letter was sent at the Governments request while Mr OKeefe was negotiating the terms of his appointment. Premier John Fahey vehemently denied this charge but Mr Carr said heritage matters had been regarded as vital issues in the marginal electorate. Whether at the bidding of the Government or not, he displayed total lack of judgment, or strong partisanship, Mr Carr said. If the ICAC is to work and do its job, it must be above party politics, there must be agreement that the head of the body is out of the political arena. Why not just say Vote Liberal and be done with it Justice OKeefes letter referred to an August 16 visit to Old Government House by Planning Minister Robert Webster. The National Trust is very grateful to the State Government for its generous grant, the letter reads. It also refers to it being great news for Parramatta. Justice OKeefes appointment hit another snag last night when the Opposition said it would not support Government plans to guarantee in legislation that he can return to the Supreme Court bench after his term as ICAC head finishes. The Government has agreed to allow Justice OKeefe to return to the bench as a condition of his accepting the job. Such a move allows him to collect a Supreme Court judges pension later. Mr Fahey hit back at the Opposition yesterday, accusing it of trying to destroy Justice OKeefes character. He said the letter was unsolicited and it was done by a man who gives voluntarily to many organisations and serves the National trust well as its president. After the Opposition raised the issue yesterday, Cabinet Office directorgeneral Roger Wilkins contacted Justice OKeefe. The judge replied in writing yesterday afternoon to Mr Wilkins, confirming he wrote the letter on August Justice OKeefe said the letter was discussed at a meeting of the Trust finance committee on the previous day and its contents also formed part of a report to the board on August The letter accords with the practice which I have adopted in relation to events which touch upon a particular branch or geographic areas in which the Trust operates, he said. He said that he also wrote to members in the marginal Blue Mountains electorate when funds were announced for the Trust property Everglades at Leura. State resists Budget spending spree FAHEYS POLL GAMBLE By State Political Reporter MICHAEL CAMERON THE Fahey Government has gambled its reelection hopes on a popular yet fiscallyresponsible Budget delivered yesterday. With six months to go until the March poll, Treasurer Peter Collins promised 1 billion in spending in the voterfriendly areas such as health, education and community services. At the same time he has locked a Coalition Government into tax relief and a strict timetable of debt reduction. There also was a commitment to dramatically increase public housing particularly pensioner units, more police and teachers, new schools, better TAFE colleges, improved roads and greater drought relief. The Treasurer promised 2 million in tax cuts including the abolition of licensing fees for lowstrength alcohol, cuts to payroll tax and land tax concessions for low cost rental accommodation. I think there is a lot in this for the average voters there are better hospitals, better schools, better roads, he said. This is a Budget of common sense, sensitive to the problems of ordinary people and families. The State Government benefited from an unexpected 559 million revenue windfall last financial year as a result of the improving economy. Buoyant property and sharemarkets produced 315 million more than expected in stamp duties and share transfer fees while club punters provided a 38 million surprise in poker machine tax. The bonus revenue helped the Government to ply 556 million more in capital works projects and 378 million in new services. The Budget was also aided by 155 million in special payments from Prospect Electricity, the Maritime Services Board, the Land Titles Office and the Treasury Corp. They also reaped 940 million from Government Trading Enterprises but the Treasurer said this would be reduced in future years owing to plans to expose State monopolies to competition. Mr Collins said the Government was within striking distance of balancing the annual budget. The improved economy had seen its original 890 million deficit estimate slashed to 430 million for 1993 This is estimated to come in at 353 million this financial year with a zero deficit result to be achieved within four years. Learning from its unsuccessful porkbarrelling in last months Parramatta poll, the Budget contains a number of longterm initiatives, including 150 million to reduce the States superannuation liability in 20 years. Over the last six years the Coalition Government has worked hard to remove NSWs finances from the critical list and nurse them back to health, Mr Collins told Parliament, delivering his second Budget as Treasurer. This Budget delivers the benefits of that reform it delivers on debt reduction, it promotes further sustained economic development. Mr Collins appeared to water down the Governments promise, made on Tuesday, to bring in legislation to force future treasurers to balance the Budget. He said a referendum question based on the legislation to be put to voters next March would be couched in careful terms, allowing deficit budgets where there were unforseen circumstances. These included major cyclical changes in the economy. Under his proposed law change, governments would be able to go into the red for a set period but must eventually return the budget to balance. Opposition finance spokesman Michael Egan described the Budget as containing unbelieveable bribes that would not wash with the electorate. It is really an attempt by John Fahey to buy your vote with your money, Mr Egan said. The people of NSW, like the people of Parramatta, wont buy it. Business cautiously welcomed the Budget. A spokesman for the Chamber of Manufactures said the private sector welcomed the corporatisation of the Water Board and hoped for further reductions in payroll tax. In a lavish Budget Day production, Mr Collins said the Government had systematically rebuilt the NSW hospital system. More than 2 billion will be spent on health this year, an increase of 6 per cent in real terms, the Treasurer said. More than 960 million will be spent in greater western Sydney and 388 million on the central and north coasts. This years health budget will include a record capital program of 460 million, an increase of more than 18 per cent on 1993 Another big winner is the Premiers Department, which will see its funding increase by 82 per cent in the year. This is, in part, due to the 20 million needed to establish the Police royal commission. At the same time the cashstrapped Ombudsmans office will receive no increase a reflection of the ongoing resentment towards David Landa. As expected, the seventh Coalition Government Budget provided many minor funding promises aimed at pleasing the broadest range of voters. These included the abolition of the 7 per cent liquor licensing fee now levied on the wholesale price of lowalcohol beer. If retailers pass on the savings to their customers, beer drinkers could enjoy a 1 to 50 reduction in the price of the average carton of beer. This will apply to beers with an alcohol content of less than 5 per cent such as Tooheys Blue and Carlton Light. The Government will build 3105 new units of public housing this financial year. Government officials say the 310 million spent on housing this year will be targeted to allow more suitable housing for single occupants. Drought may bump food costs up 25pc By CHRISTINE SPITERI THE cost of some food items could increase as much as 25 per cent by the end of the year if the drought devastating NSW continues, experts predicted today. National Farmers Federation executive director Rick Farley said meat was subject to the most volatile price changes but eggs, bread, chicken, flour and some fruit and vegetables may also be affected. He said food price increases were more likely if the drought widened to States which were currently unaffected. Mr Farley said many droughtaffected farmers had already sold off nonessential stock. Initially that leads to a surge of product on the market and in those circumstances prices for the consumer fall, he said. But as farmers reduce their stock to breeding herds only, the supply drops off and naturally that can lead to an increase in prices. The fact that Victoria, Western Australia and South Australia are okay tends to offset that but if the drought widens, we could see prices go up. He said forecasts of a 2025 per cent increase in the cost of some food items if the drought continued were fair. The Australian Consumers Association has warned customers to shop around to ensure they are not paying too much for food. ACA spokesperson Gail Kennedy said comparing prices allowed consumers to identify unscrupulous retailers who might use the drought to raise prices unjustifiably. We certainly dont want to see consumers being ripped off by retailers who are using the drought as an excuse to increase prices, she said. But if supplies drop off, obviously the market determines the prices. Shopping around is the way to go to ensure you get the quality you want at the right price. Ms Kennedy said consumers should consider frozen and canned fruit and vegetables if prices became unaffordable. Prices Surveillance Authority chairman Dr David Cousins said it was impossible to anticipate a rise in food prices because of the many variables linked to the drought and supply. He said the 1982 drought did not result in the sharp rises in food costs initially forecast, although prices did surpass CPI increases. I think it is very dangerous to be speculating about rises in the price of food brought on by the drought, he said. There are so many variables depending on different products, different areas that any forecasts are very uncertain. Dr Cousins said the flowon time for price increases, if any, would be the next three to four months. Consumers could expect some prices to fall, like meat as farmers sell off their stock, but these prices might later rise. The PSA will monitor the shift in food prices.

        "text": "RACISM Racism is a major cause of war and social violence. The belief, often based on religious or allegedly scientific grounds, that ones own group of people is innately superior to all others, leads to intolerance, justifies aggression and makes a virtue of misunderstanding, even despising others. The United Nations has declared it morally repugnant and unacceptable, pointing out that such feelings of innate superiority have no justifiable basis. To say the least, racists make bad citizens at both the national and the international level since citizenship is based om mutual respect and a community of value. It is deeply troubling to realise not only that Australia is a racist society, based on the systematic oppression of its Aboriginal inhabitants, but also that internationally it is increasingly seen in these terms. We may have forgotten the White Australia Policy but many of our Asian and African neighbours have not, and the Blainey debate several years ago, with its scapegoating of Asian migrants by rightwing and neofascist groups, was given extensive coverage especially in Asia. It is true, of course, that most Australians are probably tolerant, easygoing and friendly, and the fact that over a million migrants have come to Australia since World War II and have become part of our society with the minimum of racial violence witnesses to this. It could also be argued that tensions between the AngloCeltic majority and people from other cultures are by and large the result of socioeconomic factors jealousy of the newcomers success, for instance, or suspicion of their closeknit communities, rather than of the ideology of race. All that may be so. But there remains the problem, or rather the offence, of our treatment of Aboriginal Australians, possibly the most imprisoned people on earth and certainly the most systematically deprived and oppressed group in Australian society. Once again, it is true that most Australians are largely unaware of the grim history of contact between the two cultures and that others are able to explain away this history and the oppression which continues by stereotyping Aboriginals as lazy, ignorant, lawless and hopelessly addicted to alcohol. Comforting as they may be to some, however, these stereotypes, like the powerlessness and poverty of Aboriginal people, confirm the view that, at least as far as Aboriginal Australians are concerned, Australia is a racist society, one in which a group of people are permanently discriminated against on account of their colour, culture and ethnic origin and their basic human rights impaired for that reason, all this legitimated by an induced and subtle value acceptance of the idea of their inferiority interwoven, over time, into the nations sociocultural fabric.1 Morally, this is troubling. But there may also be political and economic consequences for us, a small, predominantly Western, society in SouthEast Asia. Indeed it is possible that with the breakdown of apartheid in South Africa, Australia may replace that country as the archetype of the racist state. There has already been some criticism in international forums of Australias delay in giving full ratification to the International Convention for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination which we signed in The Australian government still has reservations about Article 4a of the convention which states that the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority, hatred or incitement to racial hatred, as well as acts of racial violence or incitement to racial hatred, are unlawful. The governments grounds for this reservation are the challenge this article poses to freedom of speech. But it has drawn unfavourable comment internationally, especially in view of the apparent reluctance of the states to introduce legislation making racial violence and incitement to racial hatred an offence. To date, South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia have passed such legislation. But its implementation has been less than enthusiastic.2 This international impression of Australia is not insignificant, of course, in a world in which the hegemony of the West is increasingly being questioned and white people are becoming a diminishing minority. It becomes even more troubling in the light of the connection between Australian nationalism, the sense that we are somehow preeminent in the region because we are Western, and the ideology of imperialism which assumes the right of white people to rule the world and sets white over against black as superior to inferior, civilised to savage and sometimes even good to evil.3 If in the long run racism not only has to do with power but is a form of power,4 then that power today is increasingly under challenge by those who were formerly its victims. For all of these reasons, the publication of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody is an important event, providing as it does an opportunity to take stock of the situation. The task of the commission was to investigate Aboriginal deaths which occurred in custody. But these deaths, disproportionate to those of nonAborigines which occurred in prison, are, it appears, symptoms of a wider problem the fact that by reasons of their culture and history Aboriginal Australians are systematically disadvantaged and discriminated against so that, in effect, they are victims of racism at the structural and cultural, not merely the individual level. Because the problem is so general, it seems better to specify and in the first instance to concentrate on factual issues. For these reasons and because the Indian Ocean Centre for Peace Studies is located in Western Australia, we shall concentrate on the Royal Commissions Regional Report for Western Australia. Before doing so, however, the reception of the Royal Commissions report is worth comment. Only briefly, selectively and sometimes sensationally and misleadingly reported in this country the West Australians headlines, for instance, alleged, inaccurately, that the police had been cleared in the John Pat case it was nevertheless widely reported and discussed internationally. Whether or not this indicates indifference or embarrassment on the part of the Australian media, it is another example of the gap between our perception of ourselves and of the significance of our relations with Aboriginal Australians and international perceptions of the same matters. To come to the report itself, the overall impression is that this state is, in effect, one large prison. Aboriginal people are grossly overrepresented in custody.5 Thus an Aboriginal person in Western Australia is 43 times more likely to find himherself in police custody than a nonAboriginal person and at least 26 times more likely to find himherself in prison p.2. Onethird of the total Aboriginal deaths in prison occurred in this state and the ages ranged between 20 years to 55 years, the median age being 12 p. 6. Yet the Royal Commission found, the offences for which Aboriginal people were arrested and punished were generally minor offences. In 1988, for example, 48 per cent of Aboriginal people in detention were there for drunkenness the figure for nonAboriginal people was 7 per cent. A further 22 per cent of Aborigines were in custody for good order offences, many of them alcoholrelated streetdrinking, for instance, fighting, abusing police, or resisting arrest p. 187. It is perhaps significant, however, that Aboriginal people were underrepresented in proportion to the rest of the community in the category of more serious offences of homicide, sexual offences, robbery, fraud, drug offences, justice procedures and other offences against property p. 157. Despite the impression given by media stories about car thefts by young Aboriginals and subsequent high speed car chases, the fact is that they were underrepresented in this area in comparison with nonAboriginals p. 157. It is difficult to avoid the impression, therefore, that it is the fact that they are Aboriginals which propels many Aboriginal people into a life of conflict with the law. Certainly, this seems to have been the case with many of those whose deaths in custody were investigated by the Royal Commission. Many of them first found themselves in prison in their teens, sometimes for ridiculously small matters stealing two blocks of chocolate, for instance p. 55, or, aged 10, for breaking into a school to steal coloured pencils p. 68. Another had appeared in the childrens court on eight occasions and been imprisoned five times by the age of 16, all for trivial offences p. 55. Another young woman had 30 convictions recorded against her between 1976 and the time of her death in prison in 1982, mostly for petty offences and motor vehicle offences, usually committed under the influence of alcohol p. 57. Several of these were wellread and intelligent people and one of them, Robert Walker, who died in Fremantle Prison in a struggle with prison officers, had published a book of poems. Nearly all, however, had a history of dislocation, of being taken away from their families and placed in institutions. As far as detention was concerned, the commissions report noted a general lack of care of Aboriginal prisoners p. 8. According to a police aide, for instance, Wed just pop into the lockup, count heads and keep going p. 514. This indifference to Aboriginal prisoners in general and to the state of their physical and mental health in particular the report finds alarming. The police, the commissioner notes, did not seem to understand that someone who is drunk is also ill p. 129 and that hisher condition may become worse when locked up p. 130. Arresting alcoholics and placing them in a police lockup, as one of the witnesses, a professor of psychiatry declared, is to concentrate a suicidevulnerable population in custody p. 129. Several of the deaths, it is implied, might not have occurred if officers had been in any way vigilant. One prisoner, a young woman, was agitated, aggressive and complaining when taken into custody, yet she was put in a cell by herself where she later committed suicide. She was 21, and had been arrested for unpaid fines p. 48. Indifference to or ignorance of prison regulations was widespread amongst police and there appeared to be little awareness of the obligation on the part of police and prison officers to care for those in their custody. Partly, the report suggests that this was due to lack of proper training and lack of interest in Aboriginal culture. But there is also a suggestion that the importance of this training was not understood at the highest levels. In 1976, for example, 7 hours out of 13 weeks of training of police recruits were given to the study of Aboriginal culture. By 1990, however, this had been reduced to 2 hours and 40 minutes, though training had been extended to 22 weeks p. 557. Even more troubling, in 1989 the Institute of Applied Aboriginal Studies at what was then the West Australian College of Advanced Education at Mount Lawley withdrew its staff from participation in this training in protest against the short time given to it and on account of the quality of the course offered, but also because of racist behaviour directed against the Aboriginal lecturers p. 560. As the report sums up, Most police officers, like other government officials, had little or no understanding of Aboriginal history, culture, society or life stylep. 555. Attitudes were and still are ethnocentric and there was little if any attempt to work with the Aboriginal Community p.555. At best, concerns were pragmatic, intent upon the matters in hand, the preservation of law and order within the community. Even in training, the police, it was found Were not really interested in Aboriginal history and would rather get rid of units like prehistory. Their main focus was on wanting to know how to handle the person in the street p.561. At worst, the relationship seemed to be conditioned by history, to be that of the conquerors to the conquered and to give rise, therefore, to preconceived ideas about Aboriginal people which saw police setting out to prove they were boss p. 555. Not surprisingly, these bad attitudes the commission found resulted in prejudiced and discriminatory treatment p. 555. It is perhaps a further indication of such attitudes and of the often unconscious assumptions of superiority on which they are based that on the whole police believed that, despite problems, relations between them and Aboriginal people were relatively good."

        "text": "Charges dropped against third war crimes accused By BINA BROWN and ROHAN SULLIVAN THE prosecution of alleged war criminals in Australia collapsed yesterday after the Department of Public Prosecutions withdrew charges against the third and final accused, Mr Heinrich Wagner. The decision effectively ends a fouryear pursuit of World War II European war criminals thought to be living in Australia which has cost an estimated 30 million and failed to generate a conviction. The DPP made its decision on Wednesday after hearing evidence in the South Australia Supreme Court that Mr Wagner, 69, suffered a heart attack last month and a trial might kill him. Mr Wagner pleaded not guilty to being knowingly involved in the deaths of 104 Jewish adults and 19 children with Jewish fathers during Germanys World War II occupation of the Ukraine. He had been due to stand trial in the new year, following extended legal argument. A spokesman for the federal DPP said the charges against Wagner were among the last laid by the Special Investigations Unit of the Australian Federal Police. The unit investigated more than 800 possible war crimes cases between 1987 and 1992 but referred only four cases to the DPP. Charges were laid against only three men, all Ukrainian immigrants living in Adelaide, and the fourth case was abandoned when the unit was disbanded in September The DPP spokesman said yesterday further legal proceedings under Australian War Crimes legislation, which targets crimes committed in Europe between 1939 and 1945, were not expected. We are not aware of any more cases, the spokesman said. The first man charged, Mr Ivan Tymofeyevich Polyukhovich, 76, was acquitted by a Supreme Court jury in May while charges against pensioner Mr Mikolay Berezowsky, 79, were dismissed by a committal magistrate in July. Defence lawyer for the three men, Mr Michael David QC, said yesterday after listening to the evidence for 2 12 years none of these people should have been convicted. Mr David rejected claims Mr Wagner was let off on a technicality and declined to comment on whether the cost of the trials could have been better spent elsewhere. It would be unfair of the public to say Wagner got off on a technicality. he said. The fact was he just couldnt go to trial dotted line it was just objective evidence that he couldnt go to trial. Our client Mr Wagner had a heart attack two or three weeks ago. We called medical evidence in court, we wrote to the DPP and he ultimately, having seen the medical evidence, said the trial shouldnt go on and entered what is called a nolle proseque withdrawal of charges. Mr David said Mr Wagner, who was not available for comment, was very relieved at the decision. Estimated costs to taxpayers for the three cases, not including all the Wagner trial costs, have been put at about 30 million. There is a lot of public opinion about whether they should have gone on or not or whether the money could have been better spent elsewhere. All I can say is they were three very hardfought, difficult cases dotted line and they were very difficult to defend, as well as prosecute, I should imagine, Mr David said. The Jewish community in Australia accepted the DPPs decision not to proceed with the Wagner trial yesterday and defended the 30 million cost of war crimes investigations as the necessary price of justice. The president of the executive Council of Australian Jewry, Mr Isi Leibler, said last night due legal process hadbeen served. I am satisfied that, 50 years after the event, Australia has behaved as well as any country could have been expected to behave, the tragedy being that this the trials should have happened 40 to 50 years ago, when both witnesses and evidence were present in a form that they are not today, Mr Leibler said. He said criminal justice was costeffective in very few cases. Justice doesnt have a price and one doesnt evaluate justice at any other levels, why the question is being asked in this particular situation is beyond me, Mr Leibler said. Dawkins Resigns Treasurer puts his family first BY DENNIS SHANAHAN FEDERAL Cabinet will be reshuffled after Christmas, probably in the new year, after the snap decision by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, to retire a move that will change the face of the Keating Government and unleash internal rivalries. The main contenders for treasurer include the experienced Minister for finance, Mr Willis, the Minister for Education and Employment, Mr Beazley, and the longterm Keating loyalist and rightwing Minister for industrial Relations, Mr Brereton. But the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, may be tempted to elevate one of his younger ministers. Mr Dawkins announced his desire to retire for personal reasons to Parliament late yesterday shortly after informing the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and leaving some of his Cabinet colleagues unaware of his intentions. After 20 years in public life I think Ive given all I can give and I think I now look forward to other pursuits, which I am sure will be equally enjoyable. Mr Dawkins told Parliament in the presence of his wife, Maggie. Mr Dawkins said he would always look back with pride on his service as a minister in the greatest government I believe Australia has ever had . I take this step without any of the rancour, without any of the bitterness, without any of the disappointment that I have seen written on the faces of those who have stepped back from executive office, he said. Later, Mr Dawkins appeared at a formal press conference carrying his recently born baby, Alice, and in the company of Mrs Dawkins. He said the difficulties of mixing a family life with his job had been crucial to his decision. Not everybody understands what its like to conduct a sensible family life when you travel 3000 miles 4800km from Western Australia to work each week, he said. Asked what she thought of the decision, Mrs Dawkins said I think its wonderful. Mr Dawkins will remain as a caretaker treasurer until Mr Keating reshuffles the cabinet and appoints a successor. The Prime Minister will consider the options for, and the extent and timing of a Cabinet reshuffle during the Christmas break. Last night Mr Keating said he congratulated Mr Dawkins for a courageous personal decision to relinquish the post of treasurer. I am, of course, saddened at the departure from Cabinet of a friend and a colleague of such distinction, passion and ability, he said. When news spread to the financial markets of Mr Dawkinss decision, the dollar dipped in a kneejerk reaction almost US 5c, with a local closing price of US 40c, compared with a London opening price of US 90c, before it edged back. Government and financial sources said last night Mr Willis was the best qualified of the most likely contenders but that his previous brief tenure as treasurer and a hesitancy as a minister could count against him. Mr Breretons close personal links with Mr Keating and his recent appointment to the Expenditure Review Committee had boosted his chances. But his inexperience counted against him. There was some reluctance within the Right faction to Mr Breretons appointment, although the right would want to reclaim the treasury portfolio. Some labor MPs said last night Mr Beazley could serve as a middle candidate despite his relative lack of financial experience. There have been rumours in Canberra and Perth for months that Mr Dawkins was considering resignation. Mr Dawkins publicly raised the prospect of resignation in September, although after this incident the rumours were strongly denied. At a press conference in September Mr Dawkins appeared tired and declared that he had to admit that whenever it becomes necessary for me to leave Fremantle, get on a plane and come to Canberra, the prospect of political retirement does well in my mind. Mr Dawkins told the press conference he had finally decided to resign on Thursday night and had informed Mr Keating soon after 5 pm. Asked if he had consulted colleagues about the decision, he said it had been intensely personal. In a long speech to a crowded Parliament, Mr Dawkins said he was pleased to have been part of a great government, the government of Bob Hawke as well as the Government of Paul Keating. One couldnt have wanted to have two such important and helpful and indeed inspirational leaders to serve as a Cabinet minister as I have, different though they are, Mr Dawkins told Parliament. I want to say particularly to my friend the Prime Minister what a fantastic inspiration he has been to me during the course of the last 11 years dotted line This is the time entirely of my own choosing, its a time which I think in the natural course of events is the right time for me, at the age of 46, an opportunity to pursue other interests, he said. Although he said he departed without rancour or bitterness and was gratified that the Labor Party had given him, as somebody from a wealthy background,the chance to participate, he referred to his critics in the party in Perth who had not agreed with him. Crowds converge to welcome new year By MARTIN THOMAS and staff reporters HUNDREDS of thousands of people streamed into the nations cities last night to usher in the new year. In Sydney, greatly buoyed by its Olympic triumph, police said a record crowd of 350,000plus packed around the shores of the harbour to witness a milliondollar fireworks show in one of the most highly spirited celebrations in years. A police spokesman reported four arrests before midnight, three for offensive behaviour and one for assualt. But, given its size, the crowd had been remarkably well behaved. One man was retrieved from the harbour at the Quay by water police on a balmy, still, smokefilled night. In stark contrast rain threatened to dampen an already hollow celebration in Hobart. In the wake of one of the roughest SydneytoHobart Yacht races in some 40 years, just 14 boats were at Constitution Dock with their relieved crews ready to partake of the New Years Eve hospitality of the Apple Isle. Almost that many crews were spending their final moments of the year at sea and many more than that celebrating on the wrong side of Bass Strait at Eden, where they were still licking their wounds. Thousands of Melburnians converged on the City Square to welcome in the new year with a rock concert minus alcohol. The city precinct was declared alcoholfree zone for the night by authorities. Other revellers travelled to Lorne, on the southwest coast, for another rock concert where alcohol consumption was also limited. Many more travelled east to Phillip Island. The Victoria Police blitz on traffic, Project 100, was in its final stage with thousands of police on the States roads testing motorists for drink driving. In Brisbane a crowd of up to 80,000 descended on the citys South Bank to see a huge fireworks display. Police rostered extra patrols on the Gold Coast where crowds of up to 20,000 massed. Two hundred police, including mounted police, were on duty on the Gold Coast between Coolangatta and Surfers Paradise. Neither Queensland nor NSW police expected too much trouble, despite the anticipated 10,000 crowd which would throng to the border twin cities of CoolangattaTweed Heads for a double celebration courtesy of daylight saving. Last year 85 people were arrested for drunkenness and a further 75 were charged with a variety of street offences including obscene language and minor assaults. In Adelaide thousands of revellers were massing in King William Street for the traditional Lord Mayors Street Party. In Perth New Years Eve revellers packed the streets and nightclubs of Fremantle and Northbridge and filled the citys restaurants. With no fireworks to blast 1994 in, many were expected to attend concerts including the Hoodoo Gurus, Hunters and Collectors, Died Pretty and the Divinyls. In the wake of wild Christmas Eve celebrations when a crowd of up to 300 youths ran riot in suburban streets, smashing property and pelting police with bricks, police issued partygoers with stern warnings."

        "text": "Professional ballet companies rise and fall A Cavalcade of Empire Pageant at the Princess Theatre in Melbourne in October 1940 included an Australian bushfire ballet which symbolically portrayed the burning of the bush and the regeneration of its plants and animals. The ballet was choreographed by the Czech dancer Edouard Borovansky to music by his compatriot Oskar Nedbal, a pupil of Dvorak. Borovansky had settled in Melbourne and opened a ballet school after touring with the Covent Garden Russian Ballet in 1938 Appreciation aroused by the bushfire ballet soon led to the formation of the Borovansky Australian Ballet Company, which performed four ballets in the Comedy Theatre in December One of them was Autumn Leaves, with Edna Busse and Rachel Cameron alternating as the Chrysanthemum, one of Pavlovas roles. The other ballets were original classical variations entitled Pas classique, a Spanish story ballet LAmour ridicule, and Vltava. Danced to Smetanas tone poem describing the great Czech river, Vltava was Borovanskys first major work for his company and probably his most enduringly popular ballet. Laurel Martyn, a former soloist of the Sadlers Wells Ballet in London who had returned to Melbourne to teach in 1939, danced in Vltava. She became the first ballerina of the company, which for several years concentrated on performances financed by the Melbourne Ballet Club. In Borovanskys studio at Roma House the club built a small stage which was the setting for adventurous choreographic experiments by Borovansky and some of the dancers. Topical depiction of war The Union Theatre at Melbourne University was the venue for the premiere in June 1941 of En Saga, a oneact ballet to music of Sibelius by Laurel Martyn. She had staged a version of En Saga in a ballet gala at the Cambridge Theatre in London in 1936 but that was only a sketch for the choreographic masterpiece now revealed. It was a moving and topical depiction of women left at home during war and of mentally and physically scarred soldiers returning and gradually adjusting to peacetime life. Adjustment has scarcely begun when the drums of war beat again. The men must answer the call to arms and their women are powerless to prevent them. The principal dancers in the premiere were Dorothy Stevenson and Jonet Wilkie. Decor and costumes were by William Constable, in his first ballet commission. He had established his reputation with designs for the Marie Ney dramatic company in 1940 and he was beginning 14 years as resident designer for the Borovansky Ballet. In Sydney, the Danish dancer Helene Kirsova, who came to Australia as prima ballerina of de Basils Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 193637, opened a School of Russian Ballet in Sydney Next year she founded the first professional ballet company in Australia, the Kirsova Ballet. It made its debut in July 1941 at the New South Wales Conservatorium of Music in Sydney in two ballets by Kirsova, A Dream and a Fairy Tale to music by Chopin and VieuxParis to music by Offenbach and Johann Strauss II, and her restaging of Leacuteonide Massines Les Matelots. The initial company of 16 dancers was headed by Raissa Kousnetzova, Valery Shaievsky, Edouard Sobishevsky and Tamara Tchinarova, all from the Covent Garden Russian Ballet of 193839, and it included the Australians Strelsa Heckelman and Henry Legerton. By the close of 1941, the companys artists had doubled in number. They included Serge Bousloff from the Covent Garden company, and Peggy Sager, who came from New Zealand to study with Kirsova and soon became an important member of the company. A ballet record in Melbourne Les Sylphides and Kirsovas threeact Faust were added to the repertoire during Like A Dream and a Fairy Tale and VieuxParis, Faust was designed by Loudon Sainthill, who as a virtually selftaught 19yearold had been adopted by the Covent Garden Russian Ballet company and taken to London in 1939 as resident artist and portraitist. Henry Krips, the companys musical director, wrote the score of Faust. He was a Viennese musician brother of the conductor Josef Krips who had conducted at Innsbruck and Salzburg before he emigrated to Australia in Another former de Basil dancer, Valentin Zeglovsky joined the Kirsova company during its first Melbourne season, which began at His Majestys Theatre in January Faust was so popular that it ran for 25 consecutive performances, an Australian ballet record. In Melbourne in July 1942 the Borovansky Ballet gave a fivenight season at the Princess Theatre. The repertoire included En Saga and another ballet by Laurel Martyn, Sigrid, which she had created for a competition in London in Since its first Australian performance, at Toowoomba, Qld, in April 1940, with Martyn and Dorothy Stevenson heading the cast, Sigrid has been performed nearly 700 times. It is the oldest extant ballet by an Australian choreographer. It is based on an old Nordic legend and the music is Edward Griegs Lyric Suite, op. Music by Grieg was also heard in the 1942 season in Borovanskys Fantasy on a Grieg Concerto, a work for a large company in the style of Leacuteonide Massines symphonic ballets. Other works in the season were Les Sylphides and a selection of Russian dances. House full signs were up at every performance, and J.C. Williamsons took note of the enthusiastic audiences and the polished presentation. Kirsovas next creation was Revolution of the Umbrellas, a threeact ballet based on a book by Kjeld Abell, a Danish writer and illustrator, which had its premiere in Sydney at the Conservatorium in February Henry Krips wrote the music and Rachel Cameron, Peggy Sager and Valentin Zeglovsky danced the leading roles. Next month, Kirsovas Hansel and Gretel, described as a choreographic transcription of Humperdincks opera, had its premiere in Sydney, with Edouard Sobishevsky as Hansel, Strelsa Heckelman as Gretel and Sager as the Dawn Fairy. Further additions to the repertoire in 1943 were the first production by an Australian company of Swan Lake Act II, with Sager as Odette, and two new Kirsova works Jeunesse to music of Poulenc and Capriccio to RimskyKorsakovs Capriccio Espagnol. The latter ballet brought Kirsova back to the stage as a dancer, in a stately dance inspired by Velasquezs portrait of the Infanta Margarita of Spain. The first entirely Australian ballet, Sea Legend, was presented by the Borovansky Ballet at the Comedy Theatre in Melbourne in November The scenario and choreography were by Dorothy Stevenson, who also danced the leading female role with Martin Rubinstein as her partner. The decor was by Allan McCulloch, the costumes were by Jean Oberhansli and the music was by Esther Rofe, arranger in the ColgatePalmolive Radio Unit in Sydney. She had written the score of Sea Legend in London in Rofe, who contributed a number of significant scores to the ballet repertoire, was a precocious musician who began composing at the age of seven. She joined the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra at 14 and she had several works performed in Melbourne before she went to the Royal College of Music in London when she was Her fellowstudents there included the Australian composers Miriam Hyde and Peggy GlanvilleHicks. Sea Legend became a popular item in the Borovansky repertoire and in London in 1948 it became the first ballet created by an Australian in Australia to be taken into the repertoire of an overseas company the International Ballet. Williamsons offer support Kirsova is said to have been offered financial backing by J.C.Williamsons, but she rejected it. She had remained independent as director and choreographer since she formed her company and she was not prepared to become just a salaried producer, director and creator of ballets. Williamsons turned to Borovansky, who had sown the seeds for the formation of a permanent company, and he accepted their backing. Borovansky offered fulltime employment and Kirsova, unable to match the challenge, lost many of her best dancers. After seasons in Melbourne and Adelaide, the Kirsova Ballet gave its last professional performance in Brisbane in May When the end came Kirsova was rehearsing four new works for a Sydney season. One of them was an Australiana ballet, Waltzing Matilda, with music commissioned from the young principal oboist of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, Charles Mackerras. In the month when the end came for the Kirsova Ballet a Borovansky company of 40 went to Adelaide, with contracts for 13 weeks, plus options. A triumphant season opened with Frederick Ashtons Faccedillaade, the Grieg Fantasy, Sigrid and Les Sylphides. The company eventually toured Australia from Perth to Sydney and Hobart to Brisbane, and then New Zealand. In Melbourne in 1944 Laurel Martyn became the first Australian to dance titlerole in Giselle. In 1947 Kirsova left Australia to live in Paris with her second husband, an official of UNESCO, and Australia lost an important link with the Ballets Russes and the great days of the Imperial Russian Ballet, with whose stars she had trained. Old musical shows keep the theatres open Running theatres was particularly difficult in Australia during the Second World War because the principal sources of shows and artists were far across dangerous seas in the USA and London. J.C.Williamsons, however, had a Gilbert and Sullivan company with firstrate stars in the country, and it had storehouses full of material from its past musical successes. It revived them with wellloved artists and new theatregoers received an education in the hit shows of the 1920s and 1930s. Marie Bremner was again the bewitched captive of the Red Shadow in The Desert Song. Strella Wilson once again played the hostess of the White Horse Inn. Gladys Moncrieff, at last recovered from the injuries she suffered in a car accident in 1938, returned to the stage in October 1942 in The Maid of the Mountains. She was left with a limp but it was not noticeable on the stage, and her personality, style and voice was still enchanting, according to the tenor Max Oldaker. Williamsons took Oldaker out of the Gilbert and Sullivan company to be Moncrieffs costar in The Maid of the Mountains and her next revival, The Merry Widow, in January Moncrieff also sang in Katinka, Rio Rita and Viktoria and Her Hussar before the war ended. Like many entertainers, she also sang for Australian forces at home and in New Guinea. In Sydney, where there was a shortage of theatres, J.C.Williamsons experimented at the Theatre Royal in 1944 by presenting plays at 30 p.m. and musicals at 8 p.m. In May 1944 members of Actors Equity went on strike against nonunion labour in the firms productions. The contracted principals kept shows going without a chorus or smallpart players. Gladys Moncrieff, a nonunionist and a nonstriker, was strongly criticised. The federal Minister for Labour and Social Services, E.J. Holloway, was accepted as arbitrator of the dispute. He gave the strikers what they wanted, and the principle of a closed shop was established in the theatre and accepted even by the Tait brothers. Moncrieff was taken onto Equitys federal council and she remained a member of the union even in retirement. Amateur theatre keeps the flag of drama flying At the beginning of the Second World War the New Theatre League in Sydney maintained its pacifist stance, following the Moscow line which condemned the war as phoney. In 1940 the leagues production of Rupert Lockwoods No Conscription involved it in a censorship case with the federal government. Federal and state police later confiscated the leagues files and a number of scripts. The Communist Party was banned in mid1940 under wartime emergency powers and New Theatre closed in Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth. The Sydney and Melbourne groups survived underground until the German invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 changed public opinion and New Theatres attitude to the war. The ban on the Communist Party was lifted to late 1941 and its membership swelled and the New Theatre flourished. The New Theatre League in Sydney staged a popular political revue, Id Rather be Left, in 1941, and it presented programs of sketches and songs in military camps and hospitals around Sydney."

        "text": "ECHIDNAS IN THE HIGH COUNTRY BY GORDON GRIGG, LYN BEARD MIKE AUGEE DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES OF ALL AUSTRALIAS 150 OR SO native mammals, only the Shortbeaked Echidnas Tachyglossus aculeatus have a distribution that can be said to be Australiawide. They are found in deserts, wet and dry sclerophyll forests, rainforests and heathlands. They are even seen in the high country of the Australian Alps. This remarkable range of habitats does not fit well with the usual stereotype of Echidnas as primitive, egglaying holdovers from the earliest days of mammalian evolution. One would expect a living fossil to survive only in an isolated habitat to which it was specifically adapted. To be widespread and even common in such a diversity of habitats must require a great range of physiological and behavioural skills. We wondered if their secret was advanced adaptation or primitive plasticity. In the traditional manner of comparative zoologists, we decided to approach a general question by looking at an extreme. The Australian Alps, above the snowline, provide an extreme habitat, and we knew that Echidnas could be found there. Crosscountry ski enthusiasts told us of seeing Echidnas out and about in the middle of winter, poking about in the snow, and there was even a reliable report of one within a few metres of the summit of Mt Kosciusko. Such observations might be considered a bit unusual for a fox or a possum, but they begged further investigation for an animal often accused of primitive thermoregulation, heterothermy and incomplete homeothermy. Of course one explanation for such sightings could be that the individual Echidnas were outside their normal winter range, perhaps stranded at higher altitudes to which they had wandered during the warmer months. Alternatively Echidnas might live there year round, spending the winter under the snow and emerging from time to time, a pattern reminiscent of mammalian hibernators. But they couldnt do that One of us M.Augee had frequently stated that Echidnas are not hibernators. It was there in blackandwhite, in scientific journals. That conclusion had been reached because captive Echidnas would only enter torpor reluctantly. In early studies carried out at Sydney University by H. Wardlaw in 1915, most Echidnas that did enter torpor died. Besides, the mating season is usually stated to be in JulyAugust mid winter, a most inconvenient time to be in hibernation There were a few anecdotal reports of Echidnas found in a lethargic state in the wild during winter one reported to have been dug out by earthmoving equipment, but no field data where actual body temperatures had been measured. We felt that the only convincing data would be that collected in the field and the only way to collect such data would be by radiotracking see box. So we applied to the Australian Research Council for funds to solve the puzzle. In preparing this application we found very little in the literature about the biology of Echidnas in the field. The lack of field studies is probably related to the difficulty of relocating Echidnas and the impossibility of trapping them. The obvious technique to use was telemetry, employing modern, implantable, longlived, temperaturesensitive transmitters that are small enough to be easily tolerated by an animal the size of an Echidna. But first to find some Echidnas in the alpine habitat. We put out the word amongst the staff of Kosciusko National Park KNP that we particularly wanted animals from the highestridges, as well as a control group lower down in the WastePoint or Jindabyne area below the snowline. Meanwhile the grant had been obtained and laboratory work began at SydneyUniversity, with Grigg and Beard perfecting the techniques of implanting transmitters within the peritoneal body cavity.Whenever possible we went to KNP in the hope of finding Echidnas ourselves. As luck would have it, the very first animal that turned up in KNP was in a perfect spot for the study. Early in 1987John Whittaker, while delivering skitrail poles to Prussian Plain at 1,720 metres elevation on the crest of Ramshead Range southwest of Perisher, captured a tancoloured female weighing about three kilograms. We implanted a transmitter and released her at the exact site of capture. The weather was warm as she crawled out of the opened sack and took a couple of hesitant steps onto the snowgrass. After sniffing the air she hastily burrowed into the soft earth. Although designated E10 Echidna number ten, this was the first animal released in the Kosciusko study area. Over the next few weeks we plotted the position andmonitored the body temperature of E10 as she moved aboutPrussian Plain. We were pleased that she remained there and did not head down into one of the valleys. By now we also had two other Echidnas with transmitters E11 and E13 at Waste Point on the shore of Lake Jindabyne altitude 1,000 metres and another E15 at Rennix Gap 1,580 metres. We also came by a female E12 from Dead Horse Gap, another highaltitude location, and released her onto Prussian Plain after implanting a transmitter. Now we had three animals above and two below the normal snowline, and were ready to establish the summer patterns of behaviour and body temperature before the weather turned cold. IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN FROM STUDIES OF Echidnas in captivity that body temperatures vary on a daily basis, and we soon found this to be true in our summer field study. Most mammals have a small daily variation of a degree or so, being warmer when active and cooler when at rest. We found the Echidnas in KNP to vary daily by 68degreeC. The pattern set by E10 on Prussian Plain in those early weeks turned out to be typical. She was active all day, foraging for small black ants by digging along the edge of fallen timber and under slumps of snowgrass, with a body temperature of 3234degreeCregardless of the weather. Soon after daylight had faded she would hole up for the night in a suitable retreat a hollow log, under a rock, in a disused burrow or, as we observed several times, under a convenient clump of snowgrass. Shortly thereafter, as the lengthening times between pulses from the radio transmitter deep within her showed, body temperature began to fall, quite slowly, as she rested for the night. In these latitudes Echidnas tend to be late risers, avoiding the chill of early morning, so the minimal body temperatures at this time of year were measured between 9 and 10 am and were typically 2527degreeC. When E10 emerged and became active again, body temperature rose rapidly sometimes associated with basking in the sun but more certainly associated with heat produced from muscular activity. Sometimes, when Prussian Plain was swept with wind and rain, she would stay in her retreat and cool further for a day or two before reemerging to forage and warm up, body temperature always returning to 3234degreeC. This was typical pattern during the summer months for all our animals at KNP, and the field data agreed pretty much with conclusions from captive animals, going back to the pioneering work of Prof. C.J. Martin in Melbourne in 1902, that body temperature in Echidnas is highly variable for mammals. To us, following the animals about in their natural habitat, it looked to be a very sensible, energysaving pattern, rather than one suggestive of poor thermoregulatory abilities associated with a primitive animal. We quickly realised how much more data we could obtain and how much extra sleep we might get if we had an automatic sampling system that could gather data overnight. So we invented and deployed a couple of weatherproof systems to record body and ambient temperatures at preset times during the night onto cassette tape see box. It was not until the first apparent disaster in the study that the full potential of these boxes the system was enclosed in a large polypropylene box was realised. At Easter we returned, expecting to turn on the receiver in the vicinity of the last position of an animal and to hear the usual beepdotted linebeepdotted linebeep on the appropriate frequency and at the usual rate. Echidnas seemed to have wellestablished home ranges and were always in the same general area. But when we got together at lunch time Mike Augee, who had gone up to Prussian Plain to locate E10, was pessimistic. He had picked up the signal as expected but it was coming in slowly, with a full 5 seconds between beats. That equated to 3degreeC, which was close to ambient temperature, and Mikes gloomy conclusion was that the animal was dead. However, he had not been able to locate the carcass as the long interval between signals made it hard to get a fix. It did seem to be off Prussian Plain, amongst dense snow gum saplings on the steep southern escarpment overlooking the Bullocks Flat skitube terminal far below. We discussed the possibilities, including predation a fox perhaps and death from exposure. The first snow had not yet fallen but it had been very cold in the mountains. Maybe the Echidnas in the high country really were only strays, at the edge of survival, and this one had just not made the grade. With still a few hours left until nightfall, Grigg set off to Prussian Plain to find EIt was a quick trip over now familiar terrain to a rock cairn at the southern edge of the plain, overlooking the Thredbo River. After a patient search and a lot of scrambling through thick undergrowth on the precipitous slope, the source of the signal was located under a rock at the base of a large sunbleached stump. It was typical for an Echidna retreat and there seemed to be every likelihood that E10 had entered there of her own free will. But was she still alive Telemetry pulses still suggested nearambient temperature. Perhaps the animal was alive and in torpor Here was an exciting problem, but we were committed toleave for Sydney the next day. We needed some way to keep track of the animals body temperature until we could return. The solution was obvious set up a box to take readings not hourly or halfhourly, as we had been doing to make overnight records, but every eight hours to spin out the cassette tape for a couple of weeks until our return. So we climbed again to Prussian Plain early the following morning carrying all the necessary equipment. The sky was blue but it had been damp and cold overnight. On reaching the crest we hurriedly checked the signal. It was more rapid. The animal was now warm It took only 1 seconds for 10 beats, compared to the 45 seconds the previous afternoon. Far from being dead, she had now warmed up. The Echidna story was also hotting up Periodic and rapid warmups from torporare characteristic of hibernating mammals. Were Echidnashibernators too While it was not a sure bet, the odds were changing. We needed more data. We set up the box to record the body temperature every eight hours for the next 15 days and secured the lid down with a large rock gales are the norm on the Ramshead Range at this time of year. Fifteen days later in early May we returned and went straight to Prussian Plain. Yes, she was torpid again, and she had moved. But she had moved to the northern side of the ridge out of range of the carefully placed recording box Murphys Law applies especially to field studies. Our two other highcountry Echidnas, E12 and E15, were also torpid and so was one of the Echidnas in the control group well below the snowline beside Lake Jindabyne. Torpor was beginning to look like a normal event for Echidnas. Only E13 wa still active. The four torpid Echidnas stayed put, with low body temperatures, for the four days of this field trip. We had only two recording boxes, so we left one at the new location of E10 and left the second to record data from another torpid animal."

        "text": "Wouldnt you know this old girl said aloud in the heat of the midday mall. Wouldnt you just know Daisy could have been sitting there, for all she knew. Kathleen kept noddling through those last days before Ronald died, the horrible secret of his illness huddled within, unable to turn to the children, lost between voyages in her own port. She drank the last of her coffee angrily, oneswig Kath, and shook her head to free it from all that unhappy stuff. There was a busker under the shopfront just nearby, strumming guitar and singing mournfully about the inland. Cant sing like my boy, she thought. Not a patch on him. Just briefly she wondered what Brain would think if he knew shed come back. But she didnt want him to know, didnt want to push herself in where she wasnt wanted. Anyway, she couldnt find him even if. He was somewhere around, up in the hills. The busker was packing up his guitar and moving off now. She felt sorry for him. No talent, she muttered to herself, poor kid. He was moving across to the people at the next table, his cap held ready, hoping for a handout. Got to give the poor coot something, she told Daisy, fumbling in her handbag for loose change. Daisy, you should have heard Brain in his palmy days. She blinked and Daisy vanished. But she went on, talking to air. There was no doubt Brians voice was better than his fathers. As the kids grew beyond the stage of scowling shame while father insisted on running through his repertoire of ballads, Kathleen was delighted when occasionally the boy joined them at the piano and sent rich true notes soaring about the living room. He was playing the lead in a school production of The Gondoliers and needed the practice. Although he was only fourteen his voice had changed without noticeable cracking and had the mature tenor assurance of a man. The year before she had sat with Ronald at a school concert watching their son as he sang a bracket of Irish songs for Saint Patricks day. Up there on stage, spotlighted, with his still unfuzzed face, he looked younger than he was, but when his voice, ripe and full and strong, lofted Macushla and Mother Machree to the soaring roof of the hired theatre, that stunning opposition of school shirt and matinee idol voice had the crowd cheering and pulping their palms. God has been good to him, the Brothers said in the foyer at interval. He has a great gift. You heard what Brother said, Kathleen repeated many times later, absorbed in savouring the words. A great gift. Your father and I are very proud. Ive made the second fifteen, Brian said. He could think of nothing else. Nothing else, she had complained to Daisy. The one thing he could do really well and never worked at. Oh it was a pleasant enough dotted line hobby, I suppose. But he sang to please himself. Thats what its for, Mum, he used to say. Theres more to life than that. She could hear him now, taking a pair of sparkling eyes to the delight of parents driven down the old Sandgate Road for school play night, encored to a reprise, sotto voce, and feel still the tears of pride that made her look away and squeeze Ronalds fevered hand. Had she but world enough and time, she reflected in the peopled barrenness of the mall, she would invent the ultimate preservative for those makeshift, rough and ready, shortlived moments. Instinctively she put her hand to her face, touching the remnants of what time had left her. She was falling apart. Cutting loose. Doing the unexpected. Kathleen craved some moment of consequence in what had become a treadmill existence as she steered her children through adolescence. I dont count, she had written to Daisy still sweating it out in Charco, those childhood traumas of measles, mumps and chickenpox. Or the mindless foodhunt, the cooking, eating and expelling the stuff just so the whole damn cycle can start again. Hey, thats a laugh, isnt is I dont place much stress on rows at the office, promotion, retirement. Wheres the buzz She had made room for one of those moments the year after Ronald died, tugged by sentiment, perhaps, or simply the need to flee the mundane while her children were safe in boarding school. Amazing herself, she took a weeks leave and went back to the town of the east wind, flying in where once, eleven years before, she had arrived by interisland trader. When the plane came down over Guadalcanal, the jungled heights of the island, fold upon fold of uncontrolled vegetable growth, seized and choked her mind. She saw Ronald, or imagined she could see him, clambering, hacking, crawling through implacable forest to sate an obsession. His thin white figure in starched drill and toupee, all the tropic duds, kept vanishing and reappearing, heading ever towards what she guessed to be the summit of Mount Makarakombou. Nothing had changed. A lot had changed. In the still familiar bar of the hotel on Mendana Avenue the past swept in. She had told no one she was going, not even the children, and now layer upon layer of time peeled her naked. In the harbour, in the islands, in the Spanish seas, Ronalds voice sang in the highest reaches of her skull as she walked during each of the next few days past Government House and the Secretariat to the Guadalcanal Club, where she rediscovered the junior administrative officer, redder, stouter, and now an assistant secretary. There was not a kiss in sight. Have I changed that much She resented the bleating sound as she jogged his memory. Married man these days, he countered, selfprotectively. Three beaut kids. Youll meet the wife later on. Shes dropping by for a drink. God, Kathleen, what a turn up, eh Why didnt you let anyone know you were coming We could have turned it on for you. He was convivial with a gin sling. Not many of the old team left, Im one of the few who stayed on. You knew about Ronald, I suppose. Yes. Sorry, Kath. Always liked the old boy. Do you know dotted line just a few days before you left, after the store was sold, he told me what happened that time he went missing. Kathleen found herself staring into her glass, afraid to urge. Yes, the assistant secretary said, he reached the top all right. And he managed to cut his name and the date on a boulder up there. Its true. Went up to see it for myself a year later. It was on the way back he got bushed. Bad show, really. All of it. Crazily she believed then that it was Ronald she had seen from the spyhole of the descending plane, living and reliving his moment of glory in that steaming wilderness of tree and vine. Nostalgia made her want to weep again, even after a year, especially after a year, grabbed by the stupidity of his pluckiness, whose driving folly she had never understood. She finished her drink, leaving the assistant secretary sitting there, and walked up the hill to the house on the ridge. The temptation to knock, to court invitation, jabbed as she surveyed the familiar lines of veranda, the garden denser but much the same, brilliant with scarlet blossom on the poinciana trees. She turned and looked across to Savo Island, unchanged in unchanging waters, her back exposed now to the pointed words that still flew about those rooms. She winced under ghost barbs. If she could, she would have redrawn the maps of those lost times, overcome by sadness and its high dingo howl across emptied, flattened desertscapes. She thought of her children and their kid faces became mnemonics for domestic detail she now dug up, gently sifting earth and sand, to lay each moment out as if it were a bowl, vase, tile, of simple but searing beauty. History was more nostalgia than facet. Correction, than fact an aggregation of personal moments with their sickening lurches of love and hate. As she sat alone that night in the dining room of the Hotel Mendana, the black waiter asked curiously and, she imagined, reprovingly, Where is your husband She looked up and smiled and took her time responding. Where is your wife Giggling, he backed away, all stumbling feet and flaphands, from this cheeky waite. She went on picking at her omelette, wondering if, for Ronalds sake, she should have mentioned he had left his mark on the summit of one of their highest peaks. Where, after all, was her husband The best thing, she supposed, about that week was knowing no one knew where she was. The boundary lines of protocol were still drawn on the island, though by shakier hands, and the supper party the assistant secretary organised for her at his home was a terrible mix of stiff and hearty, through all of which the secretarys wife regarded her with sharp and curious eyes nourished by the gossip that still, after all this time, gave transfusions of energy. Nothing, should she explain loudly over the canapeacutes, beyond sweat and arms and unwanted kisses in the sticky afternoons of those three lost weeks The temptation to say loudly, clearly, There was no puspus, my dear, shocking with the unacceptable pidgin obscenity, almost overcame her. A nauseous wave swept her up and out to the bathroom where she was noisily sick for quite some time. Ive cut and run, she wrote on a card for Daisy. The card showed native huts and women in brightly coloured Mother Hubbards. Wasnt going to tell a soul but Ive decided cutting and running is what its all about. I think the kids have inherited that gene from me Got your card, Daisy remembered when they next met years later. You old devil, you. Daisy was without envy, never said half your luck or wish Id been there, never stained the moment. Im lucky, she always said. Youre lucky. Watched any telly lately If you have youll know youre lucky. Daisy put her right, letting her see the brevity of the program, the limited number of items, the transience of applause. Heres to you, Daise Cheers Lets go back a little, she said to Daisy, mumbling away to herself in the mall. I want to tell you about them, about the kids. Your turn next week. That Brain she said. That Shamrock Now yearning for the confidences, the shared comfort of age, she would write Daisy long letters full of plaint. Goodbye. Goodbye to those years in which she huddled in the same house, always the same, while son and daughter flapdoodled their way through Mickey Mouse humanities courses on straight Cs. Herself unsurprised, still on the secretarial game but translated, now she also had put a course or two behind her, into something a little more meaningful as a parliamentary worker, learning to keep her too ready lips closed, ploughing ahead to retirement down the track with only the occasional flirtation in sight. Dollops of carelessly dropped, scented dross, she told herself and also another elderly prospective escort who promptly, promptly dotted line and, my God, there was a further not so fragrant deposit littering the fence marge. So who cares cared She had the kids, no longer kids, to worry about in the bleak evenings, wondering how straight Cs and humanities establish themselves and their holders in the expanding early sixties except in protest flings with mounted police or in batonbeaten greenie marches. There had been narrow squeaks with alternative communes seductively beckoning. Shamrock had taken a year off to find herself. Where will you look, dear Kathleen had asked mildly. Oh Jesus, you do crap me off I lived through that, Kathleen admitted, through all that sulky acrimony, that impudent flouncing, until Shamrock hitched her way to a commune outside Mackay, an outwardly decorously run family group that, according to a chastened and returned daughter, was organised to punishment point by a failed law student with stunning connections in the state judiciary."

        "text": "OVERVIEW OF EVENTS After seeing the advertisements for The Dawson Chair and Smokys interviews on TV, I made further enquiries and subsequently spent 3,349 of my life savings to purchase the chair because I was in a great deal of pain at the time and Smoky spoke of the benefits both he and his wife Dot had received from the chair. Smokys enthusiasm influenced me to make that decision to buy my chair. Initially, the chair functioned very well from the date of delivery, 81192 25893, and from then on my problems began. Because I have been a buyer of electrical goods for Myer Northland 197279, I have had experience dealing with manufacturers on behalf of Myer and also with customers, their repairs, and complaints. So when my chair developed problems, to give the Dawson Chair Company the opportunity to rectify my complaints, which at that stage was Footrest Massager, 25893, not working and heater pad overheating, unusual loud vibration noise in frame, and a loose wire that Graham wanted to repair but I would not allow him to do that because he has no qualifications to do so. Graham Guthred then took the chair from my home, 8993, and returned it 161093, a total of 5 weeks and 4 days plus the 2 weeks that I could not have the use of the foot heater and massager. It was winter months at that time and that is my main reason for choosing to have heaters and massagers in 3 areas, foot, mid back and upper back, because that is my needs because my back is icy cold at times and warmth helps. asteriskOn 13th September, 1993, I rang Craig to make sure Graham had reported to him my complaints and suggested that a person about my weight, 15 12 stone, check the frame for vibration. I have asked three times for details of what was done to the chair because now I have the same problems and more. Over the summer months I noticed that the heaters were very hot but attributed that to the high 30 degree summer temperatures. Because my spine can be really cold on a hot summers day, I still needed to use the heaters, so to be able to bear them I put a brocade bedspread on the chair so as not to get burnt, as there is every possibility that could happen after 3 to 5 minutes with the footrest on and only slightly longer in the upper back where the padding is flattened. Also I cannot sit on the chair now for 2 reasonsThe upper back massager hurts that area and that is an area I paid an extra 500 in my effort to get relief which I did for a while when the padding was thicker. The control for the area has an intermittent fault of going to 34 of an hour. It should be approximately 20 minutes. Reported that to Graham 1511 Your use and care manual makes a point about thickness of the luxurious cushioning at point I now observe that the vinyl on the main seat part is saggy possibly due to the seating material flattening. LiftRecline Mechanism completely ceased to function when I was on it on 28th April, I was in the recline position at the time and wanted to come up to the lift position, however, there was a loud clunking noise and the control completely stopped. I have now discovered the reason why, and that is the WELDING that should hold the chair to the frame has completely broken away and two holes remain where it has been. I have not sat on the chair since and will not be able to do so again. I have written two letters to Cynthia to pass on to the relevant persons. One was dated 16th April and 30th April. Since writing them I have also discovered that where my head rests the vinyl has gone hard. In other places it has gone greygreen or pink. Is the vinyl used suitable to be used on this medical chair or is it only suitable for lounge suites. Because of the serious nature of my complaints and the chair not performing up to their claims I have undergone a great deal of stress wondering what to do about my problem as to having invested 3,00 and having these problems is not the way I want to go because each time it leaves my home it has the potential for more damage. The length of time away. The uncertainty of what might go wrong next and if I have to pay for freight which is expensive as I only receive a Disability Support Pension. I also live alone and to pack the chair into the box would be very difficult for me so to help me understand what options I have I rang up a Legal Advice Service. My supporters feel that the Investigators may be able to help me with my complaint with my Smoky Dawson Chair are as follows Staff member at the Office of Mrs. Jan Wade, AttorneyGenerals Dept. Victoria because there maybe other people who have similar disabilities and have purchased this chair. I first contacted Mr. Ian Pugh at the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs, Product Safety 03 242 Ian only becomes involved if there is a recall of products, however, he put me in contact with the Product Safety Officer for Victoria, Davis Moss at the Office of Fair Trading Melbourne 03 602 He suggested media coverage and gave his reasons why he thought was an option open to me. Ian Pugh also put me in touch with the Approval Investigation Engineer at the Office of the Chief Electric Inspector 03 691 4470, Facsimile 03 691 4455 as my concern was the electrical safety of the chair as I could not find any reference to the Australian Standards. David came to my home on Monday 6th June 94 and spent 40 minutes here looking at the chair and taking photographs of parts of interest to his area of expertise. Before he came he rang his counterpart in N.S.W. to ask if they knew of any problems with this chair, and the answer was, Yes. The comment was poor design, engineering, workmanship were the main comments. It must have been very important for him to come after Ian Pugh and David Moss have spoken with him as normally he does not come to persons such as myself. Pat Kenna pronounced Kennar Technical Sales Manager for C.I.G. 03 287 8209, Facsimile 03 287 8476, Mobile 018 550 I rang C.I.G. as that was the only place I could think to ask about welding. Pat came 2 hours after my call and his comments were poor design, engineering, workmanship. I asked Pat about his position and he said, he is the sort of person that the Dawson Chair Company need to consult. Pat can write a report if required but is limited because he has done this as a service to me and the community. It was not part of his role for C.I.G. Jeff Geddings, Barrister Solicitor, West Heidelberg Community Legal Service Inc. When I took my draft letter to him from which he edited to send a letter of my request for a refund of 3,349, I mentioned to him my concerns about the Smoky Dawson Chair and said I felt like alerting the investigators, and he said why dont you. My appointment with him was 10th May, At that time I felt that I should give the Dawson Chair Company time to respond to that Legal letter, but they have chosen not to do so, instead I received a letter from them dated 26th May 94 offering only to service the chair. 12 Manton St Heidelberg. 3084 03 4597761 15th November 1992 Dear Craig, Graham Guthred has delivered my chair and I am very pleased that I ordered the three heaters and massagers as well as having the chair on casters. Since I ordered and received my chair Community Services Victoria have sent me information that I could be eligible for sales tax exemption so after I contacted the sales tax office I contacted Graham and he said, The the chair was already sales tax exempt but at what rate he didnt say, So what I need to know is at what rate of sales tax is the exemption and what would have been the full invoice price before the exemption My Invoice Nos are 10180 09813 My order was Square Medium Lift Chair l699 Three heaters 250 each 750 Three massagers 250 each 750 Castors 40 Delivery 100 . 3339 Could you please send me your guaranteewarranty and any other instructions that I may need as I dont have those details at the moment. I am using my chair six times a day for treatments as well as a normal lounge chair. I would appreciate an early reply to this letter. Thanking you Yours sincerely Sybil J. Smith 20th January 1993 Dear Graham, I have now had my chair three months and I thought that you would be interested to know that I am finding relief from the constant pain that I was in. I use it constantly and you might say I live on it. With the problems I have I am very pleased that I decided to have the heaters and massagers installed where I did so my intuitive feelings were right for me. Because I have no help to move the chair I am pleased that I thought to have the chair put on castors and that makes it easy to move. And finally I often drop off to sleep and I find that very healing and refreshing also. I dont expect miracles from having the chair but any improvement in my health is a bonus point. Till we meet again Sybil Heidelberg 3084 03 457 7120 16th April 94 Dear Cynthia, I am writing this letter to let your company know that Graham Guthred called at my home on the 11th April and it was decided not to send my footrest part of the chair back to Sydney at this stage because since I reported 1st April the fault with the massager and heater the massager had started to work again, however, the heater is excessive in heat. Graham left at 4 pm but at 6 pm when I wanted to use the chair the massager would not work and hasnt since. Would you please send direct to me details of the work that was carried out on my chair when you had it at the factory approx. 13th September to 11th October I am very distressed with the problems. I am having with my chair as I have invested my savings in it and I have been very grateful with the results I have got from it to date. I do need all the help I can have from the Dawson Chair Company and Im sure I am just unlucky that my chair has problems. I also showed Graham that the Vinyl has colour changes and he made note of that. At the present moment my thoughts are that it should be returned to Sydney however I need it more than ever right at this moment as I am under a great amount of stress and find it difficult to cope with life. Yours sincerely Ms Sybil J. Smith 12 Manton St Heidelberg 3084 03 457 7120 30th April 94 Dear Cynthia, Further to my letter that I wrote to you dated 16th April 94 advising you the problems I was having with my Dawson Chair since the 1st April. I now need to inform the Company that the liftingreclining mechanism ceased to function on Thursday 28th April just to add further to my problems with the chair. Question What is the maximum weight of a person that the lifting mechanism is designed to lift"

        "text": "PROSPECTS FOR MODIFYING THE BIOSYNTHESIS OF STARCH IN GRAINS Les Copeland Department of Agricultural Chemistry The University of Sydney NSW 2006 Summary This paper presents an enzymologists view of the prospects of using recombinant DNA technology to modify the yield and quality of starch in cereal grains. The biosynthesis of starch is discussed briefly in several stages the supply of substrates, the synthesis of the glucosyl donor ADPglucose and polymerization reactions, including the formation of branches. Aspects of starch biosynthesis in cereals that may be targeted for modification are considered. It is concluded that much still has to be learnt of the basic biochemistry of starch formation in plants, especially regulation of the metabolic processes concerned, before recombinant DNA technology may be applied to modify the yield and quality of starch in a planned way. Key words ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase, enzymes, mutants, starch biosynthesis, starch branching enzyme, starch synthase, transformation. The development of technology for manipulating genetic material outside of an organism and for carrying out genetic recombination in a directed way has, without doubt, been among the most significant recent advances in biological sciences. Using this technology, foreign DNA may be used to transform i.e. genetically engineer plant cells so that the introduced DNA integrates stabily with the genome of the host cell and is replicated and passed on to progeny cells. Transformation of maize has recently been reported using the Agrobacterium system Gould et al. 1991 and also particle gun techniques GordonKamm et al. 1990 and it is reasonable to anticipate similar achievements with other cereals in the foreseeable future. Thus, it is timely to consider how recombinant DNA technology could be applied to benefit the production of cereal crops and cereal products. In this paper, I present an enzymologists views of the prospects for modifying the biosynthesis of starch in cereal grains. Pathway of starch biosynthesis It is pertinent to discuss briefly the pathway leading to the formation of starch before considering possibilities for modifications. For a more detailed description of the process, the reader is referred to review articles by Preiss 1982, 1988. Several aspects of starch biosynthesis need to be considered the location of the pathway in plant cells, the supply of substrates, the synthesis of the glucosyl donor ADPglucose, polymerization reactions, including the formation of branches, and regulation of the various steps. Plant cells have a high degree of structural organization in that they have a number of clearly defined subcellular compartments which are associated with specific metabolic functions. Compartmentation of enzymes and metabolites is important in metabolic regulation, especially in plant cells. The controlled transport of metabolites across membrane barriers can regulate the availability of substrates, and hence the activity of enzymes. In leaves, starch is a major product of photosynthesis and is enclosed in the chloroplasts. Leaf starch is a transient storage reserve of photosynthetically reduced carbon, but in many plant species it also acts as a longer term reserve which is mobilized during grain filling. In nonphotosynthetic tissues, starch is deposited inside amyloplasts, which are organelles closely related to chloroplasts. The source of substrates for starch synthesis is sucrose, which is the main form in which carbon is translocated in the phloem from the leaves to nonphotosynthetic tissues. Sucrose is taken up by nonphotosynthetic cells and converted in the cytoplasmic compartment to an intermediate which is transported into the amyloplasts Figure 1. The nature of this intermediate, that is whether it is a hexoseor triosephosphate, has not been clearly established. Triose phosphates, but not hexose phosphates, are transported readily across the chloroplast membrane, whereas amyloplasts from pea roots are able to translocate hexosephosphates as well triosephosphates Heldt et al. 1991. There is also some indirect evidence which suggests that hexosephosphates may be taken up by amyloplasts in the endosperm of wheat and maize Keeling et al. 1988, Tyson and apRees 1988. Clarification of this aspect of starch biosynthesis is needed to provide a better understanding of how carbon is partitioned between starch and other metabolic processes. As indicated in the scheme in Figure 1, the metabolite taken up by the amyloplasts is converted to glucose1phosphate and, in turn, to ADPglucose, which is now generally regarded to be the donor of the glucosyl units incorporated into a14 glucan links of starch. Branch points are introduced by the formation of a16 links in a separate reaction. Identifying the reactions in the biosynthetic pathway is only the first step to understanding how starch is formed. The enzymes concerned need to be characterized with regard to their physicochemical and kinetic properties and genetics. The formation of ADPglucose from glucose1phosphate is catalyzed by the enzyme ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase, which has been studied extensively from photosynthetic and nonphotosynthetic tissues. These studies have indicated that ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase is likely to have an important role in the fine control of how much starch is synthesized. Activity of the enzyme can increase or decrease in response to changes in the concentration of certain metabolites, which act as signals that reflect the metabolic status of the tissue. In plant tissues, 3phosphoglycerate is the most effective activator and phosphate the main inhibitor of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase. cDNA clones of ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase from rice endosperm and spinach leaf has been prepared, which should facilitate genetic studies of this enzyme. However, the finding that ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase from various plant tissues, including maize endosperm, is made up of two dissimilar subunits, which appear to be the products of separate genes, may complicate such studies. Starch synthase catalyzes the incorporation of glucose units from ADPglucose into a14 glucan links of amylose and amylopectin. Multiple forms of the enzyme have been shown to occur in plant tissues. For example, maize endosperm contains two soluble and two granulebound forms of starch synthase. The soluble starch synthases differ in their activities towards amylopectin and may be the products of different genes. The relationship between the granulebound and soluble starch synthases is not clear, although it is likely that at least some of the bound activity is due to entrapment of the soluble enzyme. The nature of the product formed may be influenced by the relative proportions of the different starch synthases and by the amount of bound and soluble activity. Granulebound starch synthase has been suggested to be important in the synthesis of amylose, which is the less soluble component of starch. As grains mature, more of the starch synthase activity becomes bound and this is coincident with increased synthesis of the amylose. Moreover, the endosperm of the waxy maize mutant, which contains no amylose, has greatly reduced activity of granule bound starch synthase. Starch branching enzymes introduce a16 links into the glucan which lead to the formation of branches in the structure. Although the mode of action of starch branching enzyme is not well understood, it is thought unlikely that amylopectin is formed by the addition of branches to a completed amylose molecule. Rather, the synthesis of amylopectin may involve the concerted action of starch synthase and starch branching enzyme, with the branching action taking place after the addition of several glucosyl units by starch synthase. The activity of starch branching enzyme is likely to influence the rate of starch synthase the increased number of nonreducing ends made available by branching in effect increases the concentration of the substrate for starch synthase. Multiple forms of branching enzymes occur in plant cells. At least some of these forms may be distinct proteins, and hence the products of different genes, but this needs further clarification. Mature round pea seeds contain two branching enzymes, one which increases in activity during the early stages of seed development and the other appearing only after the midpoint of development. These two enzymes have been suggested to have different roles in the formation of starch granules. Information on the properties and mode of action of the starch synthases and branching enzymes is still very limited. These enzymes are not easy to study there are difficulties in obtaining preparations free of other interfering enzymes and the assay methods for measuring activity are rather unsophisticated. In particular, much more work needs to be done to clarify the relationship between the multiple forms of the starch synthases and starch branching enzymes, and to determine whether the different forms of the enzymes are involved in the synthesis of different parts of the amylopectin molecule. This should shed light on how the degree of branching of amylopectin and the ratio of amylose to amylopectin are controlled. More knowledge is required of events that take place in the late stages of seed development, when the endosperm cells lose water and become packed with starch. The activities of the biosynthetic enzymes are likely to change markedly under these conditions and this could also have major effects on the nature of the product formed. Genetic modification that could increase yield or alter the quality of the product The following purely speculative remarks suggest aspects of starch biosynthesis in cereals that may prove to be useful targets for modification. Increased yield could be achieved by altering the partitioning of carbon in the plant so that more is directed towards the formation of grain rather than to vegetative growth and increasing biomass. Strategies for increasing the size of the sink for reserves could include increasing the number of seeds established before filling commences, for example by increasing the proportion of partly developed florets present at pollination that eventually produce seeds. In wheat, only 3040 of florets set grain Simmonds 1989. The reasons for this are not understood but the availability of sucrose appears to be only one factor. Evolutionary increases in the grain weight of wheat have been due mainly to increases in the number of cells in the endosperm and the number of plastids per cell, which have resulted in a greater capacity to accumulate starch Gifford et al. 1984. Although the capacity to accumulate starch is determined genetically, the actual amount of starch synthesized will be influenced by environmental factors that can affect steps in the biosynthetic pathway. Thus, reducing the sensitivity of starch biosynthesis to adverse environmental conditions, such as drought, heat stress, availability of nutrients, etc., may provide another strategy for increasing yield. Modifications to the amounts of the starch biosynthetic enzymes expressed, or to their properties, could bring about changes in the quantity of product as well as its qualities. ADPglucose pyrophosphorylase catalyzes the first unique step in the biosynthetic pathway and changes to the properties of this strategically placed enzyme could provide a way to direct more carbon into starch. Modifying the activities of the starch synthases and branching enzymes could change the molecular size, degree of branching and shape of the components, and hence the solubility of the starch and the form of the granules. However, there are also likely to be effects on the amount of starch accumulated. Before we can follow any of these strategies, we need to know more about starch biosynthesis and its relationship to plant growth and development. A number of naturally occurring mutants with altered patterns of starch accumulation in storage tissues have been characterized in various plant species. Analysis of the genetic changes and their consequent biochemical effects in these mutants will provide a valuable guide to using transformation to make planned modifications to the plant. The effect of changes to the amount of enzymes of starch biosynthesis may be seen by comparing mature seeds of normal maize with those of waxy wx, amylose extender ae and dull du mutants Preiss 1988. The endosperm of normal maize contains approximately 70 of its dry weight as starch, of which 2530 is amylose. In comparison, waxy maize contains no amylose, due to reduced activity of granulebound starch synthase, whereas high amyloseamylopectin ratios occur in amylose extender and dull mutants due to reduced starch synthase IIb ae and starch synthase II and starch branching ezyme IIa du. The endosperm of another mutant, sugary maize su, has much less starch than normal maize but contains more sucrose and approximately 25 of its dry weight as the highly branched phytoglycogen."

        "text": "ROAD TEST Japanese executives Bob Hudson compares the new Nissan Maxima with Toyotas Cressida. BUYERS of midsize sixcylinder luxury sedans have a new name to add to their shopping lists. The car is the Maxima and it comes to Australia as a fullyassembled import from Nissan Motor Company Japan. In this report, weve lined the Maxima up against Toyotas classleading Cressida to see just how much of a challenge this newcomer is likely to be. As well as competing directly with the Cressida and also Mazdas 929 V6i, the Maxima could possibly draw some sales away from the lowerpriced Europeans such as fourcylinder BMWs, Citroens, Peugeots, Saabs and Volvos. The Maxima differs from the Cressida and the 929V6i in that instead of an inline six driving the rear wheels, its powered by an eastwest mounted V6 engine that drives the front wheels. Like Cressida and V6i, the Maxima comes only with automatic transmission. Two Maxima models are available, the M and the TI. Mechanical specifications are basically the same on both models, except that the TIs fourwheel disc brakes are equipped with an abs antilocking system. Other features exclusive to the TI include electricallyadjustable front seats, automatic climate control air conditioning the M has Manual air, fourspoke leather steering wheel, bootlid spoiler and keyless touchpad door locks. The two test cars were the Maxima M and the topspec Cressida glx, hence the considerable price difference in the specification table. The Cressida gl carries a suggested retail price of 34,000 but this doesnt include air conditioning, which in manual form would add around 1800, taking the price of the gl to just over the Maxima M, which costs 35,The Maxima ti costs 39,950 add automatic climate control air to the equivalent 37,500 Cressida glx and you end up with a price of 39,For the extra three hundredodd dollars, the Maxima ti includes antilock braking, electric front seats, the door touchpad system and a rear spoiler, so I guess you would have to say it comes out ahead of the Cressida on valueformoney. Styling and features There are no real styling surprises or innovations in either car. Both have gone for a relatively restrained look and both appear to have borrowed from smaller models in the range, presumably to promote a family image. This is particularly evident in the Cressida, which looks like an enlarged Camry with its very smooth and rounded appearance. The Maxima has more of a European particularly the Saab 900 look about its rear end but succumbed to the family look around the front, which isnt all that different to a Pintara. Of the two, I lean towards the Maxima as looking a little more upmarket and individual, but then its largely a matter of personal taste. Whether you choose to buy a Maxima or a Cressida, there should be no disappointments with the standard of finish. Both test cars displayed high quality paint work and excellent fit of panels, trim and interior and exterior fittings. If anything, the Maxima feels to have the tighter body, its an impression thats enhanced by the solid photo way its onepiece doors close, the complete absence of door frame flexing over uneven surfaces or wind noise past the weatherseals. The Mazda 929 sedans doors also have onepiece outer shells and extend into the roof sides. But though the Cressida doesnt have the same smooth, flush look along the sides, or doors that shut as solidly, its still a very wellbuilt car that fits comfortably into the image expected of a luxury car. I mentioned earlier the features which Maxima M buyers miss out on compared to the ti model, nevertheless the Ms equipment list is still a long one. Major items include power steering, electricallyoperated windows and exterior mirrors, central locking, cruise control, high quality fourspeaker stereo system with power aerial, alloy road wheels and heightadjustable front seat belts. The Cressida gl matches the M on all these features except cruise control. One minor, but annoying omission from both Maxima models is the nonfitment of mudflaps dirt splashes up along the vehicle sides on wet or unsealed surfaces. comfort and space Though both cars have similar overall interior dimensions, differences in seating design and the way the space is divided up alters their suitability in coping with various accommodation requirements. Nissan has restricted front seat travel to offer less front leg room and give more space to those in the back. The Maxima is also better suited to carrying three occupants across the back seat, not because its wider but because the cushion is flatter and the transmission tunnel is smaller than in the Cressida. The Cressida will suit longlegged drivers a little better that the Maxima. Despite the heightadjustable seat and steering wheel, I couldnt get me knee under the Maximas steering wheel to press directly on the brake pedal. This necessity to operate the brake with your foot at an angle can be very tiring during long spells at the wheel. Apart from these restrictions, overall seat comfort rates as very good in both cars. On ride comfort, the Cressida is a clear winner over the Maxima. The Maxima doesnt do anything nasty like bottoming out on large bumps, but it doesnt cope with minor irregularities as well as the Cressida, with more harshness and tyre thumping evident. When it comes to loading the family luggage for a holiday or any reasonably heavy items for that matter Maxima owners will have an easier job as the boot lid extends almost down to bumper level. Cressida owners have to lift items over a fairly high loading lip as theres no cutout panel. Neither car offers the facility of a folding rear seat and neither boot compartment is particularly deep. The Maximas boot scores a little better on overall capacity its wider and deeper than the Cressidas, but not quite as long. behind the wheel As mentioned earlier, the Cressida offers a more comfortable driving position for longlegged drivers. However, people of more modest proportions should be able to find a perfectly suitable driving position in either car. Both provide height adjustment for the drivers seat, affording drivers a good view of the road ahead. Neither car has a steeply sloping bonnet which means the front corners are caption visible from the drivers seat, thus making it easier to judge the front extremities when parking or manoeuvring in confined places. Judging the rear extremities isnt so easy as you cant see the boot lid corners in either car. The Maxima tis boot lid spoiler would be a help in this regard. With one or two minor criticisms, both cars have a good control layout and their instrument panels are clear and legible. In the Maxima its a bit of a stretch for drivers to reach the sound system and ventilation controls and though its power window buttons are where they should be on the drivers door arm rest, some of the buttons are hard to reach because the door pull handle obstructs them. Minor criticism of the Cressida layout includes the turn signal and cruise control levers being confusingly close together glx model, the large transmission tunnel that prevents ideal placement of the left foot rest and the two separate switch panels for the sound system, divided by the ventilation controls. Power steering makes both of these table photo cars easy to park as far as steering effort is concerned, but the Maximas front wheel drive layout results in a larger turning circle, which can sometimes make the difference between turning around in one go or having to make a threepoint turn. on the road Though both engines are virtually the same cubic capacity, the Cressidas double overhead camshaft, four valvesper cylinder inline six puts out considerably more power both quoted engine output and measured power at the driving wheels than the Maximas single camshaft per bank, two valvesper cylinder V6 engine. photo The Maxima would be left behind on performance if it wasnt for its lighter overall mass and the fact that its engine produces maximum torque at much lower engine speeds than the Cressida. As it turned out, the two cars posted similar standing start performance times but the Cressida was noticeably more responsive in its midrange acceleration. The Cressida engine is also a little smoother and quieter than the somewhat raspiersounding V6 in the Maxima. Overall, the Maximas performance rates as strong and satisfying, but the Cressida goes as well or better, with seemingly less effort. The Cressidas performance characteristics can be a definite asset when competing in the luxury class, as buyers of this type of car usually expect maximum smoothness and quietness. There wasnt a great difference in overall fuel consumption between the two cars the heavier Cressida used a bit more fuel around the city and suburbs but proved more economical out on the highway. Both recorded lower overall consumption than you could expect from a current automatic photo Holden or Falcon. Neither of these cars is about to challenge the Europeans on their handling finesse, but at the same time both are generally quite adequate for everyday use, albeit with different characteristics because one is front wheel drive and other rear wheel drive. Not unexpectedly, the front drive Maxima displays considerably more understeer than the Cressida when pushed hard, though its generally well behaved and stable over all types of road surfaces. But the Maximas steering isnt as sharp as it could be, with little feel about what the front wheels are doing and a vagueness in the straight ahead position. The Cressidas steering could also do with less power assistance for a more positive feel out on the open road but didnt have the vagueness of the Maximas steering. The Cressida leans a little more into corners than the Maxima but handles more neutrally and offers a good compromise, considering its more compliant ride. Though the test results show a bit over a cars length difference in stopping distances from 80 kmh, both cars have powerful braking systems with fourwheel discs providing fadefree operation. The Maximas brakes proved effective in quickly reducing speeds for cornering, but the car locked its front wheels too readily under emergency braking tests, preventing any shorter stopping distances. In a rear wheel drive car, with its better mass distribution fronttorear, more braking bias can be directed to the back wheels thus inhibiting front wheel lockup. This was certainly the case in the Cressida jumping on the brakes hard from 80 kmh resulted in all straight line stops with virtually no wheel locking. Both cars have similar automatic transmissions electronically controlled fourspeed units with overdrive, lockup torque converter and power and economy modes. Both operate smoothly, with ratios well matched to the engine performance. The overdrive onoff button is handy when travelling in hilly country or when overtaking to hold the transmission in third gear, but I could survive without the power and economy buttons. While they alter the shift pattern slightly, it makes little difference to overall performance. The Maximas switch actually has three positions Power, Auto and Comfort and I suspect the majority of owners will just leave it in the auto position. servicing Despite having its transmission in the engine bay as well its mounted off the end of the eastwest positioned engine, overall ease of access rates a little better in the Maxima due to the compactness of the V6 engine compared with the Cressidas twincam inline six. Both cars provide satisfactory access for routine checks of fluid levels. The Maximas oil filter is more readily accessible than the Cressidas which is under the exhaust manifold but replacement of the spark plugs on the V6 engine would require a special tool as they sit in deep recesses. Servicing intervals are the same for both cars after the first at 1000 km, maintenance is due at 10,000 km or six monthly intervals with more frequent lubrication services specified for vehicles operating under severe conditions."

        "text": "WHEN THE MICE FAILED TO ARRIVE One afternoon in one of the years when I used to stay at home to mind my son and my daughter and to do the housework while my wife was away at her job, my son was caught in a thunderstorm. The storm broke over my suburb at halfpast three, which is the time when schools are dismissed. I had been alone in the house since halfpast eight that morning, when my children had left for school. All afternoon I had watched from my windows while the clouds gathered. I had thought of the storms that broke every few days in summer over the city where I had lived from my fifth year to my tenth year. That city was a hundred miles inland from the suburb of Melbourne where I lived with my wife and my two children. In the thirtythree years since I had left the inland city, whenever I had seen the sky darkening by day I had remembered the storms that gathered outside my schoolroom window in the 1940s. The storms of those years had always arrived at midafternoon. When a storm was overhead the teacher would have to switch on the lights in the darkened schoolroom. Before the first lightning flashed, I moved as far away as I could move from the schoolroom windows. At home I used to hide from lightning by lying on the floor under my bed. At school I could only press my face against the desktop and ask God not to let the lightning strike me through the windows. I never thought of lightning as striking a group of children. I saw in my mind the zigzag of gold stabbing down from the black clouds and piercing the heart or the brain of the one child who had been marked out for dying on that afternoon. When I thought of myself being killed by lightning, I dreaded the confusion this would cause. After I had failed to arrive home at the usual time, my father would search for me along the streets that I had promised I would follow every afternoon. Before my first day at school I had promised I would never turn aside from McCrae Street, Baxter Street, and McIvor Road. On the very few afternoons when I left those streets and walked for a little way along the creek, I supposed as I walked that my father was hurrying along McIvor Road while I was down among the bulrushes. My father had set out from home to meet me, I supposed. He had come to tell me that our house had been burned down or that my mother had been killed, but we had passed one another without knowing. On those afternoons I had almost turned back from the creek to make sure that my father was not somewhere behind me and walking away from me. And even while I wondered whether I ought to turn back, I thought of my fathers arriving at the school and then turning back towards home but this time leaving the streets and walking along the creek for a little way because he thought I might have been loitering there whereas I was just then going back towards the school by way of the streets and passing my father again unseen. When my father could not find me in my usual streets, he would think at first that I had turned aside to watch the water in the creek flowing swiftly after the storm. He would go down to the bank of the creek, and while he was looking for me among the bulrushes a priest from the presbytery next to my school would ride his bicycle along McCrae Street and Baxter Street and McIvor Road on his way to my fathers house to tell my father, who was not at home, that his only son had been killed by lightning. I prayed that I would not be killed by the storm and that my father would not be lost and confused during the hour when the clouds had passed suddenly away to the east, and when the twilight that had seemed about to turn into darkness had turned instead into a bright afternoon with wet leaves flashing in the sun and steam rising from roofs. I prayed, and I was always spared, and I walked home while the gutters were flowing and the last of the black clouds were rumbling above the eastern horizon. While the gutters flowed and the wet leaves flashed and the steam rose from iron roofs, I understood that I had been spared, but perhaps only for two or three days. The lightning that could have killed me was stabbing at the darkgreen treetops far away past Axedale and Heathcote. By midnight the gold zigzags would be shooting harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean. Days or even weeks later the clouds would settle quietly among the mountains of New Zealand or of South America. But somewhere behind me while I walked eastwards towards my home, another storm would soon arise. I thought of each storm in summer as beginning far away to the east, in some bare paddock in the district around St Arnaud, where I had never been. When I looked just now at a map of the state of Victoria, I saw that I have avoided all my life the countryside east of Bendigo. I was able just now to trace with my finger, beginning at Bendigo and moving northwest to Swan Hill then southwest to Horsham then roughly east to Castlemaine and then north to Bendigo, a quadrilateral enclosing more than five thousand square miles that I have never set foot in. Near enough to the centre of this quadrilateral lies the city of St Arnaud, whose name, whenever I heard it as a child, sounded like a preliminary snarl of thunder. When I thought of the beginnings of a storm, I saw a dark cloud risng from the earth in the way that the evil genie rose from the jar where he had been imprisoned for hundreds of years, in one of the illustrations that I often stared at in the pages of The Arabian Nights Entertainment. In all his life my father never bought a book for himself or as a present for another person. But a few books came into his possession from time to time. One of these was the book we called the Arabian Nights. Until I was thirteen years old, that book was the largest and the oldest book I had looked into. As a child I stared at the illustrations plump, squat men with beards and turbans giant negroes with curved swords donkeys cruelly burdened. I understood that the young women in the illustrations were meant to seem beautiful, but I was repelled by them. They had the huge dark eyes of Jersey cows, and their noses seemed to grow straight down from their foreheads. In the cities where all these people lived, the street and lanes were narrow and gloomy away from the cities the countryside was rocky and desolate the sky, whether clouded or unclouded, was always grey. I suppose the illustrations in the Arabian Nights were printed from some sort of engravings on stone or metal. But I know no more today about the carving of pictures out of metal or wood or stone than I knew when I sat in front of my fathers book and thought of the Arabians, as I called them, as living all their lives threatened by storms. Today, if I happen to see in a book one of the sort of illustration that I call, rightly or wrongly, engravings, I remember myself having felt sorry sometimes for the whole of a nation called Arabia because its women were unattractive and its weather seemed always stormy afternoon. Or I remember myself having rested my eyes sometimes from focusing on donkeys or genies, and having tried instead to discover the cause of the greyness overhanging everything Arabian, at which times I began to see hundreds of fine lines forming an impenetrable mesh between me on the one side and on the other side the turbaned Arabians and their cowfaced young women. From the time when I first learned to read printed words, I wanted to read the whole of the Arabian Nights. I wanted to see far into the strangeness and the greyness of Arabia. One afternoon in a year when I could still read no more than scattered words and phrases, my father came up behind me and warned me that I would learn nothing of benefit from the Arabians. He warned me that the Arabians did without shame what he and I and the people of our inland city avoided as the worst of sins. One day in my tenth year I read for the first time the whole of a story from my fathers Arabian Nights. At that time of my life I read books only in order to look for details that I could include in my dreams of myself living as a grown man in a mansion with a lightning conductor on every chimney behind a high fence of strong and interlocked wire in the bushland between Bendigo and Heathcote. One room of my mansion was going to be fitted out as a private cinema. On many a hot afternoon when the people of the districts surrounding my mansion were looking up into the glaring sky for the clouds that would be the first signs of a storm, I would be in my private cinema. The blinds on the windows of the cinema would be sealed against the light from outside. Modern electric fans would whirr in slowly swivelling cages. At rest in my cool twilight, I would watch what I called true films showing men and women doing without shame in far countries what the people in the districts around my mansion avoided as the worst of sins. Of the story that I read in my tenth year I have forgotten every detail except one. I have not forgotten that a woman in the story, wanting to punish a certain man, ordered her slaves to strip the man and to flog him with the pizzle of a bull. For long after I had first read that detail, I tried to believe that the stories of the Arabian Nights were not wholly fanciful. I tried to believe that somewhere in some country on the far side of the grey crosshatching in books, a woman might once have looked at and named without shyness or shame the naked pink object that I pretended not to notice if it protruded from beneath the bull that moaned and shoved against the tall fence around the yard where my fathers brother milked his Jersey cows while my father and I watched during our summer holidays. And after I had enjoyed the delicious shock of supposing that a woman might once have done those things, I dared to ask myself whether a woman in some story I had still not read might have put a delicate finger to the object while it rested in the hands of one of her slaves, or might even have curled all of her fingers around the object and lifted it away from the slave and then and here I winced or hugged myself or gasped stepped daintily towards the man who had been cowering naked all this time with his back to the woman and with his hands in front of his privates, and brought the long and quivering object down on his white buttocks. If, on the far side of the grey world of illustrations in books, such things as these had been enacted even once, I thought, then I myself might one day watch such things being enacted not merely in my mind while I read some antique book but on the screen of my private cinema, in my mansion protected by tall wire fences."

        "text": "Question 1 part 1 a Constraints on the Scientific Paradigm Yes indeed Freud was constrained by the interlectual tradition of his time that of the scientific paradigm which emanated through the British empiricists Locke,unclear etal following Descartes unclear objectsubject dichotomy. This paradigm pushed Freud in the direction of bulletwanting to be scientific bulletto discover objective truth bulletto look for causes to explain bulletwhy things happen bulletto measure observe. Freuds training in medicine neurology reinforced this Freud certainly wanted his theory to be credible acceptable, which was another constraint on his theorizing therapy. b. Breaking with the Paradigm Yet Freud also broke away from the scientificempiricist traditions by bullet introducing concepts which were clearly not measurable observable or subject to experimentation such as the unconscious, psychic energy repression bullet Overtly claiming that science was not all important to advancing knowledge. Freud was rather indifferent to whether his theories or concepts could be verified. He was convinced within himself of their validity usefulness. bullet Giving emphasis to what was going on inside the person within the context of that persons field of reference to how people might overcome psychological difficulties. This brings us to the matter of how Freud handled the big issues of phenomenology agency within his theoretical framework c. Accommodating Phenomenology Agency. One of Freuds great contributions to development of psychology was his emphasis on the consequences. Complexity power of intrapsychic phenomena. In this he was taking the study of human beings into the area of phenomenology the inner subjective experience of the individual as a legitamite focus of scientific enquiry study. Freud built up much of his early theorising from case histories of his hysteria other patients. In this ideographic context he was of course greatly influenced by the importance of the patients own thoughts, feelings, actions experiences. This Freud thought was crucial to understanding the cause of neuroses etc. So Freud clearly valued inner subjective experience as real essential as a focus of study Freud also valued the person as a person rather than as an object of scientific study This reflected his interest in phenomenology. In this he took the case of unclear patients to a new level of humanity where patients were treated as people Freuds therapeutic work clearly also demonstrated his key emphasis on inner subjective experience The techniques of carth catharsis, free association, dream analysis were all means of the patient being helped to get in touch with aspects of the personality that were repressed, and which could in due course be brought to awareness and integrated into the personality for the wellbeing of the patient Because F emphasized the inner subjective experience of the person he also gave some credence to that persons capacity to create their experiences to change their lives. His therapy was, implicitly at least, based on a belief that the person was capable of living a healthier more fulfilling life could exercise some control over that life. Therapeutic interventions designed to lift repression, gain insight to change behaviour became key elements of Freuds therapeutic package that to my mind suggest some modest allowance for human agency in his model of the person. But I would not overstate this. Human agency is not a strong point of Freud d. Limits on Freuds Theory Ultimately, the scientific paradigm Freuds conception of intrapsychic dynamics severely limited his capacity to allow for human agency. While a persons inner subjective experience was crucial the person had little awareness, let alone choice control over the workings of the mind and consequently of their behaviour. The main constraints in this regard on Freud came from his ader adherence to ipsychic determinism. Freud believed that every psychological event unclear outcome had a specific cause. And it was the task of a good theory to identify these causes. Thus the emphasis is to explain, rather than understand. ii Reductionism Freud tended to reduce the whole personality to drives or instincts located out of awareness in the unconscious. The id becomes the engine of the personality Psychopathology was explained largely in terms of repressed conflicts deep within the person outside conscious understanding control iii an emphasis on early childhood experiences. Development of the personality was largely achieved, for better or worse, once the early psychosexual stages were complete. Thus Freuds abitily to account for human agency is reduced by his failure to countenance human development as an ongoing process over the life span. dConclusion So Freud was both influenced by the scientific paradigm of his time also a major challenge to it. He challenged it by giving emphasis to inner subjective experience or phenomenology in deriving his theory of the psyche its dynamics. But he was constrained heavily by his determinism, reductionism seeking after explanations. In the event, however, Freuds work inspired many new ideas, concepts theories that look psychology even further beyond the scientific mechanical model to giveunclear more weight to phenomenology human agency. Part 1 Question 3 Freud has offered much to the development of contemporary psychoanalysis and other therapies. From his work has sprung much creative thinking and therapy. As Nina Colthart acknowledges there are two important assumptions acknowledged today in diverse therapies which have there roots in Freudian assumptions. They are that the unconscious exists and that human behaviour has meaning which can be psychologically understandstood and which is therapeutic. Yet much of Freudian theory has been repudiated and challenged. It seems that Freud in conceptualising the unconscious nature of and determination of much behaviour was creating both a gift and a burden to the study of personality. Freud came to the study of human behaviour in the prime of empirical science. That which was observable, measurable, refutable constituted what was to be knowledge truth. Yet in seeking answers for the behaviours of his clients, or patients, Freud postulated the functioning of irrational, unconscious forces, as causation for the apparently inexplicable behaviours. Such forces he argued were present because they explained the outcomes he was observing. Freud adopted the constraints of his time to develop a causative model of human behaviour. Influenced also by scientific agenda of Darwinism and his own background in neurology, Freud developed the concept of irrational impulses and drives where forces energy were unconsciously experienced, and linked to the biological survival of the individual. Thus the aim of Freudian psychoanalysis became to bring out from the unconscious, material which was repressed, displaced and distorted, so that it could be made conscious and more adequately appropriately dealt with. Freud assumed that it was the instinctual drives, expressed as love and aggression, which gave purpose to all human behaviour. Furthermore Freud observed that the human species went through stages of development, for which he proposed corresponding psychosexual development. The instinct of life love, was dominated by the psychosexual unclear energy of libido. How did this operate in the human psyche. In keeping with the constraints of a scientific enquiry Freud proposed a structure of personality within which the energies instinctual drives operated. Thus Freud was able to propose causative sequences of behaviour, which became for his later critics, overly determined and pessimistic. The structure of personality was for Freud the basis on which he was able to construe the sequence of behaviours in a logical framework. The id was the source of libido energy, it was the has inhabitant of the unconscious and it gave impetus to instinctual motives. These emerged to confront the ego, the conscious and unconscious part of personality which manoeuvres the psychic energy to comply with more realistic outcomes. As the psyche developed further the superego emerged representing the morality of the individual, the constraints of society. The ego was there to balance the demands of our irrational id with those of the rational superego. Furthermore one had to postulate the emergence of such a structure of personality in person. For Freud his work with hysterics led him to propose that sexual energy was the central orchestrater of the development. To account for their incredible unclear revelation of sexual trauma incest, Freud deduced that such sexual energy was active in childhood. unclear of rape, were construed as fantasy and fantasy was the outcome of impulses to be sexual with ones chief love unclear is for the boy with his mother for the girl with her father. Such inappropriate desires had to be resolved and integrated into the personality. Freud postulated from such assumptions then the oedipus electra complexes. Such proposals denied the knowledge Freud himself had of rape incest. He could not unclear in his society that such evils were so predominant in so many lives. Thus the infantile childhood theories of sexuality and report of sexual drives gained a status they may never have deserved. Freud continued to develop his theory, explaining behaviour in terms of repressed impulses, consuming sexual drives, displaced aggression and defence mechanisms. As his criticques often observed the leap from the observed behaviour to the explanation was often too great to accommodate. Could little Hans phobia of horses really be attributed to displaced aggression towards his father followeding and an unresolved Oedipal Complex There was little to unclear Freuds analysis unclear unclear alternative explanations which Freud could unclear. The explanation had derived from his theory his theory behavioural extremes validated this explanation. The scientific method demanded explanation. Part II Question 5 Jung developed an integrated model of the psyche incorporating both conscious and unconscious dimensions. Unique to his model was the integration he sought of transpersonal aspects of the person, synthesised from generations of humanity, evolving through the unique development of human brain. The conscious ego was active but not as dominating as the unconscious in Jungs structure of the psyche. The latter comprised two interrelated unconscious processes. The fir one was the personal unconscious, comprising all material from experience not in consciousness, including ones repressed emotions experiences. It also held seeds of future aspirations goals. However there was organisation within even the personal unconscious. It held ones set of complexes, ideas thoughts linked to a common theme or construct. Thus Jung proposed all our ideas, hopes, internalisations about something eg mother, father, formed a complex relating to that concept. Complexes could also contain repressed experience and would cause disruption and disorganisation when they became split off from other parts of the psyche and sought to dominate the whole, conscious ego personal unconscious. More central to the model of the unconscious were the archetypes of the collective unconscious. Herein Jung sought to give a place to the transpersonal, the spiritual, the soul of humankind. He believed that humanity held in common certain beliefs, themes and expectations which were expressed in the archetypes of the collective unconscious. These were unified collections of thought depicting themes of humanity. Central to all archetypes was that of the idealised self, the ideal man. The self archetype helped to integrate the collective consciousness and through connections with complexes of personal unconscious the ego was connected to this central self. The complexes also had connections with archetypes enabling integration of a human being with hisher past the repeating themes of humanity, represented by archetypes. Thus from the personal unconscious one could experience connections with the archetypes of collective unconscious. The energy of Jungs model was derived from the tension between the opposing poles of the psyche. Thus the archetypes were depicted as containing oppositions. The Self had opposing aspects, the known public persona and the hidden, less liked, disowned shadow. unclear complexes of male female were archetypal opposites of anima animus the expression of female within the male, male within female The integration of these opposites within the conscious ego was the goal of our existence. II Existensial and transpersonal views of human psyche both accept the concept of the egoic self and the existential existence of that self in hisher world."

        "text": "The Social Sciences, the Humanities and Science and Technology in Economic Development THE PLACE OF PSYCHOLOGY The following material was a submission made on behalf of the Society to the Australian Science and Technology Council, which is investigating the role of the social sciences and the humanities in the contribution of science and technology to economic development. The submission was based in part on comment and suggestions by Stephen Bochner, Nigel Bond, Jacquelyn Cranney, Ross Day, Graeme Halford, Beryl Hesketh, Ian Johnston, Jim Kehoe, Gitte Lindgaard, Robert McBride, Peter Sheehan, and David Siddle. Also, it was based in part on views expressed by participants in Psychology for the Clever Country A Forum for Psychological Science. Members are invited to send comments on this material to Kevin M. McConkey, School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, PO Box 1, Kensington NSW Psychology discovers, describes and explains human experience and behaviour through the logic and method of science. Psychological research and application is based in a logical, empirical, and analytical approach, and that approach is brought to bear on an exceptionally wide range of issues. In the diversity of its investigation and impact, psychology contributes both directly and indirectly to economic development. Some of these matters were canvassed in a previous submission to ASTEC entitled The role of psychology in research directions for Australias future. This diversity, and the consequent contributions, of psychology is constrained at times by categorisation problems. Although the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Research Council list psychology as a Social Science, the Australian Academy of Science has a National Committee for Psychology psychologists are Fellows of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and the Australian Academy of Science and, internationally, psychology is represented on the International Social Science Union and the International Council of Scientific Unions. If the diversity of psychology, and its benefits, is not recognised by ASTEC, then the value of this disciplines contributions to economic development could be lost. Just as other major industrialised countries recognise the wideranging benefits of psychology see Gerstein et al., 1988 National Behavioral Science Research Agenda Committee 1992 Rosenzweig, 1992 Simon, 1980 Smelser Gerstein, 1986, the current study by the SSHSTED Working Party of ASTEC provides a key opportunity not only to highlight the place of psychology as a field of science, but also to highlight the way in which psychology can and should contribute to socioeconomic objectives. As the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr. Free, indicated at Psychology for the Clever Country A Forum for Psychological Science on 23 April 1992, psychology is concerned with a huge spectrum of problems and virtually all those problems relate to the wellbeing of this country in one way or another. Recognising that the core of ASTECs interest in the current study is the role of the social sciences and the humanities in the contribution of science and technology to economic development, this submission turns now to consider outputs and inputs as defined in the SSHSTED Discussion Paper. In doing so, this submission emphasises that the translation of advances in science and technology into economic development involves, at base, human behaviour. Put simply, economic development occurs because the technology is available and because humans engage in appropriate behaviour. OUTPUTS The outputs of psychology are vast, but those outputs are neither understood nor capitalised upon broadly enough in this country. The following examples may help ASTECs understanding of the range of outputs. Training. Training the workforce to use technological advances has not taken advantage of psychological knowledge. In fact, inappropriate notions of training limit the relevance of science and technology to economic development. From the perspective of psychological research, some major aspects of current approaches to training need to be reconsidered. First, in current approaches there is little acknowledgment of individual differences in the ability to acquire skills in the workplace. From a psychological perspective, it is necessary to target training more carefully, and to design training that is more appropriate to the ability levels of individuals. In this way the training dollar is spent more effectively. Such an approach requires psychological expertise in assessment and measurement. However, such expertise is not being used in most of the services that are currently delivering training. Second, developments in cognitive psychology have advanced our understanding of issues such as the nature of expertise, the changes in cognitive structures that follow knowledge acquisition, the skill acquisition process, and how these interact with general ability, motivational, and attitudinal factors. Again, these developments are essentially ignored in current approaches to training. Put simply, there is a great deal of psychological knowledge and expertise that will help people in the workforce to more effectively use technology. Unfortunately, the translation of research findings into practical strategies has not occurred in this country. The psychological knowledge and expertise is there, the interest of government and industry is apparently not. Industrial relations. The adaptation of the workforce to changes that are driven by advances in science and technology is often a core concern in industrial relations. The introduction of new technologies usually requires change in the workplace overall and in the people who operate the technology it also sometimes involves a change in the thinking of management. All this change requires effective communication and effective skillacquisition. The government has attempted to handle issues of reskilling and multiskilling through the development of competency standards for the workforce. This approach, however, has both advantages and disadvantages, and psychological research underscores the relevance of these advantages and disadvantages to economic development involving technological change in particular. The advantages include the provision of a structure with clear goals for training, and the increased portability of skills at the trades and technical level. The major disadvantage, however, lies in the danger of a use by date on the competencies that are specified. Specific workrelated competencies relevant to the needs of today will date quickly with technological advances, thus leaving Australia in much the same position as before, with a workforce that possesses skills that are no longer required. From the perspective of psychology, if science and technology are going to be translated into economic development via the workplace, the competency standards movement must focus on a the development of generic or core competencies, b the training of transferable skills, and c the development of learning skills that will make future learning and adaptation to technological change easy. The issues, which require psychological expertise, do not appear to be given a high priority in the discussion of competency standards and industrial relations. In the rush to become apparently clever today, this country may be at risk of forgetting to become wise tomorrow. Systems design. The design of systems throws into bold relief the various ways in which people interact with technology, and technology interacts with people. Examples here could range from the design of office equipment to the design of control and monitoring systems in automated manufacturing, and the relevance of psychological research to system design can be seen in areas including manufacturing, transport, health, education and, communications. To illustrate the place of psychology in system design, this submission will make specific comment on the development and use of interactive computer systems. Economic development can occur either by enabling an increase in revenue generation or by bringing about savings on current expenditure. The potential for psychology to contribute in both these ways is real, but effectively untapped, in the development of interactive computer systems. Considering all aspects of current computer systems, clearly design, development, packaging, and presentation are not well coordinated. From what we know about human behaviour, there are obvious mismatches between technical and user documentation, help systems and tutorial packages, and the functions provided and the actual uses of computer systems. This is because the technologydriven approach to systems design does not consider issues such as the understanding of users, users tasks, cognitive capabilities, and organisational needs and culture. These issues are in the domain of psychology. In terms of systems design then, the very issues that will make the difference between systems and good systems lie within the domain of human behaviour. The production of excellent systems will, of course, depend on multidisciplinary teamwork, but the time has come for a move beyond technological wizardry to effectiveuse technology basic and applied research in psychology is what will allow that move to occur. Some of the major economic potential for interaction between the social sciences and science and technology can be seen in communications and interactive technology. For instance, multimedia is a fashionable buzzword that means little more than the use of audio, video, still images, text, graphics, and all that moves, in integrated computer systems. However, even with all the technology underlying it, we have little understanding of how, where, when, for whom, in what situations, or why multimedia is of benefit. We really do not know the answers to these and many other questions, and the answers will not emerge from a technologydriven approach to communications and systems development. Yet, the success, or even public acceptance, of such systems depends upon an understanding of what fits and what works from the pointofview of the user. The answers to these questions must come from the social sciences working with science and technology. It is the case that economic development is determined by issues that cross the boundaries between disciplines, rather than be delineated by them, and psychology plays a key role in this regard through its links with a variety of other disciplines. Food technology. The way in which psychology provides the essential link between technology and people can be seen in a variety of other industries, such as the food industry. Psychophysics, which is the area of psychology that links the perceptualpsychological world with the physical world it represents, has enormous potential on the industrial scene. Taking the food industry as a model, there is often a major gulf between the Technical RD department and the Marketing department. People in Technical RD focus on the physical aspects of products people in marketing focus on the psychological world of the consumer. Yet the aim of both these departments is to build better products, satisfy the consumer, and create wealth. There are substantial data that show how the application of psychophysics can facilitate the link between Technical RD and Marketing, and contribute to economic development. The value of this approach can be seen in activities within the CSIRO, as well as activities in the private sector. There is strong demand for this role of psychology, and the demand was outlined at Psychology for the Clever Country. Transport. The effective design and use of transport systems are dependent not only on advances in technology but also on our understanding of human behaviour. The systematic study of roaduser behaviour has facilitated road and vehicle design, improved our management of traffic movement, reduced the rate of death and injury from transportrelated accidents, and is contributing to decisionmaking in the reduction of the environmental impacts and in land use and transport planning for the future. The contributions of psychology towards better road transport again demonstrates how much economic development involves, at base, human behaviour. Again, there is strong demand for this role of psychology, and this demand was highlighted at Psychology for the Clever Country. INPUTS Education of psychologists. Basic education in psychology typically occurs via an undergraduate major with an honours year in psychology that is characterised by its research emphasis. This basic education is in a healthy state in Australia Australian ViceChancellors Committee, 1992. Almost all universities have departments of psychology, and most of these departments offer fouryear programs of academic study in the discipline. That fouryear program equips graduates with the knowledge base that allows them to obtain specific professional training either supervised experience in the workplace, postgraduate education through masters degrees in areas such as clinical and applied psychology or, through doctoral degrees across the broad spectrum of psychological science and application. Largely because of employment opportunities, postgraduate education and training of psychologists have channelled the majority of psychologists towards areas of health and welfare."

        "text": "THE TURN TO ETHICS IN THE 1990s DAVID PARKER This issue of The Critical Review starts from the perception that in advanced literary circles for most of the 1970s and 1980s, few topics could have been more uninteresting, more deacutepasseacute, less likely to attract budding young theorists, than the topic Ethics and Literature. For most of that period, explicit ethical criticism , to borrow Wayne Booths phrase, had fallen on hard times The Company We Keep An Ethics of Fiction, Berkeley, 1988, chapter 2. I will say nothing about what Booth might have regarded as the good times for ethical criticism, the 1950s and 1960s, that period when straw dinosaurs walked the earth we are perhaps still too close to those times to say anything useful about them. On the other hand, there is reason think that, at the more humble level of undergraduate pedagogy at least, ethical criticism has continued on among us alive and well. Frederick Jameson, one of the most vehement critics of ethical interests in literature, said a dozen years ago that when most teachers or students of literature ask of a novel or a poem, What does it mean, the predominant code in terms of which an answer is expected is the ethical. What does Lord Jim mean, for example, is a coded demand that we talk about the moral conflicts of the hero. Jamesons point is that literature, even the latest novel, always comes to us through what he calls sedimented reading habits and categories developed by dotted line inherited interpretive traditions The Political Unconscious narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act, Ithaca, 1981, p. 9. Put simply, when our critical traditions are formed by the likes of Aristotle, Pope, Dr Johnson, Matthew Arnold, Henry James, F.R. Leavis and Lionel Trilling, it is small wonder that we highly educated Western readers may share a prejudice in Gadamers sense in favour of both ethical interpretation and literature that offers moral insight. Indeed, what we think important enough to call literature in the first place will be partly constituted by the demand that works offer such insight. If this is circular, it is less a vicious circle than an hermeneutical one, and something about which we can be reasonably relaxed. Despite these traditional presumptions about literature and the ethical, or perhaps because of them, most avantgarde AngloAmerican literary theory in recent years has been either more or less silent about ethics or deeply suspicious of it. The oddness of this state of affairs is registered well by the classicist and moral philosopher Martha Nussbaum, who, in her recent book, Loves Knowledge Essays on Philosophy and Literature New York, 1990, talks of the strange absence of the ethical in literary theory. Nussbaum notes that amidst literary theorys deep interests in such areas of philosophy as epistemology, semantics and ontology, and despite its multitudinous references to figures such as Nietzsche and Heidegger, the work of leading contemporary moral philosophers such as John Rawls, Bernard Williams and Thomas Nagel is hardly noticed at all. This is especially hard to understand, she says, as it is a time of great ferment in moral philosophy One cannot find for generations since the time of John Stuart Mill, if not earlier an era in which there has been so much excellent, adventurous, and varied work on the central ethical and political questions of human life. Nussbaum goes on to suggest that in view of the importance of this work, literary theorys apparent uninterest in it is itself significant dotted line it signals a further striking absence the absence, from literary theory, of the organising questions of moral philosophy, and of moral philosophys sense of urgency about these questions. The sense that we are social beings puzzling out, in times of great moral difficulty, what might be, for us, the best way to live this sense of practical importance, which animates contemporary ethical theory and has always animated much of great literature, is absent from the writings of many of our leading literary theorists. pp. 16970 The urgency of Nussbaums own tone shouldnt lead us to overlook the fact that there has been engaged, urgent, practiceoriented literary theory in the past twenty years. Most of it has been political, concerned with issues of race, gender, class and sexuality. But what Nussabum calls the organising questions of moral philosophy , and specifically the question of how we should live, are rarely if ever explicitly addressed. But then does this lack of explicitness necessarily mean there has been an absence of the ethical , or at least a significant turn away from it, in AngloAmerican literary theory and criticism in the 70s and 80s One answer is surely not the period has been dominated by forms of political and poststructuralist criticism that are at very least implicitly ethical. According to this view, ethical criticism has remained the predominant mode of criticism in this period. This is Wayne Booths argument in The Company We Keep. What he calls the new overtly ethical and political feminist, neoMarxist and antiracist movements, as well as the earlier structuralist and deconstructive formalism , both have an ethical program in mind p.5. To this extent, I would agree with Booth. These days, even the most linguisticallyfocused recovery of the marginalised Other of a logocentric philosophical or literary text at least implicitly links itself with the defence of those who have been Other to Western imperialism, to patriarchy or to bourgeois interests. As Seyla Benhabib puts it, one of the defining perceptions of this period is that the logic of binary oppositions is also a logic of subordination and domination Situating the Self Gender, Community and Postmodernism in Contemporary Ethics, Cambridge, 1992, p.15. Its hard to see how a concern with such evils as subordination and domination isnt at least implicitly oriented towards a conception of a good life centering around goods such as freedom, selfexpression and selfrealisation. And in practice, some forms of feminism especially have explicitly developed a picture of human flourishing not simply in terms of thin concepts such as social justice and equality but also drawing on thicker conceptions of human character which tend to revalue such goods as connectedness, emotional responsiveness and care as alternatives to an allegedly masculinist concern with moral autonomy, rationality and obligation. Of all the various forms of the politics of difference that have emerged strongly in the past twenty years, feminism has perhaps gone further than the others in recognising the need for explicit debate over such central questions in moral philosophy as the role of traditions, essences and universals. Peta Bowdens essay in this issue, Theoretical Care Feminism, Theory and Ethics, is an example of this new feminist work. At the same time, some forms of feminism and much neoMarxist criticism and literary theory have been at very least ambivalent towards the whole sphere of the ethical. For example, Terry Eagletons influential book, Literary Theory An Introduction, veers between a somewhat reductive view of ethics and a fuller and more adequate one. On the one hand, the moral is restricted to a meiopic concern with immediate interpersonal relations , as opposed to the political, which can put such relations into the broader view of our whole material conditions of existence . The assumption is that to see things politically, from a neoMarxist perspective, is to see them as they are, in their full implications p. 208. In their essay Seumas Miller and Tony Coady Literature, Power and the Recovery of Philosophical Ethics talk in detail about this sort of view, which boils down to the idea that the ethical is ideological, or a form of false consciousness, the true alternative to which is political consciousness. But Eagleton doesnt quite go that far here and argues that political argument is what he calls genuine moral argument , which implicitly concedes that moral thought might extend well beyond the sphere of immediate interpersonal relations . Here Eagleton goes some way towards a more adequate conception of the ethical, one which recognises that ultimately there is no excluding the question How should a human being live from political reflection, any more than we can permanently exclude the political from reflection on interpersonal relations. Richard Bernstein, in his recent book on the ethicalpolitical horizons of postmodernity , is surely right when he says that although we can distinguish ethics and politics, they are inseparable. For we cannot understand ethics without thinking through our political commitments and responsibilities. And there is no understanding of politics that does not bring us back to ethics The New Constellation The EthicalPolitical Horizons of ModernityPostmodernity, Cambridge, 1991, p.9. To underline this inseparability, Bernstein uses the phrase ethicalpolitical , which is an attractive solution in some ways, and one which reminds us why Booth was right in calling all the political movements that have dominated literary discourse in recent years forms of ethical criticism. But the reason why we cant simply talk of the ethicalpolitical at this stage, and the main reason why Booths argument is inadequate, is that one dominant vein of political criticism in recent years has been hostile to ethics and has either ignored it or disavowed any connection with it. This is the vein represented in its least compromising form by Frederic Jameson. In his work, Marxism becomes a masternarrative in terms of which ethics must be constantly deconstructed. The essential thrust of Jamesons case against ethics is that it legitimates by universalising into a system of binary moral oppositions the characteristics of one group or class versus another, so that evil inevitably denotes imagined characteristics of those who are Other to the hegemonic group. Thus ethics is an ideological mask of the willtopower of the dominant class, or, as others would put it, race or gender. It is reasonable to concede that ethics can be ideological in this way. Ethics can be unconsciously masculinist or bourgeois, unwittingly privileging a certain sort of genderbiased conception of autonomous rationality or certain classbiased conceptions of social order. Indeed I would want to suggest that one of the permanently valuable legacies of the political literary theory of the 70s and 80s has been precisely to keep reminding us of the historicallyand culturallycontingent basis of formations like ethics and the socalled literary canon, which therefore cannot be unproblematically conceived as timeless or universal. On the other hand, the characteristic weakness of such theory has been to suggest that that such formations are nothing but the masks of ideology. It is this nothing but which is the signal weakness of Jamesons enterprise, a weakness with significant ethical implications. One important element of Jamesons case is his claim that ethics is inevitably judgmental, following a simple binary pattern of me and my group good, the Other and her group evil. Once again, it is reasonable to concede that moral judgments can be like this and often are. Judgmentalism is a permanent possibility within ethics so long as my focus on the perceived difference between me and the Other is not qualified by a perception of commonality between us. Where Jamesons account is deficient, however, is in not recognising this perception of commonality as a possibility within ethics, a possibility which is after all central in the JudeoChristian tradition. The locus classicuss is the familiar gospel story of the woman taken in adultery the Pharisees are ready to stone her to death as they are bound by law to do, until they are prompted to look into their consciences and see that none of them is without sin either. That is, they are prompted to recognise an element of commonality with her, at which moment they transcend the selfother binarism of their judgmental attitude. My claim is that, partly constituted as we in Western societies are by the JudeoChristian tradition, among others, nonjudgmentalism is not merely an abstract possibility for us, but one which is part of our cultural milieu and identity. In fact the very term, nonjudgmental, surely owes its modern connotation to a tradition of spiritual and moral discrimination mediated to us, among other ways, by our literature by Measure for Measure, or novels such as Middlemarch or The Scarlet Letter, to take only the most explicit examples. Another claim I would make is that judgementalism, the powerful temptation in us to divide the world selfrighteously into simple binaries, is a possibility within any beliefsystem that is oriented towards some conception of the good, be it religious, ethical or political. Pharisaism is as much a temptation of Marxism or feminism as it is of any theological creed or moral commitment all can degenerate into dividing the world rigidly into sheep and goats."

        "text": "CHAPTER 9 Going Organic DECIDING YOUR PERSONAL APPROACH TO GARDEN CHEMICALS Garden chemicals in Australia are in a mess. The chemicals are often quite dangerous yet the labels on the bottles are very confusing. Sales staff selling these chemicals are often untrained and thus they add to the danger in the use of these products. Don Burke spoke to the Federal Minister for Primary Industries, Simon Crean, who has agreed to a major review of these products, their labelling and the way they are sold. The Minister and the Labor Government are committed to a complete overhaul of the system and Don hopes that eventually most toxic garden chemicals will be dispensed by qualified staff from licensed premises. In the meantime, what is the safest approach to garden chemicals Do you avoid them all together, or use them as necessary Here are three suggested approaches to home chemical use. Each involves certain tradeoffs between the safety of the gardener, the wellbeing of the environment and the best control of pest or disease problems. Chemicals dont have to be an integral part of gardening, but to grow certain plants successfully you will need to use some sort of chemical to control pests or diseases. Among the plants that need chemical controls are roses, azaleas, tomatoes and certain fruit trees, particularly citrus. These same plants are the most popular in Australian gardens. Some of the pests for which there is little alternative to chemical control are bullet Fruit fly not a problem in South Australia, Tasmania or Victoria bullet Black spot on roses bullet Petal blight on azaleas bullet Mealy bug bullet Twospotted mite bullet Scales of all sorts and bullet Citrus leaf miner. Going Organic Other problem areas gardeners face every day and where chemicals offer a convenient method of control are weeds, and the common garden pests including snails, slugs and a myriad of caterpillars. But, no matter whether you intend to use chemicals or not, what would be termed clean cultural practices in your garden are going to reduce pest and disease problems. This means keeping the weeds at bay, picking off pests by hand or with a stick or even the vacuum cleaner and removing infected flowers, leaves or even the entire plant. Hand removal of diseased flowers is an important part of controlling petal blight on azaleas. As soon as you notice a flower looking a little wilted, pick it off and put it straight into a bag and into your garbage bin not the compost heap and dont throw it under the bush. It is important to keep on removing infected flowers even if you do spray with a fungicide. Rust on fuchsias, a disease that starts off as brown lumps under the leaves but spreads fast and can quickly cause your favourite fuchsia to drop its leaves, may be headed off by removing the infected leaves as soon as the rust is noticed. The drawback to this approach is that it can be very labour intensive and time consuming, but then so is spraying. And, before you spray, always look closely at the problem and ask yourself, Can I live with this, or is it going to do longterm damage to my plant You may discover that simply by tolerating a chewed hole you will be able to avoid the use of chemicals in your backyard. Three options Avoid them altogether in the backyard. This will reduce the number of plants that you can grow in your garden and the quality of your harvest. You will have to be prepared to accept that damage will occur and you will simply have to live with it. If you decide to take this approach, you can follow recommendations that are taken as a standard for organic growers. Organic growers restrict their chemical usage to a few selected chemicals, including the fungicide copper sulphate, and depend on the build up of natural predators, selection of diseaseresistant varieties and good cultural methods. Acceptable organic chemicals include Dipel or Bacillus thuringiensis derris dust which can kill fish, so keep it away from dams and fish ponds copper sulphate take care you are selecting copper sulphate, not copper oxychloride and glyphosate for example Roundup if necessary to control weeds. These products should be used in conjunction with mulching, compost and pelleted fowl manure such as Dynamic Lifter. Reducing chemical usage also allows natural predators, such as ladybird bugs, praying mantis and insecteating birds, to prosper in your garden and keep the pest numbers down naturally. Going Organic Use only chemicals that break down quickly.This approach will still reduce the number of plants you can grow and the quality of your harvest. You will also have to be prepared to spray more frequently to control pest problems. The ideal profile for a chemical that fits into this category would be one which has a low acute toxicity, and absence of longterm effects, a short persistence, and is resistant proof pests tend to develop resistance to various chemicals, particularly with continued use. Most of the commonly used pesticides that fit into this category are not very selective that is, they kill the good along with the bad. If this was your chosen approach to chemical usage in your backyard, some of the chemicals you would be able to use in addition to those mentioned in category one would include pyrethrin Maverick if Dipel is not effective dispersible sulphur copper oxychloride Kocide white oil Clensel and snail bait. These products would be used in conjunction with manual control picking off by hand and stomping, adjusting your tolerance levels to accept some damage, hosing away insects such as aphids, choosing appropriate plants and varieties, and promoting strong growth with the use of fertiliser, compost and mulch. Spot treat problems with a more persistent chemical.This approach will allow you to grow the problem plants such as tomatoes, roses, ctirus and azaleas. The chemicals in this category still have a low mammalian toxicity, but do require the wearing of protective clothing when mixing and spraying. Included in this last list are many of the mixed garden chemicals that are designed for specific garden plants such as roses, tomatoes and lawns. As well as the chemicals listed above in categories one and two, you could include in your garden shed Lanosan Tomato Spray carbaryl, dusting sulphur and copper oxychloride, an insecticidefungicide for control of just about every tomato problem known to man except fruit fly Lebaycid for fruit fly control carbaryl Garden Spray Insecticide Fungicide carbaryl with wettable sulphur and mancozeb Rose Gun Black Spot and Insect Killer triforine with pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide Bayleton for the control of petal blight on azaleas OnceaYear Path Weeder DPA present as simazine and amitrole and BinDie a berbicide for control of bindii. Obviously, not every gardener would require every chemical on this list and some listed contain a mixture of chemicals. Depending on what plants you grow, this long list could be reduced to a handful of chemicals. For example, if you grow some vegies perhaps tomatoes, fruit trees, roses and annuals you may want to have on hand Lebaycid, Maverick, Garden Spray mancozeb and carbayrl, a snail bait and copper oxychloride or Kocide. Which of these three approaches to chemical usage you select should be a personal but considered decision. Make it in conjunction with others in your family, taking into account the way you use your backyard. Dons advice is that any woman of childbearing age should avoid spraying chemicals. He also believes that gardens where children play are not really the place for chemical use. Importantly, ask yourself if you have the right temperament for chemical use. If youre a near enough is good enough type, then you probably should avoid chemicals all together. Chemicals need to be used and mixed in a very methodical and careful way. Never do it in a hurry and always take care to follow the instructions on the label and wear long sleeves and pants, shoes and socks, a hat and gloves and in many caes a mask. Safe storagePlease take care with chemicals stored at home, no matter how safe they are supposed to be. Ideally, all chemicals should be stored out of reach of any children, preferably in a high locked cupboard. Keep chemicals away from food storage areas and never store leftover chemicals in unmarked containers or food containers such as soft drink bottles. Most chemicals have a shelf life of around two years. Dont hoard old chemicals. Instead, check with your water board or department of agriculture about the safe disposal of home garden chemicals in your region. Most states operate collection days on a regular basis. AMAZING FACT Leguminous plants are natural fertilisers, taking nitrogen from the air and introducing it into the soil. DONS ORGANIC ACTION LIST FOR EVERY BACKYARD If you want to start caring for the environment by going organic in your backyard, here is a short list of things you can do. FertilisersRev up the compost heap. Start feeding it with animal manure as well as vegie scraps and lawn clippings. As well, discover the benefits of a green manure crop. Use Dynamic Lifter, cow manure and Nitrosol. PesticidesReduce your use of pesticides for killing both insects and fungal diseases but dont throw them all out for information on safe disposal, contact your state water board office, which will tell you about collection days. Tolerate a small amount of damage before reaching for the spray can. Beyond this, rely on sulphur, lime sulphur, and copper sulphate for fungal disease problems. For insects use pyrethrums, white oil, soft soaps, derris dust and biological controls such as Dipel. And, for a good allround tonic, use seaweed extracts eg, Seasol. WeedsThere is nothing as good or organic as hand weeding, but the occasional use of Roundup or Zero is okay for large areas. Prevention is better than cure in every organic garden, so make good use of mulches and living ground covers, which reduce the opportunity for weed growth. CareLook at your plants frequently, keeping an eye out for any problem. Treat problems as soon as you see them, by hand if possible. Plants that repeatedly cause problems should be removed. Clean culture is the best way to beat both insect pests and diseases. This means removing dead leaves, dead plants, or even weeds around your living plants where any of these are harbouring nasties. Compost them and then return them to the soil later on. EnvironmentBy planting shelter and food plants and putting out water, encourage birds to your garden. They will help you to beat pests by recycling them in the most efficient and organic way known. Companion plantingExperiment with these ideas, but dont expect miracles. HOW DO YOU GO ORGANIC IN YOUR BACKYARD We all want to do the right thing be organic, save the world, live in a clean and healthy environment but its all so confusing where do we start Well, the best place is with the facts, but trying to find any facts about organic products and methods is hard. There is very little scientific research to support many of the claims that are made. It is shameful that so many claims are made about organic products and methods such as companion planting, even though there is almost nothing to support the claims. It is true that many organic products and methods do work, but there is little understanding about why and how. Even knowing what is organic and what isnt is confusing. In a strictly scientific sense of course, the world is either organic or inorganic. Organic is everything that is or was once living, including things derived from carbon, although any organism for example yourself contains inorganic materials such as salts. But in everyday language the word organic tends to suggest something that is pure, chemical free and basically good for you. So we buy organic fruit, organic vegetables really organically grown fruit and vegetables and organic products in the distinctly inorganic supermarket building."

        "text": "iN.B. Postcode changed to OX106HQ Eveline 16th Aug. 90 My dear Pam, John, Fliss, Greg This seems an appropriate day to write to you while thinking of Evan on his proper birthday. Already 10 days have flown, the first 8 unbelievably warm dry, with a hose ban in force from Sat. However yesterday a few good downpours seem to have broken the drought more promised back to normal J J went off to Munich last Wed. John had 2 days work then a weekend for them away, from boys. As soon as theyd gone Rogers cough got worse so I had to drive the Golf to the doctor, two villages away. After a few trips Ive now conquered my fear of gears narrow roads but still dont fancy venturing too far afield. On Sunday took them to see Nuffield House, which was having an open day. Lord Lady M. lived there having built it in the 40s not a very good time for deeacutecor you should see the allgreen bathroom dotted lineIt was a bit too near in time to appreciate having it all set up as if they were still around dining table set for a banquet with very blue venetian wineglasses plates which would not improve ones appetite afternoon tea tray ready in the drawing room the only really elegant room all his court robes other uniforms standing about in a headless gathering. I heard a lady say in a worried tone They ought to be behind glass or theyll rot. I dont supose Lord M. would worry if they did For a billionaire it was an unpretentious house. He gave away 30,000,000 in his lifetime to charities. The most interesting things were 3 MorrisCowley cars in the driveway, all looking in mint condition, one of which is still driven every day. Apparently when a colour was being chosen for the new cars in the factory he said you can have any colour you like so long as its black. I remember in 1946 when I first came over here, being amazed to see so many black ones after our colours at home. Nothing much has changed in the village in 2 years except that the Honey Factory, Evelines only industry, has moved to a town the buildings are being demolished to make way for 17 apartments cottages. We hope they will be in keeping with the present mixture of old newer houses. The Honey Factory imports honey from all over the world bottles it including Oz Blue Gum. A pity it had to move. The big black horse in the field behind us has another foal exactly like the one when I was here last. Lovely to see them together from our upstairs windows. I go for my morning walks one day clockwise round the village next day anticlockwise, but sometimes venturing up another field path. Rabbits are back in force becoming a worry to the farmers I think. The sky is often crisscrossed with aircraft trails at that hour theres always something of interest. I even get a Good Morning from the any other early walker not many whereas later in the day the English are not friendly to strangers. On Tues. night we had our first quintet evening did the Schumann lots of noise fun. Good job the neighbours are well away across the garden. Next time it will be the Dvorak Quintet meanwhile Jenny I are enjoying playing together. Gill is going well they all had a great time in Corsica with suntans to show off, though they will no doubt fade from now on. On the day I left Friday 3rd you may remember we had very strong winds rain. A huge branch cracked off my big gum tree in the front garden hung there swinging. There was nothing I could do except leave it for Philip to cope with. Im glad I had the branches over the house lopped. Philip drove me in his de luxe office car to the airport where I was very disgruntled to find that all nonsmoking seats had been taken many prebooked which my travel agent should have told me to do. So I spent the entire trip to Frankfurt with a chainsmoker on one side across the aisle my neighbour on the other almost as bad. However I achieved my ambition to sit next to a German. He came from Bremen spoke no English we communicated well all the way, though I had to make him slow down. The plane was a new 747 with wings that looked normal level on the ground but lifted up at an angle in the air, with turnedover bits on the end like eagles wings. It was very comfortable except for not have enough nonsmoking places. As there were families with children in the same section it seems obvious they should do something about it. I must write tell them. Lovely being here with the family, who all send love to you all Lots from me too, Estelle iiTues. 16th Oct 90 My dear Pam, John, Fliss Greg Lovely to have your letter, Pam, written just a month ago. To answer your first question, we were on our way to London for the day as I read your letter in the car going to Reading train from there only 45 mins or so, we also drove up one night to a concert in the Wigmore Hall about 1 hour door to door. Contratulations Fliss on winning the Mitsui Scholarship Evan told me Angus too All in the family its very exciting for you. Pam you should be up to U by my reckoning I hope its on schedule. I wasted most of my time in England having a rather bad dose of bronchitis which led to a cracked rib from coughing honestly That took 6 weeks to completely heal, so in just the last week Ive been able to enjoy breathing deeply again. However it was better to have it happen in England I was feeling normal by the time I came over here on the 29th Sept. Then on the 4th I went by train to Ansbach, leaving Gill very well but very large and looking as though the baby wouldnt wait until I go back. They assured me they could manage anyway sent me off for my Italian holiday. I met friendly Germans on the train managed to communicate very well, if not in perfectly constructed sentences. On the 6th, Charlotte, Harold I went by train to Nuumlautrnberg where we joined the coach two coaches in fact 70 people, which was more than we liked but it wasnt too bad. At Munich a little old man got on had the seat next to mine. He turned out to be an exconsul general in the German diplomatic service, spoke perfect English was full of interesting information. What luck for me Hed been many years in Ankara but well before Philips time there. We had warm mostly sunny weather for the whole week in England also incredibly dry warm so could enjoy the sightseeing well most of it. Florence was rather a shock disappointment so much traffic noise people that the buildings one had dreamed about wanted to see for so long were nothing like their pictures in books. Well, I didnt expect A Room With a View but wasnt prepared for all the clutter. Never mind, Pisa made up for it with the marvellous Cathedral Square with the Baptistry, Cathedral of course the L.T. in sparkling white marble set off by brilliant green grass no cars. Lucca was interesting for tall houses narrow streets no traffic in the old part. Three Medici Villas were fascinating with murals in one of them amazingly fresh in their original state after nearly 4 centuries. Our Reiseleiter was a very erudite young man I wish could have understood all his talks, but caught enough to help appreciate it all. Verona was elegant Innsbruck provided a memorable goulash souup on our way back The drive in sunshine through the Eisack Etch Valleys in the Sudtyrol was one long calendar picture of Alps, forts castles on hills, green, green grass autumn colours in the trees. I could go on but cant wait any longer to tell you that we have a girl at last Charlotte after Oma of course pronounced the German way. She was born on the 8th which is Rolands birthday after trying all afternoon to ring him for that from Montecalim we knew something must be happening. Then at 9 pm he rang us at the hotel great rejoicing all round. Gill had an easy time came home next day They do it differently these days all much more comfortable than a week in hospital. Roland had the week off was marvellous. Sebastian was delighted is so gentle so sweet with his sister so far altogether everything goes well. Needless to say I was glad to come back on Monday night start my au pair job, they are glad to have me back. Charlotte is so cut with silky very dark hair all over her head. She weighed nearly 7lbs. but seems so tiny after one hasnt seen a new baby for so long. Shes feeding sleeping well looking a bit different each day its all very satisfactory A very good midwife has come each day to see that all is well is far better than a doctor. Well Ill have to stop this has been written in fits starts so excuse scribble please I just had to send you the NEWS much love from everyone from me always Estelle. I wrote to Greg the other day Gill worried she hadnt answered his letter never time but theyve asked him to come for Xmas. 12th Sept 92 Dear Pam John Time for a quick line before the days activity begins then its all go This is a lovely area for them to bring up the children in very little traffic on the road at the front the house set well down from it at the back side tall trees through the back gate a forest walk to kindergarten nur ein paar minuten or to the shops also to the Mischwald, a 3 or 4 sq k. forest the Stadtpark with lovely walks the Bille, a little river flowing through. Beech, birch, oak lots more Sebastian goes to kindergarten each day until 12 loves it. German is taking over from English, naturally, but Gill is determined to keep his English going. He tends to speak it with German constructions now vice versa sometimes Charlotte is a little person knows exactly what she wants her 3 chief loves are a cot cover, Made by my exneighbour, Softy Bear who was Gills but still looks like new a dummy. Theyre trying to get rid of the latter but its a bit of a joke now if it gives her some comfort, why not so long as its not in public. She trails around the house with her paraphenalia is putting words together very well so clearly. She divides syllables up carefully at the moment also likes things to be tidy I dont suppose this will last long. Gills quartet gave their concert as part of the Hamburg Festival on Thurs. The festival is really a lot of concerts over a month some in unusual venues. Theirs was in the Finance building in a small hall. Without audience the acoustics were so resonant I feared for them, but all these lovely people started rolling in from 30 onwards by 8 it was wellfilled."
