    "text": "In Australia, since the beginning of the 1980s, there has been a general economic swing towards the weakening of the market power of larger monopolies. This has been due to the theoretical belief that monopolies and regulation create inefficiencies and that by increasing competition in the market place the result will be a more efficient situation to benefit the consumer. The weakened monopoly will often take the form of monopolistic competition, that is, many firms each with some degree of monopoly power, or of an oligopoly where there are a few firms with impeded entry. The finance sector was the first major area of deregulation followed by the airlines and more recently our communications network. Due to differing levels of deregulation and economic climate the outcome of the weakening of these monopoly powers has both benefited and deprived the consumer and the efficiency of production to varying degrees. To grasp the theory of the monopoly and the benefits and costs it provides the consumer, a basic model must be discussed. However, the existence of a true monopoly is rare. Often there is a group of firms with differing levels of monopoly power who all face a downward sloping demand curve and therefore can choose output levels and prices to maximise profits. A monopolist has complete control over the level of output as they are the market. As a result, the monopolists Average Revenue AR is the market demand. From Fig it is shown that the monopolist will produce at a level where Marginal Revenue MR equals Marginal Cost MC. In a competitive market ,AR, which represents price, would equal MC. Therefore, in a monopoly, costs are higher and consumers buy less. Lost consumer surplus area AB arises along with deadweight loss area BC. This deadweight loss represents the social cost and the inefficiency of resource allocation of a monopoly. A deadweight loss will always exist unless the firm can perfectly price discriminate. So, by raising prices above equilibrium consumer welfare is reduced. Other inefficiencies that may arise from the existence of a monopoly are the toleration of inefficient work practices due to the weakness of competitive pressure, also the possible excessive expenditure to defend a monopolistic position. Questionable inefficiency that may arise from the sheltering from competition is lack of research and development into more productive or quality producing processes. However, the conflicting arguement is that because the firm is protected it is willing to bear the risks and costs of invention and innovation. So that the consumer does not suffer from excessive charges for goods or services provided by monopolies, price regulation may be introduced, often in the form of government regulation. The intervention of the government is both on a social and economic ground. Price fixing, in the case of utilities such as water and electricity means that access is not limited to those that can afford possible excessive prices. However, this may encourage overconsumption and under investment if the price is set too low or over production and inefficiency when it is set too high. The cost is borne by the general public in the form of higher prices or taxes. Monopolies can take the form naturally or be created. The natural monopoly arises when the market is only large enough for one producer. This form of monopoly cannot have its market power reduced in static conditions. However, a monopoly that has been created and protected due to government or other large bodied regulation can have its market dominance reduced by lifting the regulation practices. Often, the result is monopolistic competition or an oligopoly. Monopolistic competition is the closest real world example of perfect competition. The products produced by each firm are not perfect substitutes but are highly substitutable and there is free entry to the market. As there is free entry, the potential to earn profits will attract many firms to the market. The result is the level of profits will be reduced to zero profit as price will become equal to Average Cost AC. Each firm will still have a downward sloping demand curve as its product is unique. Although monopolistic competition is similar to perfect competition the differences result in a failure to produce a perfectly efficient market where both producer and consumer surplus is as large as possible. Price still exceeds MC so there still exists a deadweight loss. However, depending on the level of competition between the companies, the set price may tend closer to the MC. Under monopolistic competition there exists excess capacity as the output level is less than that which minimises average cost. As the demand curve is downward sloping, zero profits occur to the left of the minimum average cost. However, demand becomes more elastic as competition increases and this excess capacity will be reduced. So, these losses to the consumer will be offset by the existence of a large range of similar products to choose from so that their satisfaction may be maximised. The other form of market that may result from the weakening of the market power of a monopoly is the oligopoly. This exists when there are a few firms due to the existence of barriers to entry. Even after government deregulation there may exist some natural barriers to entry such as the market dominance of a few firms which makes entry to the market highly uneconomic. These can occur in the form of consumer loyalty, predatory pricing by existing members on competitors and the saturation of the market by present members. Collusion may exist between members to set a price and price wars can erupt if a firm dramatically alters its price or level of advertising. The consumer under the oligopoly will benefit in the event of a price war as they will receive the lowest price possible for the good . However, as to be expected if the price falls below average cost in the long run the firms will go out of business. So, the theoretical conclusion from weakening the market power of a monopoly is, that dead weight loss is reduced therefore there is a more efficient allocation of resources. The market is opened to competition therefore the price of the good is reduced and yet again the consumer benefits. To remain in the market the firm must have efficient methods of production and to keep consumer loyalty the quality of the product or service must be maintained. However, by studying the results of recent deregulation in Australia and the United States rarely do all consumers benefit to the same degree, if at all from the weakening of the monopoly power. After the Martin and Campbell Reports of the early 1980s which came to a conclusion in favour of deregulating the Australian financial system, Australia proceeded to transform its banking system from the most controlled to the least controlled banking system in the world. The main arguement for the deregulation was that removal of bank controls would lead to more efficient financial markets, with leaner interest rate margins. The resulting competition would eliminate the possibility of monopolistic superprofitsAnderson 1993 pp57,62.The costs of current regulation of interest rate and lending controls were believed to be the diversion of funds to possibly less efficient intermediaries and the blunting of the competitive and innovative drive of the banks Campbell 1981 p761. All interested parties, that is, the banks, could see only benefits to the deregulation. So from 1980, interest rate ceilings were removed on bank deposits, some term deposit restrictions were removed, quantitative bank lending guidance ceased, the Australian dollar was floated and exchange controls removed, controls on bank deposits withdrawn, invitation to overseas banks to establish in Australia issued and ceilings were removed on home loan interest rates. The result of this dramatic change has been almost the opposite to the idealised predictions. Domestic banks asserted their dominance by mergers and superior infrastructure causing foreign banks to suffer losses and failure. It has been clear that deregulation increased the availability of the range services and products available to the consumer. However, often this has been only available at high interest rates and used for portfolio rather than more direct investment Abbott 1990 p93. The failure of some state banks and Tricontinental was due to the financial institutions choosing more speculative, high risk securities thus putting the deposits of the community at risk and causing a greater cost to the taxpayer in the end. Therefore, the Australian financial sector did not follow the textbook example of increased competition resulting in a more efficient and allocative market but rather resulted in greater inefficiencies and the assertion of dominance of existing oligopolists. Like the financial system in Australia, the United States U.S. airline industry was deregulated in the hope of increased competition leading to a more efficient and innovative system. However all routes have not been exposed to the same level of competition. As a result fares have fallen in the long haul market but their has been little benefit in the short to medium haul market. Similarly, fares are lower in the high density than those in the lower density markets. However, in general the airlines have become more efficient by using the hubandspoke system and more innovative. The real benefit to the consumer has been the increased availability and use of discount fares. This has not been without cost. Some smaller, less profitable services, to smaller communities that were subsidised by the more profitable routes have suffered. Also the increased congestion at main airports and deterioration of cabin service quality has occurred. However, there is no evidence that cost cutting has reduced the safety of flying. The Australian deregulation of the two airline policy has not been as successful as the U.S. example. Deregulation occurred November 1990 and twelve months later, Compass Airlines was in provisional liquidation. Compass Airlines tried to compete in a market that, though officially deregulated held barriers to entry that it could not overcome. The deregulation consisted of the removal of, controls over the importation of aircraft, determination of passenger capacity on trunk routes, setting of airfares for passenger services and constraint on entry of new domestic operators on trunk routes. As a result of Compass entry fares fell on an average by 12 in real terms and service and quality improved. The entry of Compass also provided a stimulus to domestic tourism Trade Practices Commission 1992. Compass failed to estimate the competitive responses of its competitors and even though it matched discount fares it was forced to maintain load factors and cash flows. The profitability of airlines has fallen over the period since deregulation but it is not obvious how much is due to the recession, increases in capacity or fare discounting. The consumer in the end has been the winner with more discount fares being offered and cheaper airfares on capital city routes. However, there still remains two airlines with the possibility of a competitor unlikely due to the oligopoly that exists. In both the banking and airline industries, levels of collusion and merging have resulted in the strength of the oligopolies. This may be due to failure to enforce antitrust laws in Australia unlike the U.S. The success of airline deregulation in the U.S. and of other communication and banking areas is the existence of antitrust laws which prevent the actions that restrain, or are likely to restrain, competition, and by restricting the forms of market structures availablePindyke,Rubenfeld 1992 p363. So as result a fairer and more competitive market exists. Other area that must be mentioned are the communication and media industries. With the introduction of Optus to compete with the former monopoly, Telecom, there has been an improvement in quality of service to the customer but only a very small saving in the cost of telephone calls which could be attributable to competition. Telecom still provides the less profitable remote and emergency services at a cheap rate whilst competing in the mobile and major city communication networks. Also with the relaxation a media ownership laws the result, due to a large number of mergers, is tending towards a larger monopoly than before. In theory, regulation is needed to correct market failure and is intended to serve the public interest. This may be needed so monopolies do not exploit the consumer. However, often deregulation masks inefficiencies, which by promoting competition, can be reduced. Only when true monopolistic competition exists can the theory become practice. The reality is, that in deregulating an existing monopoly that has oligopolistic tendencies the result does not follow a set pattern. Due to economic climate, market dominance of existing monopolies and consumer loyalties the benefit to the consumer and the quality of the service produced will be different each time."
