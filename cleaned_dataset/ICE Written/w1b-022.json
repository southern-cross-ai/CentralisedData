As indicated, Coles Myer have requested that we provide them with a report from Dr Dixon should we be in possession of one. We note that prior to writing to Dr Dixon it may be easier if you could contact your general practitioner, Dr Bone and request that he provide you with copies of any reports Dr Dixon has provided to him subsequent to your attendance. Should Dr Bone not be in possession of any reports it will be necessary that we formally request a report from Dr Dixon who is more likely than not to require prepayment report fees for the provision of same. We confirm that we have requested Coles Myer Limited to advise as to whether they are prepared to accept liability with respect to the payment of your medical and associated treatment costs and upon receipt of a response we shall contact you further. We look forward to hearing from you as to whether Dr Bone is in possession of any reports from Dr Dixon. Yours faithfully, BOOTH MATHER BLACKMORE CB940026 8 February 1994 Ms N. Adams 93 Francis Road ARTARMON NSW 2064 Dear Ms Adams, RE INJURY AT K MART CHATSWOOD We refer to the above matter and to your recent attendance upon this office with the writer. From the information provided by you we are of the view that you have a sustainable claim for compensation arising as a result of the incident that occurred on the premises of K Mart Chatswood on 26th November, In relation to such claim we note that shop proprietors have a relatively stringent duty of care to members of the public that frequent their premises. In accordance with such duty, generally, proprietors of businesses must ensure that all areas upon which the general public have access are free of any obstacles and safe from any unforseen incidences. In light of the present state of our instructions we are of the view that a prima facie claim for compensation can be made on your behalf. Having regard to the actions of the employees of K Mart Chatswood in stacking the shelves whilst members of the public are in the immediate vicinity the proprietor of the supermarket would, in our opinion, be found to be negligent giving rise to your entitlement to compensation for the injuries. The amount of compensation that is payable to you is determined upon considering the extent of your initial injuries, the resultant disabilities arising from such injuries, the prognosis provided by your medical practitioners with regard to your symptomology and the amount of funds with which you are out ofpocket in relation to obtaining treatment for your continuing disabilities. The opinions of your treating medical practitioners are of the utmost importance with respect to compensation claims and it is essential that you continue to attend upon such practitioners in order to obtain appropriate treatment for your continuing disabilities. With respect to treatment we confirm your advice that notwithstanding obtaining physiotherapy you continue to suffer from disability in the neck region. In due course we shall request a report from your general practitioner as to your condition. We note that you are to discuss your overall condition with him upon your next attendance. At the present time we note that the accident is a relatively recent event and it is hoped that your continuing physical symptoms will reduce with appropriate treatment and time. Should you find that your symptoms fail to resolve or lessen consideration ought to be given in obtaining appropriate referrals to specialists in an endeavour to obtain further treatment. We note that we have attended to the service of a formal letter of demand upon the proprietor of K Mart Chatswood. We enclose herein copy of such letter for your attention. Upon receipt of a response from the proprietor we shall then contact the relevant insurer direct in an attempt to obtain a speedy resolution of this matter. As discussed with you, procedures involved in relation to a claim similar to yours will initially require informal discussions being undertaken with the insurer to allow them the opportunity to assess as to whether they are in fact liable for your injuries. In the majority of cases the relevant insurer will require an appropriate statement to be obtained from yourself by a loss assessor instructed by themselves. If such eventuates we feel that such interview ought to be undertaken in the presence of ourselves to ensure that your claim is not prejudiced. Upon receipt of any advice from such insurer as to an interview being undertaken we shall contact you in order to make suitable arrangements for such interview to take place in our office. After all investigations have been undertaken by the insurer, informal settlement negotiations will be carried out. Should the matter be unable to be resolved at that time it will be necessary for formal Court proceedings be filed before the District Court of New South Wales. Should we reach an impasse with the relevant insurer we will advise you further as to the formal procedures involved with respect to the preparation for filing of such a claim before the Court. We reiterate our advice to yourself that in the majority of cases an amicable settlement is able to be achieved without the necessity of proceeding to formal Court process. As indicated in conference we note that with respect to our professional fees such are charged at the conclusion of the matter and based upon the time expended by ourselves in the preparation and conduct of your claim. In the event that your claim is unsuccessful we note that we will not render a memorandum of professional fees with respect to acting on your behalf, however, note that with respect to any expenses or disbursements incurred by ourselves, including the payment of appropriate report fees and searches etc., that payment of such expenses be made by yourself upon incurring same. We shall contact you further upon receipt of advice from the relevant insurer of K Mart Chatswood.

As indicated to yourself, the Defendant has a period of 28 days after service of the Statement of Claim to file a Notice of Grounds of Defence. In the event that such Defence is not filed we can then seek default judgement. We do anticipate that the Defendant will defend the action and thereafter the matter will then be placed in the Court list to await the allocation of a callover date. We do note, in accordance with the current Court delays, it is unlikely that the matter will be allocated a further callover date within the next 18 months. Notwithstanding same we note that we shall keep you informed as to the progress of the matter. We thank you for the report received from Wynyard Sports Injury Clinic and note that such will assist with regard to Nicolas claim. Prior to Nicolas departure we did indicate to her that it was essential that she keep a record of all relevant practitioners upon whom she attends for treatment whilst she is overseas as it may be necessary to obtain appropriate reports from such practitioners during the course of her claim.

Accordingly, we have attended to the preparation of a District Court Statement of Claim for filing. We note that prior to filing the Statement of Claim it will be necessary for filing fees in the sum of 13500 be paid. Accordingly, we ask that you forward to us your cheque made payable to the District Court of New South Wales in the sum of As indicated to Nicola prior to leaving overseas, we are concerned as to what the prognosis will be with respect to her neck condition. This is particularly so having regard to aspects of her current employment and the necessity for her neck to be in a fixed position for lengthy periods of time. In accordance with the medical report obtained at the request of Coles Myer we note that it is their view that all of Nicolas present symptoms stem from her work and not from the incident that occurred on the 26th November We find this view totally inconsistent with Nicolas history and the views expressed by both Dr Dixon and Dr Bone. This is especially so when you have regard to Nicolas age. Should you have any queries with respect to the above please do not hesitate to contact the writer on 328 Yours faithfully, BOOTH MATHER BLACKMORE C. Blackmore940026 25 July 1994 Ms N.
