Under the lights along Marine Parade, the sunburnt holidaymakers strolled in bikinis and swimsuits, cars pulled in and out of the parking lot, childrens voices echoed back from the dark edge of the sea where the surf broke in a long glassy roll. The bay was fringed with great crags and scrubby headland, black against the night sky. The lighthouse on Breaksea flicked on and off, making a path across the ocean. Its a heavenly place, Esther, Ern said, and it seems to agree with you. Ive never seen you looking so well. I came all this way to comfort a widow and what do I find His voice sounded almost resentful. What did you expect to find she mocked him. Grief, bitterness, I dont know, but youve always been unpredictable. Why did you really come To take you back with me. Really Yes, until you get on your feet again. Merle and I discussed it, we want you to stay with us. And then Whatever you like. Find a place, perhaps, on the peninsula. You always loved it there. And settle down amongst all those millionaires, she said drily. Christ, Ern, the sale of my house wouldnt even buy a hut on the peninsula. You could find something small. Anyway, that was the plan, and instead dotted line Instead, she said, you find me here at the end of the world, looking content. Not exactly content, more like overexcited. Whats exciting you, Esther Is it the new novel Perhaps. Writers are so selfsufficient, he grumbled, I can never make them out. She laughed. I thought you spent your life doing just that. Oh yes, I try, but I never really understand them. I just publish them. And God knows how long that will last. Esther looked up, startled. What do you mean Ive been taken over. For a moment she wondered whether this was some kind of diabolic possession. Taken over she reiterated. The multinationals have got me, love. But why she said, already knowing the answer. Going broke, cant keep my head above water, getting too long in the tooth for it, all the wheeling and dealing. I just wanted to publish good books. She thought of the prodigious, restless energy of this large fat man and mourned for its passing. Will it change things she asked him. Theyve promised I can keep my own show going under their umbrella. Ive got a good list and they know it and my writers trust me. Dont they She nodded and put her hand over his pudgy fist. Weve built up mutual relationships but when dollars rule the roost, trust goes out the window. He hit the table, making the glasses dance. I valued my independence, Esther. Dont we all. Oh well, cant be helped. Everything changes. Remember He grinned at her and gulped his drink down. Weve all got to survive, except for poor bloody old Matt. How long is it now since hedotted line went Seven months. Time flies, he said, does it for you I meant to come long ago. He placed his big hand over hers. Forgive me, but Im glad youre still looking so lovely. Oh Ern, she said lightly, Im old and Im overweight and youre the only man on earth who still makes me feel beautiful. Thats because Im old and overweight and I love you, he said simply. I always have, but I worry about you because youre too far away. Whats this new novel like A mess. You always say that. Well, its at the messy stage when nothing comes quite right. Title Love Letters to a Friend. Good. Are they really letters Sort of letters, musings, reminiscences. Whats the plot Its postmodern it hasnt got one. It wont sell. Its a love story with a sad ending. But shes reconciled. Thatll sell. He raised his glass. Well, heres to it. No good asking when you expect to finish She raised her eyebrows at him. Okay, he grumbled, but dont shillyshally too long. Its been three years since that childrens book and how long since your last novel There was that collection of short stories but no novel since The Fatal River, thats too long, Esther. He wheeled her down the road towards the beach, past the sign that warned fishermen about the king waves rolling in from nowhere to sweep them off the rocks into the sea. The crowds had thinned out, only a few children from the caravan park played on the promontories of seaweed thrusting out into the surf. A lone swimmer struck out for the little jetty, where the fishermen were unpacking their tackle. She sat in the half darkness, her white hair and silky dress phosphorescent in the light off the waves. Are you really lonely, Esther he asked her. Yes, but usually Ive got Clarrie with me. Your housekeeper Weve known each other off and on forever. We even went to primary school together, but shes away just now looking after her daughters children. So how do you manage Oh, people come in. Ive got somebody now, a temporary, but shes back with her family over Christmas. What about your secretary Hes quite competent. So youre all organised. He paused. But what about real people, people to relate to Theyre all real, Ern, she said gently. I know I sound like an awful snob, but you know what I mean. Intellectuals I dont know any of them any more. And dont miss them Of course, she said drily, but youd be surprised what you can find hidden away in a little town like this. A lover She grinned up at him. How did you know Its written all over you. She grimaced. As obvious as all that To me, yes. I hope he treats you well. So do I, she said, suddenly serious, and shivered. As the hire car sped up Ocean Beach Drive, she looked up automatically towards the mountain slope, checking on Bens windows, but everything was still dark. My eldest child lives up there, she said. Hes fortyfive years old and I cant believe it. How have I managed to survive for so long How have any of us he said. Do you see much of him No, but at least I know hes there. Do you ever see Stephen now No, I dont even know if hes still alive. I bet he is, Ern said. Stephen was tough. Dont you remember all those cases he won against impossible odds, when we were all communists together Stephen was never a communist, Esther said, he was too smart for that. He was always the fellow traveller hanging round the fringes. Whereas you and I and Matt were in it once, boots and all, Ern said. Do you know what annoys me most about my years in the party now That for so long we were apparently content to take the word of men who were our intellectual inferiors. Why did we do it, Esther Because we wanted to change the world, she said. Because we wanted to believe. Matt had been expelled from the communist party for criticising the leadership. Esther, Ern and Merle had left after the Hungarian uprising, although Esther had been under a political cloud since shed disappeared into Europe with Paul and hadnt come back to Australia for seven years. A responsible cadre didnt throw the party over for sex and travel. And now, Ern said, therere no communists left and were both members of the largest political party on earth, the excommunists. Matt said they were doing it all over again and theyd get it right next time. Ern grunted. Matt was a political optimist. They followed the turnoff to the point, past the golf links, the lake and the bird sanctuary. Youre hiding something, Esther, he said. Dont be ridiculous, what have I got to hide I dont know, but I intend to find out. A promise or a threat she said. As they drove into the garden, they could hear the phone ringing through the empty house. Do you want me to answer that Ern asked her, and, at her nod, went lumbering across the lawn with surprising agility for such a heavy man. He came back to the car looking puzzled. Its some girl, she wouldnt give me her name. Sounded a bit hysterical, I couldnt really make head or tail of it. I think I know who it is. Want me to head her off No, Id better talk to her. Better face the bloody music, whatever it is, she thought, but when she picked up the phone, her hand was shaking. Listen, bitch, hissed the thin, hoarse voice, y better get round ere quick an bail out y precious boyfriend. I beg your pardon Esther said. Beg y pardon, mocked the voice. Dont give me none a that posh shit an dont hang up on me neither. Either y come for im now or the coppers will, so take y pick. I dont know your address. Last house above the harbour under the mountain, y cant miss it. It looks like shit The phone clicked off in her ear. Whats the matter Ern said, his hand on her shoulder. Would you mind. she said, it seems as if I have to go on a rescue mission. Even with the map, it took them a while to find the place, a dark deadend tucked away amongst the scrub under a granite outcrop, a lockedup silent street except for one shabby little fibro set off by itself in an overgrown garden. The front door was wide open, blazing with nightlight and noise. A police car was parked out front. Stop here, Ern, Esther told him, and turn out your lights. Struggling between the meaty hands of two local police, Billy erupted onto the front porch, both arms bandaged and twisted up behind him, while Iris stood screaming abuse in the doorway. Whatve I done Billy wailed. Wherere y takin me Down to the station, Billy, well sort it all out down there. Billy sat down in the middle of the concrete path, his head buried in his knees. Better cool it, mate, the first policeman said. Billy raised his arms in a melodramatic gesture, the blood seeping beneath the bandages. Look what y done now. He turned his pitiful face towards Iris. I try t die for y an y put me inter the coppers. Iris tore down the path and threw her arms around Billys neck. Dont touch im she screamed, aiming a knee at the sergeants groin. Listen, missus, you watch out or Ill put you on a charge, he said angrily. It was you rung us up, remember. It was you charged im with assault in the first place. Let im go, Iris sobbed, I didnt mean none of it. Do y withdraw the charge then, madam Yairs, Iris wailed, I want im back. Okay, its your funeral. But dont go wastin our time again bringin us out ere on a wild goose chase or youll find yself in serious trouble. Grumbling, they climbed into the police car. The driver put his head out the window. If I was you, Billy, he said sardonically, Id get them wrists seen to in casualty. They might turn septic. They drove away down the dark street as all the curtains twitched back into place. I cant handle it, Iris, Billy sobbed, I just cant handle it any more. Cmon, Iris crooned, cmon now, love. She lifted him up and lugged him back along the path into the house. Lets go home, Ern, said Ether. Afterwards they sat out on the front verandah, smoking cigarillos, and sipping whisky and ice, listening in the stillness to the occasional plop and splash of bird or fish on the surface of the river."
