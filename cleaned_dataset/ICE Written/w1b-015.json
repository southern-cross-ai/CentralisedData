    "text": "Thursday 2nd June Dear Dad, Thanks for the letter hope you survived your busy week. Thanks for the tape, too. Ive listened to about half of it so far. Ive had 2 prac exams this week Chem and Biol. Chem was OK because we could take in our notes and all we had to do was identify 2 organic unknowns. One of mine was acetic acid which was quite obvious from the smell but I had to go through all the motions of identifying it anyway The other one was more difficult. Biology was a real killer 10 stations in 10 minutes and at each one we had to identify parts of a dissection or slides then answer questions about functions etc. I unreadable know one mistake I made identified cartilage for bone and then went on to answer all the questions for that part on cartilage, but I hope I went OK on all the other parts. After this 4 of us went to a cafeacute in Newtown complained about it for about an hour. Thats about all Newtown is good for, its coffee shops Weve had less lectures this week in preparation for exams. Ive just finished my B.S. assignment but I cant tell you if its good or not because its too soon after I wrote it to be objective. Did you read in Column 8 on Wednesday about the farmers who got a cheque in the mail for a couple of thousand dollars That was the parents of a College friend of mine, Kirsty Kreig. She lives in the corridor I used to live in in Langley. The sore on my ankle I told you about got worse after I started putting Peranyl on it. Its better now although the redness and swelling has increased, the scalyness has gone. Pretty tricky of you to do a diagnosis over the phone, I think Somebody asked me the other day what you did, and when I told them they said how is that different from a GP and would you believe I didnt know apart from the extra years of study. Ive actually often wondered that myself, so please fill me in or tell Mum to since shell probably be writing next. Glad to hear Graeme finally caught a fish and would he like me to take him fishing in the holidays Last day of lectures tomorrow and its hard to believe Ive been here nearly 6 months. In a way I fell like Ive been here forever but it also doesnt seem that long. Has Chrysilla or Annette had their baby yet If yes please fill me in Must go now to post before next lectures. Love from Stephanie xox xox P.S. Sorry about the messy fast lecturerstyle writing but its 45 pm next lecture is at 3 and I have to buy stamps. P.P.S. Did you send my Naprosyn yet Tuesday, July 19th Dear Mum, Not much time has passed since I came back to College, but I thought you could probably tolerate a short letter. I hope, with musical everything, that youre not too busy, driving thingsdotted line As you may remember, I was planning to take Ballet this semester however it is not going ahead due to lack of demand. Something much better is, though Bridge I will certainly enrol, even the time is convenient Tuesdays from 30pm 30pm. Massage is being run as a 2day seminar on 2 consecutive Saturdays, which means I can also do that. There is also a day of sailing on Sunday, September 17th during which you learn to sail then sail around the harbour or so the brochure says. This sounds good but from memory this is the day you are coming to Sydney and without a doubt I would rather see you Could you send me your times days of arrival departure please We are considering changing our BS topic to Adoption nobody could find much on domestic violence. I have got 3 results back so far for chem physics exams I got 73, for physics pracs 85 for BS assignment interviews I got 86 which I was very happy with. My tutor said of my assignment This paper is very good though you could have done a little more background research. You write with an impressive level of sophistication . Id be happy for you to read it but dont know whether that would be appropriate or not In our 1st Anatomy lecture yesterday we were given the following list of vaccinations we have to have Hep B Rubella TB Measles Tetanus Mumps Diptheria Polio Next week we are having a Mantoux test for TB if we are negative, we are then vaccinated. I assume I have had all the others except Hep B, which consists apparently of 3 needles then a blood test, so Ill have it at the Uni health service if possible. As well as new doors, Williams 2nd floor has also a new extra phone, at the other end of the corridor to me. This will cut the incoming calls by half, or more, because most calls are for the other end of the corridor I guess they have more friends down there So life in Williams is getting better better I enclose a copy of my semester timetable just for interest. Cant wait to come home again. Lots of love to everyonedotted line love from Stephanie xoxox P.S. I found this petrol docket in my purse from the holidays. P.P.S. Its freezing in Sydney P.P.P.S Liz. was very grateful for the law handbook xox Saturday, July 23rd Dear Mum, I know you only spoke to me last night but Im so HOMESICK that I just HAD to write a litterdotted line it was either that or ring you again I have done a very excellent thing, and that is changed my flight from Sunday August 7th to Monday 8th at 10am. So I can spend an extra day at home all I have on that Monday is 2 lectures since ICB pracs are not on and the BS tutorial is only once a fortnight. I also rang Alison, so here are the plans for tonight pick me up at 15 pm, go to Cronulla for dinner, then go to a dance party at Caringbah then go to Craigs house dont know where that is. Alisons phone number in Newtown is 5l99613 not that I want you to ring her but just in case. Its always difficult in College to find someone to tell them what you are doing so theyll actually remember the important details time you were coming back just in case you dont, which I think is quite important in Sydney especially. They said they will then drive me home in the morning on Sunday, which is not exactly what I want to do but I guess Ill survive itdotted line Kim Childs has got about 6 letters this week, her father must be the head of Australia Post. It is pouring today, the day I wanted to do my washing I did it anyway because in terms of undies I am in dire straits The most recent intercollege competition is sculling, ie. drinking a whole glass of alcohol in one gulp. It was on last wednesday night at the University Bar needless to say I did not attend. They chose the Womens team at the Sports dinner on Tuesday night we had invited Wesley Sancta girls and all the coaches to College and they had a special sports dinner with us. After dinner whenever someone made a speech or whenever a team was mentioned, they had to scull it was foul. They have this a rather rude song that people sing at and at the end they sing Down, down, down, down until the person has sculled their drink. Dad was college like this when you went Cant wait to come home Cant wait to come home Cant wait to come home I love you all this much Love from Stephanie P.S. Its your fault that Im so homesick, if I hadnt had such a good holiday I would have been glad to get back to Uni PPS Since its your fault, you have to fix it and that means lots of LETTERS andor PICTURES as the case may be xox Thursday, July 28th Dear Mum, Thank you for being so very nice to me this week, while I have been lonely. Im feeling better today especially since I decided to write to you. We had dinner with Andrews last night, I didnt speak to one guy the whole night. It was not very well organised most of the girls sat on one side of the room the guys on the other not really intentionally but not many people could really be bothered on a weeknight. Some people did mix, however, and went to the Andrews bar afterwards. In Anatomy tutorial yesterday we had our Mantoux text I dont have a red mark yet. Have I been vaccinated for TB Im also going to arrange my Hepatitis B vaccinations today. Have you got my other letter yet I washed my woollen skivvy yesterday the instructions said to roll in a towel then dry flat in the shade. So until this morning it has been drying on my bedroom floor, but I got sick of avoiding it so I hung it on the line. I dont remember you drying things flat, so I dont think Ill bother anymore. Im not starting until 10am today because we dont have every ICB lecture every week. I have a history philosophy tutorial which I really enjoy, the tutor is actually a Biochem unreadable lecturer but he knows a lot of history has been almost everywhere. He is very old he just rambles on about Rome, and the Age of Enlightenment. We did a quiz last week to see what our history background was I only knew 1 question our of at least 50 that was what do AD BC stand for My history is really very bad I didnt even know what the Magna Carta was, let alone who signed it when Next monday the editor of Cleo the womens magazine is speaking at formal dinner. It will be interesting because these speeches usually have a my advice to you young women segment I wonder what her advice would be Maybe shell distribute free Cleos. Please tell Peter Graeme GOOD LUCK for the musical, you wont get this until tomorrow but tell them anyway. Im sending it Express Post because I hate having a letter on the way over the weekend especially if you ring me hint, hint This weekend Im staying in and working, working, working so that next unreadable weekend when I come home I dont have to worry about doing work. Im looking forward to coming home so much that I cant stop thinking about it. Its very opportune that there is also a med harbour cruise on that weekend whenever someone asks me if Im going I can tell them that Im going home that weekend . Its excellent However, if they dont live at College they often dont ask why, which is the second important part, so I tell them anyway My brothers are in the school musical one of them has a lead role . In fact the way I say it I think it sounds like Peter is the big star in an enormous Broadway production, but never mind. People who dont live in college dont appreciate what a big thing it is to go home. Kim is going Crosscountry skiing with the bushwalking club this weekend near Thredbo. She unreadable asked me if I wanted to go but said no, I really do have to work this weekend. It costs 130 and its a beginners course, so it sounds good."
