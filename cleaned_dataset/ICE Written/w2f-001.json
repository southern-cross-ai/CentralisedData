    "text": "CLOUD STREET Tim Winton Through the crowd she sees the bloke leaning on the first pillar above the post office steps, and her first impulse is to go on ahead and buy those salmon and onion sandwiches at Coles and forget the whole flamin thing. Hes not bad looking. Good suit, nice pair of shoes. Glasses, though he doesnt seem the squinty, limp type. Hatless. A bit of an individual, it seems. Shes too nervous for this. Whats a bloke like that want with a shopgirl like her Hes no run of the mill lair. Hes the sort of man you pray will come out of the smoky gloom and ask you for a dance. Rose wheels back for another look and finds herself going up the steps. Now or never, Rosie. When she gets to him, his eyebrows rise and Rose feels herself being given the onceover. Before he can, she gets the first word in. Gday, Earl. Havent strained yourself, have you He smiles indulgently. Hello. I thought youd be a looker. Boom goes Roses heart. They stand there a full moment in the spring sunshine with people coming and going around them, posties wheeling past on their heavy old PMG bikes. You hungry Rose asks. I am. Yes, yes, lets get a bite. They wind up at the sandwich counter in Coles and Rose forgoes the salmon and onion. They eat and Rose swings on her stool like a girl, waiting. This bloke seems different to men shes known. Theres no big talk, no flashing of money, no nervous guffaws. Ill guess and you tell me how close I am, he said, wiping his fingers on greaseproof paper. You left school at fifteen. Your dad votes Labor, you play netball, youd like to be a lawyers secretary and you sleep with your socks on. Rose smiles and knows whatever she says will sound stupid. Patchy, she says, but boring enough to get me right. Whats your name Rosemary. Rose. Yes, she says relieved. What a talker. You need the switchboard between us, do you, before you can really fire I spose Im used to it. I suddenly dont know what to talk about. Football The common cold Just ask me out, she says. Lets go out together. Friday. Youre a reporter, she says. You went to uni, your parents live in Nedlands and youve tried to teach yourself to talk like one of us. Us Friday, she says. Meet me at Shenton Park station. Seven oclock. Bye. She slides off her stool, minding her stockings. She steps out into the sunshine and has to concentrate to find her way back to work, though its barely a block away and shes walked it every lunch hour for years. Well, she thinks, hardly believing her cool delivery. Well. She wondered about her guess. A reporter Yes, shed seen those blokes around. Fast movers, funny, sharp, always asking and watching. Yes, hed be right there in the thick of it. Hed know politicians and criminals. Hed be a mover and shaker. Well, well. Toby Raven At sixthirty that Friday, Rose was waiting outside the Shenton Park station. He lurched up in a Morris Oxford and nearly took her left hip from its moorings. The first thing she learnt about Toby Raven was that he couldnt exactly drive. He made his way, but thats the best you could call it. Rose climbed in, suddenly twice as nervous, and they hopped away. Well, well, he murmured, smiling widely at her after a few moments. Hello, said Rose. Hello. Toby sent the car in a swoon towards the kerb and Rose prayed that he would never again feel moved to take his eyes off the road. Itd taken all afternoon to dress for this, and she could barely move for starch with her nervousness turning so quickly to naked fear, the sweat on her steamed up the tulle and the car began to smell like a laundry. She pulled the wrinkles out of her gloves and tried not to ruin her lipstick with gnashing as they drove beneath the long shadow of Kings Park and beside the river reclamation to the lights of the city centre. Gawd, she thought, this should be a fabulous feeling cruising with a beau if only a girl wasnt afraid of dying. She sat back as Toby swooped and swerved, grunted and grated, and took deep breaths as the colours of the city broke over her she did a real job of seeming perfectly serene. They passed through the high class end of town with its grand hotels and ballrooms to cross the railway bridge into shabby streets and boozers parks. Toby wedged the car up on a kerb with a thud that nearly put Roses head through the roof. He sighed triumphantly. Lets go in. Rose couldnt see anywhere likely to be an eating establishment. There were shopfronts, houses, shadowy doorways. She got out and smelled garlic. Youve gone to a lot of trouble, Toby said beside her. It was hard to tell what he meant, but she smoothed her great full skirt graciously all the same. He led her to a narrow doorway where a big, bumperbreasted woman met them and took them down to a crowded, smoky room full of tables, chairs, tablecloths, candles, laughing people, chinking glass and cutlery. Great vats of spaghetti were carried past by boys, and jugs of wine that reminded Rose of nosebleeds. People seemed to be speaking all kinds of languages, and some seemed to know Toby. They sat at a small waxspattered table, and bread was brought. It wasnt exactly the dining room at the Palace Hotel. Where are we she said, trying to look pleased. Marias. This is where the real people come. Rose felt her cheeks glowing. Beaut How do you like your spaghetti Oh, she huffed, like my tea as it comes. He laughed. Youre not about to let me go on that tea business are you Listen, she owned up, I dont know a thing about spaghetti. Or the real people. Ill just have whatever you reckon. Two carbonaras, he told the boy. And a jug. Do you come here a lot Yes, all the time. Terrific place. Its a hideaway for those in the know, you might say. We all come here. Makes a bit of a change from the old mutton and boiled veg. Toby smiled at someone over Roses shoulder and now and then she sensed an eyebrow raised. You know all these people I know who they are and they know who I am. Some of us are friends, associates, old flames. Im clubbish, youd have to say its my last concession to a bourgeois past. Rose tried not to panic. You okay Rose strangled out a yes. Youre not nervous Dont be nervous. Im quite safe, you know. Not respectable but I am able to restrain myself with a lady. Rose smiled. She ran her fingers along the checked tablecloth. What are you thinking You want to go home Were different, said Rose. You dont know a thing about me he protested gaily. Then tell me. What do you do Is a man only what he does No, Rose said, only what he is, I spose. Well, Rose, youre dead right. Im a hack. A journalist on the Daily. I is probably what I does. Youve been to university, or something, havent you Ah, sharp lady. See, were different. So what Rose smiled. You write, then Well, you couldnt call what I do writing, though I do scribble a bit in my own time. Do you read Yes, she said breathlessly, I read. Thank God. Thank Jesus, Mary and Josephus, she reads Rose, youre a lovely girl. The moment I heard your snooty twang on the phone I knew it was love. See, were not so different. Rose laughed. Toby was so confident, his face so full of mad expression, his hands seemed to crackle with animation. He fitted the din and swirl of this place. The spaghetti came with wine and salad. Rose hadnt eaten since breakfast, so she went to work. It was like eating kite string but the wine soon took the awkwardness out of it. Tell me who you read, he said with a lump of cheese camping on his chin. Oh, Gawd. Dont be shy. I love books. My rooms is full of them. I read the whole Geraldton library endtoend when I was a kid. Name some names. But Rose didnt know names, she only remembered stories. You name some, she said. Toby grinned, closed his eyes Hammett, Steinbeck, Hemingway, James Jones, Mailer, D. H. Lawrence. Xavier Herbert, Sillitoe, Camusdotted line She let him go on and on in a winy whirl as people brushed by with friendly nods and vats of red sauce. Their duffle coats and minks flapped, their pockets jingled, their laughter blanketed Rose Pickles in, warm as all getout. Rose had enough wine in her to keep calm as they jerked their way through the traffic to the Esplanade. The lights of the river seemed more beautiful than shed seen them. The palm trees along the foreshore cast weird silhouettes. One of the worlds strangest towns, said Toby, aiming them down Riverside Drive. I wouldnt know, said Rose. Perth is the biggest country town in the world trying to be a city. The most isolated country town in the world trying to be the most cutoff city in the world, trying desperately to hit the big time. Desert on one side, sea on the other. Philistine fairground. Theres something nesting here, something horrible waiting. Ambition, Rose. It squeezes us into corners and turns out ugly shapes. You must see a lot of things, said Rose, hating herself for sounding so wideeyed. Too many things. Rose thought of morgues, cells, the steps of aeroplanes, the flash of camera bulbs. Her world was mundane and domestic in the high times. In the low times dotted line she couldnt even think of those times. The night wasnt big enough for all those feelings. Toby jacknifed the Morris into a carpark across the river from Crawley. The university clock was lit and it stood above the trees, the lamps, the water. Thats nice, she said. No, he murmured. This is nice. Rose took the kiss and was surprised at how soft his skin was. She slid in close to him. Nice is a terrible, bourgeois word, said Toby catching a breath. Whatever, said Rose, whatever. She loved the smooching sound of the upholstery. She stopped being kissed and started kissing. She held his head, felt his hands on her back, in her hair. Just switching you through, she murmured, trying not to giggle. Rose Pickles, he said. His hand was between her breasts and she left it there as the river went by and by. Oh, Rose, you loved me. How you did. And there you go drifting by with the river, out on an eddy in a black, shiny Morris Oxford with a man who quotes D.H. Lawrence with his tongue in your ear and cheese on his chin. How you longed, how you stared at me those thundery nights when we all tossed and the house refused to sleep. Its gone for you now, but for me the water backs into itself, comes around, joins up in the great, wide, vibrating space where everything that was and will be still is. For me, for all of us sooner or later, all of it will always be. And some of you will be forever watching me on the landing. Back at his flat, Rose falls on the bed thinking dammitall Im twentyfour years old, as her acre of tulle comes away and his hands run down her legs to peel her stockings I want him. She feels the air cool on her shins and draws him down. He slides into her and its as hard as the recesses of her heart and wonderful, only unlike Rose Pickles heart it stops beating and lurching and loses its steel and lets her down into a sad melancholy quiet."
