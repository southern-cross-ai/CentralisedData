    "text": "Courage They spell it C.A.T.S Flag path plotted in field of desire By GLENN MCFARLANE GEELONG buried the fragile image when it shoved Carlton out of the premiership race with a 33point victory at Waverley yesterday. In one of the most courageous finals wins in memory, the Cats won after losing three stars before the start of yesterdays semifinal. Those who arrived at the ground early yesterday gave the Cats little chance of staying in the race for its first flag in 31 years. For it was early that the whispers were out OUT dotted line Brownlow Medal fancy Garry Hocking, captain Mark Bairstow and 1989 Brownlow Medallist Paul Couch. Into the team came veteran Tim Darcy, onegame rookie Aaron Lord and fringe player Sean Simpson. Geelong fans would have been excused for packing their bags and heading home before the first bounce. But most of them, and the rest of the 53,000 there hadnt reckoned on sheer mental and physical desire coupled with outstanding play. And all plotted by a match committee courageous enough not to risk injured players. The result was that the Cats surprised everyone and controlled the match all day. Victory and the possible return of the three stars next week lifted them into a preliminary final showdown against North Melbourne. For Carlton, it was the end of 1994 a shattering conclusion to a year that promised so much, but delivered even less than last year. Geelong showed desire, speed and spirit to outpoint Carlton. Its courage was everywhere, right down to two players on the interchange bench injured during the game. Strong contributors Peter Riccardi and Grant Tanner were forced to watch the emphatic last quarter from the sidelines. Tanner set the early initiative for Geelong with a blistering opening quarter in the middle. He took on and beat Adrian Gleeson, winning 11 possessions in the first quarter. Tanners influence was later dampened by Andrew McKay before he was injured in the third quarter. But the two men who stood defiant and dominant were John Barnes and Liam Pickering both rejects from other clubs. Ruckman Barnes played another slashing finals match to eclipse big man Justin Madden and rookie Matthew Allan. He beat allcomers in ruck duels and around the ground. Barnes, rated 10outof10 by Sunday Herald Sun expert Neil Roberts, was understandably exhausted on the final siren. Pickering was no less busy. Assigned the task of playing on one of the competitions best Greg Williams Pickering outpointed Williams in the first half to give Geelong a great start. Williams fought hard to get back in the match after halftime and after being reported for disputing an umpires decision just before halftime. But Pickering was not just content to keep an eye on Williams. He was so outstanding in overall matchplay that in the end his possession tally was only a few short of his decorated opponent. Gary Ablett, who captained his Cats yesterday, kicked six goals in another display worthy of high praise. His majors were crucial to Geelong, especially two late in the third quarter. As Carlton made a secondhalf charge at Geelong, Ablett stood firm with two strong marks in attack. His task was made easier by the absence of Steve Silvagni, who injured his ankle late in the first quarter and eventually came off early in the second. But Ablett had plenty of help in attack the everimproving David Mensch, Adrian Hickmott and last weeks hero, Bill Brownless. Brownless had good duels with Michael Sexton and Earl Spalding. The Blues had to rely on whatever they could get out of Williams to give them drive from the middle. Stephen Kernahan tried his hardest, but managed only a limited return. He almost got them back in the game before the Cats defence tightened again. Andrew McKay was important and probably Carltons best, along with the evertrying Matthew Hogg. Geelong took the match by the throat in the first quarter with a fourgoal blitz against the wind. Its 15point quartertime lead didnt look like diminishing early in the second. Aaron Lord gave Geelong speed and the forwards continued to get on top of the reputed rock steady Carlton defence. At halftime the margin was out to 28 points. Tanner was stretchered from the ground early in the third, forcing Geelongs first interchange move, while Carlton got the margin back to just 15 points midway through the quarter. But Geelong, through Ablett, burst the margin out to 26 at the last change. The Cats turned defensive in the last quarter, clinging desperately to the advantage, which they blew out to 33 points. It was fitting that Brownless held the ball as the siren rang. He was the man who kicked the winning goal after the siren last week against Footscray. Yesterday his kick went into the stands as he celebrated another important Geelong finals win. With the possibility of regaining the three missing players plus outstanding onballer Michael Mansfield next weekend, Geelong will go into the match against North Melbourne brimming with confidence that finally, it can break its long premiership drought. EAGLES SET PACE By MARK HARDING MICK Malthouse does not know if he will stay with West Coast beyond 1995 but with him or without him the Eagles seem set to power through the 90s with the brand of dour, tough, relentless football he has taught them. One of the features of the Eagles in their three Grand Final appearances has been the ability to keep the same group of inform players together 15 of the side that decimated Geelong yesterday took part in the 1992 flag victory. And if Malthouse has doubts about his own willingnes to continue beyond his current contract which expires at the end of next season, he has no such doubts about the ability of his men to keep going. Only fullback Michael Brennan, who has been there since the AFL created the monster Malcolm Blights words in 1987 and is the club games record holder, has expressed any doubts about continuing. And with just two 30yearolds Peter Wilson and David Hart in the side the bulk should be around for years to come. This was the Grand Final every Victorian at the MCG yesterday dreaded not so much the West Coast victory, because they left no doubt they were the worthiest of flag winners. More, it was the confirmation that Geelong had played its Grand Final before it even stepped on to the turf. Coach Malcolm Blight refused to admit that several of his stars, including Gary Ablett, went into the Grand Final well down on fitness. Instead he said the task of winning four finals was too tough. I think you always think that you can beat history, he said. But as he explained, no side had ever been able to do what was asked of the Cats and to ask it against such a professional side as the Eagles was almost ludicrous. For a while Geelong, which has been more responsible than any team for a superb finals series, kept rolling and fighting on the spirit that had taken them to two afterthesiren victories. After being jumped by the Eagles they fought back to grab a quarter time lead but from there, with Garry Hocking injured and the rest of the midfield down, they were outbussled, outtackled and outran. Malthouse tried hard to absolve himself of any responsibility for an awesome performance he praised his men for their thoroughness and dedication, sympathised with Blight and Geelong and avoided questions about his own emotions. When pressed he admitted fear of failure was still his driving force and said he was not worried by the image Victorians had of him as a dour, humorless man who did not enjoy his football. I will enjoy it with my family and friends, he said smiling. Continued Page 44 Eagles the benchmark FROM Page 43 I love watching the boys enjoy the spoils of their discipline and dedication, Malthouse said. I get a bigger kick out of the players celebrating I feel happy for them. Malthouse began his postmatch press conference by criticising pressmen who bagged him for cutting short last weeks conference to attend a basketball game. He explained his daughter was playing in her first basketball final nothing ever takes precedence over that, he said. Malthouse spoke of his family again when he said yesterdays win would not sway him in any decision he made about his future. After 1995 he will assess what is best for his family before deciding whether to come back to Victoria or seek another term with the Eagles. While nothing is permanent in footy, he could expect to have the job for as long as he wants it. The former Richmond defender has instilled an evenness and discipline in the Eagles that might not always make for attractive football, but is mighty effective on the scoreboard. Im not interested in goals for, it is goals against that worry me, he said revealing his philosophy. Ironically yesterdays tally went against the norm. The Eagles kicked 20 goals for only the second time this season and powered to their highest score for the season. In contrast Geelongs score was its lowest for the year. What tells you even more about the Eagles style of play is that they were able to kick such a massive score with their fullforward Peter Sumich badly beaten and their only other tall forward, Jason Ball, a spirited, but far from the most significant contributor. The Premiers goals came from swoopers Heady, Kemp, Wilson, Evans, Bond, Lewis and Waterman. When the Eagles won in 92, they were characterised as a group of anonymous runners every one knows who they are now, but they are still a side driven by team discipline rather than individual brilliance. Malthouse summed up the attitude when asked to pay a tribute to Norm Smith Medal winner Dean Kemp. I thought he played well, but I thought he had a lot of friends though, the coach said. Kemp indeed had friends everywhere. Probably only Michael Mansfield and Bill Brownless could claim individual victories for the Cats. The rest simply were outmuscled by a team Victorians will say had the premiership handed to them on a plate by the AFL. The reality, though, is that the best team of 1994 won the premiership. Their banner before the match declared Watch out were back. Theyll be back next year too. Rafter ready for Kiwi WIMBLEDON doubles champions Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde yesterday gave Australia a 21 lead in the Davis Cup qualifying tie over New Zealand at King Edward Barracks. The world No. 2 team destroyed Kiwi parttimers Kelly Evernden and Brett Steven 63, 64, 61 in 81 scintillating minutes before a stunned capacity crowd. The victory put the tie in Australias favor and left new captain John Newcombe on the brink of his first tie success. I was confident before the match that Mark and Todd could do the job and they did, Newcombe said. They played exceptionally well, but the match was a little tighter than the score would suggest. Todd played as well as Ive ever seen him and Mark played pretty well too. The Australians, beaten in the US Open final two weeks ago and vanquished in their past two Davis Cup encounters, ruthlessly punished the Kiwis after a tense opening. Woodbridge, now unquestionably in the best form of his career, was the dominant player in a wonderful display of returning and volleying. The pair directed most of their attacks at semiactive Evernden, 33, and the plan paid immediate dividends for the first break of serve in the seventh game of the first set. At one stage, with Evernden desperately attempting to leave Cup competition on a winning note, the Australians won nine of 10 games. They just buried us, said plucky Evernden. They have such a variety of shots and tactics that its almost impossible to match them. I was hoping for better, obviously. But I cant change anything now nor would I want to. We were beaten by a far better team. Woodbridge and Woodforde endured a second set revival by the Kiwis before surging to victory. The pair saw a 51 lead dry up before Steven, unusually vulnerable on serve, again dropped his delivery against the fierce Australian returning in the 10th game."
