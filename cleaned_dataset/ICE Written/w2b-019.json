    "text": "33 The Keating coup The recession and the GST got Hawke. Paul Keating, January l992 I Support for the Hawke government collapsed after its l990 election victory, due to public disenchantment, a protracted recession and a leadership struggle. The recession demoralised Labor. It meant that Labors economic policy, judged by its own criterion, had failed. The paradox of Labors fourth term is that Hawke, a four times election winner, fell victim to the recession and that Keating, despite his unpopularity, finally deposed Hawke. The leadership crisis in Labors fourth term was triggered by Hawkes decision to repudiate the l988 Kirribilli agreement and remain as prime minister and Keatings refusal to accept this and his resort to a challenge. Once Hawke told Keating on 3l January 1991 that he was breaking their agreement, a leadership challenge was inevitable. Keating, denied a managed transition, sought the mantle by force. A few months after the election Kim Beazley, a Hawke loyalist, rated a Hawke retirement during the term at a 90 per cent probability a misplaced judgement. Hawke had never completely closed the door on this option in talks with Keating before the 1991 challenge. But ALP national secretary Bob Hogg had a different view I dont think that Hawke had any intention of delivering on the Kirribilli Agreement and leaving.1 Keating had a choice he could submit to Hawke or put the issue before the party through a challenge. The Labor leadership was a likely poisoned chalice with the collapse of Labors fourth term position creating the basis for a coalition win at the next election. But Hawke and Keating, like figures in a Shakespearian tragedy, were compelled by their history and their natures to their battle. Each man had a dual identity Hawke the successful prime minister who refused to recognise the exhaustion of his tenure, and Keating the legitimate successor whose optimum time to become a successful prime minister had passed. Keatings mistake was to belittle Hawke, thereby turning Hawke against his retirement with dignity option. Hawke convinced himself that Keatings claim was illegitimate that he was entitled to defy Keating and dishonour his pledge. As their mutual obsession intensified, Keating decided to challenge Hawke rather than leave politics and Hawke, in turn, decided his responsibility was not to manage a smooth transition but to stay in office. After the 1990 election the Hawke government was changed in power and personality dimensions. Keating became deputy unopposed after Lionel Bowens retirement. The left won three Cabinet posts, for Howe, Hand and Bolkus, and was fully integrated, ready for the strangest political alliance of the Hawke era Hawke and the left against Keating. The right wing emerged stronger but divided. Beazley took the main microreform portfolio, transport and communications Kerin remained in resources and primary industry Crean became a junior minister and Ray and Richardson had senior Cabinet posts. Evans stayed foreign minister and Willis became finance minister. This was a diverse group but in policy terms it was more sympathetic to Hawkes gradualism than to Keatings firmer economic line. Hawke was positioning Crean and Beazley against Keating. At the same time the 1980s era economic ministers the engine room of that government were outflanked Walsh went to the backbench, Button survived on borrowed time, Dawkins was unpopular within the party. This group, which had been Keatings Cabinet base, was no longer the anchor of the Hawke Cabinet. Keatings grip on the Cabinet was slipping and Hawkes was tightening. Hawke, in fact, had wanted a bigger restructuring, and had spoken to Button, Willis and Richardson about their leaving politics. Richardson was shocked when Hawke had sounded him out on a possible retirement and overseas posting he rang Keating at once You wont believe what the bastards just suggested. Yet Richardson himself had told Hawke to dump Button and Willis Hawke wrote a letter to Beazley in April 1990 declaring that Labors fourth term would be judged by its microreforms, and instructing Beazley to pursue this agenda with determination. This went to the core of the case against Hawke that since its May 1988 Economic Statement the government had been drifting and Hawkes shelflife as prime minister had virtually expired. The malaise continued from Labors third term into its fourth by 1990 the government was adrift, devoid of any strategic leadership. Hawke remained a relatively popular leader with an approval rating in the 4045 per cent range, but leadership had ceased largely to be an electoral asset for the Labor Party. Labors support fell to below 35 per cent of the primary vote. After the 1990 election Keating moved to stake his claim to the leadership on policy grounds he threw himself at the microreform agenda and ridiculed Hawkes technique of reform by consensus. The battlefield was telecommunications reform, where Hawke was aligned with Beazley to introduce a competitive duopoly in the local industry while Keating sought to replace Telecoms monopoly with a fully competitive model. It was a bitter, emotional, and symbolic struggle. Keating assumed for himself the crash through or crash mantle of policy leadership. By his actions Keating claimed to be the real leader, replacing Hawke. The irony is that Keatings fury only accentuated the growing Cabinet majority for Hawke. The dramatic moment in the communications battle came when Keating, frustrated beyond endurance, threw his pen on the table and walked out of the Cabinet room complaining, This is a fucking secondrate decision from a secondrate government. Keatings nemesis, Robert Ray, taunted, Go on, spit the dummy. But Keating was being driven by power, not just ideology, in this dispute. Hawke asked himself one question why was Keating trying to become a hero on microreform now Why was Keating calling for airline sales and telecommunication competition now Hawke recalled with bitterness the events of 1988, when Keating had not raised his voice to support Hawke when Hawke himself was under internal assault for his pursuit of airline privatisation. Keatings dilemma during 199091 was to sustain his claim to the prime ministership while explaining away the recession, an immensely difficult task. Keating became agitated, frustrated and prone to selfdestructive actions during 1990 he committed a series of blunders which reinforced the hostility which sections of the public held towards him. In May 1990 Keating made a devastating public assault on Button, breaking Cabinet solidarity to declare a virtual no confidence in his colleague, provoked by Buttons penchant for soliloquy. Then he used a VIP jet to fly to Melbourne with journalists to attend a Collingwood football game, his latest loyalty in the cause of a more knockabout image. This fanned public concern about Keatings elitism and double standards. In September 1990 he attacked the National Australia Banks outgoing chief, Nobby Clark, claiming the bank had been technically insolvent a few years earlier, an extraordinary claim by a treasurer. Keating retreated but Howard hurt him he accused Keating of playing fast and loose with the confidence of ordinary Australians in the stability of the financial system. But Keatings most memorable mistake came on 29 November 1990 with the release of statistics showing that Australia was in a second quarter of negative growth, the technical definition of a recession. Keating had a press statement prepared by his advisers which he read to the media it contained the infamous line, dotted linethis is a recession that Australia had to have. In one blow Keating destroyed two years of promises that Australia could avoid a recession the pledge made by Hawke and Keating at the 1990 election. Keatings comments were a terrible political blunder, a mistake he later conceded. But he was also wrong when he suggested that the worst impact of the recession might have passed. The contrast between Hawke and Keating was sharp Keating was brazen in his reluctance to admit his mistake while Hawke flashed humility and a caring countenance. Within the party there was talk about eliminating Keating as a recession scapegoat but this was too dangerous for Hawke. The key to Labors political crisis during its fourth term was that Hawkes leadership malaise transcended Keatings unpopularity, a considerable achievement. This was because Keating, popular or unpopular, was perceived to be the dominant figure in the government. Most people believed that Keating would replace Hawke as prime minister during the fourth term. Hawkes problem was summarised by NSW Liberal advertising adviser, Greg Daniel, chief of Clemenger Sydney It would seem to me that Australia is in the peculiar position, almost, of having two GovernorsGeneral Hawke and Haden and a Prime Minister Keating who is called the Deputy Prime Minister.2 This perception had been revealed in ANOPs research before the 1990 election, and Rod Cameron said in late 1990 that Keating had as much chance of being an electable Prime Minister as Hawke. Another study by Mackay Research in mid1990 concluded Consistently participants spoke as though it was beyond question that the Prime Minister would retire during his present term. The study found that Keating is consistently described as arrogant, cold, aloof and gratuitously insulting yet there is continuing grudging respect for his performance as Treasurer.3 Hawke and Keating were a study in contrasts. Hawke played more golf, travelled overseas, including a memorable trip to Gallipoli for the 75th anniversary commemoration of the ANZAC landing, and thrived at the Lodge. Keating was burning with frustration, fearful that Hawke would repudiate his Kirribilli pact, yet resentful that if he became prime minister he might inherit only the ashes of an era. It is extraordinary that the two men discussed their agreement again only on 9 October 1990, six months after the election. Hawke told Keating that he wanted to be around for a settlement in South Africa and said he was likely to be honoured with the keys to the city of London for his contribution to the Commonwealth. He said, I want to stay until CHOGM the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Zimbabwe next year. That meeting would be in October 1991, late in the term for a leadership transition. Keating appealed to Hawke he would need time as prime minister to change his image before an election. Keating reminded Hawke that he had given an unconditional pledge to retire in front of witnesses. But Hawke deferred further discussion and Keating left an unhappy man.4 The upshot was that Keating encouraged the two witnesses, Kelty and Abeles, to approach Hawke to seek a reconvening of the Kirribilli meeting. But Hawke was not interested. The equation was set Hawkes resentment of Keatings pressure and Keatings hostility to Hawkes obstinacy. Keating had two powerbases against Hawke the NSW right and the centre left. This time, unlike 1988, the NSW right wanted a leadership change. Its powerbroker, Graham Richardson, had taken this decision before the 1990 election a point few ALP figures had grasped. But Richardsons resentment towards Hawke hardened postelection when Hawke tested if he wanted to quit politics and then gave him social security, a job Richardson disliked. Keating had fought with the NSW right at various stages of his treasurership, but Keating and his base were reuniting the challenge would be rooted in NSW tribal loyalty. Richardson had always known that eventually he would move from Hawke to Keating. Keatings ultimate aspirations were part of NSW Labors tribal culture over the previous twenty years. Richardson knew that Keating would be a great gamble but he also felt that Hawkes leadership was dying that with Labors primary vote sinking below 35 per cent, only a new leader could break the cycle. However, the right wing was divided on the leadership between NSW and Victoria. Victorian right powerbroker, Robert Ray, was Keatings chief critic within the party. The KeatingRay relationship was rooted in a deep and mutual antagonism. Keating had vetoed Hawkes earlier plan to make Ray the finance minister. He called Ray the fat Indian and never concealed his contempt for Rays political judgement. Ray felt that Keating was electoral poison, a man who put his selfinterest before the partys interest and that his unpopularity with the party and the public made absurd the talk about his leadership."
