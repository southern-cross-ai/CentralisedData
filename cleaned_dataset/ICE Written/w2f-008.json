    "text": "Susan Geason AN OLD HUSBANDS TALE FOURTH GRANDDAD SLAIN the headline screamed up at Virgo Lonergan from the morning newspaper. The granddad murders had been all over the front pages for months, dominated the evening news and had the police dumbfounded. The police followed promising leads, rounded up the usual losers, doorknocked, and had even imported an American FBI psychologist to prepare a profile of the serial killer. POLICE BAFFLED thought Virgo. It was obvious they didnt have a clue who was killing off wellheeled, wellrespected retirees in Sydneys exclusive North Shore suburbs. Virgo, who was following the case avidly, had been fascinated with serial killers since shed done a diploma in criminology after her law degree at Sydney University. She could almost recite the names of Ted Bundys victims by heart, and was well versed in other famous serial murders, from John Wayne Gacey to John Wilder. Drinking the first cafe latte of the day, she skimmed the potted history of the crimes. Four senior citizens Norman Baines, sixtyeight, Roger Harris, seventytwo, Arthur Prentice, seventy, and Donald MacPherson, seventyfour had been hit from behind with a heavy object and killed in broad daylight between their homes and nearby shopping centres. Arthur Prentices dog, Ruff, had also been dispatched to the afterlife. Virgo conjured up a vision of the two pottering around heaven, with Ruff scattering angels like frightened seagulls. Another victim, Victor Herbert, seventyone, had survived the bashing, but was still in hospital, weak and confused. The police were pretending hed cough up valuable clues when he came around, but reading between the lines where all the best stories lay Virgo got the impression the doctors didnt expect him to regain his wits. The murders were all carried out on Mondays or Tuesdays, which probably meant the killer was a shift worker of some sort. The police hinted heavily that they were keeping back valuable clues, but Virgo doubted it. This looked like the most difficult sort of crime to solve it was random, the victims didnt know each other, and there were no witnesses. Unless hes caught in the act, the only way theyll catch this one is if he boasts to someone or kills himself and leaves a confession note, Virgo mused. In the famous fit of remorse. But she wasnt being paid to ponder juicy murders, so she spilled her intray on to the desk and sat looking at it without enthusiasm. Virgo Lonergan had started life as Virginia. After seventeen years of being asked if Santa Claus existed, and five of smutty puns, she decided she might as well go the whole hog. Anyway, her birth date was on the LeoVirgo cusp, so it seemed appropriate. Two years with a city law firm had immunised her against naked ambition and a stint at Legal Aid had dimmed the stars in her eyes. When she realised shed heard every recidivists hard luck story three times, she decided to leave the criminal classes to the tender mercies of all the other middle class dogooders. After some R R in the Maldives, shed returned to Sydney, acquired a private investigators licence and put up her shingle. Now she spent her working hours in a tiny, minimally furnished office at Crows Nest, on Sydneys lower North Shore. So far she was surviving on a mixture of legal work for old clients and friends, insurance surveillance work, and the odd character check for companies. Very occasionally someone walked in off the street and asked her to spy on an errant spouse. This was dull and demeaning, but no worse than real estate conveyancing, she rationalised. Today was dedicated to paper work her Leo badly wanted to throw the intray out the window, but her Virgo worked its way doggedly through the bumf. The accounts were instantly forgotten when that endangered species, a live customer, rang the doorbell. The client turned out to be a typical North Shore matron about forty, wellgroomed and dressed in an expensive duncoloured skirt, blouse and blazer the kind of woman who mistook dullness for good taste. And who thought sex was something you did in bed on Friday nights for the first three years of your marriage, thought Virgo, uncharitably. The womans eyes popped slightly at the sight of Virgo. One hundred and seventyeight centimetres and slim, Virgo had blueblack hair sweeping back dramatically from a widows peak, navy blue eyes and skin the colour of skim milk. Today she was wearing a yellow linen miniskirt and jacket with a black bustier and black shoes which put her over one hundred and eighty centimetres. It was like a chance meeting of a sparrow and a cockatoo. Nyree MacPhersons immediate impulse was to bolt, but shed been taught at school to be polite and to finish what she started. Virgos schooling had taught her to suss out the openings, grab the ball and run. This she did here was a client, a warm body. It might even be interesting. She slipped between the hesitant woman and the door faster than an Argentinian goalie, ushered her into a seat and offered a cup of coffee from a pot that perked all day. Her escape route cut off, and needing something to do with her hands, the woman accepted the coffee. Virgo chatted amiably, dropping enough social and cultural references to put Nyree MacPherson at ease. When a relaxation in her victims shoulders signalled defeat, she began to question her gently. It seemed Nyree MacPhersons father was one of the murdered granddads, and she felt the police were not doing enough to find the killer. Enthralled as she was by the prospect of poking around in a mass murder, Virgo had to be honest Mrs MacPherson, the police have been all over this case like hives. If they cant get a handle on it, I dont see how I could. Theres no way I could get access to the evidence, for a start. The woman paused, hesitating on the brink of a disclosure she might live to regret Im not absolutely certain he was killed by any mass murderer, Miss Lonergan. She could be right, of course, thought Virgo. Copycat crimes were common in cases like this someone seizing the chance to off gramps and blame it on the ghoul. What makes you think that, Mrs MacPherson The woman became so distressed Virgo thought she might faint. Dying of curiosity, she murmured Everything you say within these walls is absolutely confidential. Finally the woman pulled herself together and blurted it out I have reason to believe my stepmother might have had a hand in his death. Appalled by the enormity of the charge, she lapsed into a handkerchiefshredding silence. What makes you think that probed Virgo They were married after my mother died about ten years ago. Phyllis married him for his money, Im certain of it. I didnt like her from the start, but dad seemed happy. Until he retired, at least. Then she was always complaining about him being around the house. I mean, where did she expect him to go The womans voice had risen, angry all over again at the injustice I dont think poor old dad realised what a harridan hed married until it was too late. They did nothing but squabble in the last two years. Virgo was disappointed just the ugly stepmother syndrome. Mrs MacPherson, lots of married couples go through a shakedown when the husband retires, but it doesnt usually result in murder. The woman sighed I knew you wouldnt believe me. The police acted as if I were just some menopausal housewife with too much time on my hands. Im sorry I bothered you. She began to rise. Wait a minute, said Virgo, galvanised by the threat of losing a client. Im not saying I wont take the case, but youve got to be prepared for the likelihood that I wont come up with anything. I mean, you obviously dont like your stepmother dotted line Shes a brittle, conniving, golddigging dotted line bitch said the woman and stopped, aghast at her lapse of taste. Virgo, who hadnt relished working for such a cold fish, warmed to her client a little. Let me look into the details of the murders first, then Ill get back to you and well talk more about your fathers case. Is that OK Nyree MacPherson smiled for the first time, and nodded. Virgo drew up a contract, the client signed and wrote a cheque for a retainer, and the women parted. Time to activate the networks, thought Virgo, dialling Kyrie Kateriniss number. All hell had broken loose in the Katerinis household when daughter Kyrie had announced she didnt want to be a doctor like her parents and her brother. When shed obtained a cadetship on a newspaper after her BA, her father had suffered a mild heart attack, and when shed taken up crime as a specialty, hed disowned her. Virgo and Kyrie shared an upbringing on the northern beaches, a high school education at North Sydney Girls High, and a fascination with human nature, particularly of the deviant variety. Kyrie was middle height, with dark yellow, very curly hair which she wore short, topaz eyes and a strong Greek nose. She wasnt interested in clothes, and almost always wore vampires wedding black and Doc Martens. Virgo had given up nagging her about her appearance long ago. If you were in Greece, youd bloody well refuse to wear black, woman, shed said once, but Kyrie had her own agenda. It had more to do with winning journalism awards than hearts. Kyrie was happy to share her material on the granddad killer with Virgo, but warned her against getting her hopes up. If you ask me, hes got clean away, she said from behind her desk in the Broadway newspaper office. Im a bit disappointed, actually. I was hoping hed move to Newport and get dad off my back. Virgo laughed, then got down to business Is it definitely a he The police arent even sure about that. The victims were old, and they were jumped from behind and brained with a pipe or something like that, so it could have been a woman. Do you really think it was random Virgo asked. Are you sure theres no connection between the victims Kyrie showed Virgo a chart shed make As you can see, theyre private school educated Knox, Scots, Shore, another Knox, and the old boy who survived went to school across the bridge at Grammar. Schools were very important on the North Shore. Virgo and Kyrie had attended the sort of selective public school favoured by the ambitious working class and leftleaning parents who wanted the best but were ideologically opposed to private education. Where do you suppose Ruff went to school asked Virgo. Oh, probably the North Shore Canine Academy. Anything else connecting the old boys quizzed Virgo. They all had plenty of money all were retired all married all living in the MosmanCremorne area. I checked and found out two of them used the same dentist and another two had the same doctor. No two of them belonged to the same club. They all had children and grandchildren. In a word, zilch. What about Donald MacPherson Was there anything different about his death Not that I can see. Why does his daughter think the wife did it Says shes a golddigger. Kyrie snorted Thats hardly a motive, otherwise wed have to build a new womens prison in Sydney. Look, K, Im going to need to talk to Nyree MacPherson, and maybe some of the other victims wives, do you mind dotted line Kyrie threw up her hands Hey I dont care what you do, mate. Just dont tell me about it, OK Next day, posing as Kyrie Katerinis, Virgo set out on her first assignment, an interview with Phyllis MacPherson. Shed dressed down slightly and wore flat heels, remembering the horrified look Nyree MacPherson had given her yellow ensemble."
