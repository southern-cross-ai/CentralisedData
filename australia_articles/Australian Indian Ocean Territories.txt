The Australian Indian Ocean Territories is the name since 1995 of an administrative unit under the Australian Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, consisting of two island groups in the Indian Ocean under Australian sovereignty:

Christmas Island (10.485°S 105.636°E﻿ / -10.485; 105.636﻿ (Christmas Island)), where the administrator resides
Cocos (Keeling) Islands (12.158°S 96.870°E﻿ / -12.158; 96.870﻿ (Cocos (Keeling) Islands)), where the same officer also has jurisdiction as administrator but does not reside
Each of these island components has its own shire council: the Shire of Christmas Island and the Shire of Cocos.
The administrative unit does not have jurisdiction over the uninhabited Ashmore and Cartier Islands and Heard Island and McDonald Islands, despite these territories lying within the Indian Ocean.
