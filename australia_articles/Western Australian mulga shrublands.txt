The Western Australian Mulga shrublands is a deserts and xeric shrublands ecoregion of inland Western Australia. It is one of Australia's two mulga ecoregions, characterized by dry woodlands of mulga trees (Acacia aneura and related species) interspersed with areas of grassland and scrub.

Location and description
This is a hot, dry area with little rainfall.
The region consists of the Gascoyne and Murchison bioregions of the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation for Australia (IBRA).

Flora and fauna
The predominant vegetation is mulga trees, a type of acacia adapted to the hot, dry climate by means of long tap roots. In some areas the mulga trees are surrounded by Eriachne grassland.
Wildlife of the region includes birds such as red kangaroos, emus, Australian bustards and honeyeaters.
Most of the area is uninhabited but there is some mining activity and some sheep grazing, both of which cause damage to native habitats.

Protected areas
4.53% of the ecoregion is in protected areas. Protected areas in the ecoregion include:

Barlee Range Nature Reserve
Birriliburu Indigenous Protected Area
Bullock Holes Timber Reserve
Collier Range National Park
De La Poer Range Nature Reserve
Goongarrie National Park
Matuwa and Kurrara-Kurrara Indigenous Protected Area
