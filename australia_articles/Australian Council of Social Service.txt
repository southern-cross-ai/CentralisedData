The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) is an Australian organisation that advocates for action to reduce poverty and inequality, and is the peak body for the community services sector in Australia. It was formed in 1956.
ACOSS is active in areas of social policy, including community sector policy, climate and energy, economics and tax, income support and employment, health, housing and homelessness, and poverty and inequality.
Cassandra Goldie became CEO of ACOSS in 10 July 2010. She was previously the Director of the Sex Discrimination Unit at the Australian Human Rights Commission (HREOC).
The  CEO  of ACOSS is often interviewed by Australian media for comment and analysis on social matters and policies of the Australian Government.

Governance
ACOSS has a 9-person volunteer Board of Governors, elected according to the constitution [1] adopted in August 2019.

Controversies
In 1991 Federal Opposition leader John Hewson accused
ACOSS of seeking to acquire more money than for welfare and making bureaucracies bigger than in helping those in poverty.[[2]]
