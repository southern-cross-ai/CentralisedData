ABSTRACT We present the full source catalogue from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz (AT20G) Survey. The AT20G is a blind radio survey carried out at 20 GHz with the Australia Telescope Com- pact Array (ATCA) from 2004 to 2008, and covers the whole sky south of declination 0◦. The AT20G source catalogue presented here is an order of magnitude larger than any previ- ous catalogue of high-frequency radio sources, and includes 5890 sources above a 20 GHz ﬂux-density limit of 40 mJy. All AT20G sources have total intensity and polarisation mea- sured at 20 GHz, and most sources south of declination −15◦ also have near-simultaneous ﬂux-density measurements at 5 and 8 GHz. A total of 1559 sources were detected in polarised total intensity at one or more of the three frequencies.
The completeness of the AT20G source catalogue is 91 per cent above 100 mJy beam−1 and 79 per cent above 50 mJy beam−1 in regions south of declination −15◦. North of −15◦, some observations of sources between 14 − 20 hr in right ascension were lost due to bad weather and could not be repeated, so the catalogue completeness is lower in this region. Each detected source was visually inspected as part of our quality control process, and so the reliability of the ﬁnal catalogue is essentially 100 per cent.
We detect a small but signiﬁcant population of non-thermal sources that are either un- detected or have only weak detections in low-frequency catalogues. We introduce the term Ultra-Inverted Spectrum (UIS) to describe these radio sources, which have a spectral index α(5, 20) > +0.7 and which constitute roughly 1.2 per cent of the AT20G sample.
The 20 GHz ﬂux densities measured for the strongest AT20G sources are in excellent agreement with the WMAP 5-year source catalogue of Wright et al. (2009), and we ﬁnd that the WMAP source catalogue is close to complete for sources stronger than 1.5 Jy at 23 GHz.
Large-area high-frequency radio surveys are time-consuming, and as a result relatively few large scale surveys have been carried out.
Those that have been completed are either deep but covering small areas, or shallow all-sky surveys. As a result, our knowledge of the high frequency (> 10 GHz) radio source population is poor.
In addition to the scientiﬁc beneﬁts of studying the radio source population at high frequencies, large scale surveys are use- ful for foreground subtraction for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. Measurement of CMB anisotropies is lim- ited by contamination from astronomical foregrounds, both Galac- tic and extragalactic. To improve the efﬁciency of the component separation techniques, observations such as those of ESA’s Planck mission are performed on a broad spectral region ranging from a 100 GHz, few tenths to hundreds of GHz. At frequencies up to extragalactic radio sources are the major contaminants on angular scales smaller than 30 arcminutes (de Zotti et al. 2005), so identiﬁ- cation of radio sources at high frequencies is critical.
The ﬁrst blind radio survey above 8 GHz was carried out by Taylor et al. (2001) with the Ryle telescope at 15.2 GHz. The sur- vey covered a 63 deg2 region and detected 66 sources to a limiting ﬂux density of 20 mJy. Waldram et al. (2003) extended the survey to 520 deg2, detecting 465 sources to a ﬂux density limit of 25 mJy (the 9C survey). Both surveys found that the existence and ﬂux density of sources at 15 GHz cannot be accurately predicted by ex- trapolation from lower frequency radio surveys such as the NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) at 1.4 GHz (Condon et al. 1998), further demonstrating the need for large scale high frequency surveys for population characterisation and source subtraction in CMB studies. The Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) sur- vey, which covers the whole sky at 23, 33, 41, 61 and 94 GHz (Bennett et al. 2003), is the ﬁrst all-sky radio survey above 5 GHz. The WMAP Point Source Catalogue constructed from the 5 yr maps contains 390 sources (Wright et al. 2009), compared to 323 and 208 sources found in the previous 3 yr and 1 yr maps re- spectively (Bennett et al. 2003; Hinshaw et al. 2007). Recently, Massardi et al. (2009) have detected 516 sources in the 5 yr WMAP maps by exploiting a combination of blind and non-blind detection approaches. Section 7 presents a detailed comparison of our AT20G results with the 5 yr WMAP point-source catalogue.
Table 1 summarises some earlier large-area high-frequency radio surveys, showing the context in which the AT20G survey was designed. A pilot survey for the AT20G at 18.5 GHz was carried out in 2002 and 2003 with the Australia Telescope Com- pact Array (ATCA) (Ricci et al. 2004; Sadler et al. 2006) and de- tected 173 sources stronger than 100 mJy in the declination range ◦. Ricci et al. (2004) conﬁrmed that ATCA (with cus- − tom hardware) had the capability to rapidly survey the sky at high frequencies. The differential source counts for extragalactic sources from the pilot survey were found to be in good agreement with the Waldram et al. (2003) 15 GHz survey.
In this paper we present the full catalogue from the Australia Telescope 20 GHz Survey (AT20G). The survey covers 20,086 square degrees (the complete Southern sky to declination 0◦) to a limiting ﬂux density of 40 mJy beam−1. We followed up candi- date sources detected in the survey at 20 GHz and also have near- simultaneous follow-up observations at 5 and 8 GHz for AT20G ◦. An accompanying paper (Mas- sources south of declination sardi et al., in preparation) will provide more detailed statisti- cal analysis of the AT20G sample. A subset of the 320 brightest ◦) AT20G sources were pre- (S20 > 0.5 Jy) extragalactic ( sented and discussed by Massardi et al. (2008). The Galactic plane was included in our scanning survey but no follow-up observations ◦, except for a blind survey of optically were carried out at < 1.5 thick compact HII regions (Murphy et al. 2009).
In Section 2 we describe the survey and follow-up observa- tions, and in Section 3 we describe the data reduction process. In Section 4 we calculate the accuracy of our measured positions and ﬂux densities. Section 5 presents the source catalogue and deﬁnes its format, with the completeness and reliability of the catalogue discussed in Section 6. As an additional investigation into the com- pleteness, Section 7 compares our catalogue with the 5 yr WMAP results. Finally, Section 8 discusses some statistical properties of the sample and Section 9 presents our conclusions.
The key feature of the AT20G is a two-phase observing strategy. The ﬁrst phase of our observations exploited the fast scanning capa- bility of ATCA, using a wideband analogue correlator, to carry out a blind survey. Candidate sources from the scanning survey were then observed in the regular snapshot mode of the ATCA. The re- sults from the scanning survey, which is complete to a deeper level but has lower reliability, will be presented in a companion paper (Hancock et al., in preparation).
The ﬁrst phase of our observations consisted of a raster of blind scans of the entire southern sky at 20 GHz, using the ATCA in fast scanning mode (in which it can achieve a speed of 15 degrees min−1 in declination at the meridian). The ATCA has low noise very wideband receiver1 (Moorey et al. 2008) which was used to- gether with a custom analogue correlator. The correlator has 8 GHz bandwidth (Roberts, in preparation) and was originally developed as part of the collaboration for the Taiwanese CMB experiment AMiBA (Lo et al. 2001). We used it to take dual orthogonal po- larization data from three of the six 22 m dishes of the ATCA. The lag-correlator measured 16 visibilities as a function of differential delay for each of the three antenna pairs used.
Our custom correlator had no mechanism for allowing for ge- ometrical delay as a function of the position in the sky, so the scans had to be performed along the meridian corresponding to zero delay for the East-West conﬁguration ATCA. All the survey observations used antennas 2, 3, and 4, situated on stations W102, W104, and W106, giving two 30.6 m (2 4) baselines and a single − 4) baseline. The shortest baseline of 30.6 m means the 61.2 m (2 survey has reduced sensitivity to extended sources (a 50 per cent ′′). Larger sources will reduction in amplitude for source size > 45 only be included in the survey if they have ﬂux density in smaller angular size cores or hot spots above the survey limit.
Table 1. Comparison of the AT20G with other high-frequency radio surveys. Note that while the WMAP images cover the whole sky, regions at low Galactic latitude (|b| < 5◦) are excluded from the point-source search. A reanalysis of the WMAP survey by Massardi et al. (2009) resulted in a catalogue of 516 sources above a limit of 695 mJy.
