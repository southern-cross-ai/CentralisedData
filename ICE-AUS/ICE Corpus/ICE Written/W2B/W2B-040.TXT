<I><#\><h>BATTLE STATIONS</h>

<p><#\><bold>W</bold>hen it launched the mighty super<l>charged XJR saloon, Jaguar struck a blow not just for the compa<l>ny, but for Britain itself. <#\>After produc<l>ing the XJ220 supercar in conjunction with Tom Walkinshaw and laying claim to the World's Fastest Car title on behalf of England (before the McLaren F1 came along, at least, and dragged the trophy a couple of counties away), Jaguar is now back in the business of building high-speed executive expresses.</p>

<p><#\>Capable, as the last eight years or so of Jaguar saloons have been, the chances of seeing one pound majestically past a BMW or Benz on a German autobahn were minimal. <#\>Smooth they were, and silent as well, but not particularly quick. <#\>Now that the range-topping XJR's in town, there's every chance that Europeans will be invaded by trainloads of Henry Roots crossing the channel by tunnel and eyeballing them from the fast lane at the car's 250km/h artificially limited top speed.</p>

<p><#\>Such speeds are academic in Australia, although the XJR is not. <#\>Any die-hard fans who remember the big saloons of the <w>'50s</w> and <w>'60s</w> and have $160,000-plus for the fastest Jaguar sedan yet must be getting pretty excited by now. <#\>What they'll get is the new XJ <w>series'</w> reshaped body which in essence harks back to Jaguars of yore; arching, aggressive front guards, a curved rump, and that elongated, low-lying stance that mimics a cat stretching in the sun. <#\>In XJR trim add a few street machining tricks such as monster-fat wheels and tyres, a toothy mesh grille, in our car's case a show-stopping metallic green finish and, of course, an Eaton-type blower and buck<l>ets of kilowatts, and there's fun to be had.</p>

<p><#\>Jaguar claims the XJR wa designed to attract buyers who would otherwise go for the likes of the Mercedes-Benz E500, BMW's M5 or 540i. <#\>Fine, fast cars every one, but unfortunately only the latter is available in Oz. <#\>As it so happens the 540i <longdash> winner of our Best Luxury Car award last year <longdash> has come in for a subtle upgrade before the 5-Series is totally replaced next year. <#\>For now it gets twin airbags, a memory function for the power-operated seats, new alloy wheels, a CD stacker in the boot and a range of new colours.</p>

<p><#\>Mechanically, it is the same as before, meaning there's a four-litre V8 driving the rear wheels. <#\>Yes, it's smaller than the Jaguar, but compares favourably to the XJR's performance image. <#\>Like the XJR, the 540i has an automatic transmission, at least until a limited edition run of six-speed manuals becomes available early in 1995. <#\>Jaguar will take orders for manual versions of any of its cars to replace the four speed auto, but expect a long wait while it's built.</p>

<p><#\>And speaking of auto transmission, that brings us to our third contender, the HSV GTS 215i. <#\>What, you may ask, is a Commodore doing in such exalted European company? <#\>Well for starters, there are the basic similarities between its four doors, largish boot and mighty engine which delivers power and torque figures comparable with the BMW and Jaguar. <#\>Up until now it has been available with a manual gearbox only, while Uncle Tom's boys tinkered with the GM four-speed auto so it would suit the 5.7-litre Holden engine's output.</p>

<p><#\>So, like the other two it's a large, com<l>fortable four-seater with oodles of effort<l>less performance. <#\>The snag is, of course, that it costs about $80,000 less than the Bimmer and a full $100,000 less than the Jag. <#\>Could it be that much worse? <#\>Could it be, in fact, a better car? <#\>Could the clas<l>sic Australian sedan with a relatively sim<l>ple pushrod V8 match the technical might of BMW, and could the 540i in turn hold its head high against the plushness and supercharged muscle of Jaguar's new spir<l>it? <#\>Are they all four-door sports cars or the best Grand Tourers money can buy? <#\>With these and many other questions in mind, we wheeled all three onto the battle field.</p>

<#\><h><bold>PRICE AND EQUIPMENT</bold></h>

<p><#\>Starting with the newest and most expen<l>sive, the Jaguar XJR stops the cash regis<l>ters at $166,980 <longdash> that's about 20 grand more than the 4.0-litre Sovereign <longdash> and for that money it's difficult to think of anything which is missing off the spec sheet. <#\>The XJR has a host of goodies to distinguish it from other Jags quite apart from what's under the bonnet; monster 17-inch alloy wheels with P Zero rubber, the chicken mesh grille and colour-keying of some (but by no means all) of the chrome set it apart. <#\>What you can't see is the XJR-specific suspension settings for roll bars, springs and dampers, the traction control, ABS and limited slip diff.</p>

<p><#\>Inside, there's acres of soft, creamy Connolly leather, plush carpets and Jaguar's famous woodgrain trim, which in this case is a dark, greyish veneer made from smoked maple. <#\>Standard equipment includes the half leather, half timber steering wheel, a timber-finish gear knob on the J-shift lever, while for entertainment there's a six-CD stacker in the boot and a stalk-operated trip computer. <#\>There's plenty more, and all the luxo gear you'd expect including power windows, remote central locking, power seats with three memory functions, automatic climate con<l>trol air conditioning with revised and far more logical controls than before <*>dotted line</*> the list goes on. <#\>The only options are a sunroof and metallic paint, the latter adding $2300 to the cost of our test car.</p>	<p><#\>The latest 540i has, as mentioned earlier, copped a passenger side airbag in line with the rest of the BMW range. <#\>The good news is that despite this and the other add-ons the price remains the same at $136,400. <#\>That includes leather seattrim, the airbags, alloy wheels, traction control, tripcomputer <*>dotted line</*>in fact, just about everything the Jag has except the power output and the bigger wheels and tyres. <#\>Our black test car also had the so called Shadow Line option which for $380 blacks out the car's chrome work.</p>

<p><#\>And just to show how competitive this business is getting, Holden hasn't changed the price of its GTS 215i in automatic gearbox form, which if any<l>thing demonstrates how much the six speed <w>'box</w> must cost to import from America. <#\>So the GTS is $59,524 with either transmission, compared with the mechanically identical but slightly better-equipped Senator 215i. <#\>If that sounds like a lot for a Holden Commodore then take a look at what you get: seriously more power and torque for starters, plus the automatic transmission with larger torque converter and recalibrated shift points, ABS and independent rear suspension, 17-inch alloy wheels with appropriate rubber, and the Hydratrak limited slip differential. <#\>It's the interior that more clearly points out the GTS's sporting rather than luxury personality; there's fairly lurid cloth trim with pink high<l>lights, a good, thick-rimmed leather-bound steering wheel, and Holden's extended dashboard with trip information on an LCD display.</p>

<#\><h><bold>ENGINES</bold></h>

<p><#\>Jaguar's AJ16 technological tour de force is a significant step beyond where the twin<?>-</?>cam, 24-valve 4.0-litre straight six per<l>formed in the past. <#\>The block has been recast for extra stiffness and there's lighter aluminium pistons, the cylinder head is entirely new with reprofiled cams operating on bigger inlet valves, and even the exhaust is bigger, while the multi-point fuel injection is now sequential. <#\>In super<?>-</?>charged XJR form Jaguar has gone a step further, provided 10 pounds of boost to the revamped inlet manifold via an air/fluid/air intercooler. <#\>The compression ration has been dropped to 8.5:1 from the normally aspirated engine's 10:1 to cope with the extra pressure, and all-up the power output is a mighty 240kW at only 5000rpm and no less than 512Nm at just over 3000rpm.</p>

<p><#\>With the same engine capacity but no more boost than that provided by God's clean air, the BMW's outputs shouldn't be in the same ballpark as the Jaguar's. <#\>Still, BMW spares little in the way of providing the most technologically advanced engines possible, and this silky sweet, free-revving V8 is a case in point. <#\>There's quad cams, four valves for each cylinder and the latest Bosch Motronic fuel injection and ultimate outputs of 210kW at a relatively high (in this company) 5800rpm and 400Nm of torque at 4500rpm.</p>

<p><#\>What the GTS lacks in sophistication under the bonnet it makes up for in sheer capacity. <#\>HSV has taken Holden's cast iron OHV V8 lump and stretched the stroke out to 88mm which when combined with the massive 102mm bore equals 5.7 litres and a whole lotta grunt. <#\>The crankshaft's a propriety item on the 215i engine, of course, but it also gets unique cam profiles and a new timing chain, an 8.5:1 compression ration, new exhaust valves and valve springs and a tuned length stainless steel exhaust system with mandrel-bent headers.</p>

<p><#\>Still, we'd like to bet that the whole she<l>bang is still considerably understressed and that the 215kW output is not the highest we'll see from the engine. <#\>It's the torque which is the key here, all 475Nm of it peaking at 3600rpm, although that's still somewhere short of the Jaguar's maximum and, surprisingly, produced higher in the rev spectrum.</p>

<p><#\>Awards for under-bonnet presentation must go to Jaguar for the sheer imposing nature of the straight six. <#\>It seems mas<l>sively long, with the company name emblazoned on the cam cover and the supercharger nestled down on the left hand side. <#\>There's even a little tool kit under there (although goodness knows what the average Jaguar owner is meant to do with it) and the fuse diagram, which just for starters gives the location of all five fuse boxes, is the most comprehen<l>sive in living memory. <#\>The BMW's engine bay is less congested, with most of the ancillaries tucked out of sight from weekend tinkerers, whereas the GTS's more humble Commodore origins are evident by the more apparent wiring and plumbing, although of course the GTS is identified by the HSV logos on the grey engine covers.</p>

<#\><h><bold>PERFORMANCE</bold></h>	

<p><#\>It's worth pausing to reflect a moment on power-to-weight ratios, because both kilo<l>grams and kilowatts have a bearing on acceleration. <#\>So while the XJR is by far the most powerful, it's also the heaviest car at 1875kg, so its weight/power ratio comes out at 7.8kW/kg, slightly inferior to the much lighter GTS's 7.6kg/kW. <#\>What surprised us was that the 5-Series carries so much weight in 540i guise: it's a full 1710kg, giving it at 8.1kg/kW, the highest weight/power ratio of the three. <#\>It's a similar case when comparing torque to mass: the much lighter Commodore has only 3.4 kilograms for every Newton-metre, whereas the Jaguar has 3.7kg/Nm and the 540i 4.3 kg/Nm.</p>

<p><#\>It made all the difference on the drag strip, for in terms of standing start acceler<l>ation the GTS had it all over the other two. <#\>This is an engine with tremendous reserves of bottom end torque, and it was able to launch the HSV car to a solid speed while the more highly strung BMW was struggling to overcome its weight dis<l>advantage, while the Jaguar also seemed to operate better at higher speeds.</p>

<p><#\>Take a look at the figures: the GTS comfortably beat the XJR to 100km/h, taking just 6.64 seconds, compared with the Jaguar's 7.81. <#\>Yet by the time they've reached 150km/h (and, incidentally, the end of our Calder Park test strip) there's less than 0.3 seconds in it. <#\>We'd suspect that by the time 200km/h was reached the Jaguar would be ahead.</p>

<p><#\>The same goes for the 540i. <#\>The V8 feels somewhat peaky compared with the Holden's hairy-chested oomph, but that's countered somewhat by the BMW having five gear ratios to play with, keeping the engine on-song more of the time. <#\>Again, it can't match the HSV's sprinting ability, reaching 100km/h slightly quicker than the XJR in 7.54 seconds but the two europeans are almost lineball to the 400 metre mark and catching the Commodore.</p>

<p><#\>The 540i's relative lack of low-down torque gives it something of a Jekyll and Hyde personality; use the heavily spring throttle pedal sparingly and at lower revs it seems almost sluggish. <#\>Sink the right pedal past its 'false' stop and there's a mel<l>low yodel from the engine and it winds up like a turbine, then accelerates like a sling<?>-</?>shot.</p></I>
