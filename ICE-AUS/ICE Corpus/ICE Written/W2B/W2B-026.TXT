<I><#\><h><bold>T<smallcaps>OXOPLASMOSIS</smallcaps></bold></h>

<#\>by Kathy Jacobs, Ringwood, Vic.

<p><#\>IN GR 103 I discussed responsible cat ownership; this time I will give you some information about toxoplasmosis and how to manage it. <#\>It is meant as a guide only and not the be-all and end-all. <#\>If you are at all concerned and/or want further in<l>formation, consult your vet or GP.</p>

<#\><h><bold>WHAT IS TOXOPLASMOSIS?</bold></h>

<p><#\>Toxoplasmosis (<it>Toxoplasmosis gondii</it>) is an obligate (able to survive only in a particular environment), intracellular protozoan (single celled organism, in this case parasitic also). <#\>It exists in three forms.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Three Forms</bold></h>

<p><#\><bold>Tachyzoites</bold>, which are oval, about three by seven millimetres in size, and invade virtually all mammalian cells.</p>

<p><#\><bold>Cysts</bold>, which form within <w>hosts'</w> cells and may contain thousands of organisms. <#\>Cysts can be from 10-100 millimetres in size. <#\>They are found throughout the body but mainly in skeletal and heart muscles and the central nervous system. <#\>Cysts are the major method of transmission as they may be in animals (pork, beef, lamb, goat), and then ingested.</p>

<p><#\><bold>Oocysts</bold> are ten to twelve millimetres in size and formed only in the mucosal and intestinal cells of members of the cat family. <#\>It is the only animal which allows the organism to have a complete sexual cycle. <#\>Found in about one percent of cats, with a greater incidence in kittens.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Different Types of Toxoplasmosis</bold></h>

<p><#\>There is congenital toxoplasmosis (when a baby is infected in utero) and acquired toxoplasmosis which has two forms. <#\>By far the most common is lymphadeno<l>pathic, which tends to closely resemble glandular fever. <#\>There is also the dissem<l>inated type which can be very severe and affect all major organs.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Symptoms in Humans</bold></h>

<p><#\>The lymphadenopathic toxoplasmosis may be asymptomatic (have no noticea<l>ble symptoms) or have symptoms simi<l>lar to glandular fever: tiredness, head<l>ache, neck stiffening, swollen glands, nausea, fever, muscle pain and rash. <#\>The disseminated form can manifest by the above symptoms and pneumonia, inflam<l>mation of the coverings of the heart and brain, enlargement of the liver and spleen, brain abscesses, confusion, photophobia (abnormal sensitivity of the eyes to light). <#\>It is extremely rare in healthy people. <#\>The congenital form is usually marked by lesions of the central nervous system, which can lead to blindness and mental retardation. <#\>The symptoms in humans are similar to those experienced in cats.</p>

<#\><h><bold>How Toxoplasmosis is Caught</bold></h>

<p><#\>Humans and cats catch toxoplasmosis through ingestion of raw or incompletely cooked meat which contains cysts. <#\>IT is believed that 10 percent of lamb and 25 percent of pork contains cysts. <#\>Cysts have also been found in beef and goat meat but statistics are not available. <#\>Tox<l>oplasmosis may also be caught from the ingestions of oocysts from cat faeces, although these do not become infective for between 24 hours and seven days. <#\>Oocysts may also survive in the soil, under favourable conditions, for up to one year.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Prevalence</bold></h>

<p><#\>It is estimated that in Australia about 40-50 percent of the poplation has been infected. <#\>Very few people are aware that they have had the disease.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Who is Particularly at Risk?</bold></h>

<p><#\>People who are immuno suppressed, such as those receiving chemotherapy, or with diseases relating to suppressed immune systems. <#\>These may develop dis<l>seminated toxoplasmosis.</p>

<p><#\>Pregnant women: It is estimated that if a pregnant woman catches toxoplasmo<l>sis while pregnant there is a 30-40 per<l>cent chance that her baby will be affect<l>ed. <#\>Of these babies about 15 percent will be seriously affected. <#\>However, effect is generally dependant on the stage of preg<l>nancy. <#\>For example, the earlier in the pregnancy the less likely that the disease will cross the placenta (15 percent in the first trimester), however the effects are more severe than if caught later in preg<l>nancy when the incidence is closer to 65 percent, but the disease is generally asymptomatic.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Diagnosis and Vaccination</bold></h>

<p><#\>Diagnosis is by a simple blood test, or more frequently two, to avoid the chance of false positive or negative. <#\>There is no vaccine available, but infection confers immunity in both humans and cats. <#\>Once you have had it, you are immune.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Preventative Measures</bold></h>

<p><#\><*>bullet</*> Be very careful handling raw meat. <#\>Wear gloves or wash your hands well afterwards.
<#\><*>bullet</*> Cook meat well.
<#\><*>bullet</*>Avoid acquiring a new cat, especially a kitten, while pregnant.
<#\><*>bullet</*> Clean cat litter trays daily so oocysts do not have a chance to become infec<l>tious. <#\>A flush and good scrub with water is generally enough, but ammonia, bleach (nonchloride) or hydrogen peroxide can also be used. <#\>If possible, someone other than the pregnant woman should do this.
<#\><*>bullet</*> Wear gloves when gardening and wash hands afterwards (this applies if cats have, or have had in the past year, access to your garden).
<#\><*>bullet</*> Wash all home-grown vegies. <#\>Heat of 60<*>degree</*>C or boiling water destroys oocysts.
<#\><*>bullet</*>If your cat hasn't had toxoplasmosis (you can have it blood tested too) or you don't know its status, you can take meas<l>ures to prevent infection.
<#\><*>bullet</*> Feed it tinned or dry food or raw meat that has been frozen to at least -20<*>degree</*>C for several days (domestic freezers may not reach or maintain this temperature).
<#\><*>bullet</*> If meat has not been frozen it should be cooked.
<#\><*>bullet</*> Cats that do not scavenge or hunt are also less likely to catch toxoplasmosis as rats and mice are a source of infection.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Treatment</bold></h>

<p><#\>Lymphodenopathic toxoplasmosis, if symptomatic, is usually treated with a one or two month course of trimetho<l>prim, pyrimethomine and/or sulfadiazine. <#\>In more severe cases duration of treat<l>ment is generally longer and dosages are higher. <#\>Infected newborn are also treated and there is generally some improve<l>ment. <#\>I am not aware of any homoeo<l>pathic treatments, consult a qualified practitioner if you are interested.</p>

<p><#\>Toxoplasmosis is a fairly common in<l>fection, with about half the population of Australia having been infected. <#\>Howev<l>er, it is believed that less than seven percent of healthy infected people will exhibit any symptoms and these are gen<l>erally very mild, such as tiredness and swollen glands which last a few days until immunity develops.</p>

<p><#\>As I stated at the beginning of this article this is not the be-all and end-all of toxoplasmosis, nor is it meant to be fright<l>ening. <#\>If you want more information, consult a qualified practitioner. <#\>Fairfield Hospital (Vic) should also be able to answer queries.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Herb for Arthritis Relief</bold></h>

<#\>By Russ Maslen, Mullumbimby, NSW

<p><#\>I was weeding the plant out from around a tree in Brunswick Valley Heritage Park in Mullumbimby in 1989 when an un<l>known chap mentioned to me that if one chewed and swallowed two leaves a day for three months that arthritis would be cured or alleviated. <#\>I was not particularly interested but mentioned it to my wife who had problems with her hands (her knuckles and wrist were swollen, fingers locking and painful) and she decided to try the plant.</p>

<p><#\>By November of 1989 she put on her wedding ring again and now does not have any sign of previous symptoms. <#\>In March of 1990 I finally went to my doctor because of troubles with my neck and arm. <#\>After wearing a neck brace, X-rays, CAT scan, neurophysiologist and nerve conduction tests it was recom<l>mended that I have an operation on ver<l>tebrae in my neck because of sensory radiculopathy. <#\>I did not like that idea very much and started eating my leaves. <#\>I now have no trouble in the above and am able to look up or over my shoulder and have not had the operation.</p>

<p><#\>Numerous other people have used the plant since then and have had obvious, visible relief and in some cases have X-rays and so on of their previous condition which they state no longer exists.</p>

<p><#\>My wife and I have been using the plant for over three years and have not noticed any side effects, in fact it has been beneficial in a number of other ways. <#\>Most people to date have taken two leaves daily but as a result of addi<l>tional information which I now have, my wife and I have commenced taking three leaves, about the size of a 20 cent coin, a day. <#\>We have used this amount for about six months. <#\>Since the active constituents are a percentage of the weight of the leaf take correspondingly more to make up the same weight if the leaves are smaller. <#\>Say, four or five of 10 cent size. <#\><it>Do not take more than this until further tests have been done.</it></p>

<p><#\>It does not appear to matter when leaves are taken, we have ours when we think of it. <#\>When the plant is found in the wild make sure to dig up the 'parsnip' root as well as the fine roots along the runners and don't break off the runners. <#\>Plant the lot. <#\>Since three leaves a day is equivalent to 90 a month put the plants into a large container or into the garden bed. <#\>Watch out for snails <longdash> they love it. <#\>A lot of plants are needed in order to keep up with demand. <#\>It prefers a sheltered situation out of direct sun but not too wet. <#\>Water the same as any other pot plant.</p>

<#\><h><bold>GENERAL INFORMATION</bold></h> 

<p><#\>Two species of centella (also known as pennywort and <foreign>gotu kola</foreign>) exist in Aus<l>tralia: <it>Centella asiatica</it> also occurs in Africa, Madagscar, India and the Pacific islands, and <it>Centella cordifolia</it> which from the very recent re-description of the genus occurs in the southern states of Australia. <#\>Originally one species was thought to be in Australia with an early name of <it>Hydrocotyle asiatica</it>. <#\>This was changed to <it>Centella asiatica</it>. <#\>The genus was then divided into two species with <it>C.cordifolia</it> being considered wide<l>spread. <#\>The very recent description shows <it>C.asiatica</it> as occurring in all states and <it>C.cordifolia</it> localised in southern areas only and uncommon.</p>

<p><#\>Based on the previous descriptions I had considered the plant which we have been using to be <it>C.cordifolia</it>. <#\>This is now incorrect as per the new description published at the end of 1992. <#\>It now appears that under the new botanical description it is <it>Centella asiatica</it> and occurs in all states, with <it>Centella cordifolia</it> being poorly known. <#\>Samples re<l>ceived from all over the country are vir<l>tually identical to the plant shown in the illustration.</p> 

<#\><h><bold>DESCRIPTION OF PLANT</bold></h>

<p><#\>Both species are a creeping herb and like damper places but often grow in open locations including garden beds and lawns. <#\>It is also quite often found along fences, under trees or shrubs and along the edge of paths and garden beds. <#\>It does not like sandy soils close to the beach.</p>

<p><#\><it>Centella asiatica</it> has a more or less circular leaf which is toothed around the edge, particularly near the slot in the leaf. <#\>It is quite often flecked with white blotch<l>es and may have reddish dots in the leaf. <#\>The leaf has a V-shaped slot with straight edges leading to the stem. <#\>These features are shown in the diagram. <#\>Leaf size var<l>ies from little fingernail size up to seven centimetres in more shelter. <#\>Plants in open locations are quite bitter to taste whereas ones in more shelter are almost tasteless but with a herby flavour. <#\><it>Cen<l>tella cordifolia</it> is described as having leaves longer than broad but otherwise very similar.</p>

<p><#\>A 10 centimetre long 'parsnip' root occurs under the central part of the plant. <#\>Both plants root at the nodes, that is, where the leaves grow from the creeping stem. <#\>The flowers and fruits (seeds) form on a very short stalk about one centime<l>tre long and are not usually seen unless you part the leaves and look closely. <#\>The flowers are minute and can only be seen with a magnifying glass. <#\>They have pink to red petals, but with the naked eye this appears as a pinkish tinge only. <#\>The fruits are a flattened disc about three millimetres across and are usually in a group of three. <#\>They sit up like toast in a rack.</p>

<#\><h><bold>SIMILAR PLANTS</bold></h>

<p><#\>There are a number of similar plants such as kidney weed, but if a leaf is placed flat beside the diagram and the shape is checked differences will be seen. <#\>A fur<l>ther check of the fruits and a check of the root for the 10 centimetre long (on ma<l>ture plants) 'parsnip' should result in no confusion</p>.</I>
