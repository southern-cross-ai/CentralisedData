<smallcaps>Done</smallcaps></bold></h>

<#\><it>All his lucrative career, while the public have loved him, Ken Done has suffered at the hands of critics who dismiss him as a commercial artist.</it> <#\><it>All his life he has wanted to be taken as a painter respected on walls as well as T-shirts.</it><#\><it>Now, at last, it seems it could happen.</it>

<#\><bold>By Ann-Maree Moodie</bold>

<p><#\><bold>K</bold>en Done lightly tosses the self-portrait onto the floorboards of his waterfront studio where it settles amid a pile of unmistakably Done canvases. <#\>There, the painting's sombre colours stand out even more strikingly against the blues, yellows and reds of the familiar flower pictures and one of his favourite scenes <longdash> the beach. <#\>If it were not for his trademark moustache, it would be difficult to recognise the self-portrait as Done. <#\>There is no boyish grin on this contorted face, no vibrant colours by which the artist has made his name. <#\>Shades of charcoal, brown and grey dominate, and Done describes it as <quote>a portrait of a face of a person who at that point in time was frustrated, unhappy, angry</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>The incident which created the black mood behind the painting is so private he will not even tell his wife of 27 years, Judy, who is also his business partner. <#\><quote>But it's not as dark as you imagine,</quote> he says. <#\><quote>It's dark to you because you are so used to seeing brighter things from me.</quote> <#\>The self-portrait is one of a series Done has produced since he began showing his work in the early eighties. <#\>There is a file of them stored at his business headquarters in Sydney's inner-city Redfern, and his most recent one <quote>has half-a-dozen faces on it because I am half-a-dozen people<*>dotted line</*>the private face, the sad face, the angry face, the media <O>photo</O> face, the unsure face, the confident face</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>These paintings haven't often been seen in Australia because they don't fit the image of his multi-million-dollar company. <#\><quote>That self-portrait is a painting for an audience of one <longdash> me. <#\>They are not the kind of things you would see on a calendar or a datebook. <#\>But one allows me to do the other <*>dotted line</*> <#\>To understand how beautiful things are, sometimes you need to under<l>stand how sad things are.</quote> <#\>He stresses that the self-portraiture doesn't signal any sud<l>den change of direction. <#\>It's all part of what he has been doing all along <longdash> chasing a childhood dream to be a painter. <#\>He just happened to be distracted along the way by his talent as a commercial artist and marketing man.</p>

<p><#\>The Japanese,with whom Done has had a love affair since his first visit to Japan in the sixties, admire him as both designer and artist. <#\>Now, he says, as part of his progression as an art<l>ist, he wants Australians to realise that his talents extend far beyond the simple linear drawings of Sydney's Har<l>bour Bridge and Opera House which have made him world famous. <#\>He wants us to accept that it's not a di<l>lemma to be successful as both a commercial and pure artist.</p>

<p><#\>An exhibition of Done's work has been touring <smallcaps>nsw</smallcaps> regional galleries. <#\>From March 11 to May 21, his Redfern gallery will show the exhibition <it>Paintings from The Cabin</it> which, according to his assistant curator, Kirstie Davidson, intermingles earlier paintings and later more <quote>expressive and abstract</quote> works including seascapes, self-portraits and images of the interior and surrounding garden of The Cabin, Done's Sydney Harbourside property. <#\>And early next year, the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney will present a comprehensive, multi-media exhibition of Done's work, including the car he was asked to paint as part of <smallcaps>bmw</smallcaps>'s "car art" collection (which put him in the company of <smallcaps>bmw</smallcaps>s painted by Andy Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein and Alexander Calder). <#\>Done's interpretations of a glass fish-sculpture, a Japanese beer can and an Arnott's biscuit tin are already on display in the Powerhouse's permanent exhibition.</p>

<p><#\>All these exhibitions will include paint<l>ings immediately recognised as Done: big, bold, bright canvases of flowers, beaches, tropical fish. <#\>But as well, they will reveal something of the other side of Done, a surprise, perhaps, for those who grumble that what he does could be done by a pre<?><l></?>schooler. <#\><quote>I'm doing many more complex things than you think, but I haven't shown work here in Australia for quite a while <#\>I was always painting all kinds of pictures. <#\>It's just that the first pictures that people saw in the early eighties were very simple. <#\>I always accepted that in Australia it would be a long time before people understood there was more to it. <#\>But I knew that there was more to it.</quote></p>

<p><#\>The time is approaching when Done, <O>photo</O> one of the country's best-known exports, may find a place in Australia's established galleries as an artist <longdash> a breakthrough for him and them.</p>

<p><#\>Some would argue that he deserves the break. <#\>Whatever else you might say, there's no denying he's worked hard enough. <#\>Done left school at 14 to become an artist. <#\>He studied design at the East Sydney Technical College but failed to graduate because, for his final assessment, he sub<l>mitted graphics for the opening titles of the <it>Bandstand</it> television show instead of a book cover for <it>The Picture of Dorian Gray</it>; <#\><it>Bandstand</it> struck him as a more appealing project. <#\>His subsequent work as a commer<l>cial artist led to a successful career as a creative director for advertising agencies in Sydney and London.</p>

<p><#\>At 40, he left advertising to renew his ambition to paint. <#\>He drew some appeal<l>ingly simple sketches of koalas and other classic Australian icons and had them printed on T-shirts. <#\>The freshness of his designs caught on. <#\>He set up a company to do his own printing and suddenly his creations were everywhere <longdash> on bathers, sarongs, mugs, socks, bags, scarves, linen goods. <#\>Many of them were bought by tourists who believed they epitomised the essence of Australia. <#\>Done quickly became a celebrity, <#\>his goods spawned a chain of shops and he featured regularly in adver<l>tisements and the media. <#\>The man who wanted to be a painter found himself a businessman.</p>

<p><#\>Two years ago, when he turned 50, he decided to have another go at being what he really wanted to be. <#\>The business was encroaching on the time he wanted to spend painting. <#\>The company, employing 150 people and turning over more than $50 million in Australia annually, was con<l>tracted and renamed Done Art and Design. <#\>The 13 Australian shops, two galleries in Sydney (Redfern and The Rocks) and one in Surfers Paradise remained company-owned, but the overseas shops were li<l>censed. <#\>The wholesale div<l>ision was closed and licences were awarded to Oroton to make accessories and the Ink Group to make cards and 
calendars.</p>

<p><#\>Ideally, the new division of work means that Done now spends more time paint<l>ing while Judy, 49, steers the company and does the fashion design. <#\>Neverthe<l>less, Done, though without a formal title, is still effectively company chairman and ap<l>pears to hold tightly to the reins.</p>

<p><#\><bold>B</bold>ecause of his success, Done became a tall poppy. <#\>Over the years, his name has lent itself to a variety of denigrations of his work. <#\>His critics, espec<l>ially those in art circles, have delighted in chanting "OverDone", "Done to Death", "Been there, Done that". <#\>In 1987, there was Brett Whiteley's unforgettable re<l>sponse to his work: <quote>I'd rather take metha<l>done than Ken Done.</quote> <#\>Done's paintings were not exhibited in any major gallery in Sydney or Melbourne and no art critic reviewed his work because it was widely regarded as too commercial and not "pure".</p>

<p><#\>Times change. <#\>A decade on, the level of Done criticism has abated. <#\>He is studied in school as a contemporary artist and he lectures at galleries. <#\>His paintings have been bought by the Australian Embassy in Tokyo and showbiz collectors like Michael Caine, Reg Livermore and Jeffery Archer. <#\>He has had 44 solo exhibitions here and overseas, the last toured Japan to an audi<l>ence of 200,000. <#\>His work fetches tens of thousands of dollars; <#\>a recent painting sold <O>photo</O> for $30,000. <#\>And last year he was awarded the Order of Australia for his services to art, design and tourism. <#\>Done attributes his gradual acceptance to the current <quote>age, quality and experience</quote> of journalists whom he says have helped equalise the tall poppy syndrome.</p>

<p><#\>But can he yet call himself a painter in the eyes of the cognoscente? <#\>While he has gained respect for cleverly exploiting his commercial art, he is yet to receive accolades for his paintings. <#\>The director of the Art Gallery of <smallcaps>nsw</smallcaps>, Edmund Capon, says the reason Done's more familiar work has not been exhibited by a major gallery in Australia is because he is perceived in the art establishment as being "commercially oriented" rather than a "pure artist".</p>

<p><#\>The gallery has hung Done work only temporarily, in competitions such as the Archibald <longdash> work Capon describes as a <quote>slightly more serious form of his more commercial ex<l>pression</quote>. <#\>Still, Capon does indicate that if Done's work was to <quote>break the mould</quote> of its commercial repu<l>tation, he may be exhibited by lead<l>ing galleries.</p>

<p><#\><quote>He has a thorough and estab<l>lished reputation as an artist who has managed to marry art, design and commer<l>cial product. <#\>He is a master of two essential ingredients of art <longdash> graphic facility and colour <longdash> and he has a fundamental under<l>standing of art such as graphic quality and the relationship and emotional qualities of colour. <#\>I would be the last person to say he did not have the facilities to metamorphose into a pure artist.</quote> <#\>So there's hope for Ken the painter yet.</p>

<p><#\>The director of the Powerhouse Mu<l>seum, Terence Measham, says Done, whom he regards as a friend, is an Austra<l>lian model of success for young people. <#\><quote>The thing about Ken Done is that his mind teems with visual images. <#\>The paint<l>ings celebrate the Australian experience, lifestyle and expression through the colours and through the iconography, and he as<l>similates, in an intellectual way, the motifs and pictorial ideas of other artists, such as Monet and Gauguin.</quote></p>

<p><#\>But art critic Elwyn Lynn thinks that although Done has developed as an artist since his work was first shown, he's still incipient and ubiquitous. <#\><quote>I think Ken Done is a serious artist at times, but he is yet to be proven,</quote> says Lynn, who has only seen Done's art reproduced in magazines <O>photo</O> <O>caption</O> and competitions. <#\><quote>I think he is becoming more expressive in his feelings for different subjects than those which are depicted on his shirts and elsewhere. <#\>But he is one of the few artists who are concerned with the hedonistic life. <#\>I think people have to realise that you can be utterly relaxed (in your style) and still be an artist.</quote></p>

<p><#\><bold>T</bold>he Cabin, where Done produces most of his work, is a two-storey building at the edge of Chinaman's Beach, a peaceful inlet tucked away on Sydney's north shore. <#\>It lies at the bottom of Judy's well-tended garden which is planted in blocks of colour and is a source of unending inspiration to her husband.</p>

<p><#\>Done first saw The Cabin when he was 14, began renting it in the early eighties, but was unable to buy it until 1987. <#\>His earliest paintings were born in a now-demolished <O>caption</O> fisherman's shack on the same beach which he rented from the elderly owner. <#\><quote>I used to sit at the other end of Chinaman's Beach, looking at this build<l>ing, and willing the people who were renting it before out of it,</quote> he says. <#\><quote>They were nice enough people, but they didn't love it.</quote></p>

<p><#\>He knows Chinaman's Beach in<l>timately and has names for the rocks which protect its shores: Point Rock, Turtle Rock, Bird Rock. <#\>Some of the names developed when his children were young and the family would explore the beach together. <#\>Other rocks have been named for their characteristics <longdash> <#\>the Japanese Tree Rock is a rock upon which crouches a gnarled old tree and that reminds Done of a Japanese landscape.</p>

<p><#\>Is it monotonous painting the same view repeatedly? <#\>Done leafs through a bundle of canvases to explain his answer. <#\><quote>It's never the same.</quote></p></I>
