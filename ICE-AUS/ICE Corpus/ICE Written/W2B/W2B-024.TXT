<#\><it><bold>One aspect of Australia's diversity has puzzled me: how do infertile places, like Western Australia's heath<?>-</?>lands and the Great Barrier Reef, support such an abundance of life?</bold></it>

<p><#\><bold>I</bold><smallcaps> have long been fascinat</smallcaps><l>ted by the diversity of life on Earth, and the reasons why some environments support a greater number of species than others. <#\>An important fac<l>tor in determining the number of species an environment can support is its productivity. <#\>Ev<l>ery environment has a charac<l>teristic rate of formation (through photosynthesis) of new plant material, which fuels the web of life within that environment. <#\>If the rate is high, the environment is said to be productive, and there is a widespread belief that such environments are home to a greater number of species than those resource-poor en<l>vironments where productivi<l>ty is low. <#\>Although this hypothesis makes intuitive sense, ecologists are now questioning it. <#\>Indeed, some have pinpointed reasons sug<l>gesting that the reverse is (or should be) the norm. <#\>This ar<l>ticle examines the relationship between productivity and diversity in three very differ<l>ent Australasian environ<l>ments: the heathlands of south-western Western Australia, the Great Barrier Reef, and the rainforests of New Guinea.</p>

<p><#\><bold>T</bold><smallcaps>he heathlands of south-western</smallcaps> Western Australia support some of the most diverse and spectacular plant com<l>munities on Earth. <#\>The entire south-western corner of Western Australia supports 10,000-12,000 species of plants, with the number of species per square kilometre rivalling those found in the richest rainforests. <#\>Most of the world's banksias, sundews (<it>Drosera</it>), and all of its dryandras, to mention only a few, are found in this small region of Australia. <#\>Yet it is remarkable that the bulk of these species comes from relatively few fami<l>lies, such as the Proteaceae, the family containing species of <it>Banksia, Dryandra, Grevillea</it> and others. <#\>Thus many species of rather similar plants coexist. <#\>This is all the more surprising as the landscape of the south-west is, superficially at least, rather monotonous. <#\>Most of the area is covered by highly infertile sandsheets, and there are few mountain ranges or sharp topographic features to provide microhabitats that might facilitate specia<l>tion. <#\>Subtle differences in soil type do, however, support different plant commu<l>nities.</p>

<p><#\>Many species in the region possess un<l>usual adaptations to extreme soil infertili<l>ty. <#\>The Western Australian Christmas Tree (<it>Nuytsia floribunda</it>) is a tree-sized mistletoe that gains nutrients by parasitis<l>ing the roots of grasses and other plants. <#\>The carnivorous plants are particularly abundant. <#\>They represent well over half of all the carnivorous species found in Australia; and two out of our seven genera, as well as the majority of two others, are found only in this small area. <#\>More than half the world's species of sundews (<it>Drosera</it>) are endemic, as is the Western Australian Pitcher Plant (<it>Cephalotus fol<l>licularis</it>), which is placed in its own family. <#\>Furthermore the bladderwort genus <it>Polypompholyx</it> is entirely restricted to the region as is one of the two rainbow plants (genus <it>Byblis</it>). <#\>All of these plants have turned to carnivory to meet their nutrient needs (they obtain nitrates and phos<l>phates from insects), and they speak elo<l>quently of the harsh constraints that the infertile soils of Western Australia places upon the flora. <#\>They add emphasis to the question of how so many different plant species could have evolved and come to coexist in such an infertile environment. <#\>Could the answer be in the very poverty of the environment itself?</p>

<p><#\>David Tilman of the Department of Ecology, University of Minnesota, sug<l>gested in 1982 that, in environments where nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates are in plentiful supply, those species that are best at utilising these nutrients can out-compete all similar spe<l>cies. <#\>A prime example of such a species is ourselves. <#\>In areas where nitrates, <O>photo</O> <O>caption</O> phosphates, water and soil abound, we can destroy almost all other species through intensive agriculture, reducing the environment to a monoculture. <#\>In less productive areas, such as those used for grazing, our ability to destroy the species competing with us is less, although with modern technology we are improving that ability. <#\>In the most unproductive environ<l>ments, humans are reduced to just another species among the multitudes, if they can exist at all.</p>

<p><#\>Tilman referred to such species as 'su<l>perspecies', but this term is already in es<l>tablished use in taxonomy where it has quite a different meaning. <#\>Perhaps the term 'exterminator species' is more ap<l>propriate for, although emotive and used in other contexts, it does adequately describe their effect.</p>

<p><#\>Humans are just one exterminator species among many, and Tilman argues that it is only where exterminator species are excluded that many species can coexist. <#\>They do this by becoming specialists, ex<l>ploiting subtle differences in the levels of critical resources (such as water and nutrients) in different areas. <#\>Thus, in the Western Australian heathlands, one spe<l>cies of <it>Banksia</it> may be able to survive in runoff areas where more nutrients are available than elsewhere. <#\>Another may survive in sand at the foot of dunes where water may accumulate. <#\>Yet another may <O>caption</O> survive in barren interdune areas because it can exist on very few nutrients. <#\>Be<l>cause of the complex interplay of soils, nutrient levels and water availability, many combinations of resource availability are possible in a nutrient-poor landscape, leading to the evolution of many specialist species.</p>

<p><#\>One further aspect of Australia's heathland has long puzzled me, and that is the spectacular heathland flowers, some of which are present throughout the year, and most of which drip with nectar. <#\>It seems anomalous that such apparent waste of effort should occur in such infer<l>tile areas. <#\>However, I think I have found a convincing explanation as to why this is so. <#\>Because of the diversity of plant spe<l>cies in the heathlands, the nearest poten<l>tial sexual partner of any individual plant may be a long way off. <#\>This means that pollinators, such as insects, mammals and honeyeaters, must be used for effective pollination. <#\>Yet in a nutrient-poor environ<l>ment such organisms, particularly the warm-blooded ones, are likely to be scarce. <#\>Thus competition exists between plants for these few pollinators. <#\>It takes fewer nutrients for a plant to make nectar, than it does to produce new leaves. <#\>This is because only water, air and sunlight are needed to make sugar, while nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates are es<l>sential for the production of new plant tis<l>sue. <#\>Thus, where nutrients are limited, it makes sense for a heathland plant to have blooms that produce lots of nectar to out-compete its fellows for the attentions of the rare pollinators. <#\>This is because its ability to produce nectar is not as tightly constrained by low soil fertility. <#\>The presence of abundant nectar alone, however, may not increase the abundance of most pollinators. <#\>Their numbers in most cases may not be restricted by the amount of nectar but rather by protein, because most species need some protein-rich food such as insects in order to sur<l>vive. <#\>And the number of insects present is probably limited by low soil primary produc<l>tivity due to poor soils.</p>

<p><#\>The process can perhaps best be thought of as an arms race; a literal war of the roses, where flower power wins the day. <#\>Some species avoid the arms race by flowering at times of the year when few <O>caption</O> <O>photo</O> other blooms are around, providing a con<l>tinuous food supply to the pollinators. <#\>Thus in a seeming paradox, these very nutrient-poor soils that heaths grow on support an abundance of plant species with the most luxurious flowers. <#\>Upon these feed specialised pollinators, includ<l>ing the tiny (ten grams) Honey-possum (<it>Tarsipes rostratus</it>), which is the only non-flying vertebrate to depend totally upon flowers for its food. <#\>So rich in nectar and pollen are the heaths of south-western Australia that a Honey-possum can virtually feed every day of the year and, for much of the time, find its food re<l>quirements from an area of no more than 40 square metres. <#\>And all of this because the environment is so nutrient-poor!</p>

<p><#\>A somewhat different example of great diversity is provided by the Great Barrier Reef. <#\>Coral organisms are animals that support photosynthetic algae inside their bodies. <#\>Such a strategy is most likely to have evolved in a very nutrient-poor situ<l>ation, the ancestors of coral animals being unable to find enough food by themselves, and taking advantage of a relationship with plants to supplement their food supply. <#\>The relationship remains useful, for coral reefs grow only in the most nutrient-poor warm waters. <#\>The reefs provide a home for an enormous diversity of fishes, and it is interesting that the nutrients present in a coral reef environment are cycled through the living animals of the reef very rapidly, with very little loss. <#\>Thus a small amount of nutrient is made to go a long way. <#\>Unfortunately, the too-rapid removal of parts of the system (such as large fish<l>es) can have disastrous effects. <#\>Today, the relatively small commercial and recrea<l>tional fisheries on the Great Barrier Reef are having a profound impact as preda<l>tors, algal grazers and other types of fish<l>es are removed from the environment.</p>

<p><#\>What happens if we enrich such a system? <#\>We do not need to guess, for we are carrying out an immense experi<l>ment. <#\>Queensland sugar cane growers fertilise their fields with large quantities of nitrates and phosphates. <#\>During the wet season much of these are washed down rivers and into the sea, eventually finding their way onto the nearer parts of the reef. <#\>In consequence, a monoculture of algae takes over from the wonderful reef diversity, much in the way that peo<l>ple and their agriculture take over from heathland with an application of super<?>-</?>phosphate.</p>

<p><#\><bold>A</bold><smallcaps>lthough Tilman's hypothesis seems</smallcaps> to work well for plants, and perhaps cold-blooded creatures such as fish, there are difficulties in applying it to the larger, warm-blooded creatures such as mam<l>mals. <#\>This is because these animals have high energy requirements and, in resource-poor environments, there might be not enough resources for them to sur<l>vive at all. <#\>Biologists from the CSIRO studying tree-dwelling marsupials (mostly possum species) in the eucalypt forests around Eden have found that 52 per cent of the forests contain no tree-dwelling mammals at all, and that 63 per cent of the tree-dwelling fauna is found in just nine per cent of the forests. <#\>They hypothesise that much of the forest is simply too nutrient-poor to support tree-dwelling marsupials, and that only the forests growing on better soils support large populations. <#\>In this case, however, matters are complicated by the <w>eucalypts'</w> propensity to manufacture toxins when they grow on poorer soils. <#\>The eucalypts that grow on more fertile soil respond to the presence of leaf-eating possums sim<l>ply by growing new leaves as the old ones are eaten. <#\>Eucalypts that grow on nutrient-poor soils, however, cannot do this because the lack of nutrients limits their growth. <#\>Instead they produce carbon-based toxins, especially tannins and phenolics, for much the same ener<l>getic reasons that the heathland plants produce nectar (that is, they are 'cheap' to produce), and are thus a less expensive way of dealing with leaf loss than by sim<l>ply growing new leaves. <#\>The tannins and phenolics work by disrupting the acid balance in the digestive systems of the leaf-eaters, preventing them from digest<l>ing their food.</p>

<p><#\>Despite the fact that the most resource-poor environments may have in<l>sufficient resources to support mammals, it may still be that environments with moderate resources might support more species than those with abundant resources, because of Tilman's proposed 'exterminator species' effect. <#\>It is difficult <O>caption</O> <O>photo</O> to carry out comparisons of mammal communities in resource-rich and resource-poor environments in Australia because of extinctions (almost a third of Australian mammals have become extinct since humans arrived here) and because of the fact that our few resource-rich en<l>vironments have been so dramatically al<l>tered by Europeans. <#\>A better place for such comparisons would be the high<?>-</?>lands of New Guinea, where very few (to date only seven) mammal extinctions have been documented over the past 40,000 years, and the highest diversities of Aus<l>tralian mammals (up to 120 species in a small area) occur. <#\>In particular, the areas of western and central New Guinea offer ideal comparisons because, while they are roughly similar in size and still har<l>bour substantial areas of upland rain<l>forest, they differ markedly in their soils.</p></I>
