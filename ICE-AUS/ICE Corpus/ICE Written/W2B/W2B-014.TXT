<#\><h><bold>The Underclass</bold></h>

<#\><h>Australia's social time bomb</h>

<p><#\><it>Australia's spreading pool of poverty was not an issue in the election campaign, but it's one of the first problems the new government must face.</it> <#\><it>There are beggars in our city streets, and chronically deprived people in suburban and rural areas.</it> <#\><it>Poverty and disadvantage are being passed to a new generation, creating a breed of outlaw children who reject all help.</it> <#\><it><smallcaps>Lyndall Crisp</smallcaps> details the issue no party has faced<*>dotted line</*></it></p>

<p><#\><bold>T</bold>he Underclass is Australia's per<l>manent poor, but it is much more than that. <#\>Apart from the urban street kids who get publicity, the Underclass today is very different from 20 years ago. <#\>The numbers are certainly bigger but more im<l>portantly, our society safety net seems un<l>able to protect the newest recruits: the middle-aged unemployed family man, single mothers and those isolated in the badly-serviced outer suburbs of modern sprawling cities.</p>

<p><#\>The Underclass includes the socially disadvantaged, from the Aboriginals and the handicapped to the abused, the homeless and the mentally disturbed who have been left adrift in the community by state governments concerned with saving money. <#\> They are the single mothers iso<l>lated in inaccessible, sterile public housing suburbs or high rise flats, and the migrants who cannot speak English or find a per<l>manent job. <#\>Dislocated and lonely, many fail to call on established public support systems. <#\>They do not know the systems exist, or feel too intimidated or hostile to make the approach. <#\>At least the Depart<l>ment of Housing, recognising that the cost of a decent house is nothing compared with the cost of supporting a dysfunction<l>al family for perhaps 30 or 40 years, is reversing a long tradition of building public housing ghettoes where such social problems propagate.</p>

<p><#\>But for many, the hardships they en<l>dure are passed from one generation to the next. <#\>It is not just a matter of being poor: <#\>their values and behaviour can be askew. <#\>Alcoholism is not uncommon, health is neglected and truancy runs un<l>checked. <#\>Too often, the abused becomes the abuser, the dole cheque is familiar to both father and son, the single mother watches her single teenage daughter play<l>ing with her new baby.</p>

<p><#\>What is intriguing, and even more wor<l>rying, is the gradual emergence of a new sub<l>stratum: a breed of young people who expect society to provide them with the life<l>style of their choice without their giving any<l>thing back.<#\>They feel no obligation to work and thumb their noses at most traditional so<l>cial structures: <#\>they are a problem for society but not for themselves.</p>

<p><#\>These are the kids who are prepared to live on the street, to exist on petty crime, to sleep rough, sell their bodies, play with drugs. <#\>They reject any notion of account<l>ability and embrace day-to-day existence which often means premature death. <#\>Their numbers are less than has been suggested by some social commentators, but they are in<l>creasing, particularly in the Kings Cross area of Sydney. <#\>It seems only a matter of time before they emerge in other cities, as they have in Britain and the US.</p>

<p><#\>In the worst cases they resort to a type of crime now not uncommon: a mutilation murder, for example, that is so horrific it defies the imagination.</p>

<p><#\>Youth counsellors working with street kids talk about them <quote>hurtling from day to day</quote>, kids who are <quote>totally feral</quote><*>dotted line</*>and, <quote>something scary</quote> happening out there. <#\>A number of these kids profess to be happy, <#\>they neither want our sympathy and help, nor do they hanker for a more stable, com<l>fortable lifestyle.</p>

<p><#\>If it turns out this unique section of The Underclass is the natural progression, the end result, of the other, familiar stratas, then what is the answer? <#\>With the chronic lack of affordable housing, fewer and fewer unskilled jobs, cuts in social welfare support systems and an ever-in<l>creasing cost of living, the Federal and <O>photo</O> <O>caption</O> state governments seem to be encourag<l>ing membership of The Underclass rather than inhibiting it.</p>

<p><#\>Bob Hawke rang the warning bells as long ago as 1979. <#\>In his Boyer lecture, The Resolution of Conflict, he said: <X><quote>There is an insidious tendency to identify the un<l>employed as the architects of their own misfortune <longdash> to attribute to them some intrinsic inferiority either of character or intensity of purpose<*>dotted line</*><#\>More and more of our people, especially the young and under-privileged, will be increasingly sus<l>ceptible<*>dotted line</*>if we do not provide them with employment or security with a sense of fulfilment. <#\>If we do no do this we have no right to demand or expect their adherence to the values of a free society.</quote></X></p>

<p><#\>The former president of the Australian Council of Social Services, Julian Disney, says the main differences between today's so-called Underclass and that of the 70s is the "blow-out" in the number of sole parents and the number of unemployed heads of family. <#\><quote>In the early 80s, the num<l>ber of children dependent on unemployed parents increased by at least 50%.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>A major factor in all this is drugs.</quote> <#\><quote>The major blow-out in crime was drugs and the major cause of drug use is unhappiness and dissatisfaction, and family break<?><l></?>down.</quote> <#\><quote>We're putting more pressure on the basic family unit than ever before in recorded history.</quote> <#\><quote>We have totally unrealis<l>tic expectations of couples and couples are being left on their own without an ex<l>tended family around them</quote> <#\><quote>It's the single greatest cause in the breakdown of human relations and therefore people have no great incentive or enthusiasm.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>What we've got to do, over the next 10 years, is strengthen the family unit.</quote> <#\><quote>Families where there are two incomes are now estab<l>lished.</quote> <#\><quote>We've got to move to what I call the three-quarter income family, where one works full time, the other part time and then swap around so couples have more time for their kids and each other.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Disney says yuppie two-income families drive up housing prices which in turn increases the pressure on low-income families. <#\>He thinks middle Australia has <quote>ridiculous expectations of life and un<l>necessary luxuries. <#\>It angers me greatly when I hear people complaining about the lowering of living standards. <#\>The test is not to study disposable income trends but sales of micro-waves, VCRs and second car sales. <#\>We're an affluent country.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Another problem, says Disney, is that Australia is one of the few developed countries with such an imbalance in population distribution. <#\><quote>There should be a higher proportion of Australians living outside Sydney and Melbourne and we must develop more provincial towns, like Newcastle and Wollongong, if we want to keep generous home property areas, low density cities and housing prices down.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Brian Howe, who has held the Social Security portfolio for six years, says he is <quote>resisting a sense of hopelessness. <#\>I don't see it like that. <#\>When you start writing off groups of people, that's a theory of pover<l>ty which is to do with culture. <#\>It suggests there's some culture which prevents people getting opportunities. <#\>It's not so much a culture as, for example, very bad housing policies where you put such people together. <#\>That does make it hope<l>less because it's a multi-deficit situation where there are so many negatives that it's very difficult to create positives. <#\>If we have ghettoes we'll create a sense of hope<l>lessness.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Many of Australia's social problems, says Howe, are 
related to the <quote>extremely high</quote> levels of unemployment during the 80s and the fact that people outside the mainstream did not have access to jobs when they did become available. <#\>Part of the answer is to put together a package of services, such as better transport and childcare centres, so these people, espe<l>cially sole parents, can get to jobs and training courses. <#\>Services should be relevant and situated where they are most needed: <#\>they should get to people before their problems reach crisis stage.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The Commonwealth could help people to know what is available, and edu<l>cate them to use the facilities and that it's normal to feel stressed living in the framework of a big city,</quote> says Howe.</p>

<p><#\><quote>A lot of the publicity about poverty tends to be a bit romantic, people talk about it as if it's exciting in some way. </quote> <#\><quote>Whereas the problem of poverty is the grinding normality of being stuck out in these ordinary suburbs without the most basic facilities and without people being able to participate. </quote> <#\><quote>It's not that they're horrible, terrible places <longdash> they're nor<l>mal, leafy streets in which everything looks hunky dory. </quote> <#\><quote>But behind the cur<l>tains you've got a lot of tension and dif<l>ficulties.</quote></p>

<#\><h><bold>Those street kids</bold></h>

<p><#\>When it comes to the homeless and street kids some questionable statistics are ban<l>died about. <#\>A popular figure in the media late last year for kids living on Sydney's Kings Cross streets <longdash> where the greatest concentration has always been <longdash> was 12,000.</p>

<p><#\>In February 1989, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission's inquiry into homeless children <longdash> that is, children whose lifestyle <quote>includes insecurity and transiency of shelter</quote> <longdash> said its inde<l>pendent consultant, Dr Rodney Fopp, found that at the <quote>very least</quote> there were, na<l>tionally, 8500 homeless 12-to-15 year olds and 3500 16 and 17-year-olds, over any twelve month period.</p>

<p><#\>Given that, according to 1987 statistics, more than 9000 Australian households (26,790 people) live in improvised dwell<l>ings and another 93,641 households (almost 200,000) live in caravans and other temporary shelter, Fopp put the total num<l>ber of homeless children, includ<l>ing children <quote>at risk</quote> of being homeless, at somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000. <#\>The Inquiry considered the estimates to be <quote>extremely conservative.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Government welfare agency staff and community workers are puzzled by the numbers, much quoted by the media. <#\>They ask who is doing the head count? <#\>How are they doing it? <#\>Where <it>are</it> these hordes of kids hanging out? <#\>Common sense alone would suggest that an area as small as Kings Cross could not support 12,000 free-ranging children.</p>

<p><#\>Annie Crowe and Ian Hood, who have worked with kids in Kings Cross for more than 10 years, say the figure for the inner city area is closer to 100. <#\>The number fluctuates because the kids move around and the plethora of religious, volunteer, council and government aid agencies <longdash> it has become a growth industry since the spread of AIDS became a significant concern in 1985 <longdash> are often counting the same heads. <#\><quote>It's a wonder we're not battering each other to death to get the last one,</quote> says Crowe. <#\>(A youth worker tells of the time he ap<l>proached a distressed teenage boy at Sydney's Central Railway Station late one evening. <#\>The boy said he had seen a television program about thousands of street kids and had come to town to join them. <#\>But after wandering around all day, he had not been able to find one.)</p>

<p><#\>Much has been written about street kid. <#\>Their stories are often tragic and should never be demeaned, but many are wildly exaggerated for the benefit of the media. <#\>At the Cross, the kids even have a fee scale for inter<l>views. <#\>Any TV crew looking for "talent" has to fight off the volunteers, each ex<l>perienced in what constitutes a sensation<l>al "grab" and how to cough, wheeze, weep <O>photo</O> or sigh <longdash> whatever is appropriate <longdash> on cue. <#\>It is a joke among the youth workers.</p>

<p><#\>Last December, a min<l>ister of the Uniting Church, Bill Crews, wrote a letter to a prominent newspaper in which he said: <quote>many of these kids are totally feral. <#\>They rest<l>lessly wander all night be<l>cause they are afraid to sleep in the dark. <#\>They'd rather travel to our refuge via the roofs and drains of Sydney<*>dotted line</*>than use the front door. <#\>These kids are getting progressively more violent.</quote></p>

<p><#\><it>The Bulletin</it> asked to meet these <quote>feral kids</quote> but it was not to be. <#\>One meeting was arranged at a refuge, a derelict house between a vacant allotment and a car park, but no one showed. <#\>Crews later ex<l>plained that, unfortunately, all the kids he had lined up had that very morning been nabbed by the police for armed robbery.</p>

<p><#\>On February 9 the same newspaper ran a big picture on its front page of a bunch of street kids sleeping under the Sydney Town Hall steps. <#\>The picture looked suspiciously posed, with one child grinning. <#\>The story failed to make mention that it was supplied by Crews and while sup<l>posed to illustrate the news that the num<l>bers had swelled alarmingly since Christmas, was in fact taken last year.</p>

<p><#\>Be that as it may, the problem exists and cannot be swept under the carpet. <#\>What youth workers Crowe and Hood emphasise, and what is probably most frightening, is that while some of these kids have not had an even break since the day they were born, others come from average, middle-class families where there is no hint of violence or abuse.</p></I>
