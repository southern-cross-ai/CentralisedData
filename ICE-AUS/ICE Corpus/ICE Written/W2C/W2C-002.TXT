<I><#\><h><bold>Daikyo stops $800m projects</bold></h>
<#\><h><bold>Over-reaction, says Goss</bold></h>
<#\><h><bold>JAP FREEZE ON QUEENSLAND</bold></h>

<p><#\>G<smallcaps>IANT</smallcaps> Japanese resort and develop<l>ment company Daik<l>yo has halted all its new projects <longdash> worth $800 million <longdash> on the Gold Coast and Cairns.</p>

<p><#\>The company said the shock move was made be<l>cause of uncertainty caused by a Trades Prac<l>tices Commission inquiry into its Cairns hotel holdings.</p>

<p><#\>The stop-work decision <longdash> involving thousands of jobs <longdash> comes at a time when tourism in Queens<l>land is experiencing a ma<l>jor downturn and the Cairns construction in<l>dustry is on its knees.</p>

<p><#\>Daikyo chief executive, Sir Sydney Schubert, yes<l>terday described the freeze as a "considered" move in a tricky economic climate.</p>

<p><#\>He strongly rejected a claim by the Premier, Mr Goss, that the company had over-reacted.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Goss described the company's move as <quote>quite unnecessary</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>But Sir Sydney said: <quote>There's no use going ahead with a project until the condition is clarified.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>To carry on spending money on design fees and basic construction costs which might be wasted <longdash> no company could afford that.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>It's not a petulant move to put on any pres<l>sure, it's simply stating the actual position of our company.</quote> <#\><quote>It's been well considered.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Sir Sydney, speaking as he teed off at the Royal Queensland Golf Club, refused to say whether he though racist motives lay behind the TPC inquiry.</p>

<p><#\>He did not want to say anything that could in<l>flame the situation, he said, but defended the freeze on new projects.</p>

<p><#\><quote>In the private sector, when you're spending money which could be wasted, I don't think it's an over-reaction,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The bottom line is profit and with the pres<l>ent state of the tourism industry and hotels not exactly booming, you have to watch the bottom line.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Daikyo's shock an<l>nouncement comes amid reports that another ma<l>jor Pacific rim trading company is set to pull out of Queensland and trans<l>fer operations to Hong Kong.</p>

<p><#\>There is also a question mark over $600 million worth of resort develop<l>ments planned by Koshin Co for the Gold Coast af<l>ter the company president was arrested in Japan for allegedly manipulating share prices.</p>

<p><#\>The projects Daikyo has halted include:

<#\><*>Bullet</*>A $400 million resort at Palm Cove, 26km north of Cairns, which was to have begun next week and would have employed 1800 people during construction;

<*>Bullet</*>A Cairns city office tower;

<*>Bullet</*>And the $300 million Gold Coast International Resort in the heart of Surfers Paradise.</p>

<p><#\>D<smallcaps>AIKYO</smallcaps> is by far the largest Japanese investor in Queensland and has concentrated on leisure-based investments and world-standard golf courses.</p>

<p><#\>It already has a $1 billion stake in the Sunshine State, including the Brisbane Sheraton Hotel, Gold Coast Inter<l>national Hotel, <w>Cairns'</w> Four Seasons, plus 50 percent of the Cairns Hilton and Cairns Inter<l>national, and 25 percent of Jupiter's Casino and the Conrad International on the Gold Coast.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Goss said the Daik<l>yo freeze was <quote>quite unnecessary</quote> and the TPC inquiry had nothing to do with the State Govern<l>ment.</p>

<p><#\><quote>We didn't initiate it, we have got no control over it,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>The Government had no problems with the Palm Cove project be<l>cause it proposed to add something to north Queensland's tourist in<l>frastructure, he said.</p>

<p><#\>However the Four Sea<l>sons deal, which the Gov<l>ernment had opposed, would have increased Daikyo's market share without adding any value to the State economy.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I think that there is a clear distinction between Palm Cove and Four Sea<l>sons,</quote> Mr Goss said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Palm Cove is new, with Daikyo constructing new facilities and provid<l>ing new employment, whereas Four Seasons was an existing opera<l>tion.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Mr Goss said he had not contacted Federal Treasurer Paul Keating about the Daikyo action but would be in touch with the Japanese com<l>pany tomorrow to find out <quote>what their concerns are</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>A Daikyo corporate spokesman said the com<l>pany was greatly con<l>cerned about the invest<l>ment uncertainty caused by the TPC inquiry and the State Government's stand on foreign owner<l>ship.</p>

<p><#\>He said the freeze was <quote>a serious economic move; a hard business decision</quote>.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The freeze will stay until the situation is clear<l>ly sorted out once and for all.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>We will not launch into such a huge expendi<l>ture when there is a chance that the Trade Practices Commission in<l>quiry could stop it proceeding.</quote></p> 

<p><#\><quote>The commission is working in relatively un<l>charted waters.</quote> <#\><quote>Previous<l>ly it has looked at situa<l>tions like BHP taking over a like company and dominating the market.</quote> <#\><quote>But is it now going to look at a company like AMP perhaps, dominating sub<l>urban shopping centres?</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>Even the hotel indus<l>try itself hasn't sorted out what a two-star, three-star, or five-star hotel in Australia is.</quote> <#\><quote>And yet the TPC is examining Daik<l>yo's Cairns hotel holdings to see if it is in a dominant role.</quote> <#\><quote>If the industry is un<l>certain what hotel star ratings represent, where does that leave the TPC?</quote></p>

<p><#\>The TPC's regional di<l>rector, Mr Alan Ducret, said he believed a decision on the inquiry could be delivered in the next two weeks.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The question of domi<l>nation came up and it was up to us to look into it.</quote> <#\><quote>If they have frozen work on their projects as a result, that would be quite a pity,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>The Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, said the inquiry had been initiated by conl<l>cerned businesses in Cairns.</p>

<p><#\>Gold Coast mayor, Ald Lex Bell, is concerned that the hold on Daikyo's plans will leave another unsightly vacant bloc, in the heart of Surfers Paradise.</p>

<p><#\>The Gold Coast Inter<l>national Resort site is one of 42 undeveloped blocks concerning the council.</p>

<p><#\><quote>We would not like to see another construction site remain empty. <#\>We have got quite enough that are empty now,</quote> Ald Bell said.</p>

<p><#\>The council has been pressing the Foreign In<l>vestment Review board to force overseas developers to build on land within the time frame set out in the regional purchase approval.</p>

<p><#\>The FIRB has relaxed time limits for develop<l>ment of Gold Coast sites owned by foreigners be<l>cause of the economic downturn.</p>

<p><#\>On Friday, Gold Coast Council aldermen decided to put pressure on the Treasurer, Mr Keating, to use legislation to make developers begin their projects.</p>

<p><#\>Ald Bell said, it was sad to see buildings in the heart of Surfers Paradise pulled down and nothing put up in their place.</p>

<p><#\><quote>We are writing to Mr Keating to say that the present situation is just not satisfactory,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>We don't believe that the time development rules should be relaxed.</quote> <#\><quote>It has got quite out of hand.</quote> <#\><quote>Mr Keating should do something.</quote> <#\><quote>It is not as though we want him to change the rules after the fact.</quote> <#\><quote>We want the rules that are there enforced.</quote></p>

<p><#\>He said Daikyo had helped the council. <#\><quote>They are giving us some land from the site to enable us to widen the Gold Coast Highway.</quote> <#\><quote>That has not been transferred yet so I hope this situation does not change that.</quote></p>

<#\><h><bold>GOSS TORPEDOED <w>PREMIERS'</w> FRONT</bold></h>

<#\><bold>By political reporter</bold>

<#\><bold><smallcaps>TESS LIVINGSTONE</smallcaps></bold>


<p><#\>THE Queensland Pre<l>mier, Mr Goss, tor<l>pedoed a plan by all other premiers to con<l>front Treasurer Keating with a "give us a better deal or we'll all raise state taxes" ultimatum.</p>

<p><#\>Parliament House sources in Canberra said the move was discussed in on Thursday night and Friday morning, with the South Australian Pre<l>mier, Mr Bannon, playing a leading part.</p>

<p><#\>Even New South Wales Liberal Premier Mr Greiner was prepared to line up with his Labor counterparts with the threat of higher taxes and only Mr Goss, bound by an election promise of "no new taxes", prevented a united front.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Goss was reluctant to discuss the planned ul<l>timatum yesterday, but said with a grin: <quote>Well, Queenslanders are always difficult.</quote> <#\>He also said Mr Keating was not the type of character to be moved by such a stance, especially given the fiscal restraint the Com<l>monwealth had imposed on itself.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Goss returned to Queensland yesterday ready to take the pruning sheers to existing state programs in the lead-up to his first Budget.</p>

<p><#\><quote>It's tough on all the states and Queensland is looking at a $500 million shortfall over the next three years.</quote> <#\>Mr Goss said.</p>

<p><#\>He said he and the State Treasurer, Mr De Lacy, would put the op<l>tions to Cabinet bluntly tomorrow <longdash> the shortfall could be made up by im<l>posing a fuel tax or finan<l>cial institutions duty, or by cuts in existing govern<l>ment programs.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Goss said tax in<l>creases would be avoided, and high budget areas such as Primary Indus<l>tries, Transport and Land Management had already been identified as areas where savings could be made in capital and recurrent spending.</p>

<p><#\>This could see cuts in the rail electrification program, 
mapping, sur<l>veying, land management and soil conservation and primary industries subsi<l>dies.</p>

<p><#\>The Premier said pro<l>grams that had been oper<l>ating for a number of years would be examined to see if they still deserved the priority they were being given.</p>

<p><#\>He said the Govern<l>ment was on target to honour its promise of a "Seniors Card" with con<l>cessions for Queens<l>landers over 70, but this could have to be "trimmed".</p>

<p><#\>Mr Goss rejected claims by the Liberal Leader, Mr. Beanland, that Queensland's free hospital system was in jeopardy. <#\>He said Queensland had received a 3.4 percent increase in base hospital funding, compared with a national average of 2.3 percent.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Beanland said Mr Goss was planning to take the axe to primary pro<l>ducers.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Beanland said the reduction of farm truck registration concessions would cost primary producers more than $8 million.</p>

<p><#\>He said Mr Goss could "talk tough" about spend<l>ing cuts but he had to find an extra $350 million to fund new expenditure.</p>

<p><#\>The Opposition Lead<l>er, Mr Cooper, said Queenslanders would have to ask themselves and the Government "where is the money com<l>ing from" every time a Minister announced a new initiative.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Every dollar in spending that is announced and is not matched by a cut somewhere else will be carrying Queenslanders closer to increased taxes following the tough result at the <w>premiers'</w> confer<l>ence</quote> Mr Cooper said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>It is one thing to achieve efficiencies and savings.</quote> <#\><quote>It is another to decimate budgets in a bid to implement extra pro<l>grams.</quote> <#\><quote>What you can so easily end up with is programs that do not work because they are under<?>-</?>funded.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>Queenslanders may be much better off if there was simply a moratorium on new Government services and programs until the economy picks up.</quote></p>

<#\><h><bold>TAXI SEX CLUE IN MURDER RIDDLE</bold></h>

<#\><bold>By <smallcaps>GUY KER</smallcaps></bold>

<p><#\>T<smallcaps>HE</smallcaps> sexual esca<l>pades of some Bunda<l>berg taxi drivers could explain one of the most baffling murders ever committed in the State.</p>

<p><#\>Detectives investigat<l>ing the unsolved slaying of cabbie Bryan Hodgkin<l>son nearly three years ago now believe he may have been killed by a jealous husband <longdash> possibly one of the city's leading citizens.</p>

<p><#\>Inquiries have so far failed to pinpoint a sus<l>pect, but details of the crime suggest an intrigu<l>ing link to the pattern of nocturnal dalliance that has since come to light among taxi drivers plying their trade in the sugar city.</p>

<p><#\>A number of cabbies have confessed in recent interviews to conducting illicit affairs with custom<l>ers, adding weight to the revenge theory given cre<l>dence by the symbolism of the execution.</p>

<p><#\>Popular with col<l>leagues and customers alike, 48-year-old Mr Hodgkinson was found on September 10, 1987, stab<l>bed and bludgeoned to death on a remote road<l>side about 25 km from town.</p>

<p><#\>A number of opportune places for murder along the highway had been overlooked in favour of the site chosen <longdash> the entrance to a Uniting Church home for wayward boys.</p>

<p><#\>The suave, debonair cabbie had been frog-marched from his cab, hit about the head and then forced to walk a few metres further to the spot where he was finished off, his jugular vein severed by a 15cm blade.</p>

<p><#\>Placed neatly beside his outstretched right hand were his hankerchief, watch and false teeth.</p>

<p><#\>The murderer then drove the cab back to town, wiped it free of fingerprints and dumped it in a suburban street.</p>

<p><#\>The possibility that the murder was a warning to small town Lotharios milking their profession of its sexual fringe bene<l>fits is increasingly favoured by Det Sgt Tim Roche, the 45-year-old investiga<l>tor in charge of the case.</p>

<p><#\><quote>When we started ask<l>ing questions among the cabbies people came for<l>ward and said: <quote>This is confidential, but I'm hav<l>ing an affair with so and so <longdash> for goodness sake don't tell my wife</quote></quote>, said Sgt Roche last week.</p></I>
