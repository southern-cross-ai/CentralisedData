<I><p><#\>Superficially it may seem that literary works appeal more to the intellect than the emotions given that active participation is required to decipher a piece of literature. <#\>Likewise it may appear that films appeal to emotions, especially <del>of</del> with the use of sensationalism and special effects used to grab an audience's attention. <#\>However this does not take into account the <del>fl</del> film maker's and the author's ability to <del>l</del> manipulate their medium to create a work. <#\>The respective skills & expertise of the author/film maker <del>and the with</del> and creative use of these, is <del>enough</del> the key to reversing this notion.</p>

<p><#\>Intellectual appeal is achieved through active participation, exercise of the imagination, the layering of detail and the multiplicity of levels. <#\>It cannot be concluded that only literature <}><->fall </-><+>falls</+></}> under these elements.</p>

<p><#\>No<space>where better is there an example of active participation in a film greater than in Greenaway's <ul>Prospero's</ul> <ul>Books</ul>. <#\>The audience is required to combine all the elements and relate <del>to</del> them to some previous cinematic experience to extract meaning. <#\>Greenaway asks the audience to exercise imagination both visually & aurally. <#\>He layers the images in great detail, using every aspect of photography. <#\>It is not the conventional means of achieving simultaneous action and it is the lack of convention that works the mind. <#\>Similarly he uses unconventional means in sound. <#\>Gielgud's Prospero has the voice over for all the characters, a <del>suggeslion</del> suggesting that he has the power over the other characters. <#\>When this power is relinquished we hear a more <del>natural</del> realistic use of voices. <#\>Likewise sound is used to add depth to character, with distortions for Caliban, echoes and unsynchronised voices.</p>

<p><#\>In doing so Greenaway gives the narrative a figurative level as well as a literal one. <#\>Shakespeare's tale of the Tempest is told but Prospero becomes the creator, <del>and the</del> with Shakespearean power over the content. <#\>His pen becomes his sword.</p>

<p><#\>The mise en scene is detailed and layered <del>a </del>showing multiplicity of themes. <#\>From disorder to order, violence to harmony, nature versus art is all visually presented to the audience, in the detailed imagery that parallels a Renaissance painting.</p>

<p><#\>Like Shakespeare's poetry, the more Greenaway's film is viewed the greater depth of meaning is revealed and on subsequent viewing an audience understands more.</p>

<p><#\>It is not <del>the</del> a film that is felt or willed but one where the mind is in control. <#\>Films cannot be categorised into those that <del>only</del> mostly deal with emotions as literature cannot be categorised into only appealing to the mind. <#\>Literature has the ability to evoke <del>and</del> feelings and tantalise senses.</p>

<p><#\>McEwan's treatment of the <ul>Comfort</ul> of <ul>Strangers</ul> shows an author's skill in <del>touching the</del> disturbing the emotions. <#\>Simultaneously he draws the reader and repels. <#\>In the same way as Mary and Colin are fascinated with the repulsive <longdash> the Freudian theory of <foreign>Unheimlich</foreign> <longdash>so to is the reader tantalised by something that is quite disturbing.</p>

<p><#\>McEwan's <del>to</del> emotional hold over the reader is embedded in the discourse. <#\>His style is economical and his careful word choice <del>use</del> make everything said, purposeful. <#\>There is the use of many word<del><O>unclear</O></del><space>s that express order and rationality along with those express discomfort and lack of control. <#\>Juxtaposition too, <del>ps</del> places routine and pattern alongside disorder and disquiet. <#\>Just as the reader feels secure in the <del>text</del> plot <del>it</del> they are imbalanced with something disturbing.</p>

<p><#\>There is no nominalisation of the setting, a feeling of insecurity and just as the reader is revealed more and becomes familiar with the known, the plot takes away that security. <#\>The reader is beholden to McEwan's power, <del>as the</del> just as Mary & Colin <del>an</del> are momentarily relaxed in Robert's company to be caught in his power.</p>

<p><#\>At this point in the <del>story</del> novel, the reader is not exercising the mind to come to grips with the plot. <#\>There may be some psychoanalysis of theme and characters at the conclusion, but the overwhelming <del>ws</del> urge is continue. <#\>McEwan has achieved a hold over the emotions while tantalising the senses of the reader. <#\>It can <del>b</del> almost be paralleled to Mary's urge to scratch the mosquito bites, which knowingly worsen if she does. <#\>So the reader is urged to continue in a powerless fashion.</p>

<p><#\>Greenaway's clever example of an intellectual film and McEwan's <del><O>unclear</O></del> disturbing novel are fine instances of an film maker and author being able to manipulate their medium. <#\>If the art form can be worked to suit the purpose of its creator then it can be categorised into intellectual or emotional boxes. <#\>To do this is to deny the ability of a skilled artist.</p></I>

<I><p><#\>Texts and cinematic translations are fundamentally different medias. <#\>They have their own unique set of codes and techniques. <#\>It is the use of these codes and techniques that an author & a film maker suit to their purpose. <#\>A reader or audience will adopt a particular attitude by feeling empathy with the creator or feeling confronted <del>with</del> by them.</p>

<p><#\>A playwright has the use of words to create images and time. <#\><del>Hi</del> Themes and viewpoints must be embedded in the discourse and revealed through the characters on stage. <#\>Shaw's play <ul>Pygmalion</ul> reveals a number of themes important to his notion of portraying realism. <#\>These themes are disguised in his comedy, the art of educating through entertainment. <#\>The <del>these of</del> comment on socio-economic <del>bin level</del> class tied to money is expressed through his variety of characters <longdash> the Eynsford-Hills have respectability and no money, Higgins treats all classes equally rude. <sent><#\>Eliza's independence comes with education, <#\>she will be able to teach as Higgins does to make her way, <del>for</del>.</sent> <sent><#\>The theme of technology's effect on humanity is discussed, <#\>Eliza is Higgins  & Pickering's experiment, devoid of humanity and feelings not taken into consideration.</sent></p> 

<p><sent><#\>Shaw's use of comedy, Mrs Higgins at-<space>home party as an example, <del>to</del> enables his audience to escape the realism of the class struggle, <#\>they suspend their <del><O>unclear</O></del> disbelief momentarily in entertainment.</sent></p>

<p><#\>By embedding his attitude in genre, style and technique, Shaw educates his audiences, reveals his viewpoint but disguises it in entertainment that <del>allows</del> diverts the audience <del>to be</del> from the immediacy of the world around them.</p>

<p><#\>The film maker must use a different set of codes and techniques to reveal point of view. <#\>Pascal's, 1938, production of Pygmalion adopts a romantic attitude to Shaw's play. <#\>Unlike Shaw's Pygmalion with its non-romantic outlook between the sexes, <del>the aim</del> this film adopts the opposing view. <#\>Although it adheres to the text, for the most part, <del>for</del> it is in the conclusion where the film maker's true intention lies. <#\>The ending is altered significantly, taking the romantic approach, one universally appealing. <#\>In addition to the screen play being a significant element so too are the visual images created. <#\>Pascal's production has a younger & physically attractive Higgins, a romantic quality, <del>all</del> making the romantic conclusion more acceptable. <#\>Similarly, Eliza is less repulsive, dirty, whose voice doesn't irritate as imagined it should. <#\>The realism if the lower class struggle, its poverty, lack of education and means is softened.</p>

<p><#\>These subdued images <del>is</del> create<del>s</del> <del>a</del> a fantasy for the audience and a form of escape. <#\>The big screen, with its commanding attention is size, proximity and movement may well overwhelm its audience with <del>i <O>unclear</O></del> the ugliness of realism. <#\>The film maker, in addition to screenplay and characters has used sound and all aspects of <foreign>mise en scene</foreign> to develop the romantic notion. <#\>The music is melo-dramatic in Pascal's Pygmalion and the <del>to</del> lighting and scenery is subdued concealing the true images of London lower class life.</p>

<p><#\>The filmmaker is concerned with making <quote>the visual aspects significant</quote> whilst the playwright making <quote>significant visual</quote> Robert Richardson <longdash> Literature & the Novel) <#\>Both must use the codes and techniques of their own medium to develop attitude <#\>The <del>playwrit</del> playwright has only words which are revealed through character & plot whilst the film maker has visual <del>um</del> immediacy full of detail, <del>which mu</del></p>

<p><#\>The statement provided in the question do assist in analyzing the <del><O>unclear</O></del> story "The Dead" and the film "The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith". <#\>There are other issues touched on in both of these works, though the conflict between two sets of cultural values is evident in both.</p>

<p><#\>In "The Dead", the conflict, or conflicts, arise essentially between past and present. <#\>The figure of Gabriel, product of a new intellectual order, seemingly happy with Gretta, is pitted against the old ways in the shape of many of the other characters. <#\>He is of a cosmopolitan viewpoint (or at least a viewpoint encompassing more than Ireland), which is one of the basic tenets of the everyman's emerging perception of himself versus the world.</p>

<p><#\>The old, insular notions of non-questioning, non-intellectualism are displayed most of all by Gabriel two old aunts. <#\>Their old age is a metaphor for the decrepitude into which their thinking has fallen. <#\>This is the dying society of "The Dead". <#\>One of non-questioning being replaced by another intellectual one. <#\>The evidence is to be found at several points through the story. <#\>Firstly, there is the discussion of singers, in which despite even the evidence in front of their ears, as it were, of Mr Bartell D'arcy, all the best singers were long ago. <#\>The "golden age" for these people is way back when. <#\>When it is suggested that such singers exist in other locales on the Continent, it is dismissed as an irrelevancy. <#\>They cannot adapt.</p>

<p><#\>Gabriel, in his speech, speaks of "preserving" the old fashioned honest values of welcome and kindness that Ireland's famous for. <#\>They are being lost to the new hyper-intellectuals. <#\>It is certainly a cynical and ironic speech, spoken certainly for the audience, given that he considers his aunts to be "ignorant". <#\>In his mind even it is possible he knows that their kind is slipping away, and he most likely does not altogether mourn for that.</p>

<p><#\>There are surprises for him too, however, that are ironic in light of his new thinking. <#\>Upon arriving, his programmed chatting with a girl he has seen grow into a young woman, should by the polite game of conversation in this culture, see her happily and conventionally talking of taking her place in the culture regardless of her personal feelings. <#\>Instead her exclamations regarding her true thoughts on men demonstrate a break from the past. <#\>The fact that Gabriel is not prepared for this shows him to be a <del><O>unclear</O></del> raw product of this dying culture, even if he has attempted to refine himself.</p>

<p><#\><del>His</del> The <quote>crow to pluck</quote> that Miss Ivors has with him points out an even different re-structuring from a simple ignorance to intellectual thought. <#\>Miss Ivors, while clearly breaking with tradition in many ways, nonetheless seems to see Ireland and its well-being the first duty of any citizen. <#\>Her gently prodding of <quote>G.C.</quote> over his lit reviews seems at first a playful jibe, but her calling him, in public, a <quote>West Briton</quote>, mainly due to his holiday destination it would seem, show that there is not a one-to-one correlation between becoming intellectually aware, and increasing one's horizons. <#\>The old society of non-questioning is dying, but it is being replaced by a multitude of new thoughts, as <del>bef</del> its a critically analytical culture.</p>

<p><#\>Finally, the revelations that Gretta provides in terms of Michael Furey reveal how pointless Gabriel's intellectual travail has been, how much it appears to have stifled him as a feeling person. <#\>It points out that the death of a non-thinking culture is not altogether a good thing if the capacity to feel is lost as well. <#\>In the end, it doesn't matter. <sent><#\>The blanket of snow falls, <#\>death comes regardless of thought, and the struggle of birth becomes an irrelevance.</sent> <#\>Still, this is the central theme of the story, and is helpful to bear in mind in analyzing it.</p>

<p><#\>In "The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith", the story is played out against the backdrop of impending federation in Australia. <#\>This differs from the dead in that it is only a political re-alignment, rather than a fundamental cultural emergence.</p></I>
