<#\><h><bold>Democracy undermined: 
reforms to the Australian 
public service from 
Whitlam to Hawke</bold></h> 

<p><#\>Since the Second World War the two challenges confronting government administration have been to ensure that the bureaucracy responded to the wishes of its political masters and to ensure that the bureaucracy responded with sensitivity to the wishes of the public. <#\>Directly related to these problems of responsiveness and sensitivity were a host of 'technical' problems which arose from the organisational structures of government: red tape, insensitivity, slowness, rigidity, time serving, conservatism, confusion, empire building, in-fighting, inefficiency, irrationality and high costs.</p>

<p>There were seen to be problems of co-ordination, of implementation, and of information flows. <#\>The list seemed endless enough. <X><quote><#\>Bureaucrats are portrayed as fear-ridden yet arrogant, as milquetoasts yet Machiavellians. <#\>Bureaucracy is rigid and at the same time expansionist</quote></X><sp>1</sp></p>

<#\><h><bold>First reform period: 1973-1986</bold></h> 
<p><#\>From 1973 until 1986 there were a succession of inquiries into and reforms of the Australian public service.<sp>2</sp> <#\>All were aimed, overwhelmingly, at ensuring accountability to government, improving responsiveness to the people, and improving efficiency <longdash> in that order. <#\>Both the Fraser Liberal/National government of 1976 <longdash> 1983 and the Hawke Labor government elected in 1983 attempted to assert supremacy over policy direction and to create a responsive, accountable public service.<sp>3</sp></p> 

<#\><h><bold>Reforms under Fraser</bold></h> 
<p><#\>Fraser introduced a series of major administrative reforms aimed at improving the lot of the individual citizen 'against' the bureaucracy: Freedom of Information legislation, a Federal Ombudsman, an Administrative Review Tribunal and an Administrative Court were all created. <#\>While these changes amounted to a revolution in the relationship between citizen and bureaucracy they were not the centrepiece of Fraser's reforms. <#\>Fraser's main concern was to ensure that the public service did the government's bidding. <#\>He was determined that as prime minister he should have greater control over policy areas and that key policy initiatives were implemented by the bureaucracy.</p> 

<p><#\>To achieve those ends Fraser increased the power of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, expanded the role of his personal advisers, and organised cabinet to ensure the dominance of the prime minister and a group of senior ministers.<sp>4</sp> <#\>Fraser's ideological commitment to the expansion of the private sector and to cutbacks in the public set him on a collision course with the bureaucracy, especially because the ideology was combined with policies aimed at reducing the size of the public service rapidly and demands on the public service to continue performing all its functions quickly and efficiently. <#\>In addition, the government too frequently used rhetoric which attacked and denigrated the public service, viewing it as a parasite on the 'productive' private sector of the economy. <#\>The remark of Sir Phillip Lynch that public servants had their <quote>snouts in the trough</quote>, burned deeply into the Canberra bureaucratic mind.<sp>5</sp></p> 

<p><#\>While the control mechanisms selected by Fraser were not in themselves ill-chosen, the government's style resulted in a demoralised bureaucracy and, in some ways, a government ultimately ill served by its bureaucrats.</p> 

<p><#\>Conflicts arose because Fraser was attempting to force policy responsiveness onto departments used to doing things in their own ways. <#\>Those departments resented public servants from the Prime Minister's Department overseeing, on behalf of the Prime Minister, what they were doing <quote>on their own turf</quote> Fraser attacked the 'cosy' norms of the public service, and was in turn bitterly attacked.<sp>6</sp> <#\>Tensions were exacerbated by Fraser's authoritarian, domineering political style and a relationship of mistrust and hostility emerged between government and bureaucracy.</p> 

<p><#\>The overall result was that Fraser failed to create a public service responsive to government. <#\>Indeed his attempts at control brought about a situation close to administrative breakdown, with the last period of the Fraser years marked by administrative scandals which seriously undermined the credibility of that government and contributed to its electoral defeat. <#\>Despite Fraser's rhetoric of efficient and lean government, parts of the public service was found to be negligent and wasteful.<sp>7</sp> <#\>For example, the Australian Wheat Board had failed to supply parliament with proper accounts between 1976 and 1978, and had handled $6000m of growers' funds without issuing a single financial statement on its expenditure. <#\>The Department of Finance had on at least three occasions ignored the strict guidelines which controlled the expenditure of the special advances to the Minister of Finance. <#\>In 1982 the federal Health department was found grossly inadequate in responding to medical fraud and over-servicing. <#\>The Australian Dairy Corporation was found to be engaged in illegal activities and its public service staff to be acting entirely to protect their own interests. <#\>On several occasions, files were not available to parliamentary inquiries and evidence was given that relevant information had been deliberately destroyed.</p> 

<p><#\>Most damaging of all were the October 1982 revelations of the Costigan Royal Commission. <#\>The Costigan report on bottom-of-the-harbour tax avoidance schemes argued that dishonesty, gross negligence and incompetence in the Commonwealth crown solicitor's office in Perth, had allowed a <quote>major fraud</quote> on Federal revenue through tax evasion, and that the government's failure to outlaw bottom-of-the-harbour tax schemes arose from the legal errors and incompetence of its officers.</p> 

<p><#\>Fraser failed to gain control and the scandals that surrounded the bureaucracy helped create an atmosphere in which reforms aimed at control could be brought down. <#\>They also helped push a concern for efficient government up the list of priorities by highlighting the need for an efficient, 'lean' public service. <#\>In so doing, they helped pave the way for the changes that were to come.</p> 

<#\><h><bold>The Hawke government</bold></h> 
<p><#\>The Labor party decided that the desired relationship between bureaucracy and government could best be created through coherent long term reform of the public service. <#\>They came to office with an energetic managerial elite made up of politicians, public servants and political advisers committed to administrative reform aimed primarily at ensuring that governments would be well served by their bureaucrats, and introduced proposals in an atmosphere of bipartisan support: 

<#\><quote><*>dotted line</*>both sides know they need their own highly qualified boys (sic) in senior positions to ensure that the will of ministers prevails and is put into practice. <#\>There is a strong bipartisan feeling that the balance of power must be shifted towards ministers from the senior career public servants.<sp>8</sp></quote></p> 

<p><#\>In June 1984, a package of legislative measures was passed, designed to improve the responsiveness of the public service to governmental priorities, improve equity within its own work force and in the delivery of government service, and enhance efficiency. <#\>At this stage the government's concern was still overwhelmingly with public service responsiveness. <#\>Efficiency was seen as a process to improve the delivery of policy to the public.</p> 

<p><#\>The government abolished the divisional structure of the public service, transferred the control of staff numbers from the Public Service Board to the Minister for Finance; gave department Secretaries virtual autonomy on organisation matters provided they stayed within the staffing aggregates set by the budget and the positions classification guidelines established by the Board; and consolidated administrative appropriations into larger votes effectively enabling secretaries to transfer funds across the range of functional inputs. <#\>A commitment was made to a Financial Management Improvement Program (FMIP), the objectives of which were: 

<#\>(i)	in determining priorities all resources claims of the department are taken into account; 
<#\>(ii)	programs are consistent with established goals, objectives and policies; 
<#\>(iii) objectives and program structures are oriented towards outcomes and are specific enough for subsequent performance to be measured; 
<#\>(iv)	performance indicators and systems to assess program performance and monitor resource usage are developed; 
<#\>(v)	responsibility is delegated to those held accountable.</p> 

<p><#\>After a year, the co-ordination of staff numbers and financial controls were regarded as so successful that a Commissioner of the Public Service Board commented: <quote>in retrospect it seems strange that they were ever considered separately</quote>.<sp>9</sp></p> 

<p><#\>Other changes included greater openness in recruitment of senior executives; a refocussing of public service management attention away from processes and on to outputs; and an innovative approach to organisational change and, in particular, a move towards less hierarchical structures.</p> 

<#\><h><bold>The Senior Executive Service (SES)</bold></h> 
<p><#\>The creation of a Senior Executive Service was the fundamental change, aimed at changing the norms of the bureaucracy and strengthening the career service's capacity for policy formulation and implementation. <#\>The reforms' objectives were to develop a more distinctive senior public service with a broad commitment to professional service rather than a narrow loyalty to a single department, client group or policy area, and to make the senior ranks of the bureaucracy more open to all, establishing in the process new norms of equity and representativeness. <#\>The creation of the Senior Executive Service was justified as an attempt to improve the responsiveness of senior bureaucrats and enhance their capacity to understand problems as a whole, from a politician's perspective. <#\>The old Australian career service had ensured that most officials spent their careers within one department and developed a departmentally-based perspective on issues, rather than one based on a broad notion of the public interest. <#\>Because it was difficult for governments to bring in their own political appointees, or even outside recruits, and it was almost impossible to fire public servants, a government was often faced with a public service which resisted the political imposition of goals. <#\>There were also problems in that the people at the top of the bureaucratic pyramid were at times past their prime and the structures generally tended towards rigidity.</p> 

<p><#\>This first reform period could still be seen as part of the overall tradition of reforms <longdash> to create a responsive, accountable public service which ran its programs efficiently.</p> 

<#\><h><bold>The second reform period: 1986 and beyond</bold></h> <p><#\>However a sea-change occurred in the 1986/87 period. <#\>In response to the economic crisis of mid-1986 and the $1000 million blow-out of the budget deficit, the Hawke government imposed a freeze on staff numbers in the public service and gave approval for a 'razor gang' to seek about $1000 million in new spending cuts. <#\>The previously projected growth in the public service for 1986-87 had been between one and a half and two and a half per cent <longdash> 2000 to 3000 people.<sp>10</sp></p> 

<p><#\>In August and September, it introduced by far the most radical changes in the history of the Australian public service <longdash> mechanisms whereby public servants could, relatively easily, be dismissed on the grounds of redundancy or inefficiency. <#\>The Public Service Act was accordingly amended in November/December 1986 by the introduction of the <it>Public Service Legislation (Streamlining) Act</it> and the repeal of the <it>Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979</it>. <#\>The Public Service Board was given the power to transfer staff within the public service in the interests of the efficient management of the service. <#\>Departmental Secretaries were given increased power to remove inefficient staff, and to switch monies between wages and other administrative expenses. <#\>In addition, for all but junior staff, the right of appeal over promotions was abolished. <#\>Departments and agencies were to submit staffing plans which indicated how the desired reduction in staff numbers could be achieved. <#\>As such plans were approved, the staff freeze was lifted. <#\>Finally an Efficiency Scrutiny Unit, reporting directly to the Prime Minister, was established to oversee an extensive program of scrutiny into selected areas of public sector administration.</p> 

<p><#\>These considerable reforms prevailed despite objections from the public service union because there was a general feeling that in the economic circumstances the government had no choice: the public sector had to be cut back, and made cost efficient. <#\>The agenda had begun to shift.</p> 

<p><#\>In June 1986 the Public Service Board and the Department of Finance released a report reaffirming the objectives of financial management improvement. <#\>However, there was little comment on how new procedures would improve productivity and performance. <#\>Moreover Government did not provide departments with additional resources to implement FMIP initiatives. <#\>The 1986 FMIP report, like its predecessors, reflected an overwhelming preoccupation with efficiency in the management of programs rather than with the quality of policy advice. <#\>This preoccupation, which was associated with achieving savings in expenditure amounted to a fundamental change in the perception of public administration; the tasks of public servants were now managerial rather than policy oriented.</p></I>
