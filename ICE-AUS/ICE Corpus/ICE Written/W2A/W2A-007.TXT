Marx to Habermas</bold></h>

<p><#\>Once the site of some of the most vigorous debates in modern feminist theory, the topic of feminism's relations to Marxism could hardly appear more exhausted than it does today. <#\>Contemporary feminism is, of course, not alone in its recent loss of faith and interest in the critical potentialities of Marxism. <#\>The reasons for this general crisis of confidence cannot be debated here. <#\>What can be discussed, however, is the more specific issue of the significance which contemporary feminism has given to its own turn away from Marxism. <#\>The following brief reconstruction of some main episodes in the rise and fall of feminism's interest in the capacities of Marxism as a critique of an alienated modernity is guided by a hermeneutical concern. <#\>What does the shifting character of feminism's interest in Marx's theory of alienation suggest about changes in feminism's understanding of its own role as cultural critique?</p>

<p><#\>The early Marxist feminists had not, generally speaking, looked to Marx's theory of alienation to produce new insights into the lived conditions of women in capitalist society. <#\>It was, rather, the apparent capacity of this theory to anchor and to provide ultimate justification for the kinds of critical observations elaborated by feminists themselves that seemed the main attraction. <#\>Marx's theory of alienation had seemed to offer an account of our species' character from the vantage point of which the lived condition of modern women could be shown as a distortion and a travesty. <#\>It is not particularly useful at this juncture to again rehearse the motivations for feminism's collapse in confidence in Marx's theory of alienation. <#\>To my mind, the remaining relevant question is: what is the fate of the task which this kind of theory had once seemed to perform for feminism once the theory itself no longer seems qualified to perform it? <#\>Does contemporary feminism's turn from Marx's theory of alienation lead on to a search for new, less problematic, ways of justifying and establishing the rationality of feminism's own critical reflections on the lived conditions of modern women? <#\>Or is a more radical response called for, one which abandons altogether the demand for ultimate criteria capable of rationally justifying feminism's critical reflections?</p>

<p><#\>This kind of hermeneutical interest is again the point of view which informs the subsequent, rather longer, discussion of contemporary feminism's relations to Habermas' radical endeavours to ground the normative commitments of social and cultural criticism. <#\>What does feminism reveal about its own sense of its options and future directions by the nature of its interest in, and the kinds of objections it raises about, Habermas' model of sociocultural interpretation and criticism?</p>

<#\><h><bold>Feminism and Marx's humanism</bold></h>

<p><#\>The question of Marx's credentials as a humanist has been debated endlessly and I do not propose to buy into a dispute over the existence of a 'rupture' in his thought which drew him away from early humanist commitments. <#\>My interest here is confined to a brief exploration of the efforts made by some early Second Wave feminists to appropriate an interpretation of Marx's humanism. <#\>I distinguish three main episodes in feminism's changing estimations of the significance of Marx's humanism. <#\>In the first we see the efforts of, for example, Sheila Rowbotham and Zillah Eisenstein to appropriate for feminism an anthropological reading of Marx's theory of alienation.<sp>1</sp> <#\>This first episode is quickly followed by the elaboration of a critical posture in which a so-called dual-systems theory discovered that Marx's anthropology is based on a gender prejudice that attributes significance to a very narrow range of human activities in modern society.<sp>2</sp> <#\>This second episode, in which feminism broaches a critique of the gender prejudices embedded in Marx's delineation of a presently alienated <quote>human essence</quote> , meant a major shift in the use feminism could make of Marx's theory of alienation. <#\>By endorsing the conception of a denied human essence which underpinned Marx's theory of alienation, the early feminism of Eisenstein and Rowbotham had been able to look to the categories of Marxism to supply a perspective on the emancipatory potentialities dormant in the life conditions of modern women. <#\>The critique of the gender prejudices in the Marxist conception of human essence meant that Marx's theory of alienation was ruined for the dual-systems theorists as an instrument of cultural criticism. <#\>Henceforth, the Marxist theory of alienation appeared itself as an object of critique, and as a deficient description of the range of human activities in bourgeois society; a deficiency which dual-systems theory sought strenuously to redress.</p>

<p><#\>It is, however, the third episode in this narrative which occupies the greatest contemporary interest. <#\>This last episode in the discussion suggests that feminism has a vital interest in the attempt to historicise the humanist commitments which underpin Marx's culture-critique intentions. <#\>It is said that this historicising interest requires a radical departure from fundamental aspects of Marx's own theory of alienation and points to the necessity for an alternative paradigm of social interpretation. <#\>To Seyla Benhabib and others, Habermas' theory of communicative action seems to offer a way of retaining the critical potential of the ideals of modern humanism without, at the same time, imposing a formulation of those ideals prejudicial to a recognition of the plurality of needs and aspirations of an increasingly pluralistic women's movement within a highly diverse modernity.<sp>3</sp></p>

<p><#\>The early efforts of Second Wave feminism to appropriate some main features of Marx's humanism emphasised two dimensions of the conception of labour in Marx's theory of alienation. <#\>Marx's theory of alienated labour refers, as both Eisenstein and Rowbotham pointed out, not only to the experience of the wage worker in capitalist society but presupposes also a philosophical concept of labour as objectification.<sp>4</sp> <#\>It is specifically the critical potentials of this philosophical concept of labour as objectification which early Marxist feminism sought to appropriate.</p>

<p><#\>Marx's concept of labour as objectification refers to the historical creativity of individuals who, through their labour, not only reproduce and enrich the conditions of life but also augment human subjectivity with a wealth of new capacities, needs and potentialities. <#\>On this view, the dynamic of social reproduction meant the incessant expansion of human needs and abilities as producers constantly transformed their inherited world and, in so doing, enhanced their own capacities and aspirations. <#\>Marx's theory of alienation discovers an antagonism between these historically generated human possibilities both inscribed in the world of material objectifications and subjective needs and the reductionist logic of capitalism which views the individual who labours as a working animal, a mere instrument of production and creator of surplus value. <#\>This configuration of realised societal wealth and individual deprivation constitutes, for Marx, the fundamental contradiction of bourgeois society.</p>

<p><#\>To Eisenstein, Marx's account of the antagonism between realised societal wealth and individual deprivation provides the basis for a critique of the full range of social relations entrenched in modern capitalist societies. <#\>There is, as she sees it, nothing about the theory of alienation which <quote>limits it to an understanding of class relations</quote><sp>5</sp> <#\>From the point of view of this dynamic, creative concept of labour-as-objectification (which upholds the idea of the species' capacity for producing a supposed wealth of abilities and needs through the productive activity of humans), all merely instrumentalising forms of labour stand condemned. <#\>On this reading, an imposed gender division of labour means that the lives of modern women, and not just the proletariat, are characterised by an antagonism between their species' potential and the impoverished, one-sidedness of their existence in bourgeois society.</p>

<p><#\>Eisenstein gives a sharply anthropologised reading of Marx's theory of alienation; the social and critical potentials of this theory are seen to rest on a bifurcation between human existence and its distortion in a capitalist-patriarchal social system. <#\>Marx's <quote>revolutionary ontology</quote> of social and human existence posits:

<quote><*>dotted line</*><#\>within each individual a dialectic between essence and existence which is manifested as revolutionary consciousness in society. <#\>Both the criticism of class existence as alienating and exploitative and the revolutionary ontology of the theory make Marxist analysis critical to developing a feminist theory which incorporates but moves beyond a theory of class consciousness.</quote><sp>6</sp></p>

<p><#\>The feminist critics of the type of humanist Marxist feminism which Rowbotham and Eisenstein had been developing throughout the latter part of the 1970s did not typically set their sights on the question of the adequacy of the Marx interpretation being offered. <#\>It should be said, however, that, to the extent that Rowbotham and Eisenstein's reading of the theory of alienation evokes an ahistorical construction of a thwarted species' potential for creative labour, this interpretation suggests a highly selective reading of Marx's own views.<sp>7</sp> <#\>As we have seen, Eisenstein's reading discovers in Marx's theory of alienation <quote>a revolutionary ontology of social and human existence which is manifested as revolutionary consciousness in society.</quote> <sp>8</sp> <#\>When extended to women, this <quote>revolutionary ontology suggests that the possibility of freedom exists alongside exploitation and oppression since woman is potentially more than she is</quote><sp>9</sp></p>

<p><#\>Eisenstein's anthropologised reading of Marx's theory of alienation, understood as the antagonism between human essence and social existence, evokes a clearly essentialising construction of human subjectivity. <#\>On this interpretation, 'autonomy' and 'creativity' appear as the presently distorted constituents of the subject rather than as historically developed human possibilities. <#\>They appear, that is, in the light of anthropological potentials rather than as a unique and contingent historical development. <#\>Thus interpreted, Marx's humanism appeared a rather easy target for the anti-essentialising consciousness which increasingly emerged with the development of Second Wave feminism. <#\>The philosophical anthropology discovered by Eisenstein and Rowbotham in the theory of alienation was found by its later feminist critics to rest on a repressive universalisation of a gendered social experience. <#\>This metaphysics of the subject was shown to necessarily involve the ascription of a normativity to selected aspects of a modern masculine subjectivity.</p>

<p><#\>The critique of the feminist implications of an anthropologised interpretation of Marx's theory of alienation was spearheaded by the dual-systems literature which appeared in the early 1980s. <#\>On this view, Marx's theory offers an interpretation of social life based on an imposed, unitary model of human activity. <#\>The dual-systems model advocated by Mary O'Brien and others was, unlike the feminisms of Eisenstein and Rowbotham, not particularly concerned with the task of appropriating for feminism the critical potentials of Marx's account of the antagonism between human essence and social existence. <#\>The conception of labour as objectification which is so central to Marx's theory of alienation is almost entirely absent in the Marx interpretation offered by dual-systems theory. <#\>Marx had insisted on the antagonism between human essence <longdash> that species' potential for creative labour, in which humans are seen to accumulate through their own historical activity a wealth of many-sided abilities and capacities <longdash> and the distortion of this human essence in the merely instrumentalising forms of labour which characterise contemporary social existence. <#\>O'Brien and the dual-systems theorists can, however, see no evidence for a contract between two antagonistic constructions of human labour. <#\>In the centrality of productive labour to Marx's theory of human essence. <#\>O'Brien, Hartmann <it>et al.</it> <#\>discover only a repressive attempt to universalise a gender specific mode of social existence.</p>

<p><#\>Mary O'Brien's <it>The Politics of Reproduction</it> attempted to overcome the supposed inability of Marx's category of production to take account of many traditional female activities by introducing the complementary category of reproduction. <#\>At this time also, Heidi Hartmann's provocative essay on 'The Unhappy Marriage of Marxism and Feminism' targeted the 'gender blindness' of Marx's category of production. <#\>Hartmann attempted to supplement Marx's category of production, seen as the basis for an interpretation of specifically capitalist relations of production, with an interpretation of patriarchy, understood as a relatively independent set of social practices of domination and coercion. <#\>Marx's analysis of capitalist relations of production appeared inadequate to an investigation of patriarchy understood as <quote>a set of social relations between men, which have a material base, and which, though hierarchical, establish or create interdependence and solidarity among men that enable them to dominate women.</quote><sp>10</sp></p>

<p><#\>The humanist Marxist feminism of, for example, Rowbotham and Einstein, had attempted to appropriate Marx's account of labour as objectification as the basis from which to ground a critical perspective on the one-sided, merely instrumentalising character of those social relations, forms of conduct and modes of activity in modern society which, they insisted, dominated not only the lives of the proletariat but women as well.</p></I>
