<#\><h><bold>Introduction</bold></h> 
 
<p><#\>Wind profilers are now a key component in many research and operational programs. <#\>Their capability to measure wind profiles with very good time (20 min-lh) and height (150-500m) resolution throughout the troposphere and lower stratosphere is unparalleled. <#\>Developments are still taking place on a number of fronts. <#\>Analysis techniques to take advantage of the good time resolution in both single-site analyses and networks for operational forecasting are being studied. <#\>There have also been technological advances such as the development of very portable 'boundary-layer profilers' and temperature sounding with profiler resolution up to several kilometres using the RASS (radio acoustic sounding system) technique. <#\>The wind profiler is a reasonably mature technology for wind sounding, but important research is continuing on such topics as using the radars to measure drop-size distributions in precipitation (Gossard 1988) and RASS (May et al. 1990a). <#\>This review will cover the technique and recent advances, illustrated by some applications, and will conclude with a description of research being performed in Australia.</p> 

<p><#\>Wind profilers are Doppler radars capable of detecting the backscatter from the fluctuations in the refractive index (which is a function of temperature and humidity) of the clear air through the troposphere (see Balsley (1981) and Larsen and Rottger (1982) for reviews). <#\>Profilers are characterised by long dwell times (of the order of minutes to obtain a velocity estimate) and observing in three or five fixed beam directions, all close to the zenith (within 15<*>degree</*>). <#\>This is in contrast to a weather radar which is continually scanning and uses dwell times of less than a second. <#\>The radial velocity of the scatterers along the radar beams is measured and the wind is estimated assuming that the wind field over the beam separation is uniform. <#\>While this can lead to errors under severe convective conditions, profilers have proved to be excellent observing platforms for the study of mesoscale systems such as fronts, jet streaks and short waves (e.g. Shapiro et al. 1984). <#\>An example, using data from the Denver 915 MHz profiler, is shown in Fig. 1. <#\>Note how the very thin region of directional shear associated with the front is resolved, although the region of large velocity shear is over a layer about one kilometre thick and two hours in duration. <#\>Another interesting feature is the quasi-periodic fluctuation (period ~2h) in wind speed ahead of the front. <#\>These have a considerable amplitude (&gt;5m s<sp>-1</sp>) and the spatial scale corresponding to a two-hour oscillation will not be spatially resolved by any foreseeable operational network. <#\>This kind of oscillation will severely contaminate the calculation of gradient quantities such as vorticity and divergence using any observing technique, although with the profiler time resolution there is at least some hope of identifying and possibly filtering such fluctuations. <#\>Some profilers, such as the Adelaide very high frequency (VHF) radar (Vincent et al. 1987), use an alternative observing method known as the spaced antenna (SA) technique, but it has similar limitations to the technique described above (May 1990).</p> 

<p><#\>There have been numerous statistical comparisons between profiler and radiosonde wind estimates which have generally shown excellent agreement. <#\>The most comprehensive of these compared two years of data from a profiler and radiosondes launched from the Denver National Weather Services (NWS) site. <#\>This study showed root mean square differences of about 2.5m s<sp>-1</sp> (Weber and Wuertz 1990); very good considering that the profiler gives a volume (150 m in height) and time (15 min) average above the radar, while the radiosonde is a slantwise point  measurement. <#\>With the volume and time averaging inherent with the profiler, it can be argued that profiler wind estimates should be more representative of the mean wind than radiosonde estimates. <#\>Profilers operating in the tropical Pacific are providing data to both the National Meteorological Centre (NMC) and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) (Gage et al. 1988). <#\>These data are increasing the skill of analyses in this data-sparse region.</p>  
 
<#\><h><bold>Wind profiler types</bold></h> 
 
<p><#\>Profilers have been built at a number of frequencies (Strauch et al. 1984). <#\>The radar equation for received backscattered power, P<sb>r</sb>, can be written as: 
				(equation) 
where K is a constant, P<sb>t</sb> is the transmitted power, A is the antenna area, <*>Greek character</*>is the radar wavelength, <*>Greek character</*>is the radar reflectivity,  <*>Greek character</*>r is the range resolution and r is the range. <#\>The radar reflectivity from precipitation is 
given by: 
				(equation) 
where C is a constant and Z is the reflectivity factor (often expressed as dBZ: 10 log<sb>10</sb> (Z)). <#\>For clear-air scatter from isotropic turbulence in the inertial subrange: 
				(equation) 
where C<sb>n</sb><sp>2</sp> is the turbulence structure constant. <#\>Examples of low and high power profilers are shown in Table 1. <#\>Note that the sensitivity of a profiler is proportional to the mean power multiplied by the antenna area. <#\>The strong wavelength depenence of  means that the capabilities of different frequency profilers and the relative importance of clear air and precipitation scatter differ substantially. <#\>This also impacts on their applications. <#\>Therefore, we will now discuss separately profilers operating at differing frequency bands.</p> 
 
<#\><h><bold>50 MHz profilers</bold></h> 
<p><#\>The capability of observing winds through the troposphere and lower stratosphere was first shown using high-power ionospheric radars operating near this frequency (Woodman and Guillen 1973). <#\>These systems use large antennas, about 50-100 m in diameter, and high power systems (e.g. Fukao et al. 1985) can measure winds as high as 25 km routinely, while more modest systems generally 'see' to about 15 km. <#\>Their main limitation, however, is that they  have a minimum observing height of 1-2 km, which is not adequate for many meteorological applications. <#\>They have been supported by 915 MHz boundary-layer profilers, but the added complexity probably means they will not be deployed operationally. <#\>However, the 50 MHz profiler has significant research applications not feasible with profilers operating at 400 or 915 MHz. <#\>These radars can always see the backscatter from the clear air, unlike profilers at higher frequencies where the backscatter from precipitation may drown out the clear-air scatter. <#\>Thus they are one of the very few observing systems capable of directly measuring the vertical component of the wind (w) under a wide variety of conditions. <#\>This has important implications. <#\>For example, they can measure the vertical motion field around frontal regions. <#\>The vertical circulation around fronts is crucial for understanding the dynamics of fronts and these systems provide excellent tests for models. <#\>An example from the third phase of the Australian Cold Fronts Program is shown in Fig. 2. <#\>The horizontal winds above 2 km are measured by the Adelaide profiler, while the winds below 2 km and temperature observations are from six-hourly radiosondes. <#\>The temperature structure and the warm and cold conveyor-belt flows described in the conceptual model of Ryan and Wilson (1985) can be recognised with the aid of satellite observations (May et al. 1990b). <#\>Of particular interest is the vertical component and the horizontal component normal to the front. <#\>A deep upward circulation driven by low-level convergence is seen around the time of the passage of the surface front. <#\>This deep circulation is responsible for the generation of the mid-tropospheric cold dome. <#\>The circulation is a feature noted in the numerical models of Reeder and Smith (1987), but the observations show a smaller horizontal scale and are more intense. <#\>This and other cases are discussed in more detail by May et al. (1990b).</p> 

<p><#\>These radars have also been used for studying short time-scale wind variability associated with internal gravity waves. <#\>A key finding is that although the energy density is concentrated towards low frequencies, it is the high frequency components that are responsible for the vertical flux of horizontal momentum and the momentum flux divergence, at least near mountainous terrain (Fritts et al. 1990). <#\>The vertical flux of horizontal momentum associated with internal gravity waves has been parametrised in many large models to provide a drag on the mean flow, but this technique provides one of the few tests of these parametrisations in the real atmosphere.</p> 

<p><#\>When there is heavy precipitation (rainfall rates&gt;10mm/h), it has been observed that a second peak associated with hydrometeor scatter appears. <#\>Because we have independent measures of both the fall speed and vertical motion, as well as automatic correction for spectral broadening due to turbulence and beam width (since these are the same for clear air and precipitation), these radars may be able to measure the drop-size distribution with great sensitivity and fewer assumptions than in previous radar studies (Wakasugi et al. 1987; Gossard 1988). <#\>This kind of measurement should lead to improved estimates of rainfall from weather radar as well as better radiation transfer models for clouds, since drop-size distributions are major uncertainties in both areas. <#\>Clearly these radars will play a major role in research meteorology for some time.</p> 
 
<#\><h><bold>400 and 915 MHz profilers</bold></h> 
<p><#\>Profilers operating at frequencies of 400 MHz and higher have somewhat different characteristics. <#\>They have more acceptable minimum observing heights, which may be as low as 200 m, and the prototype for the NOAA profiler network has routinely observed winds to greater than 15 km above ground. <#\>Even a very low-power mobile 404 MHz profiler (Moran et al. 1989) routinely sees above 6 km, which is adequate for many applications. <#\>Even quite powerful radars operating at around 915 MHz are limited to a maximum height of about 10 km (Strauch et al. 1984). <#\>This is most likely because the inner scale of turbulence becomes less than half a radar wavelength at greater heights, so the fluctuations in radar refractive index are highly damped. <#\>A small inner scale is also presumably why 10 cm weather radars are mostly limited to the boundary layer for scatter from the clear air. <#\>A significant difference compared with 50 MHz profilers is that when there is precipitation, the shorter wavelength means that the precipitation echo is many orders of magnitude greater than the clear air. <#\>This means that they cannot always measure the vertical component of the wind; instead they measure the fall speed of the precipitation. <#\>This does not, however, greatly affect the accuracy of the horizontal wind estimates (Wuertz et al. 1988). <#\>In this sense they can be regarded as supplying similar data as a radiosonde, but with more representative estimates and much better time resolution.</p> 

<p><#\>A number of very low power 915 MHz profilers, capable of measuring winds continuously up to about 2-3 km, have been built. <#\>These initially were designed to support 50 MHz profilers, but have been used in a number of experiments, for example in looking at flows in complex terrain. <#\>They are very useful for these and other experiments studying small-scale phenomena since the profilers are small and easily deployed.</p> 
 
<#\><h><bold>Networks</bold></h> 
<p><#\>There have been a number of studies devoted to developing single-station diagnostics using profiler-derived winds. <#\>For example Nieman and Shapiro (1989) used geostrophic methods to estimate temperature gradients and temperature advection from profiler data in regions where fronts had little curvature and were not evolving rapidly. <#\>Zamora et al. (1987) used line integral methods to obtain three station estimates of vorticity, divergence and deformation around fronts and jet-streaks. <#\>They were also able to diagnose the ageostrophic wind component in some cases. <#\>As noted earlier, profilers  have been used to document fronts and jet streaks (e.g. Rottger 1979; Shapiro et al. 1984), and operationally to look at developments between the synoptic observing times (Beckman 1990). <#\>However, it is clear that many of the major benefits for operational and research meteorology will lie in the deployment of networks. <#\>NMC and ECMWF are assimilating data from the profiler network in the tropical Pacific area with a significant impact (Gage et al. 1988).</p></I>
