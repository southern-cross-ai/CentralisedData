<p><#\>Dear Mr. & Mrs. Lewis-Jones & Ms. Middleton</p>

<#\><h><bold>RE: YOUR PURCHASE OF UNIT 4 (LOT 15) 111-115 FOVEAUX STREET
SURRY HILLS</bold></h>

<p><#\>As you are aware a Receiver has been appointed to the trust account of Laing & Simmons Bondi Junction, the agents to whom you have paid a holding deposit of $5,000.00.</p>

<p><#\>We have written to both the receiver and the Real Estate Services Council advising them of your position, requesting that they note your interest and advise the present status of your deposit.</p>

<p><#\>In the meantime the vendor's solicitor has indicated that the vendor is prepared to exchange contracts on the agreed deposit less the $5,000.00 with a clause in the contract providing that completion need not take place until your deposit is returned unless it is necessary to resort to litigation for its recovery.</p>

<p><#\>I am awaiting the exact wording of the proposed new clause and when I receive same I shall contact you further.</p>

<p><#\>Yours faithfully,


<#\><bold><ul>McCABE BROWN</ul>.</bold></p>

<p><#\>We refer to previous correspondence in this matter and confirm that we act for Heather Middleton, the proposed purchaser of Unit 4/111-115 Foveaux Street, Surry Hills.</p>

<p><#\>As you are aware, our client paid to Laing & Simmons Bondi Junction on 8th January, 1994 a deposit of $5,000.00 towards the purchase of the above property.</p>

<p><#\>Dear Sir,</p>

<#\><h><bold><ul>COMPENSATION FUND CLAIM <longdash> HEATHER MIDDLETON
GLEN REAL ESTATE PTY LIMITED t/as LAING & SIMMONS BONDI JUNCTION</ul></bold></h>

<p><#\>We refer to previous correspondence herein and advise that a full copy of our <w>clients'</w> Contract was handed to your Mr Henry Noy on or about 13th April, l994. <#\>However, as requested, please find enclosed further copy front page of Contract together with copy pages 2 and 3 of the special conditions which set out, respectively, the provisions for completion and the payment of the deposit.</p>

<p><#\>We confirm our earlier advice to you that the Contract had originally been negotiated on a specially reduced deposit of $14,000.00, thus the provision in special condition 12(c) for the balance of the 10% to be paid on completion.</p>

<p><#\>We became aware of the problems with the agent after the payment by our clients of their $5,000.00 holding deposit but prior to exchange of Contracts. <#\>The Contract was then amended to take account of the fact that the $5,000.00 part deposit would be paid on the earlier of completion or receipt by the purchaser of the sum of $5,000.00 from the Compensation Fund of the Real Estate Services Council pursuant to the claim made by the purchaser as provided in Clause 12(b).</p>

<p><#\>It is, therefore, vital that the $5,000.00 be available to be paid at the latest by the time provided for completion in the Contract which is set out in special condition 8.</p>

<p><#\>Would you please let us have an assurance as a matter of urgency that the payment of the $5,000.00 will be available in time to enable our clients to meet their obligations under the exchanged Contract.</p>

<p><#\>We point out that we had been assured that the process for obtaining a refund of the deposit moneys would not take long.</p></I>
