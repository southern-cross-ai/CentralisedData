<p><#\>Dear Lesley,</p>

<p><#\>It sounds as if you are kept very busy, what with Magnus's infected leg, all the children's activities and all the animals aswell!. <#\>As you are aware last June/July we travelled to America for one month!. <#\>We visited and stayed with family and friends and Kate absolutely loved every minute. <#\>Phil also had a wonderful holiday.</p>

<p><#\>Kate has just celebrated her 5th birthday. <#\>She has a Calamity Jane party which was a success. <#\>We even hired two ponies for the kids to ride. <#\>Naturally, the ponies were a great hit with the kids. <#\>They were very well behaved and enjoyed the carrots that the children fed them. <#\>I made this huge cake that I thought looked quite ridiculous, however it tasted good and the kids all thought it was a wonderful cake with plastic cowboys, Indians and tepees on it. <#\>She received lots of Power Ranger toys. <#\>She is crazy aboout them and wants to be Trini. <#\>In fact the Power Rangers are currently in Sydney filming their first movie, but unfortunately for Kate they have not made any public appearances.</p>

<p><#\>The day after Kate's birthday her first tooth fell out. <#\>She was SO excited! <#\>I was with her and she didn't know whether to laugh or cry. <#\>It was the most precious moment to see. <#\>The tooth has been carefully placed in a plastic bag so that Kate can display it to any interested (or oven not interested) person. <#\>Her second tooth fell out two weeks later.</p>

<p><#\>My lectures have finished for the year and I continue to work on my research and business. <#\>Last month I received a letter to tell me that I have been awarded a scholarship, the King & Amy O'Malley scholarship (he was an American who came to Australia and founded our first national, or commonwealth, bank). <#\>This allows me to study/research full time next year as the award is worth $10,000, although I will still undertake a little lecturing (as the students have insisted to the head of the school that I teach them!).</p>

<p><#\>I can't believe that Spoofie is about to celebrate her 13th birthday. <#\>She is still so spritely, jumping fences and getting into a bit of mischief and looks so well. <#\>Mushka has even turned 10. <#\>Luckily, all the animals are very well, although Mushka suffered two epeleptic fits this year.</p>

<p><#\>We have had our first couple of hot days for the Summer. <#\>Kate has recommenced swimming lesson and her grand achievement was that she floated on her back for ten seconds ! <#\>water restrictions are getting tougher due to the drought. <#\>How is Tasmania bearing when it comes to water? <#\>I hope it is better than here.</p>

<p><#\>Goodbye for now.</p>

<p><#\>Dear Ellen,</p> 

<p><#\>I hope that you all had a very happy Christmas and are now enjoying a happy 1992. <#\>It is such a long time since I have written. <#\>1991 was a busy year, to say the least. <#\>I continued to lecture part-time which I enjoy, even though it pays poorly and involves a heavy workload. <#\>The other major undertaking was that I commenced further studies, also part-time (for a Masters of Education). <#\>I have wanted to start my Masters for a long time and so I did.</p>

<p><#\>The workload is difficult and especially tiring as I can only work once Kate has gone to sleep at night and don't have the luxury of a block of time to read or study. <#\>Never-the-less I have really enjoyed the courses that I undertook this year (I did 4 courses) (I find it hard to belive that I am enjoying studying as I can very clearly remember that when I left <w>Teachers'</w> College I swore I would escape and never return!) and found that I learnt a great deal and that was exciting. <#\>Anyhow, the studies are going well and I shall be continuing this year. <#\>With part-time work and studies it means that my parents baby-sit for three and a half days a week.</p>

<p><#\>Kate just loves her Baba (Russian for grandmother) and Jeda (grandfather) and understands Russian and also Polish and is learning to speak them. <#\>My mother always talks in Russian to her and now my mother has a Russian guest over from Germany so that she also speaks in Russian and i think that this is the language that she will pick up most quickly. <#\>It's so interesting to watch her development and how she can pronounce Russian words so well.</p>

<p><#\>Kate talks non stop. <#\>This age is just wonderful! <#\>She is now normally very good and loves "helping" us around the house. <#\>She and Mushka are devoted to each other. <#\>In fact when we returned from our Surfers Paradise holiday Mushka and Kate both went berserk with excitement. <#\>Kate screamed and hugged Mushka, Mushka jumped on and nuzzled Kate and they both ended lying on the floor together with Kate still hugging Mushka and saying <quote>beautiful Mushie</quote>. <#\>We could not separate them for three hours!</p>

<p><#\>Kate is the same with the cats and loves hugging them (they tolerate it for a while before jumping away) and also joins me each morning in saying <quote>good morning birds</quote> to our budgies and peachface parrot. <#\>She knows each cat by name and calls them for meals and checks that they are all there and eating. <#\>Once when one cat did not turn up for dinner she became quite upset and I had to calm her down.</p>

<p><#\>At Surfers Paradise not only did she go to the beach for the first time (which she absolutely loved), but she also was able to hand feed lorikeets and pat kangaroos. <#\>This was heaven for her. <#\>In fact on each occasion she was photographed and videoed by the many Japanese tourists who were there!</p>

<p><#\>Last week we had another surprise holiday. <#\>A friend rang up and asked if we could help her. <#\>She had not had the chance to go to her holiday house in a year and could we go and have a holiday there and check that the house was O.K.? <#\>Naturally, as Phil had a few days holiday from work we said "Yes!" The house is at Huskisson, on the south coast of New South Wales. <#\>It was two blocks from the beach and one block from a nature reserve. <#\>We stayed for four days.</p>

<p><#\>We visited an animal farm, where once again, Kate went berserk with delight. <#\>This time she got to see a Koala and was so pleased that she kissed it. <#\>She certainly loves animals. <#\>She was again able to feed animals, but she also hugged and even kissed one of them. <#\>Then she was treated to a pony ride, so it was a very exciting day for her and now Kate asks for <quote>more holidays please</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>My sister Helen is also devoted to Kate and visits often so she can play and walk with her. <#\>She also spoils her with gifts. <#\>I believe that Kate is a very lucky child to have so many people devoted to her and to have already experienced two exciting holidays.</p>

<p><#\>She is at an age where she can now understand so much and that is very interesting. <#\>She had a birthday party and was very excited about that. <#\>My parents bought her a swing and a slippery dip and for weeks after she would sit at the top of the slippery dip, before sliding down, singing "Happy Birthday to Kate". <#\>She thought Christmas was magical and was fascinated by the tree and decorations. <#\>She helped me decorate it and we also put a Christmas wreath on the front door. <#\>She them disappeared and I found her staring at the wreath. <#\>When I asked her what she was doing she said <quote>beautiful</quote> with a sigh while still staring at the wreath.</p>

<p><#\>We took her to a local church up the road to join in the carols, but the only word that she recognised was Jesus (we have a manger under our tree and she knows the characters), so that each time the crowd sang or said Jesus, Kate would yell out, at the top of her voice <quote>Jesus!</quote> I thought it was quite funny. <#\>Obviously, she also enjoyed all the presents at Christmas, bothe receiving them and giving them. <#\>She only gave on the condition that she could also assist in unwrapping them.</p>

<p><#\>For Christmas Eve we went to my parents for a traditional Polish Dinner and on Christmas day we went to Phil's sister's home for a traditional Australian Christmas lunch. <#\>As the weather is so hot more and more people are tending towards cold pork and ham, rather than the hot roast.</p>

<p><#\>We are currently renovating our laundry again. <#\>It is now seven years since we moved into the house and time to start repainting for the second time. <#\>So, we are starting with the laundry and will work up to bigger rooms. <#\>The garden is looking great with the roses in bloom and masses of marigolds crowding the front plots.</p>

<p><#\>It was fortunate that only two weeks ago we received some rain as we have been experiencing drought conditions this year and even with watering the grass was always dry. <#\>Did the water reach you? <#\>Now things are looking green and lush. <#\>This greenhouse effect is certainly changing things. <#\>A taxi driver, while at Surfers Paradise, told us how in the past five years the weather has completely changed there as well, with very little rain now.</p>

<p><#\>Have a wonderful trip to Melbourne for the Phantom, I'm sure that you will enjoy it.</p>

<p><#\>Keep well and happy,</p>

<p><#\>Dear Ellen !</p>

<p><#\>Thankyou for your card at Christmas. <#\>We had a wonderful Christmas and it made more fun because Kate was SO excited. <#\>I can imagine it was the same for James and Amanda. <#\>Kate met Santa (several times) and wasn't at all greedy when it came to asking her what she wanted for her present (a box!). <#\>We even bought presents for all our animals and wrapped them and put them under the tree. <#\>Kate snuck into the hallway and told Mushka about her surprise and then came giggling back to me and revealed that she had told Mushka about the secret gift. <#\>We then went to the greengrocer and bought a large bag of carrots to leave out for the reindeer. <#\>Kate was literally jumping up and down with excitement.</p>

<p><#\>At Christmas Eve we had a traditional meal at my parent's house, Christmas day we went to Phil's family. <#\>On Christmas morning Kate couldn't believe that her stocking had been filled! <#\>She was so happy and thought that that was it<*>dotted line</*>of course, there was more under the tree. <#\>She was in kid's heaven<*>dotted line</*>presents, presents, and more presents, as well as food and fun !</p>

<p><#\>Kate's third birthday went well. <#\>We organised a party at the Plaster Pot. <#\>I bought a large gingerbread house for the party and all the kid's eyes were wide with delight,especially when it came time to eat it !</p>

<p><#\>In November Kate was a flowergirl at a friends daughter's wedding. <#\>At the rehearsal she played up, running around the church, etc. <#\>Fortunately, on the day, she was wonderful. <#\>(We were extremely proud, of course !). <#\>She stood at the alter holding her heavy basket of flowers and would occassionally ask if it was over yet, when told it wasn't then continued to stand there quietly. <#\>Her walk up and down the aisle was also perfect and she looked cute !<*>dotted line</*>well, I think so,<*>dotted line</*>I've enclosed a photo, so see for yourself!</p>

<p><#\>The union won my case for some backpay at work (as I wasn't being paid for my marking, examination setting, etc) and that has been a nice little windfall, so,<*>dotted line</*>, Phil, Kate and myself are off to Singapore in early February.</p></I>
