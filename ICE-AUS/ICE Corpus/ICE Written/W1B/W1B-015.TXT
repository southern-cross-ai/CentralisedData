<I><#\>Thursday 2nd June

<p><#\>Dear Dad,</p>

<p><#\>Thanks for the letter <longdash> hope you survived your busy week. <#\>Thanks for the tape, too. <#\>I've listened to about half of it so far.</p>

<p><#\>I've had 2 prac exams this week <longdash> Chem and Biol. <#\>Chem was OK because we could take in our notes and all we had to do was identify 2 organic unknowns. <#\>One of mine was acetic acid which was quite obvious from the smell but I had to go through all the motions of identifying it anyway! <#\>The other one was more difficult. <#\>Biology was a real killer <longdash> 10 "stations" in 10 minutes and at each one we had to identify parts of a dissection or slides then answer questions about functions etc. <#\>I <del>unreadable</del> know one mistake I made (identified cartilage for bone) and then went on to answer all the questions for that part on cartilage, but I hope I went OK on all the other parts. <#\>After this 4 of us went to a caf<*>e-acute</*> in Newtown & complained about it for about an hour. <#\>That's about all Newtown is good for, its coffee shops!</p>

<p><#\>We've had less lectures this week in preparation for exams. <#\>I've just finished my B.S. assignment but I can't tell you if it's good or not because it's too soon after I wrote it to be objective.</p>

<p><#\>Did you read in Column 8 on Wednesday about the farmers who got a cheque in the mail for a couple of thousand dollars? <#\>That was the parents of a College friend of mine, Kirsty Kreig. <#\>She lives in the corridor I used to live in in Langley.</p>

<p><#\>The sore on my ankle I told you about got worse after I started putting Peranyl on it. <#\>It's better now <longdash> although the redness and swelling has increased, the scalyness has gone. <#\>Pretty tricky of you to do a diagnosis over the phone, I think!</p>

<p><#\>Somebody asked me the other day what you did, and when I told them they said <quote>how is that different from a GP?</quote> and would you believe I didn't know? <#\>(apart from the extra years of study). <#\>I've actually often wondered that myself, so please fill me in (or tell Mum to since she'll probably be writing next).</p>

<p><#\>Glad to hear Graeme finally caught a fish and would he like me to take him fishing in the holidays?</p>

<p><#\>Last day of lectures tomorrow and it's hard to believe I've been here nearly 6 months. <#\>In a way I fell like I've been here forever but it also doesn't seem that long.</p>

<p><#\>Has Chrysilla or Annette had their baby yet? <#\>If yes please fill me in!</p>

<p><#\>Must go now to post before next lectures.</p>

<p><#\>Love from Stephanie   xox xox</p>

<p><#\>P.S. Sorry about the messy (fast lecturer-style) writing but it's 2.45 pm & next lecture is at 3 and I have to buy stamps.</p>

<p><#\>P.P.S. Did you send my Naprosyn yet?</p></I>



<I><#\><h>Tuesday, July 19th</h>

<p><#\>Dear Mum,</p> 

<p><#\>Not much time has passed since I came back to College, but I thought you could probably tolerate a short letter.</p>

<p><#\>I hope, with musical & everything, that you're not too busy, driving & things<*>dotted line</*></p>

<p><#\>As you may remember, I was planning to take Ballet this semester; however it is not going ahead (due to lack of demand?). <#\>Something much better is, though: Bridge! <#\>I will certainly enrol, even the time is convenient: Tuesdays from 5.30pm <longdash> 7.30pm. <#\>Massage is being run as a 2-day seminar on 2 consecutive Saturdays, which means I can also do that. <#\>There is also a day of sailing on Sunday, September 17th during which you learn to sail then sail around the harbour or so the brochure says. <#\>This sounds good but from memory this is the day you are coming to Sydney and without a doubt I would rather see you! <#\>Could you send me your times & days of arrival & departure please?</p>

<p><#\>We are considering changing our BS topic to Adoption; nobody could find much on domestic violence.</p>

<p><#\>I have got 3 results back so far: for chem & physics (exams) I got 73%, for physics pracs 85%; for BS assignment (interviews) I got 86% which I was very happy with. <#\>My tutor said of my assignment: <quote>This paper is very good though you could have done a little more background research. <#\>You write with an impressive level of sophistication</quote> .</p>

<p><#\>I'd be happy for you to read it but don't know whether that would be appropriate or not?</p>

<p><#\>In our 1st Anatomy lecture yesterday we were given the following list of vaccinations we have to have:
Hep B					Rubella
TB							Measles
Tetanus						Mumps
Diptheria
Polio</p>

<p><#\>Next week we are having a Mantoux(?) test for TB & if we are negative, we are then vaccinated. <#\>I assume I have had all the others except Hep B, which consists apparently of 3 needles then a blood test, so I'll have it at the Uni health service if possible.</p>

<p><#\>As well as new doors, Williams 2nd floor has also a new (extra) phone, at the other end of the corridor to me. <#\>This will cut the incoming calls by half, or more, because most calls are for the other end of the corridor <longdash> I guess they have more friends down there! <#\>So life in Williams is getting better & better!</p>

<p><#\>I enclose a copy of my semester timetable just for interest.</p>

<p><#\>Can't wait to come home again. <#\>Lots of love to everyone<*>dotted line</*></p>

<p><#\>love from Stephanie   xoxox</p>

<p><#\>P.S. I found this petrol docket in my purse from the holidays.</p>

<p><#\>P.P.S. It's freezing in Sydney!!</p>

<p><#\>P.P.P.S Liz. was very grateful for the law handbook

<I><#\><h>Saturday, July 23rd</h>

<p><#\>Dear Mum,</p>

<p><#\>I know you only spoke to me last night but I'm so HOMESICK that I just HAD to write a litter<*>dotted line</*> it was either that or ring you again!</p>

<p><#\>I have done a very excellent thing, and that is changed my flight from Sunday August 7th to Monday 8th at 11.10am. <#\>So I can spend an extra day at home; all I have on that Monday is 2 lectures since ICB pracs are not on and the BS tutorial is only once a fortnight.</p>

<p><#\>I also rang Alison, so here are the plans for tonight: pick me up at 5.15 pm, go to Cronulla for dinner, then go to a dance party at Caringbah then go to "Craig's" house (don't know where that is). <#\>Alison's phone number in Newtown is 5l99613 <longdash> not that I want you to ring her but just in case. <#\>It's always difficult in College to find someone to tell them what you are doing so they'll actually remember the important details & time you were coming back; just in case you don't, which I think is quite important in Sydney especially. <#\>They said they will then drive me home in the morning on Sunday, which is not exactly what I want to do but I guess I'll survive it<*>dotted line</*></p>

<p><#\>Kim Childs has got about 6 letters this week, her father must be the head of Australia Post.</p>

<p><#\>It is pouring today, the day I wanted to do my washing; I did it anyway because in terms of undies I am in dire straits!</p>

<p><#\>The most recent inter-college competition is sculling, ie. drinking a whole glass of alcohol in one gulp. <#\>It was on last wednesday night at the University Bar; needless to say I did not attend. <#\>They chose the Women's team at the Sports dinner on Tuesday night <longdash> we had invited Wesley & Sancta girls and all the coaches to College and they had a special sports dinner with us. <#\>After dinner whenever someone made a speech or whenever a team was mentioned, they had to scull <longdash> it was foul. <#\>They have <del>this</del> a rather rude song that people sing <del>at</del> and at the end they sing <quote>Down, down, down, down</quote> until the person has sculled their drink. <#\>Dad <longdash> was college like this when you went?</p>

<p><#\>Can't wait to come home
Can't wait to come home
Can't wait to come home
I love you all this much:

Love from Stephanie</p>

<p><#\>P.S. It's your fault that I'm so homesick, if I hadn't had such a good holiday I would have been glad to get back to Uni</p>
<p>PPS Since it's <ul>your</ul> <ul>fault</ul>, <ul>you</ul> have to fix it and that means lots of LETTERS and/or PICTURES (as the case may be) xox</p></I>



<I><#\><h>Thursday, July 28th</h>

<p><#\>Dear Mum,</p>

<p><#\>Thank you for being so very nice to me this week, while I have been lonely. <#\>I'm feeling better today especially since I decided to write to you.</p>

<p><#\>We had dinner with Andrews last night, I didn't speak to one guy the whole night. <#\>It was not very well organised; most of the girls sat on one side of the room & the guys on the other <longdash> not really intentionally but not many people could really be bothered on a weeknight. <#\>Some people did mix, however, and went to the Andrews bar afterwards.</p>

<p><#\>In Anatomy tutorial yesterday we had our Mantoux text <longdash> I don't have a red mark yet. <#\>Have I been vaccinated for TB? <#\>I'm also going to arrange my Hepatitis B vaccinations today.</p>

<p><#\>Have you got my other letter yet?</p>

<p><#\>I washed my woollen skivvy yesterday & the instructions said to roll in a towel then dry flat in the shade. <#\>So until this morning it has been drying on my bedroom floor, but I got sick of avoiding it so I hung it on the line. <#\>I don't remember you drying things flat, so I don't think I'll bother anymore.</p>

<p><#\>I'm not starting until 10am today because we don't have every ICB lecture every week. <#\>I have a history & philosophy tutorial which I really enjoy, the tutor is actually a Biochem <del>unreadable</del> lecturer but he knows a lot of history & has been almost everywhere. <#\>He is very old & he just rambles on about Rome, and the Age of Enlightenment. <#\>We did a quiz last week to see what our history background was & I only knew 1 question (our of at least 50) & that was: what do AD & BC stand for? <#\>My history is really very bad <longdash> I didn't even know what the Magna Carta was, let alone who signed it & when!</p>

<p><#\>Next monday the editor of Cleo (the women's magazine) is speaking at formal dinner. <#\>It will be interesting because these speeches usually have a "my advice to you young women" segment <longdash> I wonder what her advice would be!! <#\>Maybe she'll distribute free Cleo's.</p>

<p><#\>Please tell Peter & Graeme GOOD LUCK for the musical, you won't get this until tomorrow but tell them anyway. <#\>I'm sending it Express Post because I hate having a letter "on the way" over the weekend especially if you ring me (hint, hint)!</p>

<p><#\>This weekend I'm staying in and working, working, working so that next <del>unreadable</del> weekend when I come home I don't have to worry about doing work.</p>

<p><#\>I'm looking forward to coming home so much that I can't stop thinking about it. <#\>It's very opportune that there is also a med harbour cruise on that weekend; whenever someone asks me if I'm going I can tell them that <quote>I'm going home that weekend</quote> . <#\>It's excellent! <#\>However, if they don't live at College they often don't ask why, which is the second important part, so I tell them anyway: <quote>My brothers are in the school musical & one of them has a lead role</quote> . <#\>In fact the way I say it I think it sounds like Peter is the big star in an enormous Broadway production, but never mind. <#\>People who don't live in college don't appreciate what a big thing it is to go home. <#\>Kim is going Cross-country skiing with the bushwalking club this weekend near Thredbo. <#\>She <del>unreadable</del> asked me if I wanted to go but said no, I really do have to work this weekend. <#\>It costs $130 and it's a beginners course, so it sounds good.</p></I>
