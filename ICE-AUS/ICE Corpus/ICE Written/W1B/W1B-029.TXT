<p><#\>To whom it may concern,</p>

<p><#\>I am writing to you to let you know of a problem I am having in resolving a fault with my 1992 Mitsubishi Magna.</p>

<p><#\>I purchased the car second hand from Penrith Mitsubishi's Kingswood branch in January this year for $26,000, but noticed hesitation and misfire problems. <#\>I advised Penrith Mitsubishi who said it would be rectified under warranty. <#\>The accompanying documentation details the ongoing problems I am having in getting satisfactory action to resolve the complaint.</p>

<p><#\>Basically Penrith Mitsubishi have stated that there is a known fault with both the TP and TR models, and that they can do no more for me. <#\>They say it is a problem which Mitsubishi Australia will have to fix, if and when they can find a solution. <#\>I have been given a litany of excuses for the inaction by the area manager to contact Penrith Mitsubishi, and when I advised Penrith Mitsubishi of my decision to escalate the problem by writing to NRMA, ACA and Mitsubishi head office once again, I was told that was probably the best thing I could do.</p>

<p><#\>I have not spelled out the complete story in this letter to you, as the accompanying documents do that. <#\>If you could find the time to read through this and advise me what action is possible I would be most appreciative. <#\>I will send a copy of this letter to the Department of Consumer Affairs also, as I do not know what courses of action are available for me to follow.</p>

<p><#\>Thank you for any help you might be able to give.</p>

<p><#\>Yours faithfully

<p><#\>Steve,</p> 

<p><#\>Thank you for your recent letter asking about the car. <#\>It is comforting to note that you and Penrith Mitsubishi regard after-sales support to be a high priority in the purchase of a car.</p>

<p><#\>As I discussed with you when I came in to get the petrol cap release fixed, there are a couple of things which need attention.</p>

<p><#\>These are : The radio antenna has been bent and re-straightened and is therefore loose

<#\>: The air vent control does not move to its full extent, thereby limiting the amount of external air that can enter the car

<#\>: The chip on the windscreen was, I thought, to be looked at before I picked the car up. <#\>The chip is still there, and I would like it repaired if it's not too late

<#\>: There is some hesitation when slowly accelerating through 90-100kph along the freeway and I have felt it at other speeds too.</p>

<p><#\>One other thing, the car has a parcel shelf mounted stop light. <#\>The bulb was blown when I purchased the car, but I only discovered it on the evening I bought the car when a work colleague pointed it out in the car park here at work.</p>

<p><#\>I bought a new bulb the next day from Penrith Mitsubishi spares, at a cost of $10.14. <#\>I understand this is a warrantable item and would appreciate it if you could arrange reimbursement (I still have the receipt).</p>

<p><#\>The car will be due for its 50,000km service soon, so I would like to arrange for the abovementioned items to be fixed under warranty when I drop it in to Penrith Mitsubishi.</p>

<p><#\>Could we arrange that the service section is made aware that some warranty items will need fixing (obviously I'll need to let them know when I'll be getting the service done).</p>

<p><#\>Please don't feel I am complaining in any way about the car, it really is a pleasure to drive, and a step up in the luxury department. <#\>I am very happy with it to date. <#\>I'd just like you to be aware that there a couple of things that will need 
attention.</p>

<p><#\>Please feel free to contact me if I can expand on any of the points raised in this fax.</p>

<p><#\>Once again, thanks for your assistance. <#\>Oh, you forgot to include the business cards with your letter. <#\>I'll be happy to distribute them if you send me some.</p>

<p><#\>Best Regards

<p><#\>To Whom It May Concern,</p>

<p><#\>I am writing to notify you of a fault condition that exists in my 1992 Magna SE Sedan.</p>

<p><#\>I purchased the car second hand from Penrith Mitsubishi at Kingswood in January this year with 46,220 km on the odometer. <#\>Shortly after taking delivery I became aware of a problem with acceleration when driving along the motorway. <#\>It appeared that the car was reluctant to accelerate from around 80-90kph when the accelerator was depressed smoothly, the car hesitating before and then during the period of acceleration. <#\>I have also had similar problems when driving uphill at 60kph.</p>

<p><#\>The effect is similar to a misfiring engine.</p>

<p><#\>I notified the salesman, Mr Steve Miller, that I would wait until the car had 50,000km on the clock before taking the car for its service, and then have the problem rectified, as I considered it may be due to dirty injectors or filters. <#\>There were also a couple of other minor problems which I would get fixed at the same time under warranty.</p>

<p><#\>On March 29 I took the car down to Penrith Mitsubishi for it's 50,000km service and advised Mr Richard Davidson of the acceleration problem.</p>

<p><#\>The car was serviced (document number MICS30070) and the air filter was changed in an attempt to fix the problem.</p>

<p><#\>It didn't.</p>

<p><#\>I made arrangements to have the car looked at again and took it to Penrith Mitsubishi again on the 11th April. <#\>The document number was MICS30291.</p>

<p><#\>This time the mechanic changed both fuel filters and checked the injectors for cleanliness. <#\>After road testing they agreed the fault still persisted. <#\>The mechanic had a second opinion from another mechanic who, I was told, described it as <quote>behaving like a dog</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>When I arrived to pick up the car Richard advised me that they had been unable to fix the fault.</p>

<p><#\>He then told me that there have been a number of cases where due to some engine design / manufacturing defect or computer design fault, certain cars have exhibited this same problem. <#\>One story he recounted was where a car had needed the cylinder head replacing before the fault was cured. <#\>Another involved the replacement of the computer with a newer version.</p>

<p><#\>He described an apparent problem in the location of the knock sensor which confuses the on-board computer under periods of acceleration. <#\>The computer is fooled into thinking that there is a knock in the engine, it then retards the timing accordingly. <#\>When the throttle position sensor relays the fact that the car is under acceleration the computer then decides it will allow power to the engine.</p>

<p><#\>Richard also mentioned "flame front" problems on some cars.</p>

<p><#\>I do not know whether the problems Richard described are related to those I'm having, but I do know that I have traded in a good 1988 Magna for one which is performing poorly. <#\>I would not have faith in the car reliably getting me out of certain situations where quick power is required, and consider it as potentially unsafe given the wrong set of circumstances.</p>

<p><#\>I would appreciate your help in having the problems rectified quickly, as I would not like a protracted situation. <#\>I was advised by Richard that the fault would indeed be fixed somehow, (him not knowing the latest with Mitsubishi <w>Motors'</w> rectification of existing faults), and that I would not have to pay for any rectification costs. <#\>He told me Mitsubishi Australia and Penrith Mitsubishi value customer relations and pride themselves with providing good service. <#\>I have no doubt this is the case.</p>

<p><#\>Could you please advise me what steps you can take to provide an early resolution to this most frustrating problem.</p>

<p><#\>Yours faithfully

<#\>Attn: Mr Bob Hudson

<p><#\>Dear Mr Hudson,</p>

<p><#\>I am writing to you with a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. <#\>You see, I have just spent $26,000 on a 1992 Mitsubishi Magna SE sedan, and have been having a problem which I notice you refer to in the last issue of The Open road.</p>

<p><#\>I am having engine hesitation and misfiring under acceleration and load. <#\>You mention these points as things to watch out for when purchasing the TR Magna. <#\>Had I known there were faults of this nature with this particular car then I probably would have opted for a different car altogether.</p>

<p><#\>I called the NRMA technical section prior to purchasing the car with a view to getting advice on the purchase price given the level of optioning that was on the car. <#\>At no time did the person I talked to mention a problem with this model that perhaps I should look out for.</p>

<p><#\>Given that I could be in line for protracted negotiations with Mitsubishi over the rectification of the fault, could you please advise me of any information NRMA or you might have about the fault condition, and what steps have been taken by Mitsubishi to rectify the fault. <#\>I have had discussions with Penrith Mitsubishi about the car, and have been advised by them to write to Mitsubishi Motors to get the rectification process under way. <#\>The service department advisor, Mr Richard Davidson of Penrith Mitsubishi, told me Mitsubishi have replaced cylinder heads and computers on some cars to fix the fault, but he was unsure of the latest methods for fault fixing, (a situation I find amazing).</p>

<p><#\>I have included a copy of the letter I sent to both Mitsubishi Motors Australia and Penrith Mitsubishi for your perusal, as it describes the fault in more detail.</p>

<p><#\>Also, I would be very interested in your opinions of modern car manufacturing, when a model can be released with such a known fault existing. <#\>You say in your article that most bugs were ironed out before 1990, but I find it ridiculous that I have spent $26,000 and bought a car with another "known" problem.</p>

<p><#\>I am awaiting an answer to my letter to Mitsubishi, but thought I may as well gather as much information as possible in order to arm myself for any possible negotiations with Mitsubishi.</p>

<p><#\>I would appreciate any assistance you may be able to give.</p>

<p><#\>Yours faithfully

<#\>Attention: Mr Peter Bylsma
cc  : Mr Bob Hudson

<p><#\>Dear Mr Bylsma</p>

<p><#\>I am writing to you at the request of Mr Bob Hudson after I described to him a fault with my 1992 Mitsubishi Magna TR sedan.</p>

<p><#\>I have enclosed copies of the correspondence involved with this problem for your perusal.</p>

<p><#\>The car has constant hesitation and misfire under acceleration or load which makes it very annoying to drive, and, I feel, potentially dangerous given the wrong set of circumstances.</p>

<p><#\>Basically Penrith Mitsubishi have told me that yes, there is an acknowledged fault in my model of Magna, but that they cannot fix the problem themselves. <#\>It requires their Head Office to come up with the necessary fix, which has previously involved anything from computer replacement to cylinder head replacement.</p>

<p><#\>I have had the car in three times for diagnosis and repair, but have been given only one excuse after another for the lack of satisfactory rectification.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Richard Davidson of Penrith Mitsubishi service department has told me they have checked the fuel injectors, filters and pump and have changed the air cleaner, (at cost to me), and that it now awaits Mitsubishi to come up with an overall fix for the problems, rather than try a problem by problem approach.</p></I>
