<p><#\>At twenty-six, Leigh (who is Cass's cousin) is tired of playing the part of bad girl but the habit is difficult to break. <#\>She fell into the role quite naturally at puberty <longdash> <w>parsons'</w> daughters do <longdash> and played it to the hilt, and now it's like a skin she can't shed. <#\>The thing is, Cass decides, Leigh knows the ropes of bad girl land, and even though the terrain has become tedious (has in fact become as boring as the Sunday afternoon prayer meetings of their childhoods), Leigh feels comfortable there. <#\>And safe.</p>

<p><#\>Safe? <#\>In a manner of speaking, safe; because Cass, watching Leigh smooth suntan oil on her bare breasts, knows that Leigh wouldn't even count the Hanlon af<l>fair. <#\>Leigh wouldn't give it any more significance than Cass would give a crunched fender or a smashed-up headlight. <#\>Annoying, yes. <#\>Inconvenient. <#\>But (shrug) these things happen, and besides, every life needs a little excitement, right?</p>

<p><#\>Nevertheless, it is because of Hanlon that Leigh has called, and because of Hanlon that they are lying towel by towel on Bondi beach, with Deb making sandcastles a few yards off. <#\>Not the usual way for Cass to spend a Saturday afternoon these days.</p>

<p><#\>"Come on, Cass," Leigh had said. <#\>"Live a little."</p>

<p><#\>"Well <*>dotted line</*>" Cass hears herself again, all tiresome caution. <#\>She is torn between maternal anxiety and the pleasant pinpricks of risk. <#\>(<it>Live</it> a little? <#\>Being target practice for Hanlon?) <#\>"There's this finger-painting thingamy at the public library. <#\>I was going to take Deb <*>dotted line</*>"</p>

<p><#\>Leigh already has the stroller out. <#\>"Deb needs to be <it>out</it>doors, not in. <#\>What kind of an Aussie kid are you raising here?"</p>

<p><#\>"But will it be safe?"</p>

<p><#\>"Safe as Sunday School. <#\>Hanlon's so dumb, he'll still be watching my flat in Melbourne."</p>

<p><#\>Leigh and Cass have travelled different roads, but they need each other. <#\>We're heads and tails, I suppose you could say, Cass explains to Tom. <#\>Though Leigh always counters: <it>You're</it> the wolf in sheep's clothing, and I'm the little lost lamb playing wolf to protect myself. <#\>(Black and white, Tom hopes; night and day.) At any rate, each plays Best Supporting Actress to the other's role. <#\>They grew up in Brisbane, which should ex<l>plain a lot, and were fed milk and biblical verses in their highchairs.</p>

<p><#\>When Leigh telephoned, the day before yesterday, Cass could feel the rush at the top of her head. <#\>"Leigh!" She was laughing already. <#\>"I don't believe it, I thought you'd vanished from the face of the land! <#\>Where are you? <#\>Brisbane?"</p>

<p><#\>"God no! <#\>Not Brizzy." <#\>Leigh hasn't been heard from for two years, though the family gossip mill has been murmuring Townsville, Cairns, Kuranda, Daintree, Leigh heading further and further north, heading deeper into shady reasons, bad company, offshore boats, <it>Dar<l>win!</it> (in a shocked whisper), Cape Trib, Thursday Island <it>(grant her Thy mercy, Lord)</it>, New Guinea! <#\>Then Brisbane again, it was rumoured. <#\>Someone had seen her at Expo, her hair un-gelled and unspiked, looking like a normal person, and she'd said <it>In sales</it>, giving a phone number. <#\>(Selling <*>dotted line</*>? <#\>No one dared to ask what.) <#\>At the phone number, a male voice went off in a shower of expletives and detonations about that fucking bitch who'd moved on, bloody lucky for her, and if he ever fucking caught up with the slut <*>dotted line</*></p>

<p><#\>Lost traces, lost causes, lost sheep. <#\>The family signed and bowed its head: <it>Remember, O Lord, thy wayward child and turn not Thy face away from</it> <*>dotted line</*></p>

<p><#\>"I'm here," Leigh says. <#\>"In Sydney." Excitement, salamander style, comes slinking in through Cass's ear<l>drum and makes straight for all her nerve centres of temptation. <#\>"Listen," Leigh says. <#\>"I need a place to crash, it's sort of urgent."</p>

<p><#\>Cass picks her up at Circular Quay. <#\>"God you look -" <it>terrible</it>, but what does it matter? <#\>Reinstated as bailer-out-in-chief, Cass feels giddy with pleasure.</p>

<p><#\>"Yeah, well. <#\>I've been doing a bit of coke. <#\>Doesn't go very well with food." Leigh lights a cigarette. <#\>"How's Deb?"</p>

<p><#\>"Adorable. <#\>You'll see in a minute. <#\>Tom's home, so I just rushed out."</p>

<p><#\>"And have you been a good girl while I've been gone?" Leigh asks.</p>

<p><#\>They both laugh.</p>

<p><#\>"What happened?" Cass wants to know.</p>

<p><#\>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p><#\>"You said it was urgent."</p>

<p><#\>"Oh, that." Leigh shrugs. <#\>"Nothing much. <#\>You remember Hanlon?"</p>

<p><#\>"That bloke you were living with in Brisbane?"</p>

<p><#\>"Him. <#\>We hit the road for a while, business you know, but I got tired of doing the dirty work and taking shit, so I -"</p>

<p><#\>"What sort of shit?"</p>

<p><#\>"Oh, you know, the usual. <#\>He hit me round a bit."</p>

<p><#\>"Leigh, why? <#\><it>Why</it> do you keep latching on to men like that? <#\>You've gotta stop <longdash>"</p>

<p><#\>"Yeah, I know. <#\>I've tried, I really have. <#\>I just can't seem to get turned on unless they're hellraisers. <#\>Anyway, in Brizzy, Hanlon set up this little dream of a deal, with me in the hot seat, natch, and it came to me that I could just take the money and run. <#\>So I did. <#\>Rip<l>ped him off for twenty thousand, and headed for Melbourne."</p>

<p><#\>"God, Leigh! <#\>Twenty thousand dollars!" Cass is appalled, her eyes glitter, she is full of plans. <#\>"Well <*>dotted line</*>" <longdash> she can't stop reeling from the enormity of it <longdash> "Well, now you can afford to, you know, quit <*>dotted line</*> Quit, uh, selling. <#\>You can go straight, get an apartment here, finish your degree <*>dotted line</*>"</p>

<p><#\>"Never give up, do you?" Leigh says fondly. <#\>In high school, they had been neck and neck. <#\>Leigh had won a state medal as well as a Commonwealth Scholarship. <#\>A brilliant future, her teachers said, which turned out to be true in a way. <#\>"Still," Leigh sighs. <#\>"Mackie was worth it for a while." <#\>She winces, then smiles, then winces again, remembering Mackie, the ex-con she'd run off with before the end of her first year at Queensland Uni. <#\>"About going back <*>dotted line</*> I think about it a lot, but I dunno after all these years."</p>

<p><#\>"It's never too late."</p>

<p><#\>"Yeah, yeah." Leigh is wistful. <#\>"I meant to, actually. <#\>Use the money for, you know, uni or something. <#\>But I blew it all on coke in Melbourne and last week I saw <longdash> "</p>

<p><#\>"You blew <it>twenty thousand dollars?</it>"</p>

<p><#\>"Well, not just me. <#\>Friends, you know. <#\>I threw a few parties. <#\>And I guess the word got round because last week <longdash>"</p>

<p><#\>"It's all gone?" Cass is awestruck. <#\>"That <it>entire</it> amount?"</p>

<p><#\>"<w>'Fraid</w> so." Leigh twists sideways in the seat, leaning against the passenger door, to gauge the effect of her words on Cass. <#\>"My coke's at maintenance level, though. <#\>It's under control."</p>

<p><#\>"I get frightened for you," Cass says. <#\>(If Leigh weren't around, what would happen to the world on its axis? <#\>What might Cass have to do?)</p>

<p><#\>"Yeah, me too sometimes." Leigh laughs. <#\>"Anyway, last week I saw Hanlon watching my place. <#\>He doesn't take kindly to being gypped, so I thought I'd better bug<l>ger off. <#\>Hitch-hiked up, left early yesterday and just ar<l>rived. <#\>God, I'm tired.'</p>

<p><#\>She slept for fifteen hours. <#\>She woke, she ate something, she threw up, she slept, she sleeps.</p>

<p><#\>Tom, looking into the guest room before heading for his office (the Saturday catch-up), says: "God, it's the worst I've ever seen her. <#\>She's thin as a whippet." Ex<l>cept for her tits, he thinks. <#\>In spite of himself, he's stir<l>red. <#\>The unspiked black hair, longer now, shaggy and glossy, falls across a child's face. <#\>He kisses Cass brus<l>quely: "So how long is she planning to camp here?" <#\>Not that he's made uneasy by Leigh's presence in his house, not really. <#\>Because this is what Tom has observ<l>ed: that the children of True Believers go one of two ways, and that there is a delicate ecology within families. <#\>To Tom's legal mind (he's a partner in a Regent Street law firm), Leigh is some sort of warranty.</p>

<p><#\>Leigh wakes into high sun. <#\>"Let's go to the beach," she says.</p>

<p><#\>"Well <*>dotted line</*> There's this finger-painting thing<l>amy <*>dotted line</*>"</p>

<p><#\>"Live a little," Leigh laughs, exasperated.</p>

<p><#\>And so they push the stroller along the neat residen<l>tial streets of Bellevue Hill and down the long asphalt slope to Bondi. <#\>Cass is always mildly surprised that no one asks for her passport at that point where the buildings change so sharply.</p>


<p><#\>Cass watches the way the men walk up and down where the sand turns hard, the way their equipment strains against their skimpy briefs, the way their eyes, not even pretending to be covert, scan the rows of oil-slicked breasts: the peacock parade on its mating route between towels and bodies. <#\>It still surprises Cass, the lack of self-consciousness on all sides. <#\>Bare bosoms are so common that if she rolls sideways on her towel and squints, the beach appears to be strewn with egg cartons, pointy lit<l>tle mounds in all directions. <#\>Big ones and small ones, floppy ones and tight little cones. <#\>She considers: if I took off my top, would Deb be startled? <#\>Would Leigh? <#\>(And if <it>Tom</it> heard of it?) <#\>A man walks within eight in<l>ches of her head, flicking sand in her eyes, and manages to spill beer on Leigh's midriff. <#\>Leigh sits bolt upright and her splendid bare breasts bounce and quiver.</p>

<p><#\>"Jeez, sorry." The man squats down, blotting at beer-wet skin with his towel.</p>

<p><#\>"Oh, bugger off," Leigh says without malice.</p>

<p><#\>"Hey, an accident, swear to God!" <#\>The man turns toward Cass and winks. <#\>He has very white teeth and a dimple beside his chin. <#\>Cass has an urge to stick out her tongue, throw sand at him maybe, and a simultaneous one to run her fingers down through the hair on his chest, across the flat tanned belly, across the blue lycra welt to that bleat of skin on the inside of his squatting thighs. <#\>Baby skin, and she can't take her eyes off it. <#\>She'd forgotten this: the way sun and salt air and drowsiness and the smell of suntan oil add up to lust. <#\>Not lust exactly. <#\>More a sort of catholic sensuousness, an erotic languor toward the whole wide world.</p>

<p><#\>"Got some beer in the Esky," the man says. <#\>"Wanna join me?"</p>

<p><#\>"Sure," Cass murmurs silkily, eyes meeting his. <#\>"Why not?"</p>

<p><#\>"Be right back."</p>

<p><#\>Cass stretches like a cat and reaches behind and unhooks her bikini top. <#\>She squirts a glob of sunscreen into one palm and rubs it lovingly on her nipples.</p>

<p><#\>"What the hell are you doing?" Leigh asks. <#\>"Why'd you invite that jerk back here? <#\>We'll never get rid of him."</p>

<p><#\>Cass smiles. <#\>This feels good, very good: sun on her white and private breasts, it's like losing your virginity again, a lifesaver watching while she massages in the oil, a slow rhythmic caress, auto-erotic. <#\>Watching herself being watched, she can feel what it was that hooked Narcissus.</p>

<p><#\>"A married woman!" Leigh is agitated, Leigh is suddenly and inexplicably angry. <#\>"A <it>mother!</it> <#\>Put your clothes back on, we're going."</p>

<p><#\>Cass's eyes go wide. <#\>"You've got to be kidding."</p>

<p><#\>"You think you're funny or something? <#\>You think you're <longdash>"</p>

<p><#\>Then chaos comes in a skirl of sand. <#\>First, the Esky man is knocked for a sixer, the blue Esky sails in an arc toward the surf trailing cans of Swan Lager like so many bows on a kite tail. <#\>After that, it's helter-skelter: screaming, cursing, an assortment of missiles (footballs, cricket bats, a rubber skipping-rope), bodies lunging, bodies falling, blood. <#\>There are gouts of blood on the sand. <#\>Mothers scream and gather up tots and towels, heading for the concrete steps. <#\>Cass scoops up Deb and runs to the water. <#\>Children cry and don't know if they're crying from fear or from the sand in their eyes. <#\>People wipe their wet faces and find themselves sprinkled with blood. <#\>A little further off, a ring of boys gathers to watch and barrack. <#\>This is some fight, some thrill.</p>

<p><#\><it>It's wogs!</it><#\> <it>The wogs started it.</it><#\> <it>They were bothering a white girl, they threw sand in a white lady's face, they kicked a football right into a little kid's head, a little white kid, he's got concussion.</it></p></I>
