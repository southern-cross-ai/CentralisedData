<I><#\><h><bold>Decriminalising drugs least worst</bold></h>

<p><#\><bold>W</bold>HETHER to decriminal<l>ise the use of cannabis must inevitably come down to a blunt choice between crime and health. <#\>It is bizarre indeed that in a nation where 20,000 or so people die each year as a result of smoking and another 2000 or so in road accidents, we can contemplate putting another carcinogen on the supermarket shelves and another mind-altering substance within reach of drivers.</p>

<p><#\>But do we have a choice? <#\>While cannabis remains illegal and posses<l>sion of even tiny amounts can result in a criminal conviction, the drug trade will remain demand-driven and deadly. <#\>There is a growing con<l>viction among some criminologists that decriminalisation of the posses<l>sion and use of small amounts of cannabis is the course which govern<l>ments will reluctantly take sooner or later. <#\>Some argue that "heavy" drugs such as cocaine and heroin will prob<l>ably end up being legal too, even if their prescription is tightly adminis<l>tered. <#\> US economist Milton Fried<l>man has suggested that if drugs had been decriminalised years ago drugs such as the highly-addictive and deadly crack might not have been developed. <#\>His argument is that new "designer" drugs, some capable of causing appalling physical and mental damage to this generation and mental damage to the unborn next generation, were manufactured primarily because the high price of illegal drugs created a demand for cheaper substitutes.</p>

<p><#\>Demand and supply: <#\>ever since mankind first felt compelled to con<l>trol substances which alter our per<l>ception of the world, it has argued too about whether the pushers are really being pushed. <#\>And since then society has argued too about whether people should be free to inhale, inject and ingest whatever they like. <#\>Wher<l>ever crusaders rail against drugs, subterranean markets have emerged to conduct the business of altering people's brains.</p>

<p><#\>Prohibition doesn't work. <#\>It makes purchase and possession more difficult, but it doesn't stop drug-taking. <#\>The higher risks drive up prices (and the profits to suppli<l>ers), but wreak their revenge on soci<l>ety through a much higher level of crime by users. <#\>Today, most house<l>breaking and robbery is committed by people seeking money for drugs. <#\>Dealing with this crime, and with the distortions and corruptions of the sys<l>tem by those who profit from it, has fundamentally altered the criminal justice balance in the community.</p>

<p><#\>The real arguments against legalis<l>ing drugs are health ones. <#\>It is not only brains which become altered but lungs, livers, hearts, reflexes and powers of perception, some tempo<l>rarily, some permanently. <#\>The di<l>lemma for legislators is to weigh the medical costs of drugs (including damage inflicted upon innocent fam<l>ily members and strangers) against the cost of maintaining and enforc<l>ing prohibitions which everybody realises have not worked. <#\>We live in a society in which dangerous drugs can be smuggled into maximum-security prisons. <#\>What hope can we entertain that drugs can be kept out of schools, bars and dinner parties?</p>

<p><#\>No-one likes to admit defeat, but obviously even the most spectacular of drug hauls barely mists the surface of the drug trade.</p>

<p><#\>The medical argument against de<l>criminalisation of drugs, from can<l>nabis to heroin, ecstasy and a pharmacist's shelf full of other abused substances, is powerful. <#\>At a time when the medical profession has put debate about smoking and drinking back on the news pages, the courts and the parliament, political parties, including both the ALP and the Liberal Party in the ACT, toy periodically with the idea of loosen<l>ing the controls on drug use. <#\>And how do they justify the apparent con<l>tradictions of banning smoking in public buildings with one hand and decriminalising another dangerous form of cigarette with the other? <#\>They don't. <#\>They are only too aware of the comparisons, the double stan<l>dards, the inconsistencies. <#\>They can only repeat the single unchallenged fact that prohibition has not worked.</p>

<p><#\><bold>L</bold>EGISLATORS must make a de<l>cision about the direction drug enforcement will take. <#\>Australia can follow the path of the United States and press more and more futile time and money into enforcement, or it can divert a fraction of that money towards education and a fraction more towards the provision of con<l>trolled doses of clean drugs to addicts and legal cannabis to smokers.</p>

<p><#\>Earlier this year the Victoria Po<l>lice issued figures of charges which followed the state's Operation Noah, a dob-a-druggie dial-in held annu<l>ally in most states, including the ACT. <#\>Of the 676 charges to arise from the phone-in, only one was re<l>lated to the supply of heroin. <#\>Almost 600 involved marijuana and 413 were for possession or use. <#\>If society thinks that is money well spent, so be it. <#\>If, on the other hand it sees canna<l>bis as a drug no better or worse than alcohol in its power to numb, and no better or worse than tobacco in its power to wreak physical havoc, per<l>haps it is more realistic to move to<l>wards decriminalisation, meanwhile educating Australians against the abuse of all drugs. <#\>Cocaine and hero<l>in might have to wait for another day.</p>

<p><#\>Decriminalising drug use, particu<l>larly at the milder end of the scale, seems like the worst alternative <longdash> except for everything else. <#\>Every<l>thing else has failed; <#\>the decriminal<l>isation path offers more chance of breaking some of the evil nexuses than anything else. <#\>Accompanied by some sustained attacks on drug de<l>mand, via education, it may even reduce the corruption of the supply end of the equation.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Health: outside inquiry needed</bold></h>

<p><#\><bold>T</bold>HE Government's move to initiate an investigation into what amounts to a $9.57 mil<l>lion budget blow-out within the De<l>partment of Health is a welcome response to a very serious problem. <#\>However the investigator should a completely independent outsider, with a brief to review the entire health operational and accounting systems.</p>

<p><#\>The Government's decision to put the investigatory role under the con<l>trol of the head of the Department of Health, Education and the Arts, Dr Eric Willmot, overlooks the need for all scrutiny not only to be impartial but to be seen to be impartial. <#\>There can be no doubting Dr Willmot's experience and impartiality, but the Government asks too much when it thrusts such a role on the head of the department under investigation.</p>

<p><#\>Such investigations are better han<l>dled by officers specifically operating outside the particular Government department under investigation and unlikely to be influenced by profes<l>sional or personal relationships. <#\>Public perceptions can be fundamen<l>tally undermined when allegations, no matter how untrue, can be made of vested interest or partiality.</p>

<p><#\>The Department of Health has long been a problem area for the ACT with perennial cost overruns requiring additional funding and failures to meet political and man<l>agement targets. <#\>A siege mentality and some secretiveness have also long been evident. <#\>The problems have also been highlighted, but lit<l>tle seems to have changed.</p>

<p><#\>Of particular concern should be the non-payment of $3.5 million in accounts dating back to last financial year.<#\>This fact, confirmed by the Minister for Health, Gary Hum<l>phries, implies that a serious breach of accepted Government accounting practices may have occurred. <#\>It should have been picked up on audit. <#\>It probably should have been picked up by Treasury. <#\>The concern is not merely about a technical failure; <#\>it may also have meant that tradesmen and other hospital creditors, many no doubt under particular economic pressure in the present climate, have not been having their bills paid on time. <#\>One is entitled to expect better of a government authority.</p>

<p><#\>The department is no longer just dealing with the day-to-day running of hospitals and health services in the ACT.<#\>Today it is vitally involved in a multi-million-dollar hospital re<l>development project the success or failure of which will dictate the quali<l>ty of health care to ACT residents for decades to come. <#\>There can be no room for mistakes or sloppy manage<l>ment.</p>

<p>Mr Humphries issued yesterday an assurance that the redevelopment budget was on track, but in all the circumstances more than just a min<l>isterial reassurance is needed. <#\>What is needed is not simply a reassurance that an annual appropriation will not be exceeded, but that the project will deliver what was promised of it at the beginning. <#\>The budgetary status and viability of the hospital redevel<l>opment should also be examined. <#\>ACT residents need not be assured that the health bureaucrats have got it right and that the budget blow-out identified last week is not just the tip of the iceberg. <#\>There could be devas<l>tating consequences if the hospital redevelopment budget were allowed to get out of hand.</p>

<p><#\>The Chief Minister, Trevor Kaine, leapt to the defence of his public servants in the wake of criticism lev<l>elled at them by the Auditor-General last month, but he must not allow his views of their competency or other<l>wise stand in the way of a full exam<l>ination of the financial status of what is arguably the most port<l>folio area and what is the Govern<l>ment's most expensive and complex capital-works undertaking.</p>

<p><#\>As each week goes by the hospital redevelopment project involves the commitment of more and more funds and, as yet, the bottom line has still not been clearly drawn. <#\>A full examination of the project's continu<l>ing viability is warranted if only to reassure the public, politicians and bureaucrats that they are on the right track.</p>

<p><#\>The recurrent savings identified as likely to result from the development of one principal hospital and the clo<l>sure of Royal Canberra Hospital (North) were not large <longdash> about $8 million a year. <#\>This makes it even more crucial that the numbers upon which the redevelopment has been predicated are not fatally flawed.</p>

<p><#\><bold>T</bold>HE task of the investigator on examining what had been going wrong in the health department will not be easy. <#\>He might well find a distinct lack of cooperation from some quarters. <#\>Many significant rep<l>utations <longdash> bureaucratic and medical <longdash> are riding on the health budget and the success or failure of the rede<l>velopment project. <#\>There are those who are pursuing the task with what amounts to a missionary zeal and who will brook no criticism or legiti<l>mate questions.</p>

<p><#\>Their enthusiasm for the project is laudable, but they should not allow their hopes and enthusiasms to col<l>our their judgement of its viability. <#\>It in one thing for doctors to have the very best and the very latest in medical technology housed in grandiose buildings, it is another thing for ACT taxpayers to meet the inevitable cost.</p>

<p><#\>It was significant that Mr Hum<l>phries chose to point out yesterday that some of the budgetary problems arose during the term of the Interim Hospitals Board. <#\>That may be true, but as much as Mr Humphries has had to rely on his advisers, his prede<l>cessor controllers relied on the same people. <#\>A lot of things have changed but the hands at the steering wheel have been much the same through<l>out, <#\>With something obviously wrong in the management, can Mr Humphries be certain that everything else remains on track?</p>

<#\><h><bold>Europeans query extent of unity</bold></h>

<p><#\><bold>T</bold>HERE is nothing like a seri<l>ous war to make nations fum<l>ble nervously for their constitutions and sing a few bars of the national anthem. <#\>It is time for conservatism and inhibitions. <#\>It comes as no shock then to see Britain reiterating its dissatisfaction with plans to fast-track some aspects of European economic unity, particu<l>larly those aspects which would see the dozen member nations surrender crucial controls over economic poli<l>cy to the European Community.</p>

<p><#\>It is almost as if Europe is having second thoughts about unity, now that real life has given member na<l>tions a chance to show how solid and confident they can be in terms of foreign policy and defence policies. <#\>Simultaneously, a world recession nibbles, bringing into focus all the "what ifs" about monetary union, industrial reform, government spending and government debt.</p>

<p><#\>To make matters worse, questions have been generated in areas such as law and order, immigration, even family law, with plenty more to come. <#\>A report on divorce from Brussels earlier this month showed that as Europe knits itself into an increasingly homogenous commu<l>nity, laws will either have to catch up or risk becoming ludicrously obso<l>lete. <#\>Could there come a time when the law will allow Irish farmers to market their produce on a single, obstacle-free market, but will refuse to recognise a divorce between an Irish farmer and a Dutch spouse?</p></I>
