<I><#\><h><bold>A NEW JAPAN</bold></h>

<#\><h><bold>That's the only certainty</bold></h>

<p><#\>IT is high irony that what seems to have saved the corruption soiled Liberal Democratic Party from outright defeat in Sunday's Japanese general election is the collapse of the socialist vote. <#\>While in these post-Cold War times the drain of support from the Left is understandable, and perhaps inevitable, it is a fact that had the socialist vote held, the anti-LDP coalition would have won. <#\>Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said at his post-election news conference yester<l>day: <quote>The LDP has won as the leading No. 1 party, so it has the duty to continue the nation's government.</quote> <#\>Mr Miyazawa is unlikely to survive as Prime Minister beyond the holding of a special parliamentary session to be called within a month. <#\>What his country undoubtedly faces is a period of some uncertainty <longdash> at least so far as formal govern<l>ment is concerned <longdash> and most likely rampant and unseemly horse-trading for power.</p>

<p><#\>Sunday's result is not the worst that might have occurred. <#\>But it goes close to it. <#\>Japan is likely to have <longdash> even after next month's parliamentary meeting <longdash> its weakest government in decades. <#\>Any new leader, LDP or otherwise, will have to battle the powerful bureaucratic structure to implement new policies. <#\>The people voted for change (or, at least, a majority of the 67 percent who turned out did: Japan like most democracies does not have compulsory voting). <#\>It is now up to the political process and the politicians to ensure that they get it. <#\>The old corruption must go. <#\>What will take its place is the most puzzling question.</p>

<p><#\>None of the parties <longdash> many of them new <longdash> that contested the election spelled out firm or even particularly formed policies on anything much at all. <#\>In that en<l>vironment, on the policy front at least, more of the same seems the most likely outcome, however prettily that same is dressed in new clothes. <#\>The Japanese busi<l>ness community welcomes the result. <#\>The chairman of the pow<l>erful Federation of Economic Organisations, Mr Gaisha Hiraiwa, says he expects the LDP and other conservative parties will swiftly strive for stabilisa<l>tion of the administration. <#\>There are substantial problems to be faced: the final outcome of the Uruguay Round of trade talks, the building economic confrontation between the United States and Japan, the thorny question of stabilising the stock market and the yen.</p>

<p><#\>The election was, rightly, viewed as a major turning point for Japan and its democracy. <#\>The LDP had held power unen<l>cumbered by coalition since 1955. <#\>It presided over the great swelling of Japanese industrial and commercial might. <#\>That it did so is to its credit. <#\>That it be<l>came in the process enmeshed in institutionalised corruption and money politics is regrettable, worthy of punishment, but also, sadly, probably inevitable. <#\>Parli<l>amentary democracy is served best by a system in which there are electable rivals <longdash> a lesson not lost on Australians at this time <longdash> so that within reasonable timescales there is a turnover of power. <#\>Something of that sort happened in Japan on Sunday. <#\>But the shape of the eventual coalition, and the strength of the new commitment to electoral, political and economic reform, are as yet a long way from being clear. <#\>What emerges, and how it emerges, will be of crucial interest to Australia, the region and the world.</p>

<#\><h><bold>PLAIN LOCO</bold></h>

<#\><h><bold>A plan that doesn't add up</bold></h>

<p><#\>WHY the railways should con<l>sider that, in the interests of "downsizing", Queensland tax<l>payers should meet the cost of continuing to employ people for whom there is no work is an in<l>teresting <longdash> and expensive <longdash> question. <#\>Why the Government, in the person of Transport Minis<l>ter David Hamill, should insist on the scheme is even more inter<l>esting. <#\>Why either is prepared to acquiesce in the face of political and union pressure to "look after people" is the most interesting question of all. <#\>According to con<l>fidential documents, Queensland Railways have been advised to sweeten redundancy deals or come up with "more creative" packages so that those selected for the tap on the shoulder will go quietly. <#\>The objective, it seems, is to provide a profitable bottom line for a corporatised railway system.</p>

<p><#\>There are two separate issues at stake here. <#\>One is efficiency, represented by a leaner staff list and much higher productivity. <#\>The other is the Government's plan to shut down so-called une<l>conomic lines. <#\>On both fronts, the people <longdash> the ultimate owners of the railways and payers of any sweetheart redundancy deals <longdash> are being sold pups. <#\>Pri<l>vate enterprise could not operate on the basis the railways appar<l>ently plan to proceed. <#\>The share-holders would revolt and the directors would be sacked. <#\>In the long run, unions do their members a disservice if they succeed in winning arrangements that are plainly economic nonsense. <#\>They "save" jobs now at the ex<l>pense of effectiveness and long-term viability. <#\>If the railways and the Government are determined to shut down large sections of the network and slash employment, they should have the courage to do so on the most economic basis feasible, and be up-front about it. <#\>Few people would doubt that the railways could be made vastly more efficient. <#\>It is inevitable that technological change will reduce formerly high levels of employment. <#\>It is not inevitable that it should result in shutting down all but the coal lines and the coastal trunk routes.</p>

<p><#\>The Government, on the ques<l>tion of line closures, seems to be proceeding on a basis that shows it to be the victim of its own prop<l>aganda. <#\>Figures purporting to show the viability of certain sec<l>tions of line relate to freight and passengers delivered to destina<l>tions: hence the "rationalisa<l>tion", for example, of closing down Quilpie. <#\>They do not take account of outward movements <longdash> that gets credited to the destination, too <longdash> so that livestock from Quilpie (say) or apples and stone fruit from Stanthorpe, heavy users of the railways, are simply ignored in the calculations. <#\>This is madness <longdash> and it is time the Government was told so: loudly, clearly, unequivocally.</p>

<p><#\>The people of Queensland should not accept at face value the unsubstantiated claims of any side in this dispute. <#\>The railways have their own objec<l>tive, corporatised profitability; the unions have theirs, another version of that tried and failed Australian public service standard of jobs for life; and the Government has either embraced political cupidity or social stupidity. <#\>(On neither choice do its actions give Queenslanders much cause for confidence.) None of the partici<l>pants in this sorry pantomime emerge at this stage covered with glory; what seems to be attaching itself to their persons is much less pleasant.</p>

<#\><h><bold>SHAMBOLISM</bold></h>

<#\><h><bold>We must <it>all</it> act on jobless</bold></h>

<p><#\>ONE million unemployed is a symbolic figure. <#\>It is, as well, shambolic: it symbolises the shambles that this aspect of pub<l>lic policy has collapsed into un<l>der the weight of the recession we had to have. <#\>It is very much a political issue <longdash> in the sense that politics necessarily governs how we live as a nation <longdash> but much less a partisan question than some would have us believe. <#\>The bottom line is not who caused it (and anyway, the people will have their say on that on March 13). <#\>It is how we can get out of it as quickly and effectively as possible.</p>

<p><#\>In their comments yesterday, a range of political leaders got it right, or at any rate partly so. <#\>Treasurer John Dawkins, on the hustings in Brisbane, said there was a ray of hope. <#\><quote>The trend has stabilised and we are hopeful it will head in the right direction,</quote> he said. <#\>His view <longdash> unsurpris<l>ingly <longdash> was echoed by Prime Minister Keating. <#\>Opposition Leader John Hewson said of explanations that the January figures were raw data awaiting statistical attention: <quote>You can't seasonally adjust people.</quote> <#\>Premier Wayne Goss was sourly most sensible: <quote>This country has got many years of hard work, years of blood, sweat and tears, in front of it, irrespective of who wins the federal election.</quote></p>

<p><#\>In Queensland, job growth is keeping roughly in step with pop<l>ulation growth. <#\>It is doing very little to cut back on the pool of long-term unemployed <longdash> most new jobs went to the new job-seekers <longdash> and it is profoundly unclear (and the State Govern<l>ment would like it to remain so) what proportion of new jobs are productive, long-term employ<l>ment prospects. <#\>There is only one way out of this dreadful maze. <#\>Granted <longdash> to take up Mr <w>Goss'</w> point <longdash> that real economic growth will have to wait for a revival of the global economy, governments everywhere must finally grasp the fact that real productive employment exists in and is created in the private sec<l>tor. <#\>Until official policy at every level of government recognises that fact and implements changes to promote private en<l>terprise, no solution will be found.</p>

<p><#\>The fact is, unemployment at the level Australia has been expe<l>riencing is simply unacceptable. <#\>Worse, it is dangerous. <#\>A whole generation of young people is coming on to the job market with bleak prospects indeed of finding productive, career-path employ<l>ment. <#\>A swathe of middle-aged Australians, still in their prime, are being thrown on the scrapheap. <#\>Government's an<l>swer is to provide training pack<l>ages. <#\>Training for what? <#\>It should be no one's proud boast that we have the world's most retrained dole lines. <#\>Or else they create jobs by spending public money <longdash> money we do not have <longdash> on bringing forward projects that provide temporary jobs or make-and-mend schemes.</p>

<p><#\>As we note above, Mr Goss is right. <#\>It will take a long time and a lot of hard work to rebuild a productive employment-growth economy. <#\>He also understands that job growth is state-based. <#\>Why then does his Government fail to act energetically to promote productive projects <longdash> greenfield as well as in the re<l>source sector <longdash> that will lead to real economic growth? <#\>Queens<l>land is leading Australia at pres<l>ent. <#\>But it won't for long if the too-hard baskets remain over-loaded and the razor gangs ARE unable to see the downstream benefits of spending money on productive projects.</p>

<#\><h><bold>JURY FEARS</bold></h>

<#\><h><bold>Free speech is the question</bold></h>

<p><#\>THE jury system is perhaps the finest benefit of English law. <#\>It exists in Australia and other places as a result of British set<l>tlement. <#\>It should not be regard<l>ed as so frail that it might be placed at risk by the screening of a television program. <#\>That it is, by the Criminal Law Association and the president of the Queens<l>land Bar Association is, to say the least, a somewhat disturbing curiosity. <#\>Mr Michael Quinn of the Criminal Law Association says the ABC docu-drama <it>Joh's Jury</it> is the first step towards the destruction of the jury system. <#\>Mr Bob Douglas QC of the Bar Association says it should not be screened.</p>

<p><#\>Not to be outdone <longdash> or to be seen merely wringing its hands <longdash> the State Government has threatened legal action if the pro<l>gram interferes with the admin<l>istration of justice. <#\>It is hard to see how it could, though. <#\>The program concerns the trial of Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen for perjury. <#\>That trial is long over. <#\>It ended in a hung jury and a subsequent decision by law officers not to continue action. <#\>After the trial, it was revealed that the jury fore<l>man had a connection with the National Party. <#\>It was alleged by jurors <longdash> who chose to speak out after the trial <longdash> that some of the jury room proceedings were disquieting. <#\>It also sparked a Criminal Justice Commission inquiry into the jury selection process, still under way.</p>

<p><#\>The position of the Criminal Law Association and the Bar As<l>sociation appears to be that jurors should forever forgo their right to free speech on matters they have heard. <#\>While a trial is in progress, of course jurors should be left free of impediment <longdash> inside or outside the jury room <longdash> and the media in gener<l>al, and The Courier-Mail in particular, have absolutely no problem with that. <#\>A juror, how<l>ever, is a juror only while empanelled. <#\>Particularly in cir<l>cumstances where some doubts exist in their minds as to the con<l>duct of a case they have heard, they should speak out.</p>

<p><#\>This is a free country. <#\>It is sup<l>posedly a place where free speech is an absolute right. <#\>There is no place in a democratic society for in-club decision-mak<l>ing or cosy arrangements made behind closed doors.</p></I>
