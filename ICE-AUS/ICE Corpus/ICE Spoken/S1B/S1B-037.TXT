<S1B-037> <2006>
<I><$A> <#\>Delighted you're all here <#\>Thank you for coming <#\>Let's
start in a fairly broad brush approach I suppose after a
generation more of of feminism how liberated are women<,>
Beatrice Faust
<$B> <#\>I'm just so glad I've been going on television since it
first came to Australia<,> and now I'm seeing women on the
floor with doo-dads around their necks pulling wires and
speaking into microphones
<$A> <#\>You're talking about our floor crew right
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Do you think this is a measure of how how liberated we
are
<$B> <#\>It's a quick measure yes
<$A> <#\>What about uh Sheila Jeffreys
<$Z> <X><#\>Oh I think I mean I have to compare Australian with
Britain uh and I would say that obviously in Australia women
earn more than they do in Britain in relation to men and
there've been great legal advances in Australia compared with
Britain and I'm also aware than in Australia the huge problems
which are really helping to maintain women's subordination
such as sexual violence such as the massively organised in
Australia sex industry which is promoting the subordination of
women and making a profit out of the subordination of women
<#\>Those issues are very big here so in that way I think
Australian women have quite a problem</X>
<$A> <#\>Well let's go to someone who also has strong views on
that but from a different generation perhaps Cathy Lumby
<$C> <#\>Um well I have to say that I think feminism's come an
awfully long way in twenty years um I think that um that young
women today have much greater opportunities than their
mothers' generation would have had and I think that one of the
sort of examples of this is the way that um feminism is now a
mainstream issue <#\>It's a sexy issue if you like ah in the media
so that issues like domestic violence um rape education
women's rights in terms of work etc discrimination are now
mainstream issues
<$A> <#\>Let's start looking in particular areas now and the
workplace we'll start with <#\>Anne Summers as the architect
certainly one of the architects of that uh trailblazing sex
discrimination act uh ten years ago uh how close are we to
equal opportunity in the workplace for women now
<$D> <#\>I should say Andrew that I often get credit for things I
haven't done and this is uh one of them <#\>Susan Ryan um and
Chris Oldsworthy deserves the credit for the sex
discrimination act <#\>I was very proud to have been involved
with affirmative action
<$A> <#\><{><[>it was a co-operative</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>which followed on</[></{> from uh sex discrimination act but I
think it's true as we see on the floor today there are women
doing crewing jobs that uh even a few years ago they didn't do
<#\>Likewise flying planes and driving buses and doing all sorts
of things that weren't available to us uh <#\>It's true that women
uh earn more than their counterparts in most other countries 
<#\>I think that's terrific uh but the sorts of problems that
we're encountering now are those of commonly called the glass
ceiling <#\>There are certain barriers towards women moving into
all sorts of decision making opportunities <#\>I think we need
to broaden women's opportunities as well as increase the
levels at which uh uh they're able to operate
<$A> <#\>We should be hearing glass ceilings shattering all over
the place shouldn't we and the splintering sound of closed
doors as well <#\>Why aren't we Carmen Lawrence
<$E> <#\>Well I think they're rather melting than shattering and
we're perhaps not seeing it just yet <#\>Uh I think it's very
important that we look at what's been achieved and I agree
that in the last twenty years there's been enormous movement
but one of the things that I think is clearly in the workplace
and in politics is the fact that the environments in which
women work and make decisions haven't changed to suit them 
<#\>So in fact women are sen in a sense are being fitted into
environments that don't suit their needs whether you're
talking about the workplace and the needs of families and
children and those juggling responsibilities or the political
environment <#\>I think the change has to be in the institutions
<$A> <#\>Are the conditions in place now I mean because we've got
what a quadrupling of a of child care facilities over the last
decade <#\>As we showed in Four Corners last week uh we now have
girls winning at school uh very much I think <#\>They're filling
the university courses <#\>Are the conditions now right for
change
<$E> <#\>Well I think that if I can just follow up I think they
are and I think that young women particularly are demanding
that the those changes are made and uh I'd obviously like to
hear from others on that but I think we're starting to see a
shift in the idea that women need liberating to the idea that
society needs changing
<$A> <#\>Why aren't they coming through quickly though <#\>What's
what's holding women back
<$F> <#\>I think that a number of the structures that exist within
society and from my point of view the workplace is a good
example of that really don't accommodate some of the things
that women now have to negotiate in the workplace <#\>An example
of that that you mentioned is child care 
<$A> <#\>When you say you're workp workplace do you mean the
health area or union
<$F> <#\>well h hel the health area is an example as much as I
think the broader um working environment that women find
themselves in <#\>The enterprise agreements that are currently
being negotiated include agreement for greater flexibility but
women with childcare responsibility women with an increasing
move into continuing education for themselves in order fer in
order to further their career often can't be as flexible as
men who don't have those responsibilities <#\>And child care
services don't cover the twenty four hour period so if a woman
is involved in studying and um is often the wage earner anyway
you know in the unit then they are not able to agree to be
completely flexible about their availability or they have to
do a permanent night duty type type shift and find child care
wh during the day while they sleep <#\>So I think there are a
number of stuctures within the workplace that aren't changing
rapidly enough and women are put in a position from my point
of view often of having to negotiate less<,> than what men are
able to do <#\>I don't think that women's negotiating power is
as cohesive in a way and it's not as public um particularly in
the health area of course <#\>It's very difficult to um for a
whole range of women's occupations to simply stop work <#\>I
mean <#\>An area you mentioned before was sport <#\>What do sports
women do to attract attention to themselves <#\>Do they stop
work or use some other mechanism to attract higher income for
themselves
<$A> <#\>Are are women balking from responsibility in some way too
though I mean uh that they're not sure they want to make the
sort of sacrifices <#\>I know uh Anne Summers in your letter to
the the next generation you pointed out what struck you as a
rather lamentable fact I suppose that a lot of younger
feminists almost looked on the older feminists to them uh with
with uh sadness and uh and saw you as sad and lonely figures I
suppose 
<$D> <#\>I guess we'll hear uh tonight whether this is the common
view but certainly I've encountered that amongst a lot of
younger women uh perhaps more so in the States than here where
the f-word was definitely uh not in vogue some years ago <#\>I
think it's coming back and I'm very pleased about that cos
it's a word that I uh very fond of eh but I think that
<$?> <#\>I think we should hear from some of these<O>laugh</O> the 
next generation
<$A> <#\>Let's hear from some of you younger feminists <#\>I mean
how to you 
<$G> <#\>I mean I took great I took great exception to the ge the
letter to the next generation and um I think it implies that a
lot of structural impedements to women making their way in the
world uh have been addressed and to a much greater extent than
they have <#\>And when we're talking about why it is that um more
isn't happening when it seems as though the the world is a
girl's oyster why isn't more happening really the issue is
still the very basic structural questions: income childcare um
uh freedom from uh exploitation in the workplace uh freedom
from sexual harrassment um <#\>They're some extremely uh deep
structural issues to be addressed which are not addressed by
public relations kinds of things to do with making feminism a
sexy issue um somebody mentioned before that um feminist
issues and wo things to do with uh violence against women have
become sexy issues ah I question why that is <#\>Why is it those
issues why is it the symptoms of women's in inequality which
makes it into the media rather than the than the causes <#\>Why
do we talk about an education campaign for judges which will
cost uh you know a couple of million dollars when when when
we're not addressing women's situation in society which was
the which was the reason that the the second wave of feminism
got kicked off in the first place
<$A> <#\>All right so who's to blame for that
<$G> <#\>Well I think feminism is still a dangerous is still a
radical force <#\>It's still questioning the very basis of
society <#\>It's still questioning um the way that uh income is
distributed <#\>It's still questioning why there are sections of
society which are are are cordoned off and exploited their
labour is exploited um<,> by  by society it's still um it
still has to be suppressed and I think it still is suppressed
I think that the radical edge of feminism is still too
dangerous to be allowed to be to to make the media <#\>Like some
of the sort of the sexy stories can
<$A> <#\>Is feminism itself at times a bit proscriptive though is
it also doing a bit of fencing off of a not wanting some of
these issues to be disc uh discussed  <#\>I mean Beatrice Faust for
example uh has been talking about the prevalence of of wowser
feminism <#\>What do you mean by that
<$B> <#\>Oh there is a group which is somewhat anti-sex and
somewhat anti-male<,> and resent any form of adventurous sex 
<#\>There's a lady here who I'm not looking at who says when the
revolution comes there will be very little penetrative sex
<#\>Now for
<$A> <#\>Okay who wants to put their hand up<O>laughter</O>  <#\>It was
Sheila Jeffreys obviously
<$B> <#\>Ninety five percent of human beings sex is penetrative
and with this goes uh tenderness about any form uh  of visual
representation of the human body and sexual activity which
again is very pleasurable to more than half the population<,,>
<#\>And uh very er<,,> strict use of language you get politically
correct language<,> <#\>You get all sorts of killjoy activities
coming out of the <{><[>wowser feminists</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>As opposing feminism at the wider the wider public</[> </{>
<$B> <#\>Uh<,> I think it probably hurts us with some of the
younger generation because what I see is a lot of young
women<,> who are really taking advantage of sexual autonomy 
<#\>They're not sex objects they are sex subjects <#\>They're making
their own decisions<,> about when to have intercourse and with
whom and under what circumstances<,> and how and when to have
babies and how to fit that all in their lives and they're
doing really well at it
<$A> <#\>All right well we must this begs a response of course
<$Z> <X><#\>Can I just as you've pointed out I have no idea if
you were the person I meant but uh but obviously I do argue
that women are not really going to make advances until we have
a total reconstruction of sexuality because I see sexuality as
as a bedrock of of the relations between men and women <#\>It's
a sort of a very important interface between them and what I
argue is that we actually have to sexualise equality <#\>If we
if there's going if if equality is going to be ev possible to
see for women in the future then we cannot have sex as it's
currently constructed which is eroticised inequality dominance
and submission <#\>We actually have to do something about that
otherwise people say you're taking all the fun away <#\>Women's
liberation would take the fun away because it would take away
the excitement of dominance and submission sex so I think yes
we have to eroticise equality <#\>On the issue of penetration I
think that shows how little we have moved in a way because
sexual intercourse penis in vagina sexuality is actually
contra-indicated for women in many ways <#\>There ar there are
uh very large numbers of women who still don't receive orgasms
through sexual intercourse whether or not we think orgasms are
important <#\>Can you imagine a sexual practice that was the
dominant sexual practice in which men did not have orgasms 
<#\>Can you imagine that happening <#\>I mean there's also a sexual
practice which is which is dangerous to women in other ways
meaning that they have to technologise their bodies in the
form of dangerous contraception <#\>It opens them to unwanted
chilbearing sexually transmitted diseases and so on <#\><{><[>It's an extraordinary sexual practice I would suggest</[> </X>
<$A> <#\><[>Enough enough enough</[></{> <O>laughter</O> <#\>You've opened it up I
think Sheila Jeffereys <#\>Let's get a response from some of
these younger people
<$D?>     <#\>Um I I I think that um this idea of doing away with
penetrative sex is the biggest fantasy of all<O>laughter</O> and I
think you really what you're doing here is denying difference 
<#\>I mean I think your position is a valid one within the kind of
pluralistic approach to sexuality but I think that you're
mistaking um areas of sexual fantasy areas of sexuality for
reality itself and that you're translating those relations of
power very literally <#\>And also if I could come back to the
point that you were making before about sexual images I think
it's a fundamental misreading of media images <#\>I think young
women today have grown up with television <#\>They've grown up
with the mass media and as a result we don't read those images
quite so literally</I>
