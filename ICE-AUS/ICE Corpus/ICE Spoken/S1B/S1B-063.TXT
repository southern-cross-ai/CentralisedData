<$A> <#\>Not to your knowledge
<$B> <#\>No
<$B> <#\><,> Wasn't it the position that uh <,> prior to the band
playing, <,> Ann Det was talking to the defendant, <,> Mister
Robinson
<$B> <#\>No she was standing right next to me <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>She's standing</[></{> right next to you <#\>Isn't it the
position that you came up <,> between <,> Mister Robinson <,>
and Ann Det <,> and forced your <,> play between the two of
them
<$B> <#\>No, there is no reason why I would <,> <#\>She was right
next to me
<$A> <#\>Is it the position that you then said <quote>I don't want you
talking to her</quote> or words of that effect
<$B> <#\>Not at all, no
<$A> <#\>Is it the position that Mister Robinson than said to you

syll</O> hullo to me first</quote> or words of that effect
<$B> <#\>No <,,>
<$A> <#\>You uh <,> said that your <,> brother was there <,> on
the evening <#\>Is he here today to give evidence
<$B> <#\>Uh <,> no

<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>And he's the one that you alleged
<$B> <#\>No, I alleged <,> Stephen Lane and Shaun <,> held him
back from from sh
<$A> <#\>Is Stephen Lane here to get evidence today
<$B> <#\>No Stephen is not here today
<$B> <#\>He's not here either
<$A> <#\>Do you live with your brother
<$B> <#\>Yes I do
<$A> <#\>You do <,,> <#\>And neither of those people are here
today
to give evidence
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>Do you know whether they gave statements to <,> the
police
<$B> <#\>No they didn't
<$A> <#\>They didn't give statements to the police
<$A> <#\>Did you tell the police on this evening with <,> what
had
happened
<$B> <#\>Yes I did <#\>I explained that two <,> friends <,>
pulled
the uhm <,> <O>2 syll</O>Michael away
<$A> <#\>Or isn't that the position <,> Mister Flynn that <,> you
headbutted the defendant first
<$B> <#\>Never, no
<$A> <#\>You placed your hands on his shoulders and you
headbutted
him
<$B> <#\>No, that's never <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>And he then retaliated and he hit you back
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>It didn't happen
<$B> <#\>No, it didn't happen
<$A> <#\>You said the uh defendant hit you once <,> on the left
<$B> <#\>That's right, yes
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>But you also had this injury above <,> the lip
as
well
<$B> <#\>No <#\>It wasn't above the lip <#\>It was on the lip <,>
on the
top part of the lip
<$A> <#\>On the top <{><[>part</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> on the top part there <#\>So, it could have been
caused from being pushed through the teeth
<$A> <#\>Oh
<$B> <#\>Well, unless he was wearing a ring <,> and that might
of
caught as well <#\>I don't know
<$A> <#\>Did you uh <#\>Where abouts were you standing on this
evening <,> prior to this incident
<$B> <#\>Prior to the when the band became <,> <{><[>came on</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>I was just walking through with Ann Det talking to a
friend
<$A> <#\>Right <,> <#\>And uh you, I believe the bar at Moby
Dicks
is at the back of the
<$B> <#\>Yes that's right
<$A> <#\>Right <#\><{><[>And the stages is</[> 
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> and the stage yet is the back to where
the
stage is, yes
<$A> <#\>Yes, that that's at the other end of the <,> the
building
as to where the <,> the stage is, right
<$B> <#\>Uhuh
<$A> <#\>And uh <,> was it crowded on this evening
<$B> <#\>Uh <,,> yeah, no more than usual
<$A> <#\>No more than usual <,> <#\>Right <,,> <#\>And uh you'd
say that
at no time was Ann Det ever talking to <,> to the defendant on
this evening
<$B> <#\>Not to my knowledge, no
<$A> <#\>Not to your knowledge <,> <#\>Well, were you with her
the
whole time, from the time you arrived
<$B> <#\>I could have gone to the toilet, something like that
<$A> <#\>Well, who moved <,> who moved in to uh to separate the
two of you after the this incident
<$B> <#\>Uh <,> <O>3 syll</O> were standing right next to me and I
fell
into <,> Steven Lane and then that's when when he pushed me
<,> and he bumped Stephen <,> <#\>Those two came in and pulled
him away
<$A> <#\>Mmm mmm <#\>Were there any other people involved
<$B> <#\>With <,> pulling Michael away
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>No there wasn't 
<$A> <#\>Nobody else
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\><,> Do you know Scott Tindel
<$B> <#\>Yeah, that's <,> yeah I know Scott, yeah <#\>He was at
the
front of the dance floor <,> and he <,> went over to grab
those two guys
<$A> <#\>Uhuh <#\>And do you know uh Robin Johnson, or Rob
Johnson
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>No <,,> <#\>I'll put it to you, <,> Mister Flynn, that
you
are the person that you headbutted the defendant first
<$B> <#\>No I didn't
<$A> <#\>You disagree with that <#\>I also put it to you <,> that
he
then hit you in  retaliation, because of <,> of your head but
<$C> <#\>I object to retaliation that word being used Your
Worship
it's conclusive
<$A> <#\>I've
<$D> <#\>It's not a wise word to use <,> <#\>Retaliation bears
no
resemblance to self defence
<$A> <#\>Self defence <#\>I'll withdraw that question, Your
Worship
<#\>I then put it that he struck you after you had <,> headbutted
him
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>I also put it to you that uh <,> after you'd been
separated <,> you than came back towards the defendant
<$B> <#\>No, no not at all
<$A> <#\>How tall are you, <,> Mister Flynn
<$B> <#\>Six foot
<$A> <#\>Six foot <,> <#\>You'd agree with me you're considerably
taller than <,> the defendant
<$B> <#\>Very much
<$A> <#\>Very much <,,> <#\>Had you spoken to uh Scott Tindel on
this
evening
<$B> <#\>No uh <,> I don't make a habit of talking to any of
those
guys
<$A> <#\>No you don't like them, do you
<$B> <#\>No I didn't say that <#\>I said I don't make a habit of
talking to them
<$A> <#\>Well I asked a question <#\>You don't like them <{><[>do you</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>I</[></{> object <#\>How is that relevant Your Worship
<$B> <#\>Well, Your Worship, goes to uh goes to <O>1 syll</O> in
relation to this matter
<$D> <#\>How can his regard to Mister Tindel go towards his
motives towards <{><[>the defendant</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>I'll</[></{> withdraw it Your Worship <#\>So you don't talk
to
them at all
<$B> <#\>No, <,> I didn't
<$A> <#\>Did you know them
<$B> <#\>I know Scott yes
<$A> <#\>Mmm <,,> <#\>Well you say that uh <#\>Well firstly I'd
<,> <#\>You
said that Mister Robinson allegedly nudged past you
<$B> <#\>That's right
<$A> <#\>Right <,> <#\>Well I put it to you at no time did he do
that
<$B> <#\>No he did <#\>Yes he did
<$A> <#\>I put it to you at no time did he approach you firstly
<,> and have a conversation with you <,> that you've <,> given
to the court
<$B> <#\>As he nudged past, he s he said words or he said that
and
<,> I told him to watch out
<$A> <#\>I also put it to you at no time did he push you again,
<,> with his open hands
<$B> <#\>Yes he did
<$A> <#\>Where was Ann Det during this uh <,,> this incident you
<,> described
<$B> <#\>She was on my right hand side
<$A> <#\>She was on your right hand side
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Michael was there, so I couldn't go between the
two
of them
<$A> <#\>So you couldn't have got in between the two of them
<$B> <#\>That's what he said
<$A> <#\>Well, were you facing the stage 
<$B> <#\>Yeah, we both were
<$A> <#\>You were both facing the stage <,> <#\>Where do you say
Mister Robinson came from
<$B> <#\>Behind me and then <O>1 syll</O> pushing to me on the side
<,>
and that was that
<$A> <#\>Alright <#\>So you say he came from behind and <,>
pushed
you on the left hand side
<$B> <#\>That's right
<$A> <#\>Who was beside you on the left hand side
<$B> <#\>I have no idea
<$A> <#\>No <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>he</[></{> cleared away or <,> pushed through them, I don't
know
<$A> <#\>Mmm <,,> <#\>And uh <,> you made the police <#\>Your
statement
to the police on the ninth of June of this year did you
<$B> <#\>That's right yes
<$B> <#\>And that's some three months after the incident
<$A> <#\>That's right yes
<$B> <#\>Right <#\>Have you discussed the matter with uhm <,>
Mister
Kelly, prior to making your statement
<$B> <#\>I had a <,> prior to Paul making the statement
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>Did he make his statement before or after you
<,>
<#\>Do you know
<$B> <#\>Yeah, he made his statement after me that night, yeah
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>But when you went back to the police station
and
made your official statement
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>That was typed out by the constable
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Had you discussed the matter with Paul Kelly prior to
that
<$B> <#\>We had talked about the night, yes, but <,,> I'd asked
him to go and speak to the <,> the constable <#\>She asked me to
go <,> see if he would give his statement
<$A> <#\>You asked him to go and give a statement, did you
<$B> <#\>She asked me, <,> Paul, if if I saw Paul to ask him to
come down to the station to give his statement
<$B> <#\>Oh, and you asked Paul to do that, did you
<$B> <#\>No, I don't think I did, I think <,> the constable spoke
to him before I did
<$A> <#\>So, after you had this uh <,> this first incident,
incident, where he pushed passed to you, <,> he was dragged
away than, <,> do you say by <,> Mister Lane and your brother
<#\>Is that the case
<$B> <#\><O>1 syll</O> yes
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>And where was he taken from there
<$B> <#\>To about <,> three meters a across on the left hand side
<$A> <#\>Across on the left hand side
<$B> <#\>If I'm looking at the <,> the stage he was dragged <,>
back and over
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>And uh where was Mister Lane <,> and your
brother
at that time
<$B> <#\>Holding him over there
<$A> <#\>No, sorry I'll withdraw that <#\>When you say you, he
brushed past you, where abouts were they at that time <,>
Mister Lane and Mister
<$B> <#\>I don't know <#\>I didn't know they were they were next
to
me <#\>I had no idea that they were next to me
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>I hadn't gone there with them
<$A> <#\>Right <,> <#\>And <,> you say as soon as he brushed past
you, Mister Lane and your brother then grabbed him
<$B> <#\>No, I didn't say that <#\>I said <,> after he <,> had
words
to say and then pushed me and it looked like he was going to
shape to start hitting me they grabbed him
<$A> <#\>O k <,> and what happened when he pushed you 
<$B> <#\>I stumbled back <{><[>about two</[> two steps yeah
<$A> <#\><[>You stumbled back</[></{>
     <#\>You stumbled back two steps <,,> <#\>And is that the
time you say that your brother and Mr Lane then intervened and
moved him away <,></I>
