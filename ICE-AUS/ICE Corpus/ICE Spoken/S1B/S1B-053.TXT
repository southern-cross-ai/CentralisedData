<S1B-053>   <2041> 
<I><$A>   <#\>But there's one thing that I'm ah a little bit
hesitant about Madam Acting Chair<,> is the uh racing development
fund uh<,> clubs that benefit from that that  
uh<,> distribution and uh with the uh whether  
you have ten percent growth or ten percent uh discount of your
T-A-B funding the onus is wholly and solely on the minister to
see whether or not we have funding for the clubs that are not T-
A-B funded<,> and uh what I say here<,> this is in lef entirely   Madam Acting Chair<,> to the discretion of
the minister to see whether these clubs are ongoing or not<,> and
no doubt you're well aware that the uh racing in the west at this
current time and as we've heard the debate just prior to this
one<,> in relation to drought<,> well the racing has been
affected<,> accordingly and uh I think I I  
the Honourable member for <@>constituencyname1</@> just made
mention of what a valuable industry racing is to Queensland and
I just conferred with my colleague here the member for
<@>constituencyname2</@> <,> it's around about the fourth most
important industry in this state and it's absolutely paramount
that racing in the bush as well as racing in the city and the metropolitan areas up and down or the provincial areas
up and down the coast   be uh<,> <O>clears throat</O>
patronised by not only the people that go to the races but by
governments and by the uh principal clubs and other people that
do uh patronise racing <#\>But the one thing that I do want to
make reference of here tonight<,> is not so much the bookmakers
but to the T-A-B<,> and when I say the T-A-B and no doubt
minister you're well aware<,> of the ah<,> dilemma facing some
of the people in the west at the moment namely at Alpha<,>
Springsure and Aramac<,> where those little small T-A-Bs will be
closed and will be ah<,> incorporated into the PubTAB concept
<#\>I know in the bigger centres that the PubTAB concept works
and it works well<,> and this something in these little small
centres that've been accustomed to for a long time <#\>We have
a lot of elderly people in those centres<,> that are not
accustomed to going into hotels<,> and that's something I ask you
minister and I know that it's that it is   ah 
<$B> <&>from Hansard transcript.  Not audible on tape</&>
<O>Rubbish</O> 
<$A> <#\>I heard somebody say rubbish over there <#\>I don't know
<{><[>where it came</[>
<$C> <#\><[>You're a bit shy yourself</[></{> aren't you
<$A> <#\>You're what sorry
<$C> <#\>You're a bit shy yourself sometimes <{><[>aren't
you</[>
<$A> <#\><[>No I'm</[></{> a I am a   shy
person <{1><[1>but</[1> but   I'll tell you
when it comes to sticking up for the people in my electorate
Madam Acting Speaker I'll tell you I'll fight hammer and tong for
them <#\>And that's the instance that we're talking about here
now<,> with the people in those little centres<,> like your
Alphas<,> and your Springsures<,> and your Aramacs<,> <#\>They
are suffering at this point of time<,> one of the worst droughts
as you've been told here tonight<,> in white man's history and
it's something that we've got to show a little bit of
consideration for and a little bit of compassion for <#\>You over
there the member for <@>constituencyname3</@> you're an old
bushie yourself <{2><[2><,></[2><,> but you don't show any compassion
at all<,,> <#\>But however getting back to this racing er er and
betting amendment uh bill Madam Acting Speaker <{3><[3><,></[3><,,> the
point I wanna make<,> is that these people are just as important
to be entitled to their bet on Saturday as the blokes on the big
metropolitan courses or the ah people who ah have access to your
big metropolitan T-A-Bs<,> and you make reference to the
bookmakers <#\>Bookmakers are a very important part of western
racing <#\>When I think back as a child I think of the great
Charlie Motsam <#\>He was a legend in western bookmaking and
probably one of the le legends   of the west
as far as racing goes and you can go back to Charleville and
you've got Rod Kinnerman <#\>You can go to the central west
<#\>You got ah Wacka Jackson and Popeye Saunders all these fellas 
and they are great racing identities <#\>And they are the
colourful figures Madam Acting Speaker that keep racing going in
these centres and they are a part of<,> the attraction of racing
is your bookmakers that come there and I think that ah western
racing is alive and well<,> provided they are given<,> the
service that they need to keep that racing going <#\>And that is
government support <#\>And I heard a while ago as I said the
Honourable Member for <@>constituencyname1</@> made reference
to<,> what a valuable industry it is in this state<,> <#\>I just
hope and pray that the ah the ah   smaller
clubs in the bush and I talk again Ma Sp ah minister   about the racing development fund<,> that
you will not just pay <w>'em</w> lip service and that they'll
continue<,> to progress<,> and provide the social outings that
they have done for a hundred years or more <#\>You mentioned this
afternoon ah mister ah minister  <,> in answer
to a question here<,> about the forty eight per cent lift<,> in
the Q-T-T-C<,> in its ah<,> in its   centres
throughout the state <#\>That's very good but at the same time
and you mentioned the Matilda Highway concept<,> and you might
think I'm getting away from racing here but we're touching on
something<,> that is relevant to the area in tourism and it
brings people not only into the west to see different ah ah
tourist attractions but it brings them to racing and other venues
that we do have there<,> and the point I do want to make<,> is
that the Matilda Highway concept <#\>We've seen this government
now <#\>This is another service you've taken away and I wanna
make a point of it<,> is the Midlander service from <@>townname2</@> to Long <@>Townname1</@>    to
<@>Townname2</@> <#\>As from November this year that service will
be terminated<,> and it is something that the people of
<@>Townname2</@> 've been sold out <#\>Another big centre and
there's a lot of good solid racing people there <#\>That is one
of their tourist attractions <#\>You've got the combo
waterhole<,> and here we are we're trying to promote tourism<,>
we're trying to promote all aspects of<,> what you the minister
over here Mr <@>Surname1</@> represents and here we are<,> these
people've been sold out <#\>Sixty eight per cent of the people
that utilise that facility that Midlander service to the central
west are aged people<,> people who have paid their taxes and
di done   their honest day's work <#\>Now
they've been penalised because that service will be terminated
<#\>I do congratulate the government<,> on the new concept of the
spirit of the outback<,> but at the same time Madam Acting
Speaker this new concept that'll get into <@>Townname1</@> of a
night time <#\>It'll depart of a morning and these people<,> will
have to wait for two or three days before they can see get   the other train out   
<$E> <&>printed in Hansard but not audible on tape</&> <O>Oh come
on</O>
<$A> <#\>This is the truth <#\>Ah the member for
<@>constituencyname4</@> you I'll   take your
interjection <#\>If you would've went to <@>Townname2</@> a
couple of weeks about a month ago  <,> when the
ah when   the ah<,> the   people
from the Queensland rail came out there and told the people of
the central west<,> exactly what they were in for<,> I'll tell
you<,> you would've been on my side at that time<,,> because this
government has sold those people out <#\>But at the same time<,>
we'll go back to racing <#\>I urge you minister to make sure you
keep your eye on<,> what ha is happening   in
racing in the cental west <#\>Make sure that those ah<,> those   smaller clubs aren't left to perish and
dwindle to the<,> be   a part of the past
<#\>As I said I congratulate you on the great concept of that that   triad meeting that we've just wi witnessed   out there and I just hope and pray
that ah<,> we're not gonna just see three big meetings in the
west every year<,> with ah prob'ly four with <@>townname4</@> but
at the same time the other smaller centres like your
<@>townname5</@> s and <@>townname6</@> s and<,> all those other
smaller centres are just as important <#\>Thank you Madam Acting
Speaker
<$?> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>
<$D> <#\><[2>Order</[2></{2> 
<$?> <#\><[3>Here here</[3></{3> 
<$D> <#\>Order <#\>Then member for <@>constituencyname5</@> 
<$?> <#\>Here here
<$F> <#\>Thank you Madam Deputy Speaker <#\>It gives me pleasure
to speak in support<,> of the Racing and Betting Amendment Bill
nineteen ninety two <#\>The Queensland Government recognises that
illegal bookmaking is synonymous with organised crime<,> and
incurs unacceptable cost to legitimate punters<,> bookmakers and
the community as a whole <#\>The cost of illegal bookmaking to
Queensland has been great <#\>The activities of illegal
bookmakers cost the T-A-B in Queensland a large amount of
money<,> and of course deprives the Queensland people<,> through
reducing the ah potential amount of state consolidated revenue
through lost betting turnover tax <#\>In this sense illegal
bookmaking is a crime which effectively robs the public purse
<#\>In the past too many people in Queensland have taken the
attitude that illegal bookmakers are harmless larrikins that do
not necessarily cause much damage <#\>That attitude was echoed
in the words of the convicted illegal bookmaker Terry Page who
said while he was walking away from the court in November last
year and I quote <quote> S-P bookmaking isn't really that bad is
it</quote> unquote <#\>In an attempt to answer Mr Page's
rhetorical question<,> I would like to reaffirm the government's
view that illegal bookmark making   is a
corrupting and costly crime against our community <#\>There is
no such thing<,> as a larrikin small S-P bookie <#\>Even small
illegal bookmakers turn over a large amount of bets and cannot
be perceived as insignificant <#\>Illegal bookmaking
encourages<,> and falls within the cash flow and money laundering
network of organised crime and drug trafficking <#\>It is a
problem that can only be put to an end by the government taking
a more positive and harsh stance <#\>This bill represents such
a stance <#\>The problem that we now face is finding an effective
method of deterring the incidence of illegal bookmaking <#\>This
bill provides effective penalties for those found guilty of
conducting illegal bookmaking <#\>For too long the lack of
effective and decisive penalties for such transgressions of the
law has led to many illegal bookmakers becoming masterful at
avoiding the full brunt<,> and intent of the penalties imposed
upon them <#\>This bill creates a lot more uncertainty in the
world of an illegal bookmaker <#\>Currently a convicted illegal
bookmaker can simply avoid paying a fine <#\>When action is taken
by the crown to recover the fine as a civil<,> civil   debt<,> illegal bookmakers have
traditionally engineered their personal records and affairs to
show that they have very few<,> or no assets which can be se seized   in lieu of the fine<,> <#\>Many illegal
bookmakers have flaunted the system<,> and publicly admitted that
they structure their financial affairs in a deceptive way in
order to avoid fines <#\>Cash which is the illegal bookmaker's
largest asset can be easily transferred and not disclosed to the
court <#\>The Racing and Betting Amendment Bill nineteen ninety-
two provides default jail terms for illegal bookmakers who have
ignored outstanding fines <#\>It also makes provision for jail
terms as an alternative to a fine at the time of sentencing for
a second or subsequent offence <#\>A provision for default jail
terms is designed to take away any incentive convicted illegal
bookmakers may have to avoid fines by restructuring their
financial affairs <#\>Significantly the magnitude of the offence
will be reflected in the severity of the sentence under the
amended Racing and Betting Act <#\>The most important issue<,>
in this instance is that a scale of penalty<,> exists which
cannot be avoided by the convicted illegal bookmaker <#\>If they
choose to avoid the fine they face a jail term <#\>I believe this
discourages the main impetus behind repeatedly committing such
a crime <#\>Repeat offenders must see a monetary advantage in
continuing to break the law <#\>It would not be unreasonable to
say that the more money illegally attained the harsher the
penalty should be <#\>This has always been the case however the
cunning illegal bookmaker<,> can earn as much as possible<,>
incurn incur   a fine indexed to the amount
illegally earned<,> avoid the fine<,> and finally provide few or
no substantial assets in place of the fine<,> and so effectively
avoid the penalty imposed by the court<,></I>
