<S1B-023> <2009>
<I><$A> <#\>Let's meet our panel <#\>To the right<,> Rex the moose
Mossop<,> Dr Louise Burke and Timberlina Morrisey
<O>applause</O> <#\>And to my left in no particular order are
Debbie Skull of Rust Spillane<,> Crackers Keenan and Lex the
swine Marinos <O>applause</O> <#\>Now Tim you're under the burden
of that stupid nickname so I'll ask you first <#\>Does the media
expect too much of our sports stars<,,>
<$B> <#\>Ah I think they do <#\>Ah obviously a sports star you know
they expect to win themselves otherwise they<,> you know they
wouldn't be playing <#\>You have to have that sort of motivation
but<,> I think you know often<,> you know the media tend to
blow it out of proportion you know <#\>We really only like
winners <#\>We don't pay too much time<,> you know to losers that
sort of stuff so<,,> you know we try to<,> really get on the
band wagon<,> and push the winners<,> I think over the top and
you know the coverage of the Olympics so far is<,> you know
has been pretty typical <#\>Our<,> our medal hopes are fairly
limited<,> compared to some ah of the<,> you know the
supernations like the USA you know so<,> poor people like
Kieran Perkins and that you know<,> that there's almost<,> you
know the weight of Australia is on their<,> you know on his
shoulders<,> you know alone and I think<,> it's you know it's
going a little bit over the top
<$A> <#\>I can see the headlines tomorrow <#\>Morrisey slams
media<,>
<$B> <#\>So be it
<$C> <#\>What if he drowns at the deep end
<$A> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>He's not a very good</[></{> swimmer
<$C> <#\>What happens if he drowns at the deep end <#\>What happens
then
<$A> <#\>Well what does happen then<,>
<$C> <#\>Well they don't like him any more do they
<O>laughter</O> <#\>That's <{><[>what I'm worried about</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah but<,> but</[></{> they can replay it endlessly
<{><[><O>inaudlble</O></[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Crackers</[></{> Crackers <#\>We've thrown you in in the deepend
giving you a a role in this program and you <{><[>haven't
drowned</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Oh will you be</[></{> quiet<,> I'm sick of you <#\>We we had a
talk about you tonight Rex and myself <O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Oh the boys<,> the boys ganging up <#\>So Crackers 
<$D> <#\>It's alright<,> <#\>I can take 'em both on <#\>No problem
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Aside aside from malice and spite what're your feelings
on this issue
<$C> <#\>They build 'em up too much and then they just drop 'em
and ah<,> when they're second best we just kick 'em in the
guts like poor old <#\>Remember<,> re remember Warick Cappa
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>No<,> no
<$C> <#\>Well that's what I mean you know <#\>He kicked a hundred
goals <{><[>and then</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Oh he was</[></{> they guy who did the <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Yeah but the</[></{> Melbourne media spent all their time
kicking him in the guts not the Sydney media and then he
kicked himself in the guts by going up to<,> Brisbane
<$C> <#\>Yeah but he just they built him up to be a superstar
which he wasn't <#\>That's what's wrong and I really believe it
<#\><{><[>A bit like Timberlina</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>But you just said he kicked</[></{> a hundred goals
<$C> <#\>Yeah but you know he really wasn't a gun and they built
him up to be a gun
<$D> <#\>He was the closest thing we had mate <#\>We had to make do
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\><{><[>That's right</[> I mean all the guns we had we put to our
own head
<$C> <#\><[>Ah <O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
     <#\>But you know they<,,> they just it's<,,> they just go on
too much
<$A> <#\>Well Debbie what's your<,> what's your feeling<,>
<$D> <#\>I think sometimes the ah<,> sports stars expect a bit too
much of the media <#\>They want the publicity when things are
going well for them and then they don't<,> then they <{1><[1>want
you</[1> to leave them alone <#\><{2><[2>They they</[2> need the publicity
because they need the sponsers and as soon as they're all set
up<,> they they want you to <{3><[3>leave 'em alone</[3> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yes</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>That's a good point</[2></{2> 
<$E> <#\><[3>I mean how is it</[3></{3> 
<$A> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$D> <#\><[>The only thing</[></{> <,> the only thing that I will say is
that I think the media the one thing the media expects too
much from sports stars is scandal <#\>If they don't get enough
they get really irritated and that<,> that's one part of <{><[>the media I don't like</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>That's true <#\>Tim<,> got any</[></{> <,> <#\>Personal <{><[>scandal</[> 
<#\>Anything
<$D> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
<$A> <#\><{><[>Ever kicked a dog</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Any goss <#\>Come on</[> </{>
<$A> <#\>Come on
<$B> <#\>Any goss<,>
<$A> <#\>Oh we'll make some up later that's alright <#\>Lex
<$E> <#\>Well it depends what you expect from them <#\>If you expect
honesty<,> and decency<,> and clean living<,> and healthy
diet<,> then yes <#\>We expect too much from them
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>So are you suggesting our athletes are<,> are are
grubby slobs
<$D> <#\><{><[>But the media don't give a stuff</[> 
<$E> <#\><[>Are scumbags</[></{> basically
<$A> <#\>Are they <#\><{><[>All of them</[> <,> <#\>Are you prepared to say that
to Timberlina's face
<$E> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
     <#\>From this distance <#\>Yes <O>laughter</O> <#\>You bet
<$D> <#\>Hey listen <#\>You're absolutely wrong because if anything's
clean<,> and articulate and<,> and ah healthy and good<,> the
media doesn't wanna know about it
<$C> <#\>You're the media <#\>You don't bother worry <{><[>about that</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Yeah but the med</[></{> the media generally doesn't want
anything that's wholesome and that<,,> <#\><{><[>They want the
scandal <#\>They want the dirt</[> <#\>They want the scuttlebut
<$A> <#\><[>I don't know</[></{> 
     <#\>What about you Rex <#\>You're very quiet here <#\><{><[>I'm</[> 
<$F> <#\><[>Oh</[></{> I'm getting a turn am I
<$D> <#\>Oh look oh <#\>Oh Rex <#\>He doesn't get <{><[>asked first</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>No <#\>Come on</[></{> <#\>In fairness
<$D> <#\>He's <{><[>sulking <O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>No no <#\>In fairness</[></{> <#\>Your time's up Rex <#\>Dr Burke what
do you think <O>laughter</O>
<$G> <#\>No <{><[>I</[> 
<$E> <#\><[>You killed</[></{> 'em then Rex
<$F> <#\>I know I did
<$A> <#\>Yes Dr Burke
<$G> <#\>I I agree with Debbie <#\>I think that the media goes after
the scandal aspect and that just looking back to the Olympics
so far we've heard so much about the female swimmers and what
they've<,> taken off or not taken off<,,> and we haven't heard
anything <{><[>about</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Who're they</[></{> <#\>What was the name
<$G> <#\>Well<,> I was there and <{><[>I didn't think anything of it</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Well<,> how many races have they</[></{> won
<$E> <#\>Have you got any photos<,>
<$C> <#\>If you want goodness you go to church <O>laughter</O>
<$E> <#\>No <#\>Hang on <#\>What're you saying <#\>Are you saying that the
Richard Lowe thing didn't happen <#\>It was all a media beat up
<$A> <#\>Well it didn't happen <#\>The evidence was inconclusive
<$F> <#\>How was it inconclusive
<$A> <#\>It was inconclusive because they didn't actually have a
micorphone on them at the time to hear them saying <quote> I'll
get you you little Aussie bastard</quote> <{><[>as he went to</[> 
<$?><#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> <O>audience laughs</O>
<$A> <#\>What's your feeling Rex<,>
<$F> <#\>I get offended by the media because they build people up
that aren't up there er that don't have the great ability
<#\>They're we always have young cricketers come on <#\><quote> Oh he's
gonna be another Don Bradman</quote> <#\>This they did to Ian Craig
the<,> young eighteen year old cricketer that that eventually
captained Australia<,> but he was never gonna be a Don
Bradman <#\>They did it to Norman O'Neil <#\>He was gonna be another
Don Bradman<,,> and then we've had footballers <#\>We've got
ah<,,> a number of footballers going around that they say<quote> oh
he's<,,> he's as good as Reg Gaznier ever was this<,> <{><[>this</[> 
bloke</quote> but he hasn't got the ability
<$A> <#\><[>Rex</[></{> 
     <#\>Rex<,> psst
<$F> <#\>Yeah<,,>
<$A> <#\><O>whispering</O> Talk nineteen nineties <O>laughter</O>
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>He did <#\>It's just nobody knows who they are <#\>Right<,>
acutally we do <#\>Although<,> Rose Holt of New South Wales wrote
in to sort of make the point that you're making only far more
eloquently which is she says <O>Flaughs</O><quote> too bloody right
the media does expect too much of our sports stars</quote> and she
gave two examples <#\>Alan Border<,> this summer <#\>One minute he
was Captain Courageous <#\>The next he was AB the hopeless
joke<,> and<,,> when Australia lost the second rugby league
test after having won the first and then<,> going on to win
the third<,> the<,,> six inch high headline was<,><quote> Shamed</quote>
<#\>Now<,> does the media tear down the stars<,> it puts up
<$F> <#\>Basically <{><[>the media</[> are all scumbags <O>laughter</O>
<$C> <#\><[>Of course</[></{> 
<$D> <#\>Oh 'cos you don't <{><[>because you don't have</[> a gig any
more basically that is
<$F> <#\><[>They're all scumbags</[></{> 
     <#\>What is what's that what's that<,> supposed to mean <#\>I
don't <{><[>have a gig</[> any more
<$D> <#\><[>A gig</[></{> 
     <#\>Oh sorry <{><[>that's nineties talk</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>That that that is</[> 
<$F> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> <O>laughter</O> It's all
<O>inaudible</O> talk <#\>What d'you mean by that <#\><{><[>Border's
just</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>That is not</[></{> true <#\>Rex <{><[><,></[> <#\>Rex does have a gig and
as a matter of fact Rex<,,> I was asked to pass this letter on
to you <#\>It came<,,> and I'm not joking care of channel nine
via channel seven <O>laughter</O> via to us here at the ABC 
<$F> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
     <#\>No mention of channel ten
<$A> <#\>No <#\>Prob <{><[>it could be from</[> channel ten
<$D> <#\><[>Channel ten</[></{> 
     <#\>Channel ten put not known at this address
<O>laughter</O>
<$F> <#\>Yeah <#\>You're right <#\>They<,> that'd be right <#\><{><[>I'll have
to read it and see what it's all about</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>We put not know in this decade</[></{> <O>laughter</O> <#\>What
<{><[><,> what about</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>It might be a love</[></{> letter
<$A> <#\>Dr Burke<,> I should stop calling you that should <#\>I
should just call you Dr and be more<,> <{><[>informal</[> 
<$E> <#\><[>Lou <#\>Loulou</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Burkie</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Louie Louie <#\>You've<,> just come back from Barcelona
where<,> you've been<,,> close to the athletes <#\>Do they
feel<,,> pressured
<$G> <#\>They do feel pressured and I think they feel a bit mus
misunderstood<,> that there are so many things that they do
that<,,> they're not allowed to express and that the media
doesn't make it<,> a great job of trying to explain to the
world what it's like to be a swimmer or a gymnast or whatever
it is
<$A> <#\><{1><[1>Yeah</[1> but is that also because<,,> swimmers and
gymnasts<,,> are used to only talking in cliches that they
think the media will like <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>So they say<quote> oh it's tough</quote>
and so on
<$?> <#\><[1>Yeah but</[1></{1> 
<$G> <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
<$A> <#\>They don't actually express it themsleves
<$G> <#\>I don't know <#\>I think sometimes the media goes to them
with the story <#\>You know the story might be that you you're
too poor to go to the Olympic Games or that you're the great
white hope or whatever it is <#\>There's only three or four
different<,> scenarios that the media wants to portray and
it's and the athlete just has to fit into that role
<$C> <#\>Timberlina<,> a good slagging<,> does that help you<,>
play better <#\>You know when some one really bags you because
you've been dragged and all that does it helps you get going
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>I I I think it does we well in our last game in in
the NBL we played Illawara Hawks down in<,,> down in
Woollongong <#\>The we
<$C> <#\>Tell me about it son <O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>The week be<,,> <{1><[1>the week be the week</[1> before we lost to
them at home and it like<,> in their local papers down there
they had one of their journalists saying after our loss to
Illawarah at home that we<,> tore apart our locker room and
all that sorta stuff<,> <#\>He just made up scandal just to try
and create a story <#\>It was just a media beat up <#\><{2><[2>We read that sort of stuff so</[2> 
<$C> <#\><[1>I saw that game</[1></{1> 
<$F> <#\><[2>That's what I say <#\>They're</[2></{2> all scumbags
<$A> <#\>In fact <#\>No no 
<$E> <#\>Well why do you read 'em then
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,,>
<$E> <#\>Ah to
<$C> <#\>Nothing else to do
<$B> <#\>It's a good point <#\><{><[>I mean</[> 
<$D> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$F> <#\><[>There's</[> </{>a number of very very good sportsmen that
don't have anything to do with reading newspapers
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$E> <#\><[>No but but Tim</[></{> just said he did
<$B> <#\>It's it's very hard to keep away from it <{1><[1>because if even if</[1> you don't read it everyone's coming up to you saying oh did you hear about this and did you hear about that <#\>It's very hard to isolate yourself <{2><[2>from</[2> 
<$C> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>
<$A> <#\><[2>But we all know</[2> 
<$D> <#\><[2>Yeah but you</[2></{2> do need<,> but but I mean when the Kings
first started out you were absolutely crying out to the media
<quote> give us some coverage <#\>Give us some coverage</quote> so I mean<,>
you can't have it both ways <#\>You can't have it<,,> the
publicity when you feel like it and not the publicity when you
don't feel like it
<$C> <#\>But he wants honesty though <{><[>don't you</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Because</[></{> basketball wouldn't've got anywhere if the
media didn't get eventually get behind it <#\>They took their
time but they did</I>
