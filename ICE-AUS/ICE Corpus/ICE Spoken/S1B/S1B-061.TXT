<S1B-061> <2004>
<I><$A> <#\>When when was it that<,> ah
you made the<,> decision that you yourself would go to<,,> to the Duseldorf conference in
October<,,> 
<$B> <#\>About the end<,,> of September when Mr
<@>surnameM1</@> indicated that he was not available to go
down to<,> Spain <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Would you would you disagree if I
put to you about the fifth of October<,>
<$B> <#\>I would think it would probably be about the twenty
ninth of September sometime like that but I couldn't be sure
<$A> <#\>All right then um <#\>On the thirtieth of September
you met with Mr <@>surnameM2</@> in London didn't you?
<$B> <#\>Yes yes
<$A> <#\>And the<,,> th there was some some discussion<,> relevant to ah<,,>
compensation claims ah following the Premier's six month
termination of your office
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Um and<,,>
<$Z> <X><#\>That was the eighth</X>
<$A> <#\>The thirtieth
<$Z> <X><#\>Thirtieth</X>
<$A> <#\>The thirtieth of September<,,> and when was it you
saw Mr <@>surnameM3</@> in London
<$B> <#\>On Sunday afternoon at three o'clock <#\>We had a
very late lunch<,> on the twenty seventh <#\>Twenty seventh
with my wife
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>Now<,,> I think it's ah common ground is it
not that<,,> at that meeting there was no discussion about
travel
<$B> <#\>No<,,> <#\>It is not the case <#\>There was a general
mention about need for the transfer of powers and I was told
to refer that to Dr <@>surnameM2</@> when it came up
<$A> <#\>All right<,,> and when you saw Dr <@>surnameM2</@> on
the thirtieth of September did you raise with him any er
specific or general travel plans
<$B> <#\>General travel plans in terms of the transfer<,> of
management and administration and also making sure that the
staff were in fact <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>And ah no particular member of staff was mentioned<,>
<$B> <#\>What do you mean
<$A> <#\>You didn't say <quote>I have in mind<,> sending X
on a on a particular trip</quote> 
<$B> <#\>No no <#\>I did mention the fact that we divided as
he knew or should have known<,> Europe into those two areas
<$A> <#\>And as far as your own travel was concerned ah there
was no particular<,> proposed trip that was discussed with Dr
<@>surnameM2</@> on the thirtieth of September was there
<$B> <#\>No particular was mentioned<,>
<$A> <#\>Then<,> ah I<,> would suggest to you that it was
following that that on the fifth of October in particular that
the bookings were made ah in relation to ah travel of yourself
and Mr <@>surnameM4</@> to Nice <#\>Would you care to have a
look at um uh<,,> 
<$B> <#\>If you say so I will accept that <#\>If you say there
is a page <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Perhaps if you go to page twenty one of exhibit nine
you'll see a<,,> file note<,,> <#\>I think I
think it'd be a note of ah <@>forenameF5</@> um
<@>surnameF5</@> <#\>Perhaps you might indicate if you<,>
agree or disagree with that<,,> 
<$Z> <X><#\>This is typed by an intelligent cockroach<,> called
Archie</X>
<$B> <#\>Um<,,> what are you asking me
<$A> <#\>Well firstly did you do you know 
whose note that is <#\>Does the fact that<,> small type has
been used for a g and i indicate a different style of
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[>I don't</[></{> know <#\>I couldn't say<,,> 
<$A> <#\>Ah so<,> we're looking at that document and document
number twenty two <#\>Would you accept that the bookings for
yourself and Mr <@>surnameM4</@> to travel to Nice were made
on the fifth of October
<$B> <#\>That they were made on the fifth of October as set
out here <{><[><,></[><,> on this document um <#\>I wouldn't argue
if that's<,> what the other evidence supports <#\>I have no
reason <#\>But the actual day of determining when we'd go is a
different matter
<$A> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>All right <#\>Um<,,> he what what cl what class of airline ah travel was used if you
can recollect for yourself and Mr <@>surnameM4</@> to go 
sorry Mr <@>surnameM4</@> to go to Nice
<$B> <#\>Oh I wouldn't know <#\>You'd have to ask the office
<#\>They did the booking
<$A> <#\>From time to time bookings would be changed at fairly
short notice<,> would they not with respect to um air travel
<$B> <#\>It could be <#\>Yes<,,> 
<$A> <#\>You remember having having a
discussion<,> with Ms <@>surnameF6</@> about<,> the<,,>
question of the application of the information bulletin to her
and other members of the staff at the London office
<$B> <#\>No<,> never<,,> 
<$A> <#\>Are you saying that you don't remember it or do you
deny it occurred
<$B> <#\>I deny that it occurred <#\>It never occurred
<$A> <#\>Right<,,> right<,,> <#\>Would you go to the document
page 18 please<,,> <#\>Right <#\>Now I draw to your attention
that it is an unsigned document <#\>I do want to suggest to
you that Ms <@>surnameF6</@> brought this document to you for
your signature<,,> and that<,> ah you ah told her in effect<,>
no <#\>It wasn't necessary for her to send it to Dr
<@>surnameM2</@> <,> and that you would sign the document which
is at page twenty which does bear your signature<,,> 
<$C> <#\>I object to that <&>pause while C has discussion with
D</&>
<$C> <#\>I withdraw the objection<,,>
<$A> <#\>So thanks um<,,> <#\>What I'm suggesting to you is
that<,> she came in um with the facsimile at pages eighteen or
nineteen ah<,,> asked you to to sign it<,>
so that she could send it on to Dr <@>surnameM2</@> <,,> and ou
said <quote>no <#\>That was not<,,> ah necessary</quote> and
that<,,> what you did sign was the document at page twenty<,,>
<$B> <#\>That I may have signed the document at page twenty is
right but the rest of it is wrong
<$Z> <X><#\>Um so do you mean she never brought<,> the document
<{><[>at</[> at page eighteen to you <#\>When did you first
see it</X>
<$B> <#\><[>No</[></{> 
  <#\>Um when<,> information was given to us at this end
<$A> <#\>You mean in recent weeks
<$B> <#\>Mmm yes<,,> 
<$A> <#\>Ah do you remember<,> ever signing a document similar
to page twenty on any other occasion<,> than the the occasion ah referred to in page twenty
<$B> <#\>Oh I could have <#\>I don't really know
<$A> <#\>I want to suggest to you<,> that you didn't and that
this is<,> a unique document<,,> in which there is written
approval by you for um<,> for a
particular travel venture by a member of staff
<$B> <#\>If you say it is unique and I have signed no others I
will accept that<,>
<$A> <#\>Do you have any actual recollection of the
circumstances in which you did sign that document<,>
<$B> <#\>No not really<,,> <#\>I just know that I did speak to
<@>fullnameF6</@> about making sure that she was in touch with
ah the Austrade office in particular and the chambers in
Germany just to make sure that we were meeting their
requirements and assisting where we could
<$A> <#\>Could you go please to page twenty four which is your
fax to ah Dr <@>surnameM2</@> of the twelfth of October
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,>
<$A> <#\>Um<,,> um I think<,> you've already said that ah you
were in Rome when you learnt that the letter dated seventeenth
of September<,> had arrived in London I think on the ninth of
October <#\>You recollect that do you
<$B> <#\>It arrived on the ninth been opened on the twelfth
and conveyed to me by phone that day
<$A> <#\>And you you <,> dictated from Rome
to London the fax which was sent out on the twelfth of October
page twenty four
<$B> <#\>I dictated the fax<,> from London to Sydney
<$A> <#\>Then how did it come to bear your signature when you
were in ah <{><[>Rome</[>
<$B> <#\><[>I approved</[></{> the signature with
<@>firstnameF5</@> <,> for it to be attached and sent
immediately
<$A> <#\>What you approved her use of a rubber stamp with your
signature
<$B> <#\>Two stamps that were held in the safe by her and she
was the only one with the power to use it when I gave her that
power
<$A> <#\>And<,> um<,,> the<,,> second sentence of this fax<,>
stating <quote>I am completing my trips into Europe in order
to set up and complete the networks I have been
arranging</quote> was an indication by you that you intended
to travel ah into Europe<,> ah regardless of whether or not
you got permission
<$B> <#\>Of course it doesn't
<$A> <#\>Well by the twelfth you knew ah of the terms of the
letter of the seventeenth of September didn't you
<$B> <#\>The twelfth in the middle of the day in Rome when I
was in Rome in Europe
<$A> <#\>You were in Europe <#\>So are you suggesting that
because you had got to Europe ah you didn't need any
permission to go anywhere within Europe
<$B> <#\>I wasn't aware until that point that there was any
permission required and even then I questioned what it meant
<$A> <#\>Well I accepting that ah you were not you were not aware until the
twelfth on the twelfth you were aware of the terms of the
letter which is at page seventeen of the bundle 
<$B> <#\>Seventeen seventeen<,,> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Now<,,> ah are you saying that because you were in
Rome when you first learnt about that letter<,> you were at
liberty to travel anywhere within Europe<,,> ah without
complying with the requests in that letter
<$B> <#\>I think the fact that I sent a pertinent fax
immediately down asking to describe what that meant in
terms<,> of my meeting with the Premier with the me
sorry Minister and Dr <@>surnameM2</@> who
neither of them mentioned this to me<,> and when I mentioned
to them that I was going to have to travel in order to make
sure that the transfer took place properly effectively and
orderly<,> I wanted to know what this now meant<,> 
<$A> <#\>Then the the travelling in Nice
and Duseldorf wasn't wasn't part of the
the transitional<,> ah work <O>inaudible</O> <{><[>was it</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Oh yes</[></{> <#\>There was a lot of
transitional work there which should be done<,> and was being
done that had been constantly being done <#\>You know that<,>
from the facts and requirements that were placed upon me
<$A> <#\>But initially you'd planned to send<,>
<@>fullnameF6</@> alone<,> to Duseldorf hadn't you
<$B> <#\>I hadn't<,> in in the initial
stages when we were asked in Madrid<,> to go to this
conference by Mr <@>surnameM7</@> and ah<,> one other Mr
<@>surnameM8</@> I think it was who was up there<,> that we
should go there and support this conference in Germany ah
<#\>I had then determined that I would go up but after that
time Mr <@>surnameM1</@> arrived in London and talked of his
need to go to Spain <#\>So I said <quote>we will send
<@>fullnameF6</@> </quote> who was the person responsible for
that area but if there were any reason that I could get there
I would be there
<$A> <#\>But you didn't have to go did you<,,> <#\>You didn't
have to go to Nice and you didn't have to go to Duseldorf
<$B> <#\>I believe I had to
<$A> <#\>You chose to go
<$B> <#\>I think I had to<,> <#\>Do you mean to tell me that
the largest<,> single<,> item in our budget<,> in income
earning for this state coal<,,> in which there was going to be
an increased market in Europe<,> from twelve million tonnes to
one hundred million tonnes<,> in eight years that I shouldn't
have been at that conference <{><[><,> meeting</[> those
people
<$A> <#\><[>Mr <@>surnameM9</@> </[></{> 
  <#\>Mr Pickard you weren't you
weren't yourself organising these coal deals <#\>There
were lots of Australian business people there as well were
there not
<$B> <#\>Absolutely <#\>I could never<,> really<,> support<,>
the idea that we did the deal <#\>I've never done that you
know it
<$A> <#\>If it was so critically important for you to have<,>
been at Nice and Duseldorf<,> don't you think you could have
got on the telephone<,> and contacted the Minister to say
<quote>look I'm in Rome<,,> <#\>I've got another six<,> days
leave<,> but I really think it's important that I should
travel from Rome to Nice and then Duseldorf</quote> <,> and
sought the Minister's permission<,,> <#\>Why didn't you get on
the phone and do that
<$B> <#\>Why didn't<,> the<,,>
<$Z> <X><#\>Now answer the question</X>
<$B> <#\>I I'm just trying to by<,,>
<#\>There was at no point<,,> that there was any indication to
me that this<,,> fax that suddenly appeared on the twelfth<,>
was a direction that now had to be taken<,> in relationship to
our discussions in London on the twenty seventh and on the
thirtieth
<$A> <#\>But you just oh when you say
<quote>this fax</quote> you mean the letter which is at page
seventeen do you Mr Pickard
<$B> <#\>I mean that letter on seventeen that arrived at my
office on the 14th and I and to me anyhow was indicated
to me was contrary to what we had discussed by
the person sent by the Premier to talk about the transition of
the office and what needed to be done
<$A> <#\>You say it's contrary <#\>The letter itself page
seventeen says <quote>I am sure that there are some business
matters in Europe you will wish to advance in the coming
months <#\>Perhaps we can consider these during my visit to
London on thirtieth of September</quote></I>
