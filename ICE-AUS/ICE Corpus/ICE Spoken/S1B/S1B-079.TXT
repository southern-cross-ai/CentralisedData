<I><$A> <#\>He wants uh some details um <#\>This was
just
following up a letter of Sue's about um uh specification
inflection and just detailing it <#\>Um I I'm basically
agreeing
with what's been said but just detailing it in relation to the
different parts of speech <#\>Because I felt they have
slightly
different implications and alternatives <#\>And it
were better to tease out what happened with verbs
<O>inaudible</O> adjectives and uh submerged them as words
<#\>Um
and the the practice that is already there seems to be that um
inflected forms are indeed given in in full for monosyllables
and
not normally for words or verbs with two or more <#\>And that
seems to make clear to readers what happens when you get an
inflected form quite neatly and when for any reason the stem
changes <#\>Uh so that practice seems to be used quite um
regularly for all the examples I've I've chased <#\>Um it was
just a a sort of random check of verbs <#\>Um there were some
exceptions when I looked at the same two practices with nouns
and
with adjectives <#\>And there may be good reason for this but
it's a question just of of um what the justification might be
for
um doing it for some nouns with two or more syllables and for
some adjectives with two syllables <#\>Um with the uh nouns
for
instance we give inflected forms um with the full word <#\>If
it's a monosyllable and it's irregular um or if it's um in a
sense regular because it adds an <mention>s</mention> whereas other
spelling adjustment or addition to the stem like the fly flies
one <#\>Um we also give it in a few cases where there are two
syllables um if there are foreign who are like aura but
not through me <#\>That seems to be um a rec- p'haps a
recent addition to do that for words of two syllables <#\>On
the
whole um with nouns of two or more syllables they're given in
truncated form <#\>And that seems to apply to plurals which
might
be O S or or O E S the ones with I E S like cherry and shanty
<&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> to other foreign plurals like you
know
like you know aulos was given a- aulos with an L O I <#\>And
it's
not that it's stopping them using the pidgin but uh it
it's still there uh i- according to that  more general
practice
of using only the truncated form when <O>inaudible</O> two or
more syllables <#\>So it it it it just to state what is the
practice and to see what we're going to do with it <#\>So that
seems to be just um on the foreign ones and particularly just
uh
uh some variation <#\>And then when the adjectives came up um
and
it was a question of what to do with the inflected forms there
was more variation particularly with the ones ending in Y
<#\>Uh
we normally give the full forms for single syllable ones and I
think that's fair enough <#\>When it comes to two syllables we
normally don't and that's the truncated form for most
adjectives
with two syllables <#\>And there you get cranky funny merry
and
just the last part um given for the comparative and
superlative
<#\>But there are others like bulky grainy slimy where we've
given the whole form <#\>So i- at at that point um p'raps
again
there's there's been a a change of practice and ever since
then <O>inaudible</O> think whether we <O>inaudible</O> or
not <#\>It's only um affirming the general practice for
monosyllable and for words with more than one syllable
<&>BREAK
IN RECORDING</&> <#\>These are the sort of circumstances in
which um it seems
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> uh
the
others but that grainy <O>inaudible</O> <&>BREAK IN
RECORDING</&>
<$A> <#\>Um
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Y- Yes you you ju- if you just put the N I E S you
think
that's uncomfortable
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Um what you're were saying that with grainy
and
slimy there is only one consonant whereas with funny cranky
merry
there were two
<$B> <#\>They're so difficult
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Er I'm just suggesting that
<O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$C> <#\>Um <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>But bul- bulky doesn't quite fit that one
<$B> <#\>No <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>I I don't feel the difficulty with grainy either
<#\>Why
couldn't you cite just I E R after that
<$B> <#\>You wouldn't know <O>inaudible</O> <&>BREAK IN
RECORDING</&> I E R <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> not <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>R I E R there is
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>Yep
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>That That's the one I first thought <O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>Well I think that's very strange <O>inaudible</O> to
do
that because it would leave in my if I we- <&>BREAK IN
RECORDING</&> whether the mayor had one R or two Rs
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$D> <#\>What with the double R
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Once you <O>inaudible</O> it <#\>In In these
cases you give them the full whereas <O>inaudible</O>
you
only need to give <O>inaudible</O> single <O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\>Oh right
<$D> <#\>Right
<$E> <#\>If we showed syllable breaks <&>BREAK IN
RECORDING</&>
<$C> <#\>It wouldn't help at all <#\>No <#\>It's the wrong
<O>inaudible</O>
<$E> <#\>What
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>It It's something I guess that's been
inherited
<#\>I don't imagine um <#\>I- and it's a matter of just
interpreting what's there and see how far you want to adjust
it
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> but they seem to have <&>BREAK IN
RECORDING</&> <O>inaudible</O> Okay <O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\>Mmm <#\>Yes <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&>
<$F> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <#\>That's a very difficult one
isn't
it
<$A> <#\>Yeah that one was a <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&>
<O>inaudible</O>
<$F> <#\>On the grounds that it is difficult that
overrides other considerations
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>You only truncate <O>inaudible</O> otherwise
<O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Are we or hmm
<$B> <#\>I mean you could give double E R but double O
<O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes a-
<$?> <#\>Mmm
<$D> <#\>Mmm
<$?> <#\>Well
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O> syllable <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>I th- I think <#\>Uh one of the things that
concerns me is not <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> here uh if we
don't
have to
<$D> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>Sure
<$A> <#\>And And what's there strikes me as being perfectly
reasonable <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> on a few ones that p'haps
you want to be extra careful <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> but to
undertake a great renovation I I I think is prob'ly not a good
use of people's time
<$B> <#\>No
<$D> <#\>No
<$B> <#\>Most <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$A> <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> <#\><O>inaudible</O> the
exceptions you seem to be making are difficult ones
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>So i- it's then uh uh in the in the definition of
difficult um that the uncertainty of the application of the
rule
lies
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$G> <#\>I wouldn't be thinking of funny as difficult
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$G> <#\><O>inaudible</O> and funnel
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$G> <#\>And the noun the noun funnel
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> the verb
<$B> <#\>Oh but <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> the verb you see
<$B> <#\>Yeah I <O>inaudible</O>
<$G> <#\>Well in the verb
<$B> <#\>Yeah right <#\>Mmm
<$G> <#\>Yes
<$?> <#\>Mmm
<$G> <#\>Because you know we've got we got a lot from a lot of
forms for funnel um because we give both U S forms and our own
forms of double L or single L and we've just got funnel then
meld
melon spelt two different ways
<O>general agreement</O>
<$G> <#\>Er I think it is a fairly major undertaking to
find all these
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>And I don't know that anyone reading it will
<O>inaudible</O> later on
<$G> <#\>No <#\>I m- <O>laughs</O> I mean that's that's
the question I was going to ask <#\>Is anyone
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$E> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Anyone really have any difficulty <O>inaudible</O>
<$G> <#\>Has anyone ever misinterpreted it
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> funnel <O>inaudible</O> funnel in
that
sense
<$C> <#\><O>inaudible</O> prob'ly has
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$G> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$G> <#\>Yeah I think you'd find two or three of these on
every
page wouldn't you
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$G> <#\>And I just wonder if it's worth it
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>And you know could leave it as it is <#\>And
you've got a considerable help there already
<$B> <#\>Mmm <#\>Sure
<$G> <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> <#\>Mmm <#\>I I mean adieu we
already done <#\>We spelled it out in full each time
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>Mmm <#\>Mmm
<$G> <#\>Uh wh- I'm sorry Pam which is the ones that you're
saying <O>inaudible</O> perhaps ought to be considered for
change
<$A> <#\>I I'm really um only saying that words like aura
perhaps
um may not deserve to be spelt out in full uh when larva and
aulos are not
<$G> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>Um it it's just that uh it we may be um going further
than we need and consistency isn't always a virtue but that in
a sense is a little inconsistent to spell it out for aura but
not
for aulos when in fact the aulos one is Greek <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>Sure
<$G> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>But But it isn't a household word <#\>And possibly
that's that's the <#\>So it it's a a paper that really says
there's very little need for action unless you want to tidy up
these things
<$G> <#\>And <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> <#\><O>inaudible</O> is is
spelt
out fully and <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&>
<$G> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>I- I- It's <#\>Yes if if you like it's a status quo
type <O>inaudible</O> but but just sort of spelling out
a
circumstance with
<$B> <#\>Mmm sure
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$G> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$G> <#\>Yes <#\>Well <#\>No doubt the dictionary's full of
oddities
<$B> <#\>Yeah and
<$G> <#\>We We We look hard to find them <O>laughs</O>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> huge list and spotlight
<O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> that we've never had anyway
<$G> <#\>No
? <#\><O>inaudible</O>
?1 <#\>No <#\>Okay <#\>Well
<$A> <#\>So i- i- if that was <#\>Anyway only to detail as I
say
the letter that Sue wrote earlier about it just just to do it
for
parts of speech and see what it was
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>And uh well confirm I think what what's there
rather than undertake a great renovation exercise
<$G> <#\>Mmm
<$G> <#\>Um <#\>Well <O>inaudible</O> <#\>What about
<O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
summarising
earlier discussions and <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&>
<O>inaudible</O> or or or just trying to bring to the surface
just what the abbreviations and the labels might be so we can
debate them <#\>Um we talked last time about intensifiers and
a
bracketed <#\>I haven't put the bracket in here but the the
implication would be that for words such as utter you might
say
something like adj brackets intensifier <#\>And then you don't
have to go to all sorts of um <O>inaudible</O> uh synonyms
partial synonyms to try and define the word
<$G> <#\>So that <O>inaudible</O> So that would serve in place
of a definition
<$A> <#\>I- In In a case like that
?1 <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$G> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>Um there are other meanings of utter that are
denotational <#\>And so you you would still give the the uh
definition in cases like that <#\>But it takes the place um of
denotational definitions where it's it's truly intensifying
<$G> <#\>And And And would prefer it in some ways
<$A> <#\>You would indeed
<$G> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>Yes <#\>Except when it's um what the very
true
<$G> <#\>And tricky
<$A> <#\>And tricky
<$G> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>There There are quite a lot that would
deserve
that treatment uh in some of their senses <#\>And tha- that I
think is the point that it would be good um as a way of
differentiating senses which are precise <O>inaudible</O>
<$G> <#\>How could How could you find these
<$A> <#\>Uh I have a bit of a list which was on a previous
paper
um culled out of out of uh grammars and syno-
synonymous chains <#\>So uh that's certainly
going
to be the a preliminary inventory <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&>
<O>inaudible</O> it's not an enormous <O>inaudible</O>
<&>BREAK
IN RECORDING</&> and and dead search
<$G> <#\>Yeah
<$E> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\>I think they'll show up as uh
<$G> <#\>Yeah <#\>Mmm
<$C> <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> <#\><O>inaudible</O> more
trouble
with the <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm
<$C> <#\>Um <O>inaudible</O> <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&>
which can be generated only in the predicate <#\>You
would
allow preposed adjective to be predictable
<$A> <#\>Uh I guess I'm <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&>
<O>inaudible</O> predicati- predicative to the sense which
which
was generated a bit l- like y- y- uh <#\>He was w- <#\>He was
ill
<&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> <#\><O>inaudible</O> I think goes
with
the predicative use <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&> <#\>The The
other
sense of an ill omen an evil one is  preposed <#\>You
You-
d say nothing of that
<$C> <#\>Well I would say apart from the fact that I think
that
example is that's not a happy one because it you can say He's
an
ill man
<$E> <#\>An ill person <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>Um I I wonder whether you're covering you have in
mind
the case whereof <#\>He was an ill man uh when we put
it
like that
<$A> <#\>Ha <#\>Um <O>inaudible</O> <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&>
subject to that sort of interpretation <#\>It <&>BREAK IN
RECORDING</&> <O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>I've used it before <#\>Yeah I've used it before
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$C> <#\>It's just the way you expressed it which made me
wonder
whether you were using it in the way that I had in mind um
because you you can if you push it even put your ill 
man
into the subject of the sentence
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Right
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$C> <#\>I mean <#\>But that's just a particular
example
which isn't a happy one <#\>But you really have um in mind I
think um uh adjectives <&>BREAK IN RECORDING</&>
reversed
so to speak
<$A> <#\>Uh it could be
<$C> <#\>It's a bit hard to work around it
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$C> <#\>It's not just that it occurs in the predicate
<$A> <#\>No No it it is it's it's the complement the I mean
the
real grammar of it is that it's a complement</I>
