<$E> <#\>Mr Speaker
<$B> <#\>The Honourable Member for McKellar on a point of
order
<$E> <#\>Mr Speaker<,>  Mr Speaker   I was
very pleased to hear that you are in the mood for upholding
previous rulings because<,>  because   on
the eleventh of September nineteen eighty the chair ruled
that a that the   Government is not
entitled not entitled   <&>General noise</&>

<#\>Member for McKellar<,> your point of order 
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O> you champion <{><[>deceiver</[>
<$E> <#\><[>The point</[></{> of order  
<$B> <#\>Order <#\>The Member for McKellar has the call
<$E> <#\>The point the point   of order Mr
Speaker<,> is that is has been previously held in this place
on the ne eleventh   of September nineteen
eighty that the Government in debate is not entitled to
analyse another party's policy in answer to a question
<$B> <#\>No there's no point of order <#\>Resume your seat
<#\>This has been ruled on by many speakers
<$A> <#\>Mr Speaker <{><[>Mr Speaker</[>  
<$B> <#\><[>Resume</[></{> your seat
<$A> <#\>So so   Mr <{1><[1>Fahey was</[1>
asked <quote>what's your opinion as far as the eleven p m to
six a m curfew</quote> <#\><quote>Well I
think</quote>  now listen to this   <quote>I think
we have got to remember when the curfew was put on it was in
relation to a certain decibel level of aeroplanes <#\>Now that
decibel level of aeroplanes has dropped significantly<,> and
it's time that we have the debate</quote> <#\>In other words
John Fahey wants to fly the planes twenty four hours a day<,>
<#\>He wants to fly Mascot airport and leave it open twenty
four hours a day and yet he's got the he's got
the   temerity to publish this sort of humbug when the
New South Wales Government<,> his when his  
former leader as Premier at the time as then the subsequent
Premier<,> ah then he as the minister at the time and as
Premier at the time<,> said that he thinks the airport should
remain open <#\>Now Mr Speaker the Member for Bennelong was
interjecting earlier <#\>Let me just say<,> I I I let me just   record his views about this
<#\><quote>Do you think the Government will go for a third
runway</quote> <#\><quote>I think they probably will now <#\>I
hope they do<,> <#\>They should've gone for it six and a half
years ago<,> <#\>It's been our policy for about seven years<,>
<#\>There's an overwhelming case for building it</quote> 
<#\>And he said <quote>I grew up in the flight path in the St
George area of Sydney and know something about the politics of
that area and I've always regarded the issue as being grossly
exaggerated in terms of the impact on local residents</quote> 
<#\>And he goes on to say <quote>the great bulk of the rest of
them are only mildly affected and in any event bought their
houses knowing full well that they are under the flight
paths</quote> <,> <#\>Really sympathetic stuff <#\>Mr Speaker
then he goes on to say <quote>many people will<,> because
you'll have the north south pattern <#\>I think the case for
it on general interest grounds is absolutely
overwhelming</quote> <,> he said <#\>And he goes on he says   <quote>Yes <#\>I suppose <#\>Is
there then is there then a case<,>  <{2><[2>is there
then a case   for bipartisan policy</[2> on building the
third runway <#\>If they adopt <{3><[3>our policy</[3>
yes</quote> <#\>Mr Speaker he says <quote>our policy<,> is to
build it <#\>Our policy</quote>

     <#\>Leader of the Opposition
<$A> <#\><quote>Our policy</quote> he says <quote>is to build
it</quote> <#\>And ah<,> Mr Speaker<,> these are the people
who're here now<,> in interjecting in the parliament interjecting in the parliament   and then
we've got ah then we've got   the Member for ah
Fadden the ah spokesperson on ah sport and tourism<,> saying
the construction of the new third runway for Sydney's
Kingsford Smith airport should be commenced immediately<,>
<#\>He goes on<,>  and he goes on   in 
those terms <#\>That's the member for Fadden who's of
course<,> thinking of running on a ticket with the member for
Bennelong against the Leader of the Opposition <O>laughter</O>
<#\>Ah<,>  well we've heard about the Howard-Jull ticket
<#\>We've heard about that <#\>Anyway<,> ah if you get up
we'll quote this back to you <&>According to Hansard Dr
Woolridge interjecting</&> <#\>Apparently they've give you up
mate as a dry as a wet you're too you're
<#\> You're too soggy   altogether <O>laughter</O>
<#\>You're you're   completely had it so
they've now gone for dear old Jull <#\>He's polishing up his
radio voice prob'ly right at the moment <O>laughter</O>
<#\>Speaking of course deeply and with meaning <O>laughter</O>
<#\>Ah<,> now Mr Speaker um <O>laughter</O> Mr
Speaker Mr Speaker   then we had the shadow
minister for business and consumer affairs Mr Moore call on
the Government to muster the guts to act now <,> because
Sydney before Sydney becomes   known around the
world as a chaotic third world airport <#\><quote>The need for
a third runway is a harsh reality</quote> <,> and it goes on
<#\>Then there's the member for ah Parkes Mr Cobb
<#\><quote>The sooner we get action going on this third runway
the better</quote> and yet the Leader of the National
Party<,,> as a<,> again er no interjecting
hypocritically   when his own when he and
his   own backbench are urging the building of the
runway <#\>Mr Speaker they're they are

the Prime Minister has been on his feet for an excessive
period of time and I appreciate your earlier statement that

Sydney I might just say though  <,> in response to
