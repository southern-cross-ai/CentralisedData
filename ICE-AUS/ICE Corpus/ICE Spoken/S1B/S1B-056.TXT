<I><$A> <#\>The gravest issue facing our nation<,> is how to provide
jobs<,> for our fellow Australians <#\>Too many<,> are now out of
work <#\>Too many<,> have been out of work for too long <#\>The
primary objective<,> of this budget is jobs <#\>Jobs in the short
term by providing a further stimulus to the economy this
year<,> to sustain Australia's economic growth<,> until the
later the world economy the world economy kicks in<,> and jobs
in the medium and longer term<,> by boosting the capacity of
Australian business to expand production<,> on a world
competitive basis <#\>This is a budget<,> to strengthen the
recovery<,> and make it sustainable <#\>Australia has had a
number of economic recoveries in the post-war period<,> only
to see them taper off prematurely<,> but this recovery is
different <O>laughter</O> <#\>It is different<,,> because firmly
embedded 
<$B> <#\>Order
<$A> <#\>into Australia's economic structure<,> we now have two
vital ingredients <#\>Inflation is at levels lower than seen for
thirty years
<$?>    <#\>Hear hear
<$A> <#\>Interest rates<,> are at their lowest for twenty years
<$?>    <#\>Hear hear<,>
<$A> <#\>These<,> these've been the twin goals the twin goals of
every Government for a quarter of a century<,,> but it is this
Government<,> which has attained them<,> and harnessed them<,>
for the future benefit of all Australians<,,> and that
makes<,> this recovery<,> different <#\>This is a quality
recovery <{1><[1><,></[1> and will be a recovery<,,> Mr Speaker<,>
<{2><[2>this</[2>
<$?>   <#\><[1><O>general noise not dropping till B calls order</O></[1></{1> 
<$B> <#\><[2>Order</[2></{2> 
<$A> <#\>this budget<,> establishes an economic framework over
four years<,> <#\>A framework for continuing low interest
rates<,> and continuing low inflation<,,> which combined<,>
with reduced company tax<,> and generous<,> investment
incentives<,> will support increased business investment<,>
for future growth in production and employment <#\>This budget<,>
sets us<,> on a prudent path<,,> leading to lower Government
deficits<,> and higher<,> national savings <#\>This budget
proposes measures which overall<,> will cut the deficit<,>
four years from now<,> by nine<,> billion dollars <#\>These steps
will see<,> the public sector<,> directly contribute<,> some
seventeen billion dollars<,> to the improvement of national
saving<,> over the three years to nineteen ninety six ninety
seven<,> <#\>The budget also takes action<,> on Government
programs put forward in the context of the last election <#\>Well
over one hundred separate spending commitments<,> will be
implemented <#\>These<,> will be fully funded over the course of
the next four years<,> <#\>These commitments<,> give effect to
the Government's plans to provide help<,> for families with
children<,> extra assistance to those out of work<,> improved
health services and other initiatives<,> to make this
society<,> even fairer<,> even more cohesive <{><[><,,> <#\>Other commitments include action<,> to enrich the culture of our country</[> <,> protect its environment<,> and support those
living outside our major cities <#\>This budget will also
provide<,> new support for our emerging exporters<,> who are
demonstrating such remarkable success<,> in capturing new
markets for products<,> made and developed<,> by the skilled
hands and creative minds of Australia's working men and women
<$?> <[><O>noise</O></[></{> 
          <#\>Hear hear
<$A> <#\>The budget also provides relief for middle Australia<,>
by lowering marginal tax rates<,> for those on incomes between
twenty thousand seven hundred<,> and fifty thousand dollars
<$?>    <#\>Hear hear,
<$A> <#\>This will reduce the tax payed by a person on six hundred
dollars a week<,> by eight dollars a week<,> <#\>Not only will
this promised tax cut be delivered<,> it will be delivered
eight months early<,> commencing on the first of November just
eleven weeks away
<$?>   <#\>Hear hear
<$A> <#\>This early payment is largely made possible<,> by higher
dividends from businesses like Telecom<,> and from the Reserve
Bank <#\>It's only right<,> that tax payers should benefit<,>
from the higher earnings of these public bodies <#\>But the
Government has decided to go further with the tax cuts<,> by
extending the benefits<,> to low income taxpayers<,> <#\>Those on
incomes below twenty three thousand two hundred dollars will
receive a new rebate<,> paid on assessment <#\>This will relieve
ninety thousand taxpayers<,> of their entire tax bill<,> and
ensure that a tax cut of a hundred dollars or more<,> is paid
to all other taxpayers annually
<$?>    <#\>Hear hear
<$A> <#\>The combined effects of the budget measures<,> will
result<,> in a deficit of sixteen billion dollars this year
<#\>This will provide an extra stimulus of around two billion
dollars to Australia's economy<,> at a time<,> when a stimulus
is needed<,> to sustain the recovery <#\>Australia's subdued
recovery<,> in part reflects the time taken<,> to recover from
the sapping effects of the debt build up and falling asset
prices of the late eighties <#\>Of more importance though<,> is
the continuing weakness of the world economy <#\>Whereas a year
ago<,> in the industrialised <{><[><,> growth</[> 
<$?>   <#\><[><O>grumbling</O></[></{> 
<$A> <#\>in the industrialised economy<,> economies was expected
to be three percent in nineteen ninety three <#\>It is now
expected to be a little over one percent <#\>Japan and Germany<,>
the world's second and third largest economies have yet<,> to
emerge from recession <#\>Against that background<,> Australia
has done well<,> and will continue to do so <#\>Our GDP growth in
ninety two ninety three was two and a half percent <#\>A rate<,>
the envy<,> of the industrialised world <#\>Our relatively good
performance can be attributed to two factors<,> <#\>First<,> the
Government's foresight<,> in building up budget surpluses in
the late eighties<,> then using that capacity<,> to provide a
major stimulus to the economy when it was required<,> and
second<,> our growing trade and investment links with the
fastest growing region of the world<,> the dynamic economies
of Asia<,> <#\>Mr Speaker<,> the short term outlook for the world
economy remains subdued<,> and therefore places a constraint
on our own growth<,> <#\>The world outlook however<,> is expected
to improve during nineteen ninety four <#\>Australia's
challenge<,> is to position itself<,> to take full
advantage<,> of stronger world growth as it comes on stream<,>
and to continue our integration<,> with the Asian economies
<$?> <#\>Hear hear
<$A> <#\>Above all<,,> this will require<,> the further
development of world class industries<,> aiming to seek out<,>
and exploit new opportunities <#\>That assures the best<,> long
term prospects of reducing unemployment and raising Australian
living standards<,> <#\>Policy<,> will have its part to play<,,>
by building on the substantial structural reform<,> achieved
over the past ten years<,> by maintaining the much improved
competitive position of our export industries especially
through low inflation<,> and by adjusting fiscal policy<,> so
that sufficient domestic saving<,> is available to fund the
additional investment required <#\>Mr Speaker at the July
Premiers conference<,>  all Australian Governments<,> agreed
on the key challenge for fiscal policy today <#\>The conference
benefited from a major report on national saving<,>
commissioned from Dr Vince Fitzgerald<,> a response to which
I'm releasing tonight <#\>The fiscal challenge<,> is to continue
the stimulus to activity over the next year<,> to encourage
economic recovery and job growth<,> while setting in frame
medium term adjustments<,> to significantly increase public
sector saving<,> <#\>From next financial year the process of
withdrawing stimulus<,,> and cutting the deficit will
begin<,,> and whilst the growth path of the economy will
assist<,> on its own it will be insufficient to accomplish the
task <#\>This budget therefore contains measures<,> which will
accelerate the process <#\>Four years from now<,> the deficit
will be cut to less than six billion dollars or around one
percent of GDP
<$?>    <#\><O>noise</O>
<$A> <#\>Mr Speaker<,> this meets<,> a key election commitment of
the Government <#\>It will be achieved<,> through five<,>
complementary steps<,> <#\>First<,> the second round of tax cuts
will be deferred from nineteen ninety six<,> until a time when
fiscal conditions permit<,> probably<,> in nineteen ninety
eight <#\>Secondly<,,> <O>inaudible</O> will be <{><[>reduced by</[>  
two billion dollars
<$?>    <#\><[><O>noise</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Order</[> </{>
<$A> <#\>Thirdly<,> the tax system will be tightened to remove or
reduce certain concessions<,> and to tax non cash benefits in
a manner more equivalent<,> to the taxation of the ordinary
income of wage and salary earners 
<$?> <#\>Hear hear
<$A> <#\>This will raise six hundred million dollars <#\>Fourth<,,>
rates of excise on petroleum products and tobacco will be
progressively increased <{><[><,,></[> and fifth<,,> wholesale sales
tax rates will be increased in two stages over the next two
years 
<$?> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$?>    <#\><[><O>noise</O></[></{> 
<$A> <#\><,,> The effects<,> of these outweighs
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> measures<,> will reduce<,> the prospective
deficit for ninety six ninety seven<,> by nine billion
dollars<,> <#\>Mr Speaker<,> these changes order more than that
<#\>They will help the erosion of Commonwealth Indirect Tax
Revenues<,> thus preventing Australia's tax system becoming
lopsided

<I><$A> <#\>I'd like to begin of course by drawing the attention of
the people of Australia<,,> to the fact that the bulk of the
Government has not bothered to attend the speech tonight <{1><[1><,> and most importantly<,> most importantly the Prime Minister has decided not to come and the Treasurer's decided not to come</[1> <#\>This is absolutely unprecedented<,,> in the history of
budget responses in this parliament <#\><{2><[2>I just want the</[2> people
of Australia to know that our Prime Minister has not got the
guts to come in here and face the reality of his dishonesty
<#\>He has not got the guts to come in here and face the reality
of his dishonesty <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>He can dish it out alright but he
can't take it <{4><[4>our Prime Minister<,,></[4> <#\>I'd also like to
invite the people of Australia at the start of er of my
remarks tonight to just think back<,,> <#\>Think back over the<,>
period since<,> the Government first announced<,> that it
would deliver tax cuts <#\>Think back to<,> February of ah
nineteen ninety two<,,> when it said that ah<,> it could
deliver tax cuts<,,> er and um<,,> think of the period since
then all the way through to the election <#\>Indeed think about
the period even up until just a couple of weeks ago<,> <#\>Think
about the things that they said about those tax cuts<,,>
<#\>Think very carefully about it<,,> <#\>Do you remember<,> <#\>Do you
remember them saying that they were going to increase tax<,>
<#\>Do you remember them saying they'd increase tax in the course
of the election campaign 
<$?>    <#\><[1><O>noise</O></[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Hear hear</[2></{2> 
     <#\><[3>Hear hear</[3></{3> 
     <#\><[4>Hear hear <O>noise</O></[4> </{4>
     <#\>No no
<$A> <#\>Do you remember them saying that they'd increase the
petrol excise <{><[>by ten cents a litre</[> <#\>Do you remember them
saying they'd increase the fringe benefits tax
<$?>    <#\><[><O>noise</O></[></{> No
<$A> <#\>Do you remember them saying that they'd put sales tax up
right across the board <{><[>on anything</[> <#\>Of course you didn't
<#\>Of course you don't because they didn't say<,> anything like
that <#\>Let me tell you<,> what my memory is of what they said
<$?>    <#\><[><O>noise</O></[></{> 
<$?> <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>They said very clearly<,,> and ver and very
distinctly<,,> that<,> the one nation tax cuts could be
magically funded<,,> without any off setting increases in
existing taxes<,> and in fact they went out of their way<,,>
very much in the way George Bush did in the United States when
he said read my lips <#\>It was no clearer for George than it was
for John Dawkins or Paul Keating<,>
<$B> <#\>Order order <#\>Refer to the<,,> Prime Minister
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$?>   <#\><[><O>noise</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>The Prime Minister and the Treasurer</[></{> <#\>It was no
clearer to George than it was to the Prime Minister of and the
Treasurer <#\>Read my lips <#\>No new taxes
<$?>    <#\><O>noise</O>
<$A> <#\>They al<,> they also swore of course in the course of
that whole period right through the election campaign that
they wouldn't increase the burden of tax<,> they wouldn't
increase the burden of tax on the people of Australia and
remember that wonderful line they developed<,> that the budget
would whirr back into balance<,> as the economy started to
grow the budget would whirr back into balance <#\>In fact<,,>
they had a lot of trouble convincing people about their
integrity in relation to tax cuts <#\>Do you remember the final
play<,,> where the Prime Minister came into this parliament
and he said<quote>ah<,> I'm gonna put 'em into law <#\>I'm gonna put
those tax cuts into law L A W<,,> so you know they will be
delivered</quote> <#\>And who can forget those words and I'll quote them
to you tonight<,,> <#\>He said at that time<,><quote>they are not a
promise <#\>They are law<,> L A W<,,> <#\>And the difference
between a legislative tax cut<,> and some Opposition speaker's
manifesto<,,> is all the world of difference</quote> <#\>He went out
of his way to say they would be delivered <#\>They were
funded<,,> and there wouldn't be any new taxes <#\>There wouldn't
be any increase in taxes<,,> and there wouldn't be any
increase in the tax burden<,,></I>
