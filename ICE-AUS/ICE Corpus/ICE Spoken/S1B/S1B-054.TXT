<S1B-054> <2033>
<I><$A> <#\>Mr Speaker <O>Acoughs</O> I heard a quote from the
Treasurer on the ABC Bulletin<,> which carried the story of
the Metway Bank's loss before the appeal court<,,> the process
which allows this Bill to come before the House <#\>Mr De Lacy
told the ABC <O>Acoughs</O> that relations between this Labor
Government and Metway<,> had been somewhat strained in recent
times<,> but the government continues<,> to have a high regard
for the bank<,,> <#\>Well<,> I bet it does<,> <#\>I'm sure Ned Kelly
had a high regard for some banks too<,,> <{><[>especially those with plenty of cash on hand<,,> when he staged his raid</[> <,,>
but even Ned<,> would not've dared dream of something like
twenty five million<,> from one single bank robbery<,,> <#\>And
that is exactly what this Bill is all about<,,> bank robbery
on a grand scale <#\>It will be legalised by the passage of this
Bill<,> but it will be robbery just the same<,,> and lots of
people in and outside the financial markets share that view
<#\>Mr Austin Donnelly president of the Australian Investors
Association<,> described the Metway Bank robbery<,> as the
sort of conduct<,> you would expect from government of a
country like Guatemala <#\>They were his ex his exact words<,>
<#\>That may be unfair to Guatemala<,> but we know<,> what Mr
Donnelly was getting at <#\>He was referring to the governments
of countries known as Banana Republics<,> like the countries
which a former Federal Labor Treasurer was fond of talking
about<,,> or like the one that this Labor government is
transforming Queensland into and rather rapidly<,> <#\>And
exactly who are the victims of this robbery <#\>A big bank<,> the
traditional target of Labor's policies of envy and greed<,>
<#\>No <#\>The Metway Bank has certainly suffered through this
government's action<,> but the victims at the end of the day
are the shareholders and the clients <#\>In all<,> hundreds of
thousands of Queenslanders will suffer<,> through this
legalised bank robbery <#\>The sum being hijacked<,> some
seventeen million plus interest<,> amounting to a total of
twenty three million<,,> represents twenty two cents for each
Metway share currently trading at about two dollars seventy
five<,,> and that twenty two cents per share adds up to<,> the
after tax profit shareholders would've enjoyed from this
investment over the past two years<,,><#\>And those shareholders
are not the dreaded capitalists of Labor mythology <#\>There are
tens of thousands of Mr and Mrs Average Queensland<,> who make
up the bulk of Metway shareholders <#\>Average workers<,>
retirees<,> people who just wanted to put some money aside for
their future for retirement<,,> <#\>They are the real victims of
your Labor carryings-on<,> by your treasurer <#\>Thuggery at its
best<,,> <#\>They and they are the real victims of this
outrageous misuse of legislative and executive power<,,> <#\>Mr
Speaker we know the object of this Bill is the removal of some
twenty three million from the stakeholders of Metway bank<,,>
but any discussion or debate on this Bill cannot be
conducted<,> without dealing with the processes which have
brought about this Bill <#\>The Bill is explicit on the processes
or mechcani mechanisations mechanisms<,> which will facilitate
the government's grab for the fund in question <#\>The fortunes
of this Government received a fillip today when the Appeal
Court agreed<,> that legislation was within the government's
power<,,> in fact<,> that this state sanctioned grand larceny
could go ahead<,,> <#\>But I urge government members starting with
the treasurer not to let all this power go to their heads <#\>You
may be legally right<,> but you are morally wrong and everyone
knows it
<$?> <#\><[><O>General muttering</O></[></{> 
<$B> <#\>Rubbish
<$A> <#\>Everyone knows it Mr Treasurer <#\><{><[>You just want the funds regardless of the morals</[> involved
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
     <#\>Read the court's decision and see who's morally right
<$A> <#\>The court found<,> that you could legally do what you are
doing
<$B> <#\>And morally <{><[>and morally</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>But it did not</[></{> found you could morally do it <{><[><,,> and taken</[> in the long view<,> you are financially stupid <#\>You
may succeed in clipping one of Queensland's best performing
financial institutions of twenty three million<,> but think of
the long term damage to investor confidence <#\>Do you think this
exercise in financial thuggery has not been noticed in the
boardrooms of major companies<,> and financial houses<,> in
the rest of Australia and beyond<,> <#\>Do you think the Asian
corporations which this government<,> and Mr Keating have so
recently discovered<,> will not be watching<,> <#\>In their eyes
will the Metway Bank robbery make Queensland the financial
flavour of the month for investment decisions<,> <#\>Not on your
Nelly<,> <#\>The architects of the tiger economies of Asia<,>
know a thing or two about government interference in
business<,,> about nationalisation of industries<,> about
invasion civil war and all the rest of it <#\>As far as they are
concerned they have been there done that and did not like it
much<,> <#\>As far as they are concerned the bad old days are
gone forever<,> <#\>What this is about now<,> is hard
bargaining<,> sticking to the terms of the deal<,> keeping
your word<,> and turning trust into financial goodwill over
the long term
<$B> <#\><[>They said that <O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
     <#\>Exactly what we did <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Exactly what you're not doing</[></{> <#\>Just try measuring the
morality of the treasurer's Bill<,> against the Asian
yardstick of good business practice<,> or any yardstick of
just about any nation outside Cuba<,> and a couple of the more
murderous republics now emerging in the Balkans<,,>
<#\>Especially when you look at the background to this Bill<,> the
history of Metway and the Building Societies' Contingency
Fund <#\>The Metropolitan Building Society was<,> as we all
know<,> one of Queensland's biggest and most successful<,> and
it contributed to the Contingency Fund like a good corporate
citizen<,,> and then the Metropolitan Building Society became
the Metway Bank<,> and who encouraged the board and the
shareholders to take the big leap and become a bank<,> <#\>The
Queensland government of course<,> and when Metway took the
big jump from building society to bank what happened<,> <#\>The
name change<,> cost it membership of the Contingency Fund<,>
right at the time this government was planning its multi-
million dollar raid <{><[><,,> <#\>All this<,> despite the fact</[> <,>
that Metway in its previous financial life had contributed
seventeen million to the Contingency Fund
<$?> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
<$C> <#\>As a building society which is completely <{><[>different</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>As a building society</[></{> <,> but it never thought that it
would have to face the day when the government made a cash
grab<,> because it had changed its name as a bank
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O> party government<,> not us
<O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>And that is what is so immoral and and so inconsistent
about this whole shoddy exercise <#\>The government is plo is
pocketing plenty from the raid of the Contingency Fund<,> but
all members do not suffer equally in fact most benefit
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>This legislation is all about winners and losers <#\>Metway
loses<,,> as do all those tens of thousands of small
shareholders I spoke of earlier <#\>Metway's customers lose<,> as
there is twenty three million less in the kitty<,> when the
board is making loan decisions<,> levying bank charges<,>
paying wages and all the rest<,,> but this <{1><[1>government</[1> well
there is twenty three million dollars <{2><[2>less in the kitty</[2> 
<#\>Are <{3><[3>you saying</[3> your grab of the twenty three million<,>
<{4><[4>lets leaves them</[4> <,> richer
<$B> <#\><[1>Rubbish</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Rubbish</[2></{2> 
     <#\><[3>Rubbish</[3></{3> 
     <#\><[4>It was never in Metway's kitty</[4></{4> 
     <#\>It was never in their kitty<,> <#\><{><[>What an extraordinary comment</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>It is their money</[></{> <#\>But why shouldn't they not have
that money <{><[>to distribute to their own clients<,> <#\>Why should you grab it</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Why do you stand up and talk when you know so little about it</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Oh you're the fount of all financial wisdom I gather <#\>God
help us
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> when they compare me with you
<$A> <#\>But when the treasurer's not armed with his legislative
elephant gun<,> when he is exposed to picking winners in the
real market place<,,> his track rord record is not very
good<,> <#\>The corporate landscape is littered with the bodies
of the treasurers economic shortcomings<,> <#\>The Indy Mr
Treasurer<,> the Gondwana<,> Compass<,> and so the list goes
on <#\>They are your some of your more outstanding financial
successes<,,> <#\>But despite the fact that this Bill will allow
the government to get away with it<,> Metway believes in the
fundamental justice of its case<,,> and  will continue to try
to recover its contributions as is its moral right as well as
its duty <#\>I must remind the treasurer that that this issue
will not go away<,,> even after he again jams<,> yet another
Bill through the House<,> in pretty dark hours and dragged on
ah<,,> without any other members being able to really speak on
it<,> when too many people <{1><[1>are not watching</[1> <#\>A bit like a
thief in the night<,> <#\>They were not aware it was even coming
on<,,> I remind the treasurer of the duties of directors
under the corporations law in regard to the protection of
shareholders' interests <#\>On these grounds alone<,> the
directors of Metway are duty bound to pursue <{2><[2>this matter<,> and pursue it as fast</[2> and hard as the law allows
<$B> <#\><[1>Who's stopping them</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> </{2>
     <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Are you suggesting<,> <{><[>are you suggesting that they should carte blanche</[> hand you twenty three million dollars
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
     <#\>What they shouldn't do is waste their shareholders' money
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>What they're doing is trying to look after</[></{> their
shareholders' interests<,> <#\>That presupposes of course<,> that
you don't change those laws too the ones about individual
rights<,> under the Constitution<,> property rights and all
the rest <#\>Just wait<,> I guess in time you will<,> Metway
will now be pursuing this matter in the Federal arena<,,> and that's what it wishes to do both through the Federal courts and through the Senate Standing Committee on finance
and public administration <#\>At least that's what it wanted to
do<,> so to pre-empt that<,> you decided<,> you'd come in
tonight<,> to shove this legislation through<,> so they
couldn't do it<,,> because there are plenty of questions
still to be answered about this extraordinary Bill<,> and
about the whole sorry saga<,,> and sadly we'll not we will not
get those answers in this House tonight<,,> <#\>The down side of
that sort of inquiry of course<,> the Senate inquiry is that
the pe peculiar attitude to responsible financial management
by the Queensland Government<,> is given wider exposure<,,>
and we will all suffer<,,> Queenslanders as a result <#\>The pity
is the cause for such an inquiry should never have existed
<#\>The money hungry government should never have the gall to
embark on the Metway Bank robbery<,> <#\>To highlight just some
of these questions I draw the treasurer's attention to Clause
six<,> Purpose of Fund<,> and ask the treasurer whether the
Clause should reflect all aspects of the purposes behind the
establishment of the Building Society Fund <#\>Should it also not
recognise and acknowledge the source of those funds<,> just
for the record <#\>Similarly I draw the treasurer's attention to
Clause seven<,> the Building Societies' Fund and again we see
a manipulation of the process <#\>A reference to the source of
the funds is made<,> and again the Bill is silent on the
original source of these funds<,,> and anyone who is not
familiar with the real history of the bulk of these twenty
five million<,> would be led to believe that these funds had
been graciously given by the government out of the
Consolidated Fund<,,> <#\>By reading this Bill and<,> and its
explanatory notes<,> you would have no idea that this money
represents some ten percent of the capital of Metway Bank
<#\>Alternatively it represents the equivalent of two times the
recorded profit after tax for the ninety two financial year
<#\>This translates into a loss of rights in regard to the
benefits flowing from this court action of some twenty two
percent<,,> twenty two cents for each and every share issued
by Metway <#\>That is to say<,> the current share price of two
dollars seventy five would've risen twenty two cents <,> for
two<,> two dollars ninety seven<,> <#\>So as you can see Mr
Treasurer<,,> this represents a significant and substantial
differential for all shareholders in Metway<,,> <#\>I just wonder
what the Treasurer would say to these shareholders if he had
to explain to these shareholders<,> these mums and dads<,> who
have invested in Metway<,> just why each of them had to pay so
much to achieve your financial ambitions<,></I>
