<S1B-031> <2005>
<I><$A>   <#\>Well the<,> Australian Republican Movement's
position<,> is one that based<,> very simply<,> on national
pride and love of country<,,> <#\>We're not seeking to
change<,,> the Constitution of Australia in any<,,>
substantive political sense<,,> <#\>We believe in our
parlimentary system of democracy<,> <#\>We believe in our West
Minister system<,> <#\>The only thing we believe should be
changed<,,> is the crown<,> because Australia is today<,,>
unlike nineteen o one<,,> Australia is today an independent
country<,,> with its own destiny<,> and its own
responsibilities<,> and every office under our
Constitution<,,> no matter how high<,> or how ceremonial<,,>
should be filled by Australians<,,> <#\>If we want to motivate
Australians<,> to believe in this country first and
foremost<,,> then at the top of our Constitutional pyramid<,>
there should be one of our own<,> <#\>We should not have the
monarch<,> of another country<,> whose principle commitments
and allegiances lie elsewhere<,,> representing our nation<,,>
<#\>That is our cause<,> <#\>It's the cause of patriotism<,>
and nothing less  <O>applause</O>
<$B> <#\>That's only half the case, that's only half the case
ladies and gentlemen <#\>Barry Jones
<$C> <#\>Firstly  first of all   I should say
I am not speaking on behalf of the Australian Republican
Movement<,> nor am I speaking on behalf of the government but
ah<,> I se  simply   make this point<,,>
<#\>I think the minimalist position<,> is that chapter two of
the Constitution<,> needs to be changed because<,> if you look
at the way the excutive power is expressed<,> in chapter two
of the Constitution<,> it bears no relationship to reality<,,>
ah <#\>Back in nineteen hundred and one it was put in the
document<,> <#\>It says in section sixty one<,> the executive
power of the Commonwealth is vested in the Queen<,,> and is
exercisable by the Governor-General<,,> <#\>Now<,> in fact of
course that's never been<,> the case <#\>It doesn't represent
what we actually do now<,> with the West Minister system<,,>
<#\>If you go through<,> the section  on the executive power
there's no reference to a cabinate<,,> <#\>There's a reference
to an excutive council<,> which consists of ministers
appointed<,> by the Governor-General<,,> but it doesn't say
how they're appointed <#\>It makes no reference to such a
creature as a Prime Minister<,> <#\>It doesn't say what
happens when there are elections <#\>The<,> assumption is that
we don't really have a political system which leads<,> to a
mandate being acheived by a party which wins an election<,>
<#\>It doesn't represent reality <#\>It says that the
Governor-General runs the armed forces<,> <#\>Well again<,>
that's not really true <#\>He doesn't do it in practice<,,>
<#\>It's as if you were driving around Canberra or Sydney with
a nineteen hundred and one street map<,> and you keep
wondering why it is that you can't recognise the things that
are before you<,> <#\>Now I believe that the Constitution
needs to be changed to reflect<,> the realilty<,> <#\>And one
of the realities is<,> that as we move towards the twenty
first century<,> with a growing sense of our own confidence<,>
our ability to get it right<,> our ability to pursue<,> ah the
democratic ah ethos that we have in Australia and a national
ethos as well<,> that it's time for the change  <{><[><,> <#\>We have our own</[>
<$B> <#\><[>It's time to stop <#\>It's time to stop </[></{>
<#\>Time to stop<,> <#\>How're we gonna get this
<O>inaudible</O> <O>laughter from audience</O> <#\>Mr
<O>inaudible</O> would you like to begin the cross examination
<$D> <#\>You made a very impressive speech<,> and you made it
sound very simple but<,> really you've raised er a lot of
complexities <#\>For instance<,> as I understand it<,,> you<,>
believe that the<,> president ought to be elected by the
parliament<,> and er I  what I'd   like to
know is<,,> how is anybody going to be nominated<,> for the
office<,> and are those people gonna be vetted by the
parliament <#\>For instance<,> are we going to get a situation
in Australia<,> like ya have<,> in the United States with the
supreme court justices and the whole of their lives being<,>
exposed<,,> <#\>Could you<,> perhaps go into that
<$A> <#\>Well I don't know that any of our Governors-General
have had lives that would be quite so interesting but anyway
 <{><[><O>laughter from audience</O></[> <#\>The<,>
the the the there are basically  there are
basically   three choices for electing a president in
a<,> system like ours<,> <#\>One is to have the president
elected by popular election<,> <#\>Now there are non-executive
presidents <#\>That's to say presidents who are heads of state
but not heads of government<,> who are popularly elected
<#\>The president of Ireland is<,> one <#\>He was out here
last year
<$D> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O> </[></{>
     <#\>Well what I <{1><[1>want to know</[1> is about is one 
that <{2><[2>you're involved in</[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>No<,> no</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>But no<,> no</[2></{2> <#\>Le  let   me go on<,> <#\>I don't agree with that
because<,> I don't think  I think   the
position should be above politics<,,> <#\>Now what <{><[>we propose</[>
<$E> <#\><[>It is now</[></{> <O>light clapping</O>
<$A> <#\>No no<,> no<,> <#\>But you see  you
see   the monichas  the Monarchists  
clapped<,> but they  they   didn't think
before they clapped<,>  <{1><[1>because the Governor-
General<,,> <#\>No no<,> no no<,> no<,,> no<,> no<,> no<,>
the<,,> no<,> <#\>You see </[1>  you can
see   that the one distinction between the Republicans
and the Monarchists is manners <O>laughter</O> <#\>The
the<,> the Governor-General  <O>inaudible noise from
audience</O>  the Governor-General   is appointed
in  in   effect by the Prime Minister as we
know<,,> <#\>He's appointed by the Queen acting on the advice
of the Prime Minister and he can <{2><[2>come and go</[2>
<$M>  <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O> </[1></{1>
<$D> <#\><[2>Well the President</[2></{2> can be appointed
<{><[>by the <O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah<,> yeah exactly</[></{> <#\>Now I don't
favour that<,> <#\><{><[>I don't favour that</[>
<$F> <#\><[>Where does he come from<,></[></{>
<#\><{><[>Where does he go to</[>
<$G> <#\><[>How on earth can you have</[></{> a president
who's above poliltics <#\>How on earth can you have a
president who's above politics<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> ah who's elected
by<,> the two houses of parliment with  in  
an election which may not neccessarily reflect who actually
holds the government of the day<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>How can that
person be above politics
<$E> <#\><[1>You can't</[1></{1>
<$A> <#\><[2>Ah</[2></{2>
     <#\>Because if you make it a special majority<,> if you
have a two thirds majority<,> you ensure<,> that the person to
be chosen<,> must have the support<,> of both the Opposition
and the Government 
<$G> <#\> <{><[>But what if the Government changes in the meantime</[>
<$E> <#\><[>That's rubbish <#\>An election's an election</[>
<$H> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> <#\>It assumes you're
gonna get a result<,> Malcolm <#\>You<,> know perfectly
well<,,> that the whole thing could be deadlocked<,> <#\>You
could end up with the ridiculous situation<,> when you have no
head of state<,> when you have<,> nobody exercising the powers
of the Governor-General<,,> because the parliament can't agree
on anybody<,> <#\>Well you only have to sit in parliament a
couple of days to realise that parliament rarely agrees on
anything at all<,,> <O>applause & cheering</O> <#\>So
now now now  so how   are we ever gonna get some
<O>inaudible</O> resolutions <{><[><O>applause</O></[>
<$C> <#\><[>Look<,> I</[></{> 
<{1><[1> look  I  I object to that</[1> <#\>Sometimes we are uniquely incapable of getting
it right<,,> that if anything new comes up <{2><[2><,> then </[2>  then   inevitably<,> we'll get it
wrong<,> <#\>I believe that there would be a sense of
responsibility<,> on both<,> the position of the on  on the   Opposition's part<,> and the Government's
part<,> which which  irrespective   of which
party was in office 
<$E> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>We got it right</[2></{2>
     <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[>Ah<,> an an</[></{>  can we
answer   the question here <O>inaudible</O> on how this
person will be nominated <#\><{1><[1>Will they be</[1> vetted
or not <#\><{2><[2>Can you answer the question</[2> 
<$E> <#\><[1>No<,,></[1></{1> <#\><[2>There is no</[2></{2>
answer<,>
<$A> <#\>Well clearly it's open to the parliament<,> at the
close to  to   vet<,> candidates<,> if it
wished
<$F> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>No no<,> no no<,> <#\>Just  just  
let me finish <#\>The<,> the ah  the
reality   is<,> that the candidate would be
decided <,>  or the candidates  <,> would be
decided and discussed between the party leaders
<$E> <#\>At a pre-selection probably
<$A> <#\> <{1><[1>Well<,> no no no<,> but you see </[1>  <{2><[2>but you see</[2>  
<$?> <#\><[1>A political conspiracy </[1></{1>
<$F> <#\><[2>Which  which   party leaders</[2></{2> <#\>Which party leaders <#\>All of them
<#\><{><[>All of them</[>
<$E> <#\><[>It's just another politician</[></{> once he's
elected Malcolm and you know it
<$A> <#\>What
<$E> <#\>Once there's an election that person becomes just
another politician <O>applause</O>
<$G> <#\>Which there is absolutely nothing wrong with if the
person's performing a political role<,,>  <{><[><,></[> <#\>The
question is what the role is gonna be 
<$A> <#\><[>No but </[></{> <#\>Look  look   the  the   objection to a
popular election<,> is that you will inevitably get<,> a labor
candidate versus a liberal candidate<,> <#\><{1><[1>Now<,>
if you just <,> if you can  </[1><,> no 
<#\><{2><[2>Well it may well <#\>No no no <#\>You may well do that</[2> but if you have a popular election you will undoubtably get a politician<,> <#\><{3><[3>Now<,> now  now   the way</[3> the way to get around
that  the way to get around that  <,,> is either to
have parliament<,> appoint<,> the president<,> or a
combination<,> of the parliment and representatives from the
state parliaments<,,> or to establish um some sort of special
electoral college <#\>Now<,> this is done in a lot of other
countries <#\>I mean<,> I'm<,> I I  I   can
understand<,,> Senator O'Chee saying<,> that our politicians
can't agree<,> <#\>He's one of them<,> <#\>He understands his
own fraility better than any of us <O>laughter</O> but the
politicians in Germany<,> the politicians in India<,> the
politicians in many other countries with non-executive heads
of state<,> manage to agree on these positions<,,> <{4><[4><,></[4>
<#\>They have a sense of responsibility that appearently<,,>
Senator O'Chee and his colleague there do not<,> <{5><[5>and
I believe</[5> I believe<,,> <O>applause</O> I believe  I believe   the Australian public will ensure<,,>
that our politicians do have the responsibility<,> to reach an
agreement<,> in the interests of the nation<,>
<$E> <#\><[1>Oh it might even be a democrat do you think</[1></{1>
<$F> <#\><[2>I'm asking him which party  which
party   leader</[2></{2>
<$E> <#\><[3>Any election's gonna give you a
poliltician</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Well<,> well Malcolm</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Malcolm<,,> why do you  why do
you   <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Malcolm</[5></{5> 
     <#\>There're a couple of things that need to be made here
if I might say Andrew <#\>The first one is this<,> <#\>I get
very angry when Malcolm makes a speech where he thinks<,> he's
got a monopoly on nationalism<,,> <#\>Believe me<,> the people
are  who   sit in the parliament are good
Australians<,> <#\>All of them<,,> <#\>We have a different
recipe for how we think Australia can be  best
be   served<,> but I've never yet met anyone who's come
in to make Australia worse<,,> from whatever side of
politics<,> <#\><{1><[1>Now for you to sit there and
just  for you to tell us  <,,> that you</[1> are
the best ah nationalistic person that Australia's yet produced
<{2><[2>it really<,> <#\>Well it sounded awfully like it</[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>No I'm not <O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>But I didn't say that </[2></{2><,>  I didn't
say that  
<$C> <#\>Browyn  <{><[>Browyn Browyn <O>inaudible</O></[>
<$E> <#\><[>No just a minute<,> <#\>No no no Barry </[></{>
<#\>Let me just finish
<$C> <#\>Yes alright <O>laughter</O>
<$E> <#\>The point is this <,,>  the point is
this  <,> that if there is a good argument for why we
need this change<,>  <{1><[1><,></[1> then I'm prepared to listen<,>
<{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>I haven't heard one yet<,> and it would make it
very much simpler Malcolm<,> if you could tell us<,> in trying
to define what is your particular scheme<,> and yours is only
one<,> <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>Mr Tanner over here has another one<,>
and Barry despite his ah<,> demurring tonight<,> has really
got another agenda as well <{4><[4><,,> <#\>And it's a</[4> political agenda because the Labor party has a resolution<,,> <{5><[5>but the point is this</[5><,> which particular Republic in the world do you want to emulate<,> <#\>Is it the United States <#\>Is it Indonesia <#\><{6><[6>Is it India</[6> <#\>Is it Germany<,,> <{7><[7><,></[7> <#\>Which one do you wanna be like
<$C> <#\><[1>Yes </[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
<$A> <#\><[3>Sure</[3></{3>
<$C> <#\><[4>Tell me about that <O>inaudible</O></[4></{4>
<$G> <#\><[5>But you're bringing in political issues here
<O>inaudible</O></[5></{5>
<$C> <#\><[6>No it's Australia</[6></{6>
     <#\><[7>It's Australila</[7></{7>
     <#\>It's the Australian one
<$A> <#\> <{1><[1>Well I mean the the the  the   problem<,,> <#\>No no no no no precisely</[1>
but  but   you see<,> the Republic that that I  I don't want to   emulate any Republic in
the world<,> <#\>I want us to have a rep <#\>A Republic in this context<,> simply
means a country with a head of state that isn't a hereditary
monarch <#\>That's all it means<,,> <#\>I mean <{2><[2>there's no</[2>
<$E> <#\><[1>We've got a unique system <#\>Why do we want to change it </[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>But Commonwealth</[2></{2> also means Republic
<#\><{><[>We are the Commonwealth of Australia</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yes yes <#\><mention>Commonwealth</mention></[></{> is the English
translation of the Latin word <O>inaudible</O>
<#\>We we  oh we   both know that <#\>Isn't
that amazing <O>laughter</O> <#\>The<,> the
um<,> the the<,> the um<,> the um no the  the   point is we don't need<,,> to labour through
the Constitutions of other countries<,,> <#\>I mean<,> we have
a system that works<,> <#\>No no <#\>We
have a  we have a   sys  system  
that works<,>  <#\>The problem here  the only problem </I>
