<I><$A> <#\>The Federal government<,> has come under fire from a
leading AIDS organisation<,> for delaying the introduction of
uniform AIDS discrimination laws <#\>It's eighteen months<,>
since a white paper was released full of recommendations for
law reform<,> but not much of it<,> has been implemented<,>
Sue Daniel prepared this report
<$B> <#\>Currently<,> if a person is sacked<,> because their
employer has found out they're HIV positive<,> in some states
there isn't even an anti-discrimination board to take up the
complaint <#\>The process of addressing the problem has been
further delayed<,> since the government set up more working
parties to look at legal aspects of the White Paper <#\>The
Australian Federation of AIDS Organisations<,> or AFAO has
criticised the government<,> saying the states simply couldn't
wait<,> for the discussion papers to be finalised <#\>This has
resulted in a mixed bag of laws<,> some of which are actually
contrary to the aims of the White Paper <#\>AFAO president<,>
Bill Whitaker<,> says this is illustrated by the situation in
Queensland<,> where legislation has been proposed<,> which
will protect people on the basis of HIV<,> but not on the
basis of sexual preference
<$C> <#\>Now the reason<,> I think why we need this is quite
obvious is that ah<,,> there are ah ah would would obviously
be quite a lot of gay men in Queensland who are at ah<,> risk
to HIV infection<,> who would wanna come forward for testing
and counselling<,> but they're hardly going to do that<,>
um<,> in Queensland<,> if there is a likelihood of ah<,> them
being discriminated on<,> on the basis of their sexuality and
obviously counselling about HIV infection ah<,> would involve
some discussion of that so it's really quite an absurd
situation in that some one with a gay man with HIV infection
in ah Queensland would be better off than a gay man who's not
HIV infected <#\>So this is just one example<,> where states and
territories have gone off on a tangent and are not following
what's in the White Paper and are not followed following
what's in these ah legal discussion papers
<$B> <#\>The Federation says the government could solve the
problem by empowering the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity
Commission to act on discrimination in the workplace <#\>The
Commission was given wider powers in nineteen eighty nine<,>
but its role is limited to conciliation and recommendation
Bill Whittaker says<,> if it was given more teeth to override
the states and territories<,> the public would be better
protected
<$C> <#\>And if they get those teeth we would like ah<,> them to
advertise the fact that they have these ah powers much more
widely<,> so that ah<,> the community at large<,> both the
employers and the employees and ah indeed the whole
community<,> is aware of what ah redress is available<,> ah
for people who're discriminated against<,> and I think if<,>
if we created that scenario<,> the number of instances of
discrimination ah breeches which ah we are constantly
receiving would ah<,> would drop <#\>And I have to say that for
each case of discrimination or alleged discrimination or
breech of privacy<,> it really doesn't help us in our ability
to control the epidemic <#\>It doesn't create that climate of
confidence<,> which is so necessary for people to seek
counselling and treatment and testing<,> and indeed for our
education programs to work
<$B> <#\>The Federal Human Rights Commissioner Brian Burdekin
agrees<,> saying the Commonwealth has the constitutional power
to give greater protection to people who are HIV affected
Burdekin says<,> although he doesn't blame the government for
spending more time trying to get it right<,> changes are well
overdue
<$D> <#\>There's been some considerable<,> um correspondence and
discussion between us and the Federal Government<,> and
people<,> who are affected about this and it's our belief as
we've conveyed to the government<,> that there is
sufficient<,> constitutional power for the Federal Government
to move<,> to put in place<,> ah greater protections<,> um for
people who<,> ah are HIV affected and<,> I've got a very
strong view<,> that that ought to happen <#\>I don't say that
with any disrespect<,> to the states but<,> my view is based
on the fact that in the late<,> twentieth century I believe we
ought to have uniform standards and protections across this
country<,> particularly in the area of human rights and
antidiscrimination law <#\>I see no reason nor have I ever
heard<,> any argument that I think stands up<,> that there
should be greater levels of protection in say Victoria than
there are in Tasmania and New South Wales <#\>I would hope<,>
that in the near future there will be Federal legislation not
only<,> putting in place uniform Federal protections<,> in
relation to people with HIV in the area of employment<,> but
indeed that that protection<,> and indeed even greater
protection<,> would be extended in areas such as housing<,>
the delivery of goods and services<,> and and so on
<$B> <#\>Well<,> given that a lot of people believe that laws<,>
don't actually change anything<,,> why should we place faith
in the Human Rights Commission in this area 
<$D> <#\>Well that's an interesting question <#\>I agree that
law<,>
in and of itself<,> um doesn't change anything <#\>I think<,>
with respect though<,> that's sometimes er seen in an
oversimplified way <#\>If you look at the history<,> of the
prevention<,> of discrimination in the area of sex
discrimination or race discrimination<,> you will find that
the law certainly wasn't a sufficient condition<,> because it
relates to what I said about<,> public education<,> and
dispelling ignorance on which discrimination<,> and
stigmatisation is usually based<,> but the law in my view is a
necessary condition <#\>It is a necessary pre-condition<,> one
important pre-condition<,> for educating the public and
informing the public that there are certain things that aren't
acceptable<,> in our community <#\>Now<,> that legal sanction in
and of itself<,> obviously won't be sufficient<,> but in my
view<,> and it it's a considered view<,> that I've formed over
some years<,> trying to work in this area<,,> without that<,>
kind of legal protection it will be<,> considerably more
difficult<,> to educate the public effectively<,> and as I
said at the end of the day<,> to provide proper redress<,> for
people who may be discriminated against<,> whether on the
basis of HIV or whatever other ground<,> and so<,> the law of
itself won't change anything<,> but in summary<,> the law<,>
and changes in the law<,,> I believe<,> are an important<,>
part<,> of<,> informing the public<,> and<,> producing<,>
changes in public attitudes </I>

<I><$A> <#\>Times have changed since Eddie Stanley taught himself
to
be a lawyer back in Brisbane during the First World War <#\>For
these days you can find at least one law school in every
capital city of the Commonwealth <#\>Sydney has four and
Melbourne three<,> New law schools are a growth industry in
academia <#\>In the last twenty years more than a dozen have been
established<,> and while Flinders University has just
appointed a Foundation Professor<,> to head Adelaide's second
law school<,> Melbourne's La Trobe University will upgrade its
legal studies department<,> to a fully accredited law
school<,> probably next year<,> But despite this growth<,>
demand for places far exceeds supply<,> and the law schools
with the best reputations<,> only accept entrants from the top
two or three percent<,> of school leavers <#\>In fact<,> many
students who may make good lawyers can't get into law at
university<,,> despite a recognised shortage of lawyers in the
community<,> So why don't law schools take more students
Professor Bob Baxt heads the Trade Practices Commission <#\>He
used to be Dean of Law at Monash University and he says<,>
it's all<,> about funding<,>
<$B> <#\>That's really quite an appalling ah<,> scenario that we
face ah <#\>University law schools are funded pra perhaps the
worst of all faculties and the government ah<,> ah and the
universities themselves I think<,> need to be<,> persuaded
that ah funding needs to be increased
<$A> <#\>Attempts to get the Federal Government to provide more
money have been met by education minister Dawkins saying<quote> it's
the universities themselves not Canberra<,> that law schools
should be going to</quote> <,> <#\>This presents a problem says Susan
Campbell<,> coordinator of the professional practice course at
Monash Law School<,,> but how did it come about
<$C> <#\>Basically it goes back to the fact that the scientific
faculties<,> who need all the whizz bang technology<,,> got
the money and<,> it was thought that<,> law schools only
needed lots of books<,> The<,> former Dean of Monash Law
Faculty<,> Professor Bob Baxt always used to say<quote> the law
library is our laboratory</quote> <,> and he used to say that to
anybody who'd listen<,> and it gradually started to pay
off<,,> but the fact is<,> that the scientific faculties
particularly the high prestige one of medicine<,,> got into<,>
the funding cake early on<,> and established<,> a ratio of
funding which enabled them to pay for all their high tech<,>
before<,> visible high tech like computerisation became
relevant to<,> the humanities and particularly law
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,> We heard Mr Dawkins say<,><quote> don't blame me <#\>I
provide the money <#\>It's up to the<,> Vice-chancellors and
ah<,> so forth to distribute it<,> and if you think that law
schools are hard done by then<,> it's ah<,> the task to go and
convince the Vice-chancellor that you need more of the
cake</quote> <,> <#\>Is this a valid argument to<,> your way of thinking
<$C> <#\>I can't quote<,,> facts and figures and statistics<,>
but<,> as<,> I understand it that's only a partially valid
argument <#\>Yes <#\>On the surface it is a matter of<,> how the
university chooses to divide its own cake internally<,,> but
as I understand it the funding that comes from the
Commonwealth to the university<,> is<,> if not now going to be
calculated on a basis which gives<,> law and various other<,>
disciplines which<,,> the present government regards as less
relevant to the national debt<,,> a lower per capita<,> ratio
of funding<,,> than<,> the ones that the present government
regards as<,> of greater<,,> purely economic value<,> so that
I think that argument is only partially valid but there
certainly is room<,,> for the law faculties to go to their<,>
university administrations<,> but then of course they have to
fight against the doctors<,>
<$A> <#\>Universities were one of the first government funded
areas to be caught up in Canberra's campaign to reduce the
size of the public sector<,> and avoid budget deficits<,,>
and with the increasing expectation that they demonstrate
their worth<,> and pay their way<,,> the saleable commodity
can start to push other academic priorities<,> such as the
pursuit of knowledge<,> back down the priority list<,> Law
schools are increasingly providing nuts and bolts training for
future legal practitioners<,,> the sort of things graduates
used to learn<,> after completing their degrees<,,> as article
clerks or more recently at transition courses<,> like those
offered by the New South Wales College of Law<,> or the Leo
Cusin Institute in Melbourne<,,> But too great an emphasis on
vocational training<,> is a cause for concern for<,> Sir
Zelman Cowen<,,> former Governor-General<,> academic lawyer<,>
and<,> Vice-chancellor
<$D> <#\>The law is different<,> from most other areas of
knowledge and from most other disciplines <#\>It comprehends in
one or another part of it<,> most other human activities in
society <#\>This means<,> that its practitioners<,> or at least
its master practitioners<,> it's complete lawyers<,,> must
have a sufficiently wide general education<,> as well as a
mastery of the law<,> to be able to provide the services of
the law<,> for a complex and a diverse society<,> Lawyers
tend to forget<,> that they have in fact learned most of their
law<,> and all of their professional skills from the time they
began to practice <#\>The well-intentioned attempts to provide
in
law school for the student<,> all<,> all<,> that he needs in
practice<,> unless ruthlessly pruned<,> will succeed only<,>
in overloading him <#\>As well the wider or the more extensive
the coverage of subjects<,> the thinner<,> and the
shallower<,> the teaching inevitably will be
<$A> <#\>Sir Zelman made those comments to the Law Council of
Australia's Legal Education Conference<,> at Bond University
last month<,> Of course these days<,> not all law students
are <quote> he</quote> <#\>Women<,> now make up half<,>  the enrolments<,> and
some people think that it's quite alright for law schools<,>
to teach a comprehensive range of practical skills</I>
