<I><$A> <#\>Hello again and welcome <,> this evening to<quote>Life
Matters</quote><#\>We're going to talk about drought tonight <#\>What
happens to the farming families when they have to give up
their properties, their livelihoods and their life styles <#\>How
do they adapt to whatever comes next <O>inaudible</O> years of
experience <O>inaudible</O> if they're trying to hold on to their
properties and only barely <#\>To whom do they turn for help <#\>Or
do they even ask for help <#\>County people are tended to pride
them selves on their independence, believing that hard work
and self reliance will see them through anything <#\>But now
farmers have been forced to rethink some of their most
fundamental attitudes <#\>Drought has hit areas all over
Australia, but no where is it having such a wide ranging
effect as Queensland <#\>It's the state most dependent on primary
industries for it's income and yet fourty five percent of it
has now being drought declared <#\><O>inaudible</O> is facing a long
dry winter <#\>Joining <O>inaudible</O> are Pat and Bryan Good from
their property in the red soil mulga country of South West
Queensland in the Mitchell district, <,> Tim Butler <,> who
happens to be the ABC's regional manager at Long Reach, but
who's also actively involved in supporting struggling farmers
and the Reverend Noel Park in Toowoomba <#\>He's the director of
Life Line for the Darling Downs in South West Queensland
Welcome to you all <#\>And do you, Noel Park first, do you travel
around the country side talking to people <#\>Do you perceive any
fundamental change in outlook among farmers
<$B> <#\>I think there has been a very definite change in terms of
they're seeking <,> help now <#\>They, <,> in the past, have been
very reluctant to talk about what's happening to them
personally <#\>From the last six to twelve months that has
changed dramatically <,> and people are now recognizing that
<,> they have to acknowledge the damage that it's doing to
their lives and to their families
<$A> <#\>And the business of acknowledgement, what does that
produce in people
<$B> <#\>Well, there's a whole range of issues, which uh range
from those who are acknowledging that uh <,> they are the ones
who are going to loose a farm that's been in the family for
generations, that <,> they're not going to be able to pass it
on <#\>It's uh it's a change of identity <,> to have to
acknowledge for instance that they need to depend on some sort
of benefits or <,> assistance from welfare organizations or
social security, challenges their whole identity as people of
the bush <#\>Uh it really it undermines all that they understand
about them selves <,> and puts them in a very vulnerable
position as to who they <,> disclose to
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\><,> And now Pat and Bryan Good <#\>You are in this
position of having decided to leave, aren't you, your your
property, your much loved property <,> <#\>What's your primary
<,> feeling about <,> having come to terms with that
<$C> <#\><O>cough</O> I I, <,> well, I think it's just <,> well <#\>As the
time goes on getting closer to <,> the time we've decided to
go, <,> that uhm <,> I suppose uh <,> the feeling and
emotion's starting to catch up with me now, <,> uhm simply
because <,> <#\>Uh, I'm in the process of just <,> trying to put
the sheep together what I've been feeding for <,> you know,
two years and <,> and they're not real good condition a lot of
them and and, you know, going to shear what will we can off
<,> off what used to be a top producing flock and uhm <,> then
probably disposing of a lot of 'em <#\>And that's probably going
to be the hardest <,> you know, thing that I'm going to have
cope with
<$A> <#\>And Bryan when are you going to leave
<$C> <#\>Probably <,> within the next two or three weeks <#\>Uhm <,>
we've decided <,> we've been fortunate enough <,> uhm <,> till
uhm through a legacy which has allowed us to buy a house in
Toowoomba, <,> to uhm <,> to go down there <,> <#\>And uh we want
to be settled in, uh well, <,> partly settled in or <,> the
wife and the <,> other children <,> to the two girls that are
on boarding school at the moment, for when they come out of
<,> boarding school on the end of term on the uhm <,>
eighteenth I think it is
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>And uh <,> you know sort of start settling in there so
<,> they'll become day <,> day children <,> uh for the next
term <#\><{><[>The uh</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>And</[></{> 
<$C> <#\>boarding school is just <,> out of the ranch now 
<$A> <#\>And Pat <,> uh how do you feel <,> your own views and and
watching Bryan
<$D> <#\>Well I'm I'm uh <,,> I've gotta try and be uh, you know,
brave uhm for for Bryan's sake, uhm you know, we've uhm <,> <#\>I
think the biggest thing that Bryan and I have been uhm to uh
talk <,> talk thing out with each other <#\>I think that's the
biggest thing <,> uhm to be able to sit there and talk things
out
<$A> <#\>How much of that have you done
<$D> <#\>That <#\>A lot, a lot, namely at night, uh, you know,
instead of sleeping we talk 
<$A> <#\>You're lucky really I suppose there are a lot of couples
to whom that would be tough
<$D> <#\>Yes, yes <#\>Uhm <,> there would be that uhm Bryan and I uhm
was, you know, we we're very close and uh we've been able to
uh see it through this far and we'll see it through
<$A> <#\>Now uh the what are you going to do with the sheep <#\>Uh uh
like you are you just going to walk or are you going to be
able to sell them or what
<$D> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>No <,> <#\>So what you you you going to shoot them, are you
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>Uhm <,> well, I've got, you know, a quality flock
there, uhm <,> it ain't the time to hold on to the nucleus
of, you know <,> <#\>Well, even though I haven't had lambings for
two years through the drought I, you know <#\>I failed for the
last two years, they haven't been joined this year, so that'll
be three years of missing out on lambs <#\>And uhm <,> I sort of
got a middle aged group of some quality young sheep there that
<,> I'm going to try and save uhm <,> and, you know, the rest
of them will just have to be shot, yeah
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>I don't even know how many I'll bring to the yards <,>
<#\>Sort of two years ago I shore sort of five and a half
thousand <#\>Last year it was four thousand <#\>And ya know, I don't
know what, you know, two and a half, three might come to the
yards this time if there're lucky <,> <#\>Uhm but a lot of em
won't walk in <#\>I don't think, they just <,> <#\>They've been on a
mulga diet for two years now and <,> and uh <,> well they're
just not coping with it anymore
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$D> <#\>We won't be able to shoot them our selves, actually pull
the trigger <#\>We'll get someone else to come in and do that <,>
for us
<$A> <#\>Well look, that's, you know, like that's an interesting
decision that you've made <#\>Uh because even, <,> tell me if I'm
wrong, but that sounds to me as if there's an acknowledgement
about <,> limits that you place on your self in terms of how
much you can bear <#\>And the impression I get is that a lot of
farmers just <,> keep on going, you know, they batter on <#\>And
of course <,> the toll it takes of them is terrible
<$D> <#\>Well, I think that that that that's right, yeah <#\>And uhm
<,> it's it's starting to show in the bush now, you know
<#\>We're a third genera well I'm third generation here <,> <#\>Uhm
<,> <O>cough</O> you know I've got a son that, <,> well I'm not
gonna be able to pass it on to <,> <#\>And uh, you know, it's
it's very emotional <,> <#\>And uhm, you know, I've just seen <,>
around me <,> <#\>Cause we're only a smaller concern compared to
some other places and uhm <,> that has been fairly well off
<#\>And uhm even they're <,> starting to really struggle now and,
you know <#\>If if there's no break in the season <,> within, you
know, six months, I think it's uhm some of those big concerns
uh uh are going to uh probably come to the crunch the same as
us small smaller fellows
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$D> <#\>And you know <#\>Most of this country around here <,> it's
predominantly sheep country with cattle as as it as you know,
sort off <,> opportunity, I suppose, or <,> uhm <,> you you
know, better better seasons they run a few more, but but
predominantly sheep wool growing country <#\>And uhm <,>, you
know, ma the majority of the country, I'd say eighty percent
of this country <,>, it's all second, third <,> generation <,>
you know, country <,> it's it's it doesn't change hands <,>
<#\>And that's <,> sort of <,>, is going to change really shortly,
I think
<$A> <#\>Yeah but
<$D> <#\>You can't even sell it, you know <#\>I'm I'm trying to sell
my place at the moment <,> and there's just no market there
<$A> <#\>Well, just go on to uhm Tim Butler now, who as I said
works for the ABC in Long Reach <#\>But Tim, you went through
this, didn't you, as a South Australian dairy farmer and you
went bust in the eighty two drought <,> <#\>Can you, what's your
prime memory <,> of your own readjustment <,> at that time
<$E> <#\>Geraldine, I think that the fixed memory I have of the
eight two drought, is that awful knot you get in your gut when
you realize that <,> all your hopes, all your dreams, all your
aspirations, all your plans are disappearing quietly down the
gurgler <#\>That they're being smothered in a in red ink on the
balance sheet <#\>And it's that awful <,> sinking feeling is
knowing <,> that no matter how hard you work, no matter what
you do <,>, there is nothing that you can do about it <#\>But uh
my <,> big f uh f uh remembering <,> the big feeling that I
had, was one of <,> of relief, when we actually made the
decision <,> that we were going to leave <,> <#\>And that was the
hardest decision I think we had ever made <,> <#\>We weren't <,>
fourth generation graziers or farmers, so uh it was possibly
easies for us easier for us so that the way is for others, but
<,> once we had crossed that hurdle, it's a a psychological
barrier, once we had actually decided <,> that we couldn't go
any further, that uh our future was limited and that we had to
go <,> then uh we started looking forward instead of looking
backwards and that was the that was the big decision day
<$A> <#\>And are you seeing that in your work in Queensland, or
not yet
<$E> <#\>Well we are <#\>Uh but unfortunately uh I feel a lot of
people are causing themselves unnecar unnecessary <,>
suffering, because they're not <,> making that decision <,>
early enough <#\>We're seeing people who are hanging on and
hanging on until they go down for the third time, until
their position is absolutely unredeemable, there's nothing
they can do and uh then <,> they start looking for help or for
assistance <#\>Now there is assistance available through a number
of channels <#\>There's help in all sorts of areas, from <,>
stress counseling to financial management to loan
restructuring <#\>All sorts of things are possible, but <,> if
your position is <,> absolutely unredeemable before you start
looking for assistance, then uh <,> it's too late <#\>There's uh
there is uh not a lot that can be done
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>Noel Park <,> that's interesting <#\>The sort of people
who come to that decision earlier, rather than later, <,> you
must have seen this with Life Line, who are they and why do
they <,> in effect become fatalistic earlier than others
<$B> <#\>Geraldine, I think basically it is the women of the rural
community who <,> are the first to realize the inevitability
of their situation <,> <#\>I guess the uh <,> the plain fact is
that those who make the earliest decision are those <,> who
have the ability to talk as uh Bryan an <{><[>Pat</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
<$E> <#\>were saying they can <,> <#\>Many families can't <,> <#\>Uh the
farmer's <O>1 syll</O> attitude to <,> uh difficult times is just
what Tim was talking about</I>
