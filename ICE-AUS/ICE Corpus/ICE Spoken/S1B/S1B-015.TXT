<I><$A>   <#\>My sister who works in public service in
Canberra was telling me that<,> the way they read<,> long
difficult documents if they just<,> hand out bits<,> around
the group and each person just reads a bit and comes back and
pools it and that's the way so I thought that<,> maybe
we should<,,> um  that everybody's been really
good   about doing the readings so um<,> I think if we
break into two or three groups next week<,> just on the basis
of what people read and um<,> play it by ear<,> <#\>Okay
um<,,> now would it or wouldn't it help<,> if I put up<,> a
few questions to refer to um <,>  to guide  
our thinking <#\>I'm at least that prepared <#\>Okay but ah
so<,,> um and then we'll just all pitch in <#\>So okay <#\>So
maybe we do need a bit of theory and we do need to know why it
is that it's such a bad thing to be a functionalist
<w>'cos</w> obviously that's the thing you can't be isn't it
<#\>Um<,> so do we understand what we mean by a functionalist
explanation<,,> <O>sounds of chalk on blackboard</O> or not
<#\>Well maybe that's<,> a goal for today<,> <#\>I'll try to
get these<,> down<,,> um just put up a couple <#\>So um<,,>
is the family<,,> <O>cough</O> <#\>When I say capitalist I
really mean constituted by capitalist social relations<,>
<#\>Patriarchal<,,> um<,,> <#\>And then the  the   other thing is is the family<,,> <O>pause
filled with coughing chatting</O> <#\>And I think this is sort
of the debate isn't it <#\>Is the family separate from the
state or does the state intervene in the family like it says
split between public and private or<,,> is the family part of
the state<,> an arm of the state<,,> <#\>Has anybody um got
any further questions just to um <,>  to
put   on the board as the focus before we just start
discussion<,,> <#\>Right <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Is it going
around
<$?> Yep
<$A> <#\>Good good good<,> <#\>All right<,> <#\>Now I don't
even have the<,> questions people <#\>Okay um<,,> well
there's some questions on the board and there's some questions
here um<,,> <#\>Who wants to kick off from<,> what they've
read <#\>Just<,> contribute anything to this discussion about
the family <#\>What's the relationship between the family and
the state the family and patriarchy<,> the family and
captialism um <#\>Is family a good or a bad thing<,> <#\>Is it
<{><[><,></[><,> private and is the state public<,,> <#\>Okay
<O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\><[>Um</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>Okay well I read the um  the   Riber
article<,> and um<,,> he <,>  the  
interpretation of the family that she gives is<,> <#\>she
calls it the modern notion of the family<,> but she says it's
different from the bougoise
<$A> <#\>Don't talk to me
<$B> <#\>Sorry <#\>Which is different from the um bourgoise
ideology<,> in terms of um<,> the  the  
family is no longer private <#\>It becomes caught into the
public<,> sphere and<,> you get the impression that it's<,,>
partly because of<,,> capitalism <#\>Like some of the
um <,,>  the   ideas that run through are like men
thought that if  if   the family wasn't
functioning correctly then<,,> these  these  
men wouldn't be able to function properly in a capitalist
society therefore the family had to be<,> maintained and
therefore that was supposed to be the woman's job
<$A> <#\>Sort of to get them washed and scrubbed up
<{1><[1>and</[1> on the doorstep of the workplace at
<{2><[2><,></[2><,> seven thirty a m or nine a m or
<{3><[3>something</[3>
<$?> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmhmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3><,> yeah um<,> <#\>She talks about
um<,> domestic science as one of the ways in which um they
placed all these like demands on women by saying that um<,>
women<,> <#\>They've like <,>  the woman had
to   run the family like<,> men ran the country<,> type
um <#\>I'm trying to explain it to you <#\>Okay so they <,>  they   turned apparently the domestic
into a science by applying like scientific principles and like
efficiency and like things like that and um<,,> <#\>What does
she say
<$A> <#\>This is Australia isn't <{1><[1>it</[1> that she's
writing about <{2><[2><,> <#\>Yeah</[2> <#\>Who else read
Riber <#\>Anyone<,,> <#\>We're relying on you<,> <{3><[3>as
the Riber authority</[3>
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Yep yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3><O>clears throat</O></[3></{3> <#\>The Riber
authority hey <O>laughter</O> <#\>Okay so she looks at um<,,>
ways in which um domestic science as a  as
a   study affected<,> the household and
<{4><[4>um<,></[4> they established like um colleges<,> of
domestic science and they introduced domestic science into
schools um trying to encourage more women to um<,,> sort
of<,,> <#\>Well apparently she says that there were more women
going to work and there was the  like the
birthrate   was lower so therefore<,,> one of the ways
to keep women at home was to<,,>
<$C> <#\><[4><O>coughs</O></[4></{4> 
<$D> <#\>Make it more interesting <O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>Yeah yeah <#\>But it's like in like <#\>Yeah boost
the status <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> domestic life
<#\>It's like you know you're doing a really important job
here so you may as well do it well and this is how it should
be done um
<$C> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>Like here's <#\>I'll pass this around
<#\>It is  but here it says  
<quote> Australia's greatest asset to baby<,> <#\>Premature
baby admitted weighing five and a half pounds discharged five
and a half months later weighing fourteen pounds <#\>A tribute
to the Plunkett system</quote> <O>laughter</O> and over the
page it says<,> <quote> baby must not be allowed to fall asleep
at his work <#\>Mother should</quote> <O>laughs</O> <#\>And
that's the baby's work<,> <#\>His feed<,,> <#\>And it says
<quote> mother should not be reading<,> nor should she be
talking <O>laughter</O> <#\>A M P M and feed by the clock
<{><[><,> <#\>Don't trust to luck</[></quote> 
<$D> <#\><[>I take it</[></{> <#\>Yeah I take 
<O>laughter</O>  I take it   Riber was talking about
the fifties<,> or earlier 
<$A> <#\>Earlier actually
<$B> <#\><{><[>Ah she</[> 
<$D> <#\><[>Early</[></{><,> twentieth century sounds right
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> 
<$A> <#\>Anyway we'll pass it round <w>'cos</w> the the
the  the   photos of the home science um<,,> um<,,>
sort of schools and colleges are quite entertaining actually 
<O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Yeah and it's just shocking that um<,,> the women
that were sort of like the advocates sort for the domestic
science were actually prominent women like wo  middle class women   that <{1><[1><,></[1><,> <#\>Yeah
<#\><{2><[2>It's like</[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yes</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>So how </[2></{2>  what   did
you make of that <#\>How come<,> <#\><{><[>How come</[>
feminists would be ah promoting
<$B> <#\><[>How come</[></{> 
<$D> <#\>It's valuing a um <,>  a   woman's
role
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$?> <#\>Mmm
<$E> <#\><w>'Cos</w> of the status
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>But wouldn't they've looked for the
underlying<,,> reasons why women were being pushed in that
direction
<$D> <#\>But if options for women to <#\>Like it  she says   more women were joining the workforce but
if options for women were limited um<,> it's not it's  you're   less likely to say well you know why is it
such a big deal that women should be mothers if the
alternatives <#\>Like you've gotta consider the economic um 
<{><[>assump</[> <#\>You know<,> getting a husband to  to   live <#\>Financial aspects <#\>I mean
there may not've been an option to sort of<,> make the focus
turn back to<,> being a mother um<,> problematic
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Mmm true <#\>Who here had science at school<,,> <#\>I
mean<,> is it still like that
<$B> <#\>Yep
<$A> <#\><{><[>Well they call it</[>
<$D> <#\><[>They're</[></{> apparently changing it
<#\>They're um pooling I think um<,> like textile and design
home science and industrial arts to make it into one
department <#\><{><[>They're calling</[> it design  a design and technology   course <#\>Like<,> it
was<,> home economics and um I mean I <,>
 I   know a man with two teenage boys and they do  both do   what would be domestic science and
when I was at school like boys wouldn't be seen dead doing it 
<#\>It's much more<,> nutrition
<$A> <#\><[>The thing</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>Is it
<$D> <#\>Yeah <#\><{><[>It's more practical</[>
<$C> <#\><[>When I did it it was</[></{> still based on the
nineteen fifties<,> 
<$B> <#\>Like what yeah
<$C> <#\>Theories and<,> books and<,> things
<$A> <#\>So what was it like
<$C> <#\>Um<,> extremely um<,,> extreme <#\>Encouraging<,>
girls to get into um um<,> heterosexual relationship<,>
marriage<,> childbearing <#\>That <,>  the
roles   <O>inaudible</O> um encouraged
<$D> <#\>They even look at um <{><[><,> early childhood</[>
stuff don't they
<$C> <#\><[>And to see</[></{><,> 
     <#\><{><[>Yeah</[>
<$D> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <#\>Like um<,> how children should
play you know <#\>Play time on their own's important just as
it is playing with other children <O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Okay so<,> what  of   the theories
on the board<,> I mean where would you locate <#\>I mean this
is Corinne Riley's interpretation<,> but<,,> what would she
be<,> saying about the relationship between the state and the
family then<,,>
<$B> <#\>The family is like a ch <,,>  is an arm
that   um capitalism uses um<,>
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> their functioning I think
<$A> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{>
     <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>But ne  it's based on  <,> mum dad
two kid  two point two kids   or whatever it
is<,> and for them to stay together I think
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>So you say</[></{> it's a functionalist<,>
analysis that says that
<$B> <#\>I think she's saying that's the way it is <#\>I don't
know that <#\>Yeah not necessarily advocating that's what it
should be but yeah she's saying that's the way it is<,>
<{><[>I think</[>
<$A> <#\><[>She's</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>I mean she's certainly saying that the state
intervened<,> in the family and regulated it and like that<,>
um thing <O>inaudible</O> as the key baked by the clock is<,>
absolutely symbolic of the <{1><[1>state</[1> regulation of <,>  of   the family
<{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2>
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Mmhmm</[2></{2>
     <#\>But then like increasing like  she
says   like increasing the status of<,> work done
within <,,>  work done within the home   is
actually um<,> more reason for the government to control<,,>
<#\>Like everything women did <#\>Like<,> um the way they
shopped and what they bought and<,> what they served and how
it was prepared like everything was just<,> <#\>There was a
right way of doing it<,> you know
<$A> <#\>I mean can you see any logic in that<,,> or is it
just like interference or and  and   control
and<,> regulation is all negative
<$C> <#\>I think the states <O>inaudible</O> um<,,> that justify <,>  justifies   that they um were
teaching good for values and <O>inaudible</O> and good
sanitary<,> and they gave them welfare <{><[><,></[><,> and<,>
so<,> um<,> I mean by giving welfare it's a control thing any
way so you know <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
<$F> <#\>But<,> it  I   mean on a postive<,>
aspect if there is one the  the   whole
concept of the  the   family mum dad
everything is breaking down as  as   sort of
educational tools<,> for those who <#\>I mean I didn't grow up
with young children so I would be hopeless with young children
so I would have to seek outside information um <#\>I mean it
would provide people with a sort of model if <,>
 you know if   it's not assuming that the parents live
in the  the   village or the city with<,>
someone's mother near<,> to sort of help<,> <#\>It  it's   a way of teaching them <#\>I mean I don't
agree with it but<,> that might have been a positive side of
it
<$A> <#\>So you you're saying it was a response to the
increasing<,> isolation of the nuclear family in an urban
setting
<$F> <#\>It  it   could've been and also I
mean<,> as  as   um you know we've got
further into the twentieth century there's so much  such a morass   of sort of information<,> <#\>It's
like if you set out how to find out how do something there's
you know twenty conflicting ideas and it's often hard to sort
of distinguish which you think is the  the  
right one if there is if you can be <{><[>so</[>
absolute<,> in value judgements but<,> at least you know if  for   some people it might have been <quote> oh
well you know this is the right way</quote> and they wouldn't
feel guilty if you know  if   they followed
all the regulations sort of thing<,,> 
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
<$G> <#\>If you look at what regulation did<,> <#\>Regulation
defined tasks and as soon as you define tasks around the
household you can then you know produce products which people
can buy to make those tasks easier to do so whereas
be  so the washing   became like  like   a  a   specific task where
you could use the washing machine and the drier and the
tumbler and that stuff<,> and so everything then<,> was<,>
<#\>There was a kind of ah  kind of   terrain
there where you could  where before you
couldn't   really produce any products for it whereas
now after the state had regulated it and kind of defined all
the positions<,> then it was just open slather on producing
products which people have to have<,> in order to fulfil the
regulation which was laid down for it <#\>So I think the
family fitted into<,> especially around that time um of
regulation and kind of the fifties and forties and fifties
with all the new products<,> <#\>They kind of  they
became   a real ma  like a place  
for <,>  for   capitalism to penetrate and to
enter into the family<,> and the<,> state intervention just
assisted that</I>
