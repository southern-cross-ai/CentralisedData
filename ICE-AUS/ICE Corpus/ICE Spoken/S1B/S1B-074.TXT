<S1B-074> <2001>
<S1B-074a> <1890>
<I><$A> <#\>Another point worth<,,> keeping in our minds too
is that it's twenty percent<,> deficit funded<,> but in
addition there's a free<,> property<,,> <#\>So that's that's probably another ten percent
<$Z> <X><#\>Yeah</X>
<$A> <#\>Or or five anyway
<$B> <#\>Five yeah <{><[>anyhow</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah yeah</[> </{><,,>
<$C> <#\>Can I ask um<,,> the<,> the the the promise of a <,> a 
relationship with ah<,> ah Salvation Army property <#\>Do they is that filled out at all um
<$D> <#\>A Salvation Army property<,,> <#\><{><[>This
factory</[> is an a Salvation Army building
<$C> <#\><[>Yeah um</[> </{>
  <#\>It indicates that the Salvation Army in Sydney<,>
could be interested in a co-operative venture
<$D> <#\>Yes <#\>They're not offering us a property
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>No <#\>I think what they would offer us<,> would be
referrals from their<,> homeless youth program the Oasis
Centre in Crown Street<,,> in Surry Hills<,> <#\>I think it's
more likely that's the sort of co-operation they would offer
<{><[>um</[>
<$D> <#\><[>And</[></{> that's what it needs too
<{1><[1>because</[1> it you're dealing
with a client group that have a whole package of needs<,> and
so<,> if the Salvation Army was dealing with their sort of
<{2><[2>social</[2> work needs and their accommodation needs
and<,> health care and drug rehabilitation<,> and Work Ventures
was providing employment training<,> that's the kind of<,> co-
operation and joint venture <{3><[3>that</[3>
<$A> <#\><[1>Sure</[1></{1>
  <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
<$C> <#\><[3>And</[3></{3> in fact there's some<,> benefit in
being<,> um<,,> a bus ride away <{1><[1><,></[1><,> from<,> <{2><[2>the sor</[2> the those <#\>Dissociating
those inhouse problems from the work <{3><[3>problems</[3>
<$D> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
  <#\><[2>I ah</[2></{2> 
  <#\><[3>Yes</[3></{3>
<$A> <#\>As long as we can make it a seamless service
<$D> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>So that<,> we don't get glitches in between you know
that we're saying two different things <#\>We're<,> kind of
pushing in two different directions
<$C> <#\>Mmm
<$D> <#\>So there'd be a case management
<$A> <#\>We'd have to <{1><[1>really</[1> handle it well
<{2><[2><,></[2><,> <{3><[3>um</[3>
<$C> <#\><[1>Oh yeah</[1></{1>
  <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
<$Z> <X><#\><[3>Can we</[3></{3> find a couple of ex er navy or
ah er ex army types <O>laughter</O> who know how to handle
these</X>
<$D> <#\>Does <@>forenameM1</@> have a twin brother
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>I'm I'm not sure
<@>forenameM1</@> 'd find this up to his taste<,>
<{1><[1>just</[1> quietly but um I<,> I I I get your<,> <{2><[2>your</[2> your general point the
<$Z> <X><#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
  <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
  <#\><O>inaudible</O></X>
<$A> <#\><{1><[1>The other thing is St <@>churchname1</@> 's St <@>churchname1</@> 's</[1> parish<,,> have a factory unit<,>
which they own<,,> and <@>fullnameM2</@> indicated at some
point to me<,> that they might consider <{2><[2><,></[2><,,> when
their lease comes due <{3><[3><,> for</[3> renewal looking
at<,> a project happening there an employment
project happening there so<,> you know we should keep
that in our minds as <{4><[4>well<,></[4> as a possibility
<$Z> <X><#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1></X> 
<$B> <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
  <#\><[3>Mmhmm</[3></{3>
<$Z> <X><#\><[4>Absolutely</[4></{4> 
  <#\>Yeah <#\>Oh great</X>
<$B> <#\>Thanks <#\>I think we<,>
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$Z> <X><#\><[>Do do you want a do you want</[></{> do you want a motion that we <#\><O>inaudible</O>
a motion that we um</X>
<$D> <#\>That we thank <@>forenameC</@> for his
<{><[>wonderful</[>
<$Z> <X><#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> <#\>Thank
<@>forenameC</@> <,> and <,> and that we
wish to pursue it</X>
<$D> <#\>So we could continue conversations with
<{><[>the</[> Salvation Army and DEET and so on
<$Z> <X><#\><[>Yeah</[></{></X>
<$A> <#\>Yep
<$B> <#\>Okay <#\>So moved <@>forenameZ</@> um a motion
of thanks <,> and seconded <@>fullnameD</@> um a
motion of thanks to<,,> <@>forenameC</@> for ah his work<,> on
this project and ah<,,> in principle that the Board's<,,> you
know interested in pursuing the idea further<,> <#\>Mmhmm<,,>
<#\>Okay three point three <#\>Board member portfolios 
<$A> <#\>I've got a<,> handout on this one<,,> <#\>I know
your board paper said it was attached but um<,> ah when I
found that it'd ah it'd been scrubbed off well not saved on the ah on the system when it had been typed up last <,> last ah week so I couldn't put it
together in time<,,> um<,,> <#\>From discussions with
ah with board members to date here's what I've
come up with in terms of board roles<,> <#\><@>forenameB</@> 
agreed he would ah continue as the ah S-B-E-C person and<,>
formally become the chair<,> of that ah of
that committee<,> um<,> <#\>The ITEC repair centre
<@>fullnameM3</@> <,> indicated he would to continue in that
role
<$Z> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O></X> 
<$A> <#\>All right <#\>You need to scrub that <#\>Yes <#\>I
beg your pardon <#\>I missed that one<,,> um<,,> ah<,> <#\>At
the moment<,> both ITEC and Maroubra don't have a um a
Board<,,> a a ce a divisional council 
<#\><@>forenameM4</@> 's in the process of putting one
together<,,> um <#\>Membership and Board search<,> <#\>I'm
proposing that<,> together with <@>forenameM4</@> and
myself<,> as the<,> staffing support and maybe
<@>fullnameM5</@> <,,> as well<,> ah <@>forenameB</@> not
<@>forenameBmisspelt</@> <,,> <#\>I don't know where I went
wrong <{><[>there</[>
<$Z> <X><#\><[>I'm Jom</[></{> and he's
<@>forenameBmisspelt</@> <O>laughter</O></X>
<$A> <#\><@>forenameB</@> <@>forenameM5</@> and
<@>forenameH</@> I'm suggesting might continue<,> in that
area<,,> ah<,,> <#\>Subject to an announcement later in this
meeting ah we may need to find an O H and S rep if<,> the
Board still wants that as a Board committee as distinct
from<,> a staff committee <#\><@>forenameH</@> 's agreed to be
on the promotions committee<,> <#\><@>fullnameD</@> to
replace<,,> ah <@>forenameZ</@> on the ah restaurant project
committee <#\>At the moment we don't have a finance or
personnel committee<,> <#\>They're<,> mooted but not<,,>
um<,,> <#\>Then<,> the next group of committees are non board
committees anyway <#\>The other board portfolios<,> <#\>ITEC
division we don't have a Board member<,> yet to fill that<,>
vacancy but um<,,> Maroubra <#\><@>fullnameC</@> agreed he
would<,> act as the board<,,> link with the ah with Maroubra division<,,> um<,,>
<#\><@>firstnameZ</@> and <@>firstnameB</@> of course with
the<,> other two divisions on which they're on the council
<#\>Corporate Services <#\>I don't know whether we need a<,>
Board nominee as such<,,> but
<$E> <#\>Interestingly enough the staff have asked can they
have one
<$A> <#\>Have they
<$E> <#\>Yeah <{><[><O>laughter</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>Have they</[></{> 
  <#\>Well we may need some more board members before we'll
have a solution to that 
<$E> <#\>They all thought this was a terrific idea
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm<,> 
<$E> <#\>Um they said <quote>who's ours</quote> 
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Well <{1><[1>we'll ah</[1> we'll
give that one some thought <#\>Industrial relations
and personnel um <#\>These are more<,> portfolio areas that
don't necessarily have a committee <#\><@>forenameM6</@> has
agreed he would continue on that role <#\><@>forenameM6</@> 
has agreed he would continue being a resource for us in the
area of finance<,> um but he would like us to have an
additional board member with that expertise<,,> um
<#\><@>fullnameD</@> has expressed interest in being our link
person with new projects <#\>You've<,> heard his enthusiasm
for<,> at least one of them<,> um <#\>I've asked
<@>fullnameC</@> if he would<,> take two other roles <#\>One
is the review of the company mission and values that we're
proposing <#\>I think the link with the Institute for Values
Research<,> in that project<,> would be very valuable<,>
working with <@>fullnameM5</@> and myself<,,> and on property
matters ah he's agreed he<,> would be willing to take on<,>
that role <#\><@>forenameB</@> you may want to <{2><[2><,></[2><,,> 
participate in some way there <{3><[3>but um <,>
 but I think you</[3>
<$Z> <X><#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1></X> 
<$B> <#\><[2>Bye bye bye</[2></{2> 
<$D> <#\><[3>That means you have to design
everybody's</[3></{3> ah office fitouts <O>inaudible comments
amid laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Um so those are those are ah kind
of the areas as they're unfolding um <#\>We we don't expect any<,> fitouts at this point
<O>laughter</O> <#\>Maybe we'll we'll 
armtwist you
<$B> <#\>Maybe next year
<$A> <#\>Yeah when we've got you in um <O>laughter</O> ah
<#\>Legal and insurance matters <#\>We we I think that should be a priority in our board
search<,> <#\>Somebody to be on the ITEC division and
corporate services division <#\>The link<,> board member with
those divisions I think is desirable<,,> <{><[>um</[>
<$C> <#\><[>Um</[></{>
<$A> <#\>Yep
<$C> <#\>Are you suggesting that we should<,> find a<,> lawyer
for the board 
<$A> <#\>I think it would be desirable <{><[><,></[><,>
<#\><@>fullnameF2</@> is a name that's in my head
<$C> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
  <#\>Is she a lawyer
<$A> <#\>She her training is in law<,>
<#\>Her her <,,> her original degree is in
<{><[>law</[>
<$F> <#\><[>Journalism</[></{> 
<$Z> <X><#\>Who is she<,,> <#\>What is she doing now</X>
<$A> <#\>Um sh I don't <{><[>know what</[> she does for a living
<$F> <#\><[>She's freelance</[></{>
<$C> <#\>She's a <{><[>freelance <O>inaudible</O> consultant</[> 
<$F> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>She's a freelance</[></{><,> C R 
<$A> <#\>Yep
<$F> <#\>Mmm<,,> 
<$A> <#\>She's not been practici she's not
practised law I don't think since she graduated
um<,,> <#\>I think there're a number of other issues we need
to think about in terms of board representation<,> <#\>I think
we need to think about the issue of gender balance<,> <#\>We
need to think about some<,> potential for some ethnic
diversity<,> <#\>I think we should think about
<$D> <#\>Scottish as well as Welsh
<{><[><O>laughter</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>I think we should</[></{> 
<$F> <#\>You're right <#\>We are Anglican after all
<O>laughter</O>
<$Z> <X><#\>Irish American <#\>What the heck <O>laughter</O></X>
<$D> <#\>Can they sign the thirty nine articles
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>They don't have to do it on this board
<@>forenameD</@> <O>laughter</O> <#\>I had to do that in ah<,>
the new college Board but I
<$D> <#\>With some soul searching <O>laughter</O>
<$C> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>More than soul searching <O>laughter</O>
<$E> <#\>Cross your fingers that's all <O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes um anyway<,> <#\>Some<,> moral dilemmas ah
<#\>Anyway um<,> I think representation from some of the other
parishes<,> that we're seeking to bring in<,> is an issue we
should be thinking about um <#\><@>fullnameM5</@> and I had a
tremendously positive and productive discussion with
<@>fullnameM7</@> the bish the regional
bishop and ah and 
<@>fullnameM8</@> <,> during the week<,> and he has in fact<,,>
encouraged us<,> um<,> <#\>He's he's 
identified parishes that he thinks are compatible with us and
even suggested ah people we should talk to <,> so and I think he's keen to be supportive of
<{><[><,></[><,> our work
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
  <#\>Mmhmm
<$A> <#\>Um it'll it'll remain to be seen
how that unfolds but<,,> he's still trying to earn his ah<,,>
right to exist I think in this part of the diocese<,> but um
<$D> <#\><@>fullnameM8</@> <{><[>or</[>
<$A> <#\><[>No</[></{> <#\><@>firstnameM7</@> 
<@>fullnameM7</@> 
<$D> <#\><@>fullnameM7</@> 
<$A> <#\>Yeah well I mean he's a new bishop<,,> building his
own credibility with clergy<,> in this region<,,> um and I I don't think he's finding it altogether easy
from<,> the messages I <{><[><,> got</[>
<$F> <#\><[>No <#\>I can</[></{> imagine <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>But anyway um
<$F> <#\>We've got a member of our congregation who's female
and just done a<,> P H D in refugee law so <O>laughs</O>
<$A> <#\>No <#\>Well there's some there's
some kind of territory we could ah explore ah<,,>
<#\>So<,> what I <,> I thought maybe we
should canvass some ideas not necessarily here and now at the
board meeting for new board members but<,> given the imminence
of ah <@>firstnameG</@> 's resignation<,> tonight um I think
<O>laughter</O> <#\>That's my understanding unless he's
reneged um
<$Z> <X><#\><{><[>What if we don't let him go</[></X>
<$G> <#\><[>Unless <@>forenameB</@> says</[></{> no
<$Z> <X><#\>What if we say no <O>laughter</O></X>
<$A> <#\>I think we need to be looking for a couple of new
board members <{1><[1>within</[1> the next two months<,,>
um<,,> <#\><{2><[2>We</[2> we we have an
approval from the A G M to have up to ten 
<$Z> <X><#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1></X>
<$B> <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
  <#\>Yep
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Um well can can <,> I ask each of
the the board member or<,> any anyone of you<,> um to put your thinking caps
on<,> and ah send to <@>forenameA</@> <@>forenameZ</@> or
I<,,> um<,> <{1><[1>a a </[1> list of<,>
names of people that you think might be possibilities and and why you think they might be
<{2><[2>possibilities</[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Names</[1></{1> 
<$D> <#\><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2></{2>
<$A> <#\>I think <,> I mean I could<,>
probably draft of a bit of a job description for a board
member that might be useful as people think about that too
<#\>We haven't had one of those <{><[><,></[><,> up to date but I think it<,> might not be a<,,> bad
idea
<$B> <#\><[>Mmhmm</[></{> 
<$Z> <X><#\>No remuneration package <#\>That's a wise thing</X>
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>We don't have to worry about that
<$B> <#\>So um before the next board meeting we should get
this board search<,> committee together and<,,>
<$A> <#\>Begin some work on it
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>So if in the next week or so<,,> you can<,>
get that<,> job description out and ah <,>
 and people can get back to one of us with<,,> any
ideas you've got<,,> it would be very handy<,>
<$A> <#\>Is everybody happy with the<,> way I have<,,> um
articulated your<,> conversations with me<,> in terms of<,>
how you are involved<,,>
<$D> <#\>Can I ask a question about the board reps<,>
<#\>There are people from<,> the origins of<,,> Work Ventures
in the dim past<,> <#\>Is there a kind of strata that's fallen
away that might be encouraged to come back<,,> or is it
just<,>
<$Z> <X><#\>I think we've hired them all <O>laughter</O></X>
<$D> <#\>You know I'm asking <w>'cos</w> there's<,> a kind of
a memory and a history and a direction <{1><[1><,></[1><,> that comes
out of that that <#\>I appreciate very
much being <#\>I mean I've always known about it<,> but<,> I
appreciate that there's that <{2><[2>you know</[2> people who
have that depth of experience<,,> <#\>I just
<{3><[3><O>inaudible</O></[3> <#\>I don't I
don't know the people myself but
<{4><[4><O>inaudible</O> between continuity and new blood</[4>
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1> 
  <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
  <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
  <#\><[4>I think I think there is</[4></{4>
  <#\>Yeah <#\>I agree that it's it's 
good to have a balance on the board of<,> both old and new<,>
um I guess<,> <@>forenameB</@> <@>forenameZ</@> and <,,> and <@>forenameM6</@> have been long
term on <{5><[5>the</[5> relatively long term on
the board <#\><@>forenameH</@> 's been involved<,> not quite
since the year dot but not far
<$D> <#\><[5>Yeah</[5></{5> 
<$H> <#\>Since the year dot of ITEC
<$A> <#\>Yep <#\>Eighty six</I>


<S1B-074b> <111>
<I>
<$A><#\>But if you were to say that the deposit for us or Work Ventures' half on a total purchase of three hundred and fifty was thirty five thousand we could come up with that tomorrow and wouldn't even notice it 
<$B> <#\>That's right in th <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>From</[></{> Work Ventures' point of <{><[>view</[> it would be not petty cash exactly but certainly not a lot of money
<$B> <#\><[>Sure</[></{> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>And and the annual fees will just be the rent we're already paying anyway
<$B> <#\>That's what I'm saying we  what we're going to be paying in August is more than the highest rate you can get from any bank now paying back your business loan</I>
