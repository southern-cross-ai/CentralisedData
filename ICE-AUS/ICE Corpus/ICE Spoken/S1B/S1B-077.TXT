<$B> <#\>Um correspondence that we've got is the regional 
council that we no longer belong to notice of annual general 
meeting <#\>And do you think we need to go to that or 
<#\>I don't think so
<$A> <#\>Okay
<$B> <#\>There was three different lots of chocolate to sell and 
those photographers with the family portraits um can give us a 
date in August which would fit in with Father's Day <#\>Um 
whether or not you wanna do it or not we'll discuss later huh
<$A> <#\>We'll bring that up in general business
<$B> <#\>Yeah <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> no items <#\>It's been a lean lean 
month hasn't it
<$B> <#\>It has <#\>My daughter prob'ly loses them
<$C> <#\>Convenient
<$C> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>I don't look for them
<O>laughter</O>
<$?> <#\>The she loses the de- deals <O>laughs</O>
<$A> <#\>Alright we'll go into our reports then John 
<#\>Treasurer
<$?> <#\>Treasurer's report <O>inaudible</O> <#\>We're coming 
to a bit of a dilemma <#\>Our petty cash tin shows twelve 
hundred dollars <#\>And our bu- what's budgeted for drawing out 
of um April May is prob'ly another four or f- four to six 
thou-<w>'bout</w> four thousand dollars more to come out 
according to the uh one of the previous year <#\>We 
either hang out for Trivia Night and hope Trivia can make a 
pretty good profit so we can put something into it and keep us 
away from uh drawing from the term deposit <#\>Or the 
alternative is to draw from the te- term deposit <#\>Um the 
minimum figure to draw is five thousand dollars <#\>So it's 
really um not quite certain which way to uh approach this <#\>We 
either hang out for a bit longer till uh June advice when we can 
make another draw or make a draw on it <#\>Or else we make a 
draw now and see where we travel
<$C> <#\>On that point John the uh there there are two two 
things
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\>Yep
<$C> <#\>One um I I had a talk with Pam about this <#\>I got 
your note by the way and thank you for that <#\>It's very clear 
and explained the the situation <#\>And uh we're going to sort 
of uh for the next couple of months any rate till it stabilises 
dodge the P and C and take pay our bills out of the of the fees 
money that are come in for the K L A in that area and not come 
to you
<$?> <#\>Oh right <#\>To the <O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\>Mmhmm
<$?> <#\>Mmhmm
<$C> <#\>So there will be a marked drop-off of uh um withdrawals
<$B> <#\>Withdrawings
<$C> <#\>Right
<$?> <#\>Okay
<$C> <#\>Um but I I think you have to we have to consider the 
future
<$?> <#\>Yes
<$C> <#\>And the the key operating fact would be when is the 
next lot of the the term deposit due for renewal because it I 
think if you make a withdrawal before that due date you do lose 
uh quite a bit of interest that you'd otherwise accrue
<$?> <#\>Mmm
<$?> <#\>Mmm <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>So um do you know the date that it
<$?> <#\>The due date is uh June <w>'bout</w> the fifteenth of June
<$C> <#\>Well I I think we could be be in a better position then 
to make a decision then to make a decision about that then
<$?> <#\>Mmhmm
<$?> <#\>Okay
<$C> <#\>And we'll hold up the um or we'll hold up passing on 
anything for the K or for the K L A costs and pay for it out of 
the the other the other side of the ledger
<$?> <#\>Right
<$?> <#\>Mmhmm
<$?> <#\>Okay <#\>And we'll hold till the fifteenth
<$C> <#\>And make a decision say coming up at the next meeting
<$?> <#\>Yeah
<$?> <#\>Next meeting to see where we travel
<$C> <#\>Yeah
<$?> <#\>Okay <#\>Thank you
<$D> <#\>Well there we go
<$A> <#\>Can you explain that John <#\>You saying then that our 
total savings are what twelve thousand seven forty
<$?> <#\>Yeah what we've done is invest we we've what's has been 
previously done investments have been <#\>As As the 
balance of P and C has grown we've skimmed off the or cream 
taken the cream off and invested into a term deposit which is 
currently yielding only about six per cent per annum rate <#\>Um 
and that compounds each uh quarter
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm
<$?> <#\>Uh it's so it only really grows about <w>'bout</w> a 
hundred and twenty odd dollars a quarter
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm
<$ZM> <X><#\>So is this common to <O>inaudible</O> 
inflation where the <O>inaudible</O> is replenished by 
<O>inaudible</O> funds</X>
<$?> <#\>Yeah
<$ZM> <X><#\>Is This is This is what happened before this 
time and every couple of years</X>
<$?> <#\>Yeah
<$ZW> <X><#\>Yeah</X>
<$ZW> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O> some funds <O>inaudible</O>

<#\>And uh we have deliberately
<$ZM> <X><#\>But every second year's gonna run short this time 
of the year</X>
<$C> <#\>We have We have run it down because we feel that uh 
even though we don't want to be completely pennil- penniless 
just because we gotta we may have a special project that need 
that comes up <#\>But by the same token w- we don't want to be 
hoarding the money away that we raise <#\>We wanna spend it on 
the kids and on the school while the kids are here

<$C> <#\>No <#\>It doesn't <#\>I've still got that <#\>Um the 
reason why I've still got it is that I wrote I I wrote to the 
Chief Secretary's department to uh seek permission for the 
registration of that fund as a charity and I haven't received a

<$C> <#\>No they're a very active canteen committee
<$B> <O>laughs</O>
<$C> <#\>They are definitely on the ball about raising funds 
<#\>There's hot dog day coming up and they're looking at the 
possibility of um having the canteen or a stall at the district 
cross country because this school it's teachers are are are 
organising <#\>It's our turn to run the Castle Hill District uh 
Cross Country out at Crestwood this year <#\>And um the schools 
take it in rotation and now our turn <#\>Uh so um I know Gary 
you spoke to Sue today
<$ZM> <X><#\>Yes uh <O>inaudible</O> <#\>She may well be looking 
for volunteers when the when the day comes around <#\>Now it is 
a gre- it is a good money-raising opportunity for the school 
because I mean you got a captive audience of um I would say 
thirty or forty children from um twelve to eighteen eighteen 
schools including their parents and everything else and 
uh</X>
<$ZM> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O></X>
<O>laughter</O>
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>Yeah
<$ZW> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O></X>
<$C> <#\>And you don't And you don't
<$B> <#\>Thirsty children
<$C> <#\>You know you can all sorts of goodies like uh Mars Bars 
and and and and things like that
<$B> <#\>Energy food <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>Yes <#\>And uh there's there's a good mar- a good 
margin on those <#\>And they're pretty <#\>They sell pretty well 
<#\>So there is a chance to make quite a few uh dollars on the 
day <#\>And it's great to see the canteen committee looking at 
the grasping the opportunity with both hands
<$A> <#\>We'll move onto the Principal's report
<$C> <#\>Oh <O>inaudible</O> thought I did it <#\>Uh
<O>laughter</O>
<$C> <O>laughs</O> <#\>Thanks <#\>Well I've I've I've only got 
one thing to say
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> given you an intro
<$C> <#\>Thank you Miro <#\>Um <O>inaudible</O> and then 
Gary's gotta a couple of things and then Kath <#\>Um you'd 
prob'ly read in the news-sheet that uh we have two new teachers 
at the school <#\>Um I dunno might be stealing your thunder Kath
<$ZW> <X><#\>No ?</X>
<$C> <#\>No <#\>Right <#\>Good <#\>This is all I've got any rate 
<O>laughter</O> <#\>Uh the um uh <#\>Quite quite suddenly <#\>We 
knew about Sue Elliott late last term who was transferred to to 
Ryde <#\>Um and um uh we have Andrea Adamsons who came from 
Canley Vale Public School uh on on Two E now which has become 
Two A <#\>The A for Adamsons <#\>And um the um <#\>That's 
just We just did that to confuse everybody <#\>No we did it to 
try and make it the same as <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Uh and 
uh during the holidays Anne Rodriguez after sixteen years at the 
school was transferred to Roselea <#\>Anne didn't wanna go 
<#\>She just felt that you know after sixteen years you want to 
change <#\>I can understand that <#\>Um and um uh she's teaching 
Year Three I think this year uh the rest of this year at uh 
Roselea and in her place we we have a Mrs Heather Thomas um who 
has taken over One T now instead of One Orange <#\>So the first 
class that got off the colour kick <#\>And they've gone back to 
um the initials which we use now in every every <w>infants'</w> 
grade except Kindergarten who still have the colours <w>'cos</w> 
we don't want to confuse them <#\>And they got the colour badges 
and everything <#\>So we'll keep them uh Red Blue and Green 
<#\>Besides that with Mrs Green teaching Kindergarten Green it 
it's good
<$D> <O>laughs</O>
<$C> <#\>Uh and then of course just to make make things happy 
and contented when you get to the primary you go by the room 
numbers <O>laughs</O> <#\>Any rate that's about it <#\>Uh we 
welcome those teachers um and uh I I'm I'm sure that they 
they've made a very promising start <#\>They came yesterday and 
they came back today <#\>So that's good <#\>Um they're got big 
smiles on their faces and they think the kids are great <#\>So 
uh it's a er even though we we do uh when you lose 
experienced members of staff uh there's always uh the loss 
<#\>And uh we certainly have a loss in losing those two uh 
members of staff but we we have been uh fortunate to have 
them replaced by two very pleasant and experienced uh teachers
<$A> <#\>Thank you very much
<$C> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Oh I might bring it up in general business Gary
<$ZM> <X><#\>Okay <#\>Alright</X>
