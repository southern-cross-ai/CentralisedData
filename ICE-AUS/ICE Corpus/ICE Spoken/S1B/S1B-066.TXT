licence as a private private inquiry agent or as a commercial 
agent
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\><,>Mr <@>surname1</@> perhaps ah I should just tell
you 
that ah <,> a number of witnesses have already been called before 
the Commission from the <@>companyname1</@> group <{1><[1>and 
ah</[1> those include <,> persons I think you would know such as 
Miss ah or Mrs <@>Surname2</@> <{2><[2>and ah</[2> <,> Miss 
<@>surname3</@> and Mr <@>surname4</@> himself <{3><[3><,,></[3> 
<#\>Now <,>during your time at <@>companyname1</@> have you ever 
obtained either directly or indirectly any confidential 
information from any government department or authority
<$B> <#\><[1>mmm</[1></{1> 
  <#\><[2>mmhmm</[2></{2>
  <#\><[3>Yeah, right</[3></{3>
  <#\>I object to answering that but yes I have
<$C> <#\>Yes well <,> Mr <@>surname1</@> to avoid the
necessity of 
your continuing to object when asked questions on that subject 
I'll make a declaration under section thirty eight <#\>Is that 
something you're familiar with
<$B> <#\>No but it's a continuing objection is it
<$C> <#\>It has <{><[>that effect</[>
<$B> <#\><[>I understand that</[></{>
<$C> <#\>Under the provisions of section thirty eight of the
I C A 
C act nineteen eighty-eight as amended I declare that all answers 
made by the witness to questions relating to his handling of 
information emanating from government departments or authorities

<$B> <#\>Thank you
<$C> <#\>Yes Mr <@>surname5</@> 
<$A> <#\>Ah what types of information
<$B> <#\>Um motor transport information
<$A> <#\><,> Yes anything else
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>Criminal history records
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\><,> Ah <,> information from electricity
authorities
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\><,,> So it's purely motor transport and nothing
else
<$B> <#\>Sure
<$C> <#\><,> Well were were you aware
while 
working at <@>companyname1</@> of other types of government
information <{><[>being obtained</[>
<$B> <#\><[>I was just thinking</[></{> while you said
that 
<#\>I was aware in relation to electricity I was aware of maybe 
over over three or four years one or two 
instances of an agent and quite honestly I wouldn't remember
which 
one it was who obtained information over the telephone from one
of 
the county councils <#\>But I think it was the way
I 
recall it it was just simply a phone call in um seeking
the
information that was given over the phone freely
<$C> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>But that's the only instance I can recall otherwise
<$C> <#\>No no knowledge of criminal 
histories
<$B> <#\>No
<$C> <#\>No knowledge of anyone else in the office dealing
with 
<@>fullname6</@> 
<$B> <#\>I knew <@>fullname6</@> <{><[>by</[> sight only
as and I knew him as only as 
being a friend of ah <@>fullname4</@> 's
<$C> <#\><[>Yes</[></{>
  <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>And probably over the six years that I was at 
<@>companyname1</@> I would have seen <@>surname6</@> <,> maybe 
<,> once a year <,,>
<$C> <#\>Do you know <@>fullname7</@> 
<$B> <#\>Yes<,,>
<$C> <#\>Know him as someone who use to work there
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>That's how I know him <#\>I didn't know him 
before that
<$C> <#\>Didn't know him when he <{><[>was a</[> police 
officer
<$B> <#\><[>And I haven't</[></{>
  <#\>No <#\>And I I and I haven't 
seen him since he left the office
<$C> <#\>You have no knowledge of ah <,> information being 
provided by him to Mr <@>surname4</@> before<@>surname6</@> was 
used
<$B> <#\>No I've got no information concern I've
got 
no knowledge of that <#\>Sorry
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>Yes Mr <@>surname5</@> 
<$A> <#\>Well now in relation to the motor transport
information 
that was obtained who was the source for that information
<$B> <#\>I only knew that person as <@>firstname8</@> 
<$A> <#\><,> Well how were the requests made of him
<$B> <#\> By the telephone <#\>Oh well
he he would ring in
<$A> <#\>Yes <,> <#\>And over what period of time was he the 
source of the R T A information
<$B> <#\>Well he was the source over
the all 
of the years that I was in the position of being the manager of 
the surveillance area <#\>Prior to that um <,> it was all sort
of 
hi hi higgledy-piggledy and I think he possibly was one of a 
number um but um what happened when I took over as the manager
is 
that the business had grown to where it actually needed some 
monitoring ah in terms of <#\>People were virtually falling over
each 
other doing picking up or duplicating jobs
and 
things like that <#\>And ah <O>clears throat</O><,>
I I think ah 
at that stage and this would be going back three and a 
half three three and a half years ago that
um 
I was just told by one or two maybe even more of the agents there 
at the time and quite honestly I don't know I
wouldn't 
know who that was that that there was 
a source that they had named <@>firstname8</@> and that he would 
ring in <,> <#\>And prior to that prior to
that 
time I was unaware of even the R T A information coming in <,> 
<#\>I but no I feel it was but ah
<$A> <#\>Well until when did <@>firstname8</@> continue to
be the 
source
<$B> <#\>Um oh
<$C> <#\>Just just a moment Mr Mr <@>surname1</@> before you <{1><[1>go on</[1> 
<#\>You said prior to being told <,> of <@>firstname8</@> 
<{2><[2>you</[2> didn't know of R T A but you said it was 
higgledy-piggledy prior 
<$B> <#\><[1>Sorry</[1></{1>
  <#\><[2>Sure</[2></{2>
  <#\>Well I think the agents were getting it themselves 
<{1><[1><,,></[1> at that stage <#\>I mean it was a prior to that it we it had had been a not a lar not as large 
an organisation as it it had then grown to
be 
<#\><{2><[2>Um</[2> and ah I think that if any of the op operators at that stage were getting that type of 
<{3><[3>information</[3> they were they were 
arranging it themselves <,> <#\><{4><[4>Because</[4> I I saw no indication of it coming through the office
<$C> <#\><[1>Yes</[1></{1>
  <#\><[2>Yes</[2></{2>
  <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
  <#\><[4>Yes</[4></{4>
  <#\>Yes <#\>Yes Mr <@>surname5</@> <,,>
<$B> <#\>I mean if it did it may have been rung into them
while 
they were there but I I wasn't aware of it
<$A> <#\>Did <@>firstname8</@> er at some stage er cease to
be the 
source for R T A information
<$B> <#\>Yes um
<$A> <#\>When was that
<$B> <#\>That was a while oh <,,> maybe twelve months before
I 
left it <#\>Around um anything from maybe fifteen to nine months
um 
<#\>My memory's not so clear on that
<$A> <#\><,>And ah when exactly did you leave
<@>companyname1</@> 
<$B> <#\>In August <O>cough</O> nineteen ninety
<$A> <#\><,,> Well now you said he would ring in <,> <#\>Was
that 
to obtain requests for the information
<$B> <#\>Sure
<$A> <#\>And how was the information supplied
<$B> <#\>The same way
<$A> <#\>Was he paid for the information
<$B> <#\>Ah yes
 <$A>  <#\>And how was he paid
<$B> <#\>In cash <,>
<$A> <#\>And how was the cash given to him
<$B> <#\>By hand
<$A> <#\>By whom
<$B> <#\>Um usually by myself <#\><{><[>Well I</[>
<#\>Sorry 
I know of no other instance than by myself
<$A> <#\><[> well now</[></{>
  <#\>Well what about when you were um away or on holidays or 
sick if that ever occurred <#\>Who would look after
<$B> <#\>I had three weeks holiday in nineteen eighty-nine
and 
that's the only holiday I ever had at <@>companyname1</@> 
<$A> <#\>And how er <O>cough</O> what 
was the 
arrangement in relation to how you would transfer the cash to
him
<$B> <#\>Um there was no regular basis um <#\>Although the
formula 
was always the same there was no regular like there 
was no weekly monthly or thing like that um and so 
the er just on a ring in situation um he
would 
say um um <quote>can I get some money now</quote> 
<#\><{1><[1>And  would</[1> <#\>Ah would give a number of um items and I would've 
probably kept a rough tally of what that was and ah 
<{2><[2>that</[2> ah <#\>He'd be outside the office 
or on the corner or something like or usually on the corner 
of the office where it was at the time ah at such and such a time 
and he would arrive and um <,,>
<$A> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>
  <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
  <#\>Now how often did you pay him
<$B> <#\>It varied um <#\>Probably never less frequently
than a 
month but sometimes it would run to six six 
to 
eight weeks <,,>
<$A> <#\>And was that er <,,> over what 
period of time did you actually look after the payments
<$B> <#\>The three probably the three
years
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>Do you know how he was paid before that
<$B> <#\>No <,> <#\>Although as I sayI was I 
suspect possibly by by individual 
agents if that <#\>But to answer your question no I don't know
<$A> <#\>And where was <@>firstname8</@> employed
<$B> <#\>I have no idea of that
<$A> <#\>Well where did you think he was employed
<$B> <#\>Somewhere that had a computer
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>I mean honestly I have no idea whether he was
police R T 
A or I mean even an insurance company who had that access <#\>I 
don't know
<$A> <#\>Well what did <@>firstname8</@> look like
<$B> <#\>Um he'd be about five ten ah he had dark hair oh 
aged 
about <,>middle thirties <#\>The I the 
description I'm giving you now would be say um two years 
old
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>Um <#\>Then aged middle thirties um um <,,> ah
medium 
to slight build um no distinguishing features on his <#\>Did I 
give you his hair colour dark
<$A> <#\>Um yes I think you did mention dark hair
<$B> <#\>No real distinguishing features <#\>He never had a 
moustache at any stage that I knew him or a beard or scars um 
<#\>Always always when I saw him he had
casual 
clothes on <,,>um um
<$C> <#\>Complexion
<$B> <#\>Ahin sum he was always
suntanned in 
summer and a normal about my skin colouring
in 
winter <#\>But normally alway I mean in 
Summer he'd turn up in shorts and you could see he spent
a 
lot of time at the beach
<$C> <#\>Well was he ah did he have a
swarthy 
<{1><[1>Mediterranean</[1> look or did he look <{2><[2>like</[2> 
the typical sun drenched Australian or what
<$B> <#\><[1>no</[1></{1>
  <#\><[2>no he was</[2></{2>
  <#\>Um <,> not ah I didn't pick him as 
being immediate migrant <{><[>look</[> <#\>You know I wouldn't 
say that you know he had a Slavic look or a or 
a Levantine look or a Spanish look um <,> but I on the other hand I suppose he didn't look like a 
Bondi Beach life saver either <#\>Um he was um
<$C> <#\><[>Yes</[></{>
  <#\>More like a Manly one
<$B> <#\>Yeah <O>laughter</O> <#\>No he was
quite I 
mean he he had a a 
strong 
looking face <{><[>um</[> um <#\>He didn't speak with any 
accent <,> <#\>I mean our conversations I mean this 
is from phone conversations um
<$C> <#\><[>Yes</[></{>
  <#\>How did you know him the first time you saw him to pay 
him
<$B> <#\>He knew me and I mean I <#\>so for all that
if if it if he hadn't walked up to me and 
said to me<@>firstname1</@> I'm <@>firstname8</@> and that was
it 
<#\>He I mean the arrangement was I 
would be standing on the corner in um in<@>streetname1</@> and 
whatever the little side street was there where the office block 
er at um three thirty in the afternoon and that he would meet me 
there <,> <#\>And I sa I I something that would have gone along the lines of
how 
will I know know you because I there was no other thing and he said <quote>I'll know 
you</quote> <,>
 <$C>  <#\>And what sort of money did you pay him when you met 
him
<$A> <#\>It was four dollars an inquiry 
<$B>  <#\>Oh well originally it was three <O>clears
throat</O>two fif <#\>I can't recall 
<#\>Look it was either two fifty or three to start but I can't
remember but 
it the last um six months or so it was four
<$C> <#\>And how much what what 
was the 
range of payment each time you saw him
<$B> <#\>Oh look it varied because as I said he didn't
always ring 
up when it was an exact amount
<$C> <#\>Yeah but it varied over what range
<$B> <#\>Oh the largest amount I probably had ever given him 
would be <,> <#\>Oh under it would be under under nine <#\>It would be maybe six hundred and 
something would be the largest but that wouldn't be very often
<$C> <#\>And what was it usually then
<$B> <#\>Oh one around two hundred 
seemed to be 
be <#\>When it had built up to that he would generally want it 
<#\>And I mean that could be that could be 
um 
maybe um three weeks <#\>It might be might be 
eight weeks
<$C> <#\><O>clears throat</O>We've we've 
been told in evidence 
that ah he was doing something like twenty a day that sort of 
figure <{><[><,></[> <#\>That would be
<$B> <#\><[>Ah</[></{> that would be high
<$C> <#\>Well what would
<$B> <#\>That would be the high um
<$C> <#\>Well see that would be fifty sixty a day five day
week 
two fifty three hundred a week would bring you up to
<$B> <#\>Fifty sixty a day
<$C> <#\>Mmm <#\>No no no dollars
<$B> <#\>Oh sorry sorry <{><[>um</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Dollars</[> </{> <#\>Twenty inquiries a day
<{><[>or a little less</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Well I mean that</[></{> that number of
inquiries 
sir would be the very very top per day and I would 
put it at much lower than that per day in numbers <,> I mean
<#\><O>cough</O> The thing ah the thing is 
that <O>cough</O>I mean other age other um um and
without 
criticising or contradicting any other witnesses other
information 
of the same type was coming to the office but from say the
clients</I>
