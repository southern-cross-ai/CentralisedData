<&>begins by reading from her notes then...</&>

<I><$A> <#\>Generally to support the <O>inaud</O> to support the
advancement of science induction and ind deduction need to be
used in combination particularly if scientists are becoming
more abstract <#\>Evidence of the stating of principles may be
obtained from information which has been collected by
observation than deduction <#\>However the observation and
collecting of information may be carried out than on the
principles of deduction <#\>Scientific induction has a mass
assertion about universal types rather than a mere summing up
of instances <O>inaud</O>
<$B> <#\>Okay <#\>I wonder if you <{><[>if you could give me</[> 
<$A> <#\><[><O>inaud</O></[></{> 
<$B> <#\>that last bit again uh principles
<$A> <#\>Um about<,> <quote> evidence for stating principles may
be obtained from information which has been collected by
observation which is deduction</quote> <#\><{><[>However</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>which is</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>deduction
<$B> <#\>induction
<$A> <#\>which is getting the evidence and then the doing a um a
<O>inaud</O>
<$B> <#\>But are you generalising from your evidence<,,> <#\>Is that
the <,>procedure you're talking about
<$A> <#\>What do you mean generalise
<$B> <#\>Well I'm asking you 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>What is the<,,> inference of standard trial and error
<#\>Observations to 
<$A> <#\>mmm
<$B> <#\>what you're just talking principle 
<$A> <#\>yeah
<$B> <#\>And what is the inference to get from a set of
observations to the principle
<$A> <#\>Isn't that deduction <#\>If you want you you <{><[>observe your</[> 
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaud</O>information</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>and then you formed your hypothesis where the <{><[>deduction</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>oh wait on</[></{> let's take <@>Name</@> 's lines <#\>You observe some
of <@>Name</@> 's lines <#\>Is that is this that sort of case you had
in mind
<$A> <#\><,,>No because um
<$B> <#\>Give me an example of what you had in mind
<$A> <#\>Um<,,> like you you were<,,> like our Morton and Fischel
assignment and things like where<,,> physics and things like
that where you observe like more <O>inaud</O> or whatever it is so
from that we say that it is nine point three<O>inaud</O>
<$B> <#\>okay  so you're saying that if you drop a hundred balls
into the tunnel at formal lengths distance<,> can you make
some generalisation
<$A> <#\>Yeah but who isn't that a hypothesis or <{><[><O>inaud</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>okay to the formal part comes into it</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>yeah
<$B> <#\>you know what you're what you tell youself you're doing
on the basis of that you propose a hypothesis 
<$A> <#\>No you say it's because of this this has been this has
been um this is what happened every time
<$B> <#\>You already had a hypothesis that you're testing
<$A> <#\>No it's more fitting in um<,> what our issue instruction
was was or what I read it as is that you're more fitting into
your what you already have the facts and data that you have
you fit a hypothesis into that <#\>These are the facts therefore
this <,,> and I <O>inaud</O>  
<$B> <#\>Well yes I'm very puzzled by that because if you're
moving in some sense from a set of observations to a
hypothesis<,,>
<$A> <#\>Mm
<$B> <#\>this seems to me to be an anthetic inference if you
like<,> and therefore its in function <#\>I'm not I'm not just
being pedantic
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>I'm but this is absolutely the heart of that <{><[> it's very
close to the</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$C> <#\><{><[><O>inaud</O></[> error for inclusion in the <O>inaud</O> 
<$D> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>If if if you're return to the basic line you're testing
the hypothesis you've already got it in front of you<,,>
<#\>You've got to test it by a population then of course you
deduce certain observations and their consequences <#\>But then
so that's the deductive component of the hypothetic and
deductive method<,> <#\>But then when you go and actually have a
look and closely observe what you predicted<,> then the
inference facts from those observations to the hypothesis is
what's called inductive
<$C> <#\>Mmm  
<$A> <#\>But that's what I'm saying <#\>I'm saying I'm not inductive
or deductive specially <{><[>it's both</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>that you do use</[></{> Let's go back to the passage you read 
<{><[>earlier </[> 
<$A> <#\><[>yeah okay</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>where you</[></{> used the word deductive
<$A> <#\>But then don't I also say <quote> however the observation
and reflection of the information may be carried out on the
basis of principles which is induction</quote> 
<$B> <#\>Just before that though you said something about
deduction
<$A> <#\>Um <,,><quote> for information which has been collected by
observation<,> which is deduction</quote> 
<$B> <#\>But what is deduction <#\>Observation is deduction is it
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> well no <#\>Information is um collected by
observation isn't it <#\>Cos of this you deduce that<,,> 
<#\>Whereas on principles
<$B> <#\>Oh well if you'd just give me an example<,> of the sort
of deduction
<$E> <#\>Um are you saying that you're deducing the information
from the hypothesis<,> or is it you're saying 
<$A> <#\>observation is deducing how it's all 
<$B> <#\>Well you you observe<,,> a hundred white swans
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>and what <{><[>do you de</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>but they</[></{> <,,>
<$B> <#\>what do you deduce from that
<$A> <#\><O>inaud</O> indu induction
<$B> <#\>But where does<,,> deduction come into it<O>inaud</O>
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>I don't know<O>inaud</O> in the way I thought it was
anyway is that the way it starts at the beginning like the way
you start you get all your all the bits and pieces of facts
about I don't know whatever you're collecting and then you say
okay because of this um you can deduce it because of what
you've experimented on what you've come up with
<$B> <#\>Well that's what troubles me <#\>If you've got a you know
a set of observations of whatever
<$A> <#\>mmm
<$B> <#\>it may be you know it might be white swans er uh
behaviour of falling weights whatever a set of observations
you're telling me from that set of observations you can deduce
something is that right 
<$A> <#\>I think so
<$B> <#\>No I'm afraid it makes no sense anyway <#\>What can we
deduce from a set of observations<,,>
<$A> <#\>Mmm <O>inaud</O> <#\>And then what <{><[>induction</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>I mean</[></{> if you've already got some hypothesis and if you
know <O>inaud</O> repeat performing a hypothetico-deductive
experiment<,> you've got your hypothesis you deduce a set of
observational consequences from the hypothesis and then you
have a look and suppose the fact and the consequences<,>
contradict what you've deduced then by modus comments you can
deduce the um falisty of the hypothesis
<$A> <#\>Yeah and then
<$B> <#\>You do it all <{><[>that</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>And then</[></{> and then they're saying that you can't confirm
anything you know so their deductiveness says you don't even
confirm that something's right <#\>You knew that from the start
<$B> <#\>Right
<$A> <#\>and what you're saying is sort of yeah <O>inaud</O>
corroborating it and it's not and the deductivist says<,,>
<$B> <#\>the deductivist <{><[>says</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah you have to <O>inaud</O></[></{> 
<$B> <#\>all you can do is corroborate which means fail to
falsify
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>No there's just you'll forgive me for picking you up on
this but I really think its utterly central huh <#\>From a
finite set of observations<,,> all you could ever deduce is
the falsehood of some hypothesis which predicts different
observations <#\>You can deduce that much by modus columns <#\>But
you seemed to be suggesting that there was some deductive way
you could to get from a set of observations to an
hypothesis<,,> and uh it it that was<,> how I was coming out
whether by intention or not you know I would have to explore
this <#\>Because you only ever confirm inductively from a finite
set of observations to a hypothesis
<$A> <#\>But then I'm also saying that I don't agree with that
sort of because you may say from your observations I mean like
Dirk Crow he says<O>inaudible</O> doesn't it <#\>I mean that's
logically known
<$B> <#\>Yes well this is all this is says is that induction is
fallible<,,> induction is fallible
<$A> <#\>But then deduction you can get it like that too <#\>You
can't progress because you don't know
<$B> <#\>Deduction is not accurate then
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Well all that's saying<,,>
<$A> <#\>So where<,> what is everyone stuck with too like I mean
deductiveness is never going to get any further in advanced
than into
<$B> <#\>Well this of course is one of the uh criticisms of Popper
I think you know some of us of course are Poppovists <#\>Uh
Poppovist deductive methodology provides no basis for making
any sort of predictions <#\>That indeed if you want to make
predictions as you importantly do in sums <#\>I mean you want to
apply<,,> uh hypotheses to achieve certain goals <#\>It seems
that Popper can't get around that sort of<,,> adopting<,> say
one hypothesis in preference
<$A> <#\>But doesn't he come to use an inductive<,> um I don't
know inductive method or whatever <{><[><O>inaud</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>well of course</[></{> this is the uh criticism that's often
made of Popper that he is a covert inductivist <#\>His
corroboration actually is doing the same job 
<$A> <#\>is doing yeah
<$B> <#\>as inductivist Comovitz
<$C> <#\>Mmm the thing is though I reckon if if it isn't<,,> acted
like he insists that it's uh you know completely analytic and
disturbs the past history of uh um given hypotheses<,> uh
successes<,> then there's no point to it at all <#\>There is no
reason in having it <#\>It's<,> totally and utterly worthless
and deduction is back where it was before<,> with no value
leaving science with no value<,,> and so it seems ridiculous 
<#\>He's sort of half sticking his nose out saying okay we'll have
corroboration and when sciences goes ah inductivist he goes no
no no I don't really mean it and it's um
<$D> <#\>Oh it's not completely useless because you can say which
theories are false 
<$C> <#\>Well yeah you can say which theories are false but you
can't use any sort theory for any sort of predictive um method
and that's what science is about <#\>Science is about making
prediction learning to hypothesise
<$E> <#\>Yeah but what did Popper Popper likes background to be
saying I don't<,> I sit on the fence <#\>I can't see Popper
sitting on the fence <#\>His inductiveness and deductiveness
he's actually using deductive methods in order to get to
something specific
<$?> <#\><{><[>inaud</[> 
<$?> <#\><[>I'm sorry but</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Well</[></{> deductivism is correct then it's all valid and
everything and no-one can disprove it but it doesn't give you
anything it doesn't do anything for you in in terms of further
scientific analysis <#\>You can't learn anything it views <{><[>you</[> 
<$E> <#\><[>but isn't</[></{> it just like stating the <{><[>obvious</[> 
<$C> <#\><[><O>inaud</O></[></{> 
<$E> <#\>You're not really stating the obvious but<,> stating what
you already know 
<$C> <#\>Mmm <#\>Basically
<$E> <#\>Just
<$C> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>But the issue make I think somehow this representation
over this issue inductivist deductivist <#\>Inductivists of
course all accept deduction
<$D> <#\>Oh right
<$B> <#\>All inductivists use deductive reasoning to create
appropriate <O>inaud</O> to false hypotheses known as<O>inaud</O> <#\>So
the issue really is just whether any inductive inference at
all is admissible as science <#\>That's the issue <#\>And so I ask
you is any inductive inference admissible as science
<$E> <#\>Can you explain<O>inaud</O>
<$B> <#\>Acceptable legitimate licit
<$E> <#\>I think it is
<$B> <#\>Right well then you're an inductivist<O>inaud</O>
<$E> <#\>But then how do you how do you get to a <O>inaud</O> how can
you be really sure 
<$D> <#\>You still use deduction though 
<$E> <#\>It gets confusing doesn't it
<$D> <#\>You you use that deduction and you attempt deduction say
<O>inaud</O> but then you're a deductivist
<$E> <#\>yeah but then<O>inaud</O>
<$D> <#\>No <{><[><O>inaud</O></[> 
<$?> <[><#\><O>inaud</O></[> 
<$C> <#\><[>what if the</[></{> deductivist says you can't use induction
and inductivist says you can use induction that you can use
deduction as well <#\>The inductivist says solely that you can
use induction <#\>He doesn't object at all to using deduction
<$E> <#\>Yeah that's fine but how Popper who is a deductivist 
<$C> <#\>Mmm
<$E> <#\>has had to admit he has to accept that
<$C> <#\>well he he he claims that he doesn't <#\>He claims that he
doesn't do it at all and his corroboration is purely analytic
and has no<O>inaud</O> value
<$F> <#\>When when Popper talks about conjecture doesn't he in
that sense include in a way induction just in another form
when he says how hypotheses are conjecture and it's made up of
a set of ideas
<$C> <#\>He's sort of slipping it in and then<O>inaud</O> he doesn't
wanna face the problem of reaching a hypothesis which sounds a
big problem to deductivists and often they say okay you can
get a hypothesis by doing this because a hypothesis can be
completly analytical <#\>You've got<,,> something that goes well
beyond the conscience of observations
<$F> <#\>Mmm mmm
<$C> <#\>And so you're saying that hypotheses are conjectures or
guesses <#\>He skips that part

<$F> <#\>Yeah yeah
<$E> <#\>But in that sense doesn't he include<,> that concept of
induction of generating a more in in<,> in his in his 
methods and then coming up with deduct and then deducing</I>
