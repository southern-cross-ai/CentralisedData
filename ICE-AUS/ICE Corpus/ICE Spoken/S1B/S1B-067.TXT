<$B> <#\>No, these injuries no
<$A> <#\>So, you're saying that that he had no injuries on the
night <#\>Is that what you're saying
<$B> <#\>I didn't see them, no <#\>I was taken straight out <#\>I
didn't
<,> get to study his face or anything, <,> <{><[>not at him</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm mmm</[></{><#\>What about after you punched him
<$B> <#\>I was taken I was grabbed straight away
<$A> <#\>Alright <#\>What about punching him the first time as
you
say
<$B> <#\>The first time I was dragged back as well
<$A> <#\>Alright <#\>Did you have a look at his face after you

<$B> <#\>No, left hand
<$A> <#\>Left hand <,> <#\>So you did see injuries upon this
fellow

<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>And when was that
<$B> <#\>Uhm, <,> that was <,> well he was coming towards me <,>
again, before I hit him the second time
<$A> <#\>Did you see him ten minutes after the incident
<$B> <#\>Yes I did
<$A> <#\>You did <#\>Alright <#\>And in fact you saw that he had
injuries on his face ten minutes after the incident, isn't
that correct
<$B> <#\>That's right <#\>He had blood on his face, <,> on his
hands
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>And uh <,> oh on his face, you saw he had a
bleeding lip, <,> didn't you

after the incident, didn't you
<$B> <#\>True
<$A> <#\>True
<$B> <#\>But that's not straight up <#\>That was ten minutes
after
<$A> <#\>Well, ten minutes after the incident <#\>You did, didn't
you
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Alright <#\>These injuries in this photo, is that what
you
saw <,> at his face
<$B> <#\>I didn't see his face, except from ah it was from a
distance
<$A> <#\>It was a distance, <{><[>was it</[> 
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible 1 syll</O></[></{> is <#\>I was at the bottom of the
stairs and he was already at the top, <,> in the dark
<$A> <#\>Alright <#\>Now you're saying to the court today, that
he
headbutted you
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Is that right
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>Where <,> did he headbut you
<$B> <#\>On my forehead <{><[><O>inaudible 3 syll</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Where</[></{> about
<$B> <#\>On my eye, <,> <{><[>left eye</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>You're</[></{> indicating above your right hand
<$B> <#\><O>cough</O>
<$A> <#\>I'll withdraw that <#\>Above your right eye <#\>You'll
say he
headbutted you
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>And what part of his body came into contact with <,> the
eye-brow <,> of you
<$B> <#\>It was above the eye-brow, not the actual eye-brow
<$A> <#\>Okay <#\>Above the eye-brow of you <#\>What part of his
body
came in contact
<$B> <#\>His forehead
<$A> <#\>His forehead <#\>Where abouts on his forehead
<$B> <#\>I'm not sure <#\>I'm not watching the actual head
<#\>I'm just
receiving the head
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>Now, <,> he had no <,> lumps or <,> red scares
or
any<{><[>thing on his face</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>It wasn't a hard, it wasn't</[></{> a hard hit
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>And you <,> had no injuries on your face, did
you
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>No <#\>In fact <,> you at no stage told police that he
had
headbutted you, <{><[>did you</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yes I did</[></{> <#\>Yes <#\>The whole time I had told them
that he
had head<{><[>butted</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Did</[></{> you use the word <quote>headbut</quote> 
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>You did <#\>You used the word <quote>headbut</quote> , did you <,>
<#\>Is
that right
<$B> <#\>Yes, I'm <,> fairly certain I did
<$A> <#\>Fairly certain
<$B> <#\>Yes I did
<$A> <#\>You did, did you
<$B> <#\>Yeap, yeap
<$A> <#\>You're you're positive about that
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>You used the word <quote>headbut</quote> to police when you described
what had happened <#\>And you're certain <,> <#\>Is that right
<{><[>You</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>have to answer <{><[>for</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>the record, sir <#\>Alright <#\>Now uh <,> you agree
with me
that uh your memory <,> is better <,> back when you supplied
the statement to police
<$B> <#\>True
<$A> <#\>True <#\>Alright <#\>Now uh you say to the court that
the def
that the uh alleged victim <,> struck you twice
<$B> <#\>No, he struck me once
<$A> <#\>He struck you once <,> <#\>Is that right
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>He struck you once
<$B> <#\>I struck him twice
<$A> <#\>Alright <#\>Just excuse me <,,> <#\>Didn't you say to
the court
he struck you again <,> on a second occasion
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>No <,> <#\>You're saying to the court that he didn't
strike
you again on a second occasion
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>No
<$B> <#\>I thought he was going to
<$A> <#\>Alright <#\>You thought <{><[>he</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>I was</[></{> sure, I was sure that the look <,> he was <,>
about to when I <,> just before I hit him, my second time
<$A> <#\>Well, what was he about to do that <,> made you come to
the conclusion
<$B> <#\>He was coming for me
<$A> <#\>Well, what was he doing
<$B> <#\>He's, in an aggressive manner
<$A> <#\>Well, what do you mean by aggressive, <{><[>what</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Oh</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>was he doing
<$B> <#\>His facials
<$A> <#\>What, his face <#\>You were looking at his face and you
you
thought he was aggressive
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>Is that right <#\>Well, what was it about his face that
came
to the conclusion that he was aggressive
<$B> <#\>Just his expressions on his, <,> his facial expressions
<$A> <#\>Alright <#\>Well, what was the expression
<$B> <#\>I don't know <#\>Anger
<$A> <#\>Anger <,> <#\>What else
<$B> <#\>I'm not sure <,,> <O>2 syll</O> uhm <O>3 syll</O> <,> <O>2 syll</O>
<#\>Retaliate, getting back
<$A> <#\>Retaliate <O>3 syll</O> <#\>Now just supposing that uh <,,>
supposing that uh <,,> your saying that he he headbutted you
<#\>Now you've punched him, is that right
<$B> <#\>True
<$A> <#\>And you've punched him in retaliation, haven't you
<$B> <#\>No, in self-defence
<$A> <#\>In self-defence <,> <#\>Not in retaliation
<$B> <#\>Which one are you talking about here, the first one or
the second one
<$A> <#\>The first <#\>Well I mean, how many headbuts were there
<$B> <#\>There was one
<$A> <#\>Alright <#\>If I can take you back to the incident
<#\>Supposing as you said <,> that he's headbutted you, <,>
right,
just supposing that had happened, <,> you <,> had struck him
in retaliation, haven't you
<$B> <#\>No, in self-defence
<$A> <#\>Well, what do you mean by self-defence
<$B> <#\>After he's headbutted me, I struck him
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>Why did you strike him
<$B> <#\>Because I thought he was gonna <,> keep going
<$A> <#\>Well, you thought he was gonna headbut you again
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>You see, in fact I put it to you, that <,> you used the
word <quote>retaliation</quote> <,> when you were interviewed by police,
didn't you
<$B> <#\>True
<$A> <#\>True <#\>And now you're coming to the court and you're
using
the word <quote>self-defence</quote> , isn't that right
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Well, why are you changing the <{><[>words</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>But it's</[></{> still retaliation, isn't it
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Do you know what</[></{> retaliation means
<$B> <#\>It's an automatic reflex
<$A> <#\>Automatic reflex <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Well</[></{> if you're getting hit, I'm sure you'd uh hit
somebody else
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>in the same
<$A> <#\>Do you understand what the word <quote>retaliation</quote> means
<$B> <#\>To come back <,> and get them
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>You do understand what the word <quote>retaliation</quote> 
means
<#\>Yes <#\>Yes <#\>You have to <,> nod or you have to answer for
the
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>record sir <#\>Right and it's the fact that supposing
that
uh <,> even the slight moment that you were struck, you hit
him in retaliation <#\>Isn't that right
<$B> <#\>Yeah, well
<$A> <#\>Yes, <,> it is, isn't it
<$B> <#\>It's still uh uhm <,> a reflex action after being hit
<$A> <#\>Is it <#\>He hit you so you just <,> instantly reflect
out
and hit him
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Is that right <,> <#\>Okay, now <,,> why did you hit him
a
second time as as you've described in the court
<$B> <#\>Oh, I've said it a numerous times <#\>He was <,> he was
coming for me <O>cough</O> and uh <,> I thought he was gonna <,>
hit me again
<$A> <#\>Right, is that uh, once again, self-defence, is it
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>That's what you see as self-defence
<$B> <#\>Yes, he he's coming at me in an aggressive manner
<$A> <#\>He's coming at you, <,> right, in an aggressive manner
<#\>What his face was angry again, was it
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>What was he doing, <,> apart from his an face
being angry
<$B> <#\>Walking towards me
<$A> <#\>Walking towards you <#\>What else was he doing
<$B> <#\>There's not much else to <O>3 syll</O>, is there
<$A> <#\>So, <,> he was just <,> you saw him focusing upon you
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Is that right <,> <#\>And uh <,> you'd hit him, <,> as
you
say <#\>Is that right
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Where abouts
<$B> <#\>Around the same area on <,> the left hand side and the
lower lip
<$A> <#\>The lower lip <#\>And why have you hit him
<$B> <#\>Thinking that he was going to uh <,> hit me
<$A> <#\>You see
<$B> <#\>Hit him before he <,> struck me
<$A> <#\>That is not true, what you're saying to the court
<#\>That
little scenario about him going to you and you hitting him, is
it
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>That is not true <,> <#\>Is it
<$B> <#\>Yes it is
<$A> <#\>You see in fact <,> you told police <,> that he was uh
having a go at one of your friends <,> <#\>And uh he'd said
something and you thought it was offensive <#\>So you just hit
him <,> <#\>You <{><[>see that</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Oh put it</[></{> correctly, <O>2 syll</O>
<$A> <#\>I'll withdraw it, perhaps I can uh I was grabbed and
I was told to walk away, so I did <#\>I then turned around and he
was having a go at someone else, one of my friends <#\>I stood
there <,> <#\>He then said something <#\>I don't know what, but
it seemed offensive at the time <#\>So I hit him again <#\>That's
what you said to the police, didn't you
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>And now you're saying something different, aren't you
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>But I was very uhm <,> upset and
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>destroy <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>but which</[></{> correction, which ah version is correct
<$B> <#\>The one I've just said
<$A> <#\>Today in court
<$B> <#\>Today in court
<$A> <#\>That version is correct, is that right
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>And the version you supplied to the police, that I've
just read out, is not correct <#\>Is that right
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Is that a lie
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>It is not a lie <,> <#\>But it's not correct version
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>You see, there's a big difference between uh saying that
someone said something offensive and you just hit them <,> and
there's a difference between a person coming at you and you
punching them <#\>Isn't there
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Big difference, isn't there
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>You see, in fact, <,> it wasn't the case at all <,> that
this man had tried to have a go at you <,> <#\>Is it
<$B> <#\>Yes it is the case
<$A> <#\>In fact I put it to you that at no stage did this man
ever headbut you
<$B> <#\>That's a lie
<$A> <#\>That's a lie, is it
<$B> <#\>That is a lie
<$A> <#\>And you're saying to the court you received no injuries
at all
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>from a headbut
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>And this man received no injuries that you saw <,> from
a
headbut
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>No <,> <#\>Did you <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>It wasn't</[></{> a very forceful headbut,
<$A> <#\>But <{><[>it connected</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>It was a</[></{> headbut
<$A> <#\>But it c connected with you, didn't it
<$B> <#\>True
<$A> <#\>You see, in fact <#\>So I put it to you at no stage did 
this man ever <,> attempt to go at you in any form at all
<#\>What do you say about that
<$B> <#\>I'd say that's a lie <#\>I would <{><[>say <O>inaudible 1syll</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>That's a</[></{> lie, is it
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>It's not correct
<$B> <#\>No <#\>Not at all
<$A> <#\>You see, I put it to you that uh <,> you had words with
the uh the victim <,,> <#\>You had a a conversation with the
victim <,> and you turned around and you then struck him in
the face  
<$B> <#\>No I didn't have words with the victim
<$A> <#\>You didn't have words <,,> <#\>Did at any stage people
grab you and move you away from this man
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>They did <#\>In fact prior to these people grabbing
hold of you you pushed him in the chest
<$B> <#\>No <,>
<$A> <#\>No <,> <#\>Are you saying that this headbutting
incident occurred prior to these people grabbing hold of you
and removing you from the vicinity of this man Mr Flynn
<$B> <#\>Could you say that again
<$A> <#\>Are you saying to the court that this headbutting
incident occurred prior to you being held on by parties and
removed 
<$B> <#\>Yeah <,> oh removed from the nightclub
<$A> <#\>Oh actually in fairness ah I'll put that to you again
<#\>You were removed by friends of his 
<$B> <#\>Oh I'm not sure who it was</I>
