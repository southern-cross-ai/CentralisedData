 <I><$A> <#\>Now what I wanted to see these for<,> <@>forenameB</@> <,,> um<,> <#\>As I
told you during last<,> week we had<,> an English couple
<{><[><,></[> about thirty five years of age<,> came to Australia at
our ah<,> sort of invitation<,> and ah they selected<,,> two
places Sydney and Port Douglas <[><,></[> as<,> the<,> sort of
extent of what they could do reasonably well in<,> in just two
weeks <#\>That's all they had here<,>
 <$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[>      <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>      <#\>God that's not long is it
 <$A> <#\>No <#\>And how this happened he was they were gonna come for
a<,> a whole proper holiday like a<,,> I think an almost a
four week tour of Australia including the Centre<,,> and bits
of Western Queensland and<,> ah all that and then<,,> <#\>He's
a<,> quantity surveyor<,,> so<,,> with the building downturn
there he wasn't prepared to risk his job <O>laughs</O> by
taking off so much time <{><[><,></[> <#\>So when they got<,> they got to
the end of a construction contract<,,> all of us oh<,> and
then<,> his boss dis agreed that he could have a couple of
weeks off<,,> <#\>So that's what limited them and then having<,>
sort of ah we met them in Africa last year in East Africa<,,>
and ah having<,,> not persuaded them but encouraged them I
s'pose<,> to come to Australia we felt some obligation as to
what ah advice we should give them <#\>So we've had them for a
week in Sydney <[><,></[> living at our place <[><,,></[> and then<,>
of their own accord they<,> booked in at Port Douglas<,>
 <$B> <#\><[>Really</[>      <#\><[>Mmm</[>      <#\><[><,> mmm</[></{>      <#\>Oh that's good <#\>In one in one of the resorts
<O>Acoughs</O>
 <$A> <#\>I think ah no <#\>Ah ah I think they've got a<,,> an
apartment <#\>It may be in a resort<,> because it's close to the
golf club I think <{><[><,></[> or close to the town <#\>I'm not sure
which <#\>And um<,,> they've got a little kitchenette<,> so they
can sort of prepare meals and be independent of fixed meal
times you see
 <$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>      <#\>Yeah <#\>It doesn't sound like a resort<,> because <{><[><,></[> they don't have<,> <[>kitchens</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>No</[>     <#\><[>And he</[></{> wanted to play ah golf and ah all that and of
course we suggested they<,> go up to the Kuranda thing and
<{><[><,,></[> if they had time <#\>They wanted to do<,> snorkelling<,>
<#\>She does anyway <#\>She's got a<,,> do you have a what do you get
when you sn<,> have snorkel lessons <#\>Do you get ah<,>
 <$B> <#\><[><,> yeah</[></{>     <#\>I don't think you get anything <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Oh no <#\>The diving</[></{> I'm sorry <#\>Yeah <#\>Diving
 <$B> <#\>PADI certificate
 <$A> <#\>What d'they call diving <#\>It's um<,,>
 <$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>There's a<,> P A D I PADI
 <$A> <#\>Oh is there
 <$B> <#\>And it's the Professional Aquatic Divers Institute and
you can either get<,> you know a certificate or a diploma or
 <$A> <#\>Different grades
 <$B> <#\>Yeah
 <$A> <#\>And that's where they<,> put the scuba gear on
 <$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>That's right
 <$A> <#\>O K well she's ah she went to Israel<,> a couple of years
back<,,> and<,> did a course there<,>
 <$B> <#\>What In the Dead Sea or something <O>ABlaugh</O>
 <$A> <#\>She wouldn't sink I s'pose in the Dead Sea <#\>So um<,,>
that was ah now she wanted to come<,,> add onto her
experiences<,> some diving on the Barrier Reef you see
 <$B> <#\>Right<,>
 <$A> <#\>So what I<,> what ah I was interested from to hear from
you is<,,> whether the advice we've given them's right or not
<#\>Did you<,> see much of the reef up there <{><[><,> <#\>Not much</[> of
these brochures would tell me about that
 <$B> <#\><[>Um well</[></{>      <#\>Actually<,,> we went out to the reef only one day and
that was from Cairns
 <$A> <#\>Oh not from Port Douglas
 <$B> <#\>No <#\>Because<,,> ah<,,> where we were staying was half way
between Cairns and Port Douglas and
 <$A> <#\>Turtle beach <{><[>I think you said</[> Turtle Cove
 <$B> <#\><[>Turtle cove</[></{>      <#\>Yeah <#\>You could either<,,> well first off we stayed at
this place<,> which is in Cairns<,,> the Cairns Colonial Club
<{><[><,,></[> and<,> that was very nice<,,> and<,> we stayed there
four days<,> and from there one day we went out to the reef
<[><,,></[> then we went up to<,> Turtle Cove and we did go into
Port Douglas quite often but<,> you know by the time you get
ready<,> in the morning and then<,,> go to Port Douglas is
about forty minutes drive away
 <$A> <#\><[>Mmhmm</[>      <#\><[>Yeah<,></[></{>      <#\>Did you have a car
 <$B> <#\>No<,> <#\>No <#\>We had to rely on the<,,> the <{><[>resort van</[> <,>
so by the time we got into Port Douglas it was usually<,,>
you know around the middle of the day late morning so<,,> it
was really too late to go out on the proper reef <#\>You could've
gone out for a half a day<,> but that only goes to<,> these
islands called the Low Isles <[><,,></[> and<,,> you know<,,>
they're nice but<,> it's not really the proper continental
shelf<[><,></[> type <[>reef</[> <#\>You need a whole day to get out
there <[><,></[> so<,> we did that one day<,> from Cairns and we
went<,> to Green Island and then right out to<,> this place
called Norman Reef<,,> and it was so expensive and so far to
go that with it's<,> really the only reason we went <[>for the
day</[>
 <$A> <#\><[>Mmm mmm</[>      <#\><[>Yes<,> yes</[>      <#\><[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>Mmm</[>      <#\><[>That's 'cos 'cos it was so expensive</[></{>
 <$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>It was <{><[>like</[> <,> a hundred and fifteen dollars
<[><,,></[> <#\>We went on this<,,> with<,> with this company<,>
called Great Adventures and<,>
 <$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>Oh these were these were these catamarans
 <$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>The giant catamaran
 <$A> <#\>Do they serve me a meal on board<,> <#\>Because you're out
for a whole day I s'pose <{><[>aren't you</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah<,></[></{> <#\>You go to a<,,> you go for a full day <{><[><,></[> and then<,,> you're on the catamaran going out there for a
couple of hours and then it stops<,> at this pontoon <[><,,></[> and moors to that <[><,,></[> and<,> that's where you stay<,> for
a couple of hours and<,> they have a big lunch on the pontoon
and<,,> you know you can snorkel or scuba from the
pontoon<,,> and<,> the oth the other thing that stopped us
going out to the reef more often was<,> the weather<,> which
was windy<,> and a bit rough<,,> the whole time we were in
Cairns <#\>I dunno if we were just<,,> unlucky but<,,> the sea
was<,> you know quite rough<,> every day
 <$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[>      <#\><[>Ah<,></[>      <#\><[>Yeah yeah</[></{>      <#\>Wow
 <$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Every morning<,> when we were staying at Turtle
Cove 'cos it's right on the beach we'd go<,,> out to the<,>
you know<,> the beach and we'd just<,> look at the water and
usually it's s'pose to be<,,> you know foot high waves and
they were like<,> six foot<{><[><,,></[> <#\>They were huge waves so
 <$A> <#\><[>Oh</[></{>      <#\>Yeah <#\>Was anyone using surfboards or anything like that
<#\>Or just
 <$B> <#\>Um<,> actually the next beach around from that is a
really popular<,> surfing beach and it's the only one<,>
apparently on the stretch <#\>They call it the Marlin Coast
<{><[><,></[> and there's sort of a gap<,> in the reef <[><,></[> and the
waves come in and they're quite big waves<,,> so<,> but yeah
you could've had a good surf really because<,,> you know they
were un<,> unseasonably<,> or unusal unusually large <[>waves</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Uhuh</[>      <#\><[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>Mmm</[></{><#\>Well did you see a boat called the Quicksilver
<{><[>at um</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <#\>Yeah
 <$A> <#\>Quicksilver one and Quicksilver two
 <$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>We almost went on<,> on the Quicksilver
 <$A> <#\>Well uh my wife and I went on it<,> just out to the Low
Isles<,> because<,,> I just have snorkel gear when we go away
like that <#\>You know just sort of played around on the
surface<,> and I<,,> agree with you that there wasn't um<,,>
you know you certainly weren't on the Barrier Reef in my op
you know there's a lot of dead coral like you get <{><[>in</[> <,> in
some of the other<,,> nearby coral<,> ah displays <#\>A lot of
dead coral and<,> a fair bit with colour as you got into
deeper water <[><,,></[> but ah<,> I think this couple want to<,,>
and that's what I was going to ask you<,> from Port Douglas
then they could go right out to the reef <#\><[>Is there</[> a trip
from Port Douglas
 <$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[>      <#\><[><,> yeah</[>      <#\><[>Yeah yeah</[></{>      <#\>Yeah <#\>There are there's several<,,> because what<,,> what
a lot of the tour boats do they go<,> they leave Cairns<,,>
you know<,> a a really horribly early hour <{><[><,></[> they go<,>
just up the coast<,,> and stop<,> at Port Douglas and pick up
further people <[>and then go</[> then go way out
 <$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>Oh I see <#\>Okay</[></{>      <#\>So they could do this full day<,,> thing<,> from<,> Port
Douglas <{><[>and</[> prob'ly join up with Cairns people if it was
needed
 <$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> Cairns is the main place <{><[><,></[> to go out to the
reef but Port Douglas yeah there is<,> quite a lot going from
there as well<,>
 <$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>      <#\>Now these certified dives<,,> um<,,> oh dive courses<,>
oh yeah I see <#\>Padi P A D I <#\><{><[>O K</[> <#\>Well she she's done<,> a
course like this <#\>She'd have some certificate but she wanted
she asked me and I couldn't answer<,> whether<,,> when you<,>
you borrow the gear again<,,> ah for certified divers to
explore<[><,></[> as it says here<,> would they give you a little
familiarisation with the equipment do you know<,>
 <$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>Mm</[></{>      <#\>I don't know <#\><{><[><,></[> I I s'pose if you ask for it they'd
give you one
 <$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>      <#\>Mmm<,,> 'cos it's just a matter of<,,> showing you which
way to turn the knobs <{><[><O>Alaughs</O></[> <#\>I s'pose if you know
 <$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>I I s'pose it'd be a good idea to do a short refresher
<{><[><,,></[> for her sake
 <$A> <#\><[><,> yeah</[></{>      <#\>Yeah <#\>You see these are two day four day five day
courses<,,> here so <{><[>I guess</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah but you</[></{> can go out to the<,,> like that full
day<,> trip that we<,> we did <{><[>they</[> were like<,> trying to
rustle up business for the<,,> for the dive and you could just
do it<,> off the pontoon <[><,></[> <#\>You know they could just they
just tell you for five minutes how it's done then they rig you
all up and then <[>they<,> push you</[> off the side <#\>They give
you<,> some sort of certificate <#\>I'm not I'm sure it's not
PADI but 
 <$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[>      <#\><[>O K</[>      <#\><[>Oh well that's all right</[></{>      <#\>Yeah <#\>You you've done it
 <$B> <#\>Yeah<,>
 <$A> <#\>But<,> so do they require you to be a certified diver
before they let you participate in that<,,> <#\>No
 <$B> <#\>No <#\><{><[>Anybody</[> could do it
 <$A> <#\><[>O K</[></{> OK oh well she'll have no I mean<,> she she's the
keen one <{><[><,></[> and he's<,,> um<,> he's more interested in
golf and just sort of <[>sight seeing</[> so ah<,,> from what
you're telling me then it seems as though<,,> if she did a<,>
some dives<,,> and um<,> with all this gear<,> full gear
provided because they've got no equipment<,,> um<,> then at
the time of them giving her the gear to<,> to put on they'd
familiarise her with ah with it
 <$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>Taking it easy</[></{>      <#\>Mmm yeah
 <$A> <#\>Oh that's all right <#\>That's good<,,> <#\>Well that means
that that little bit of advice that we<,> gave them stands
good <{><[><,></[> <#\>I said to them about <[>you</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>They'll</[></{> they'll they'll be fine because everything
is<,> very well organised there especially <{><[>in</[> Port Douglas
<[><,></[> <#\>There's a great<,> tourist<,> information <[><,></[> and<,,> you know it's just a tourist town so everything is
geared to the tourist <[><,,></[> and there's<,> just a lot
of<,,> you know you just walk down the main street and
there's<,,> most of the shops<,,> um<,,> you know that they're
they're all they're all<,> fonts of knowledge all these<,>
people that run the shops and 
 <$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[>      <#\><[>Mmm</[>      <#\><[>Mmm</[>      <#\><[>Mmm<,></[></{>      <#\>Is there a fancy<,,> or a<,> famous pie shop or something
in Port Douglas
 <$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>There is actually I 
 <$A> <#\>Did you use it
 <$B> <#\>No <#\><{><[>Because</[> <,> because um<,,> what happened<,,> <#\>Oh
no <#\>The the only time we went to Port Douglas<,> to eat was
like<,,> my birthday so we had a <[>big</[> <,> seafood meal <[><,></[> but I saw lots of people hanging around this pie shop <#\>I<,,>
can't remember what it's called <[>but</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Uhuh</[>     <#\> <[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>Yeah</[>      <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <#\>See 'cos if they've got an apartment or whatever
you call it<,> where they've got some<,> cooking facilities<,>
or reheating facilities or whatever<,> they could be
attracted to take<,> have take away stuff and take it back
there  or just go and sit on the wharf<,,> um</I>
