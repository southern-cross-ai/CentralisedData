<I><$A> <#\>I remember<,> when I first started<,> right<,> um<,,>
and
and ah<,> there was<,> you and<,> and ah <@>Forename1</@> working<,>
that um<,,> <{><[>that um</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>That's OK</[></{> <#\>No one knows what we're talking about
<O>BClaugh</O> <#\>We're just bitching
<$A> <#\>That um<,,> <@>Forename2</@> said<,,> um<,> well you know<,>
some one said to <@>Forename2</@> <quote>well<,> um how come you
didn't employ a girlie this time</quote><,,> <#\>And that's when
<@>Forename2</@> sort of <quote><O>mumbling noise</O></quote>
<$B> <#\>What <#\>Did he employ you
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\><{><[>he employed he employed me</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Oh I didn't know</[></{> that he actually employed you
<$A> <#\>Oh I was <{><[>initially employed by <@>Forename2</@> </[> <,> <#\>I was
initially employed by<,,> <@>Forename2</@> but I think <@>Forename3</@> was
paying for it
<$B> <#\><[>I thought <@>Forename3</@> I thought <@>Forename3</@> did</[></{>     Mmm
<$C> <#\>Mmm<,> <#\><{><[>But <@>forenameA</@> </[> you escaped from that despair
<O>Alaughs</O>
<$A> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{>     <#\>That's why we're going on this project<,> <#\>But
that<,>
that they were<,> they were saying like<,> <quote>oh<,> oh
<@>Forename2</@> </quote> I think <@>Forename4</@> actually said to him
<quote>oh <@>Forename2</@> you didn't employ a<,,> you didn't employ
a girl <#\><{><[>What's wrong with you</quote></[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Yeah<,> <#\>'Cos <@>Forename4</@></[></{> brought this up and I
turned
around and say <quote>well maybe it's because I had a
distinction in statistics<,> blah blah</quote> <#\>I just got
<{><[>really sort of</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Well I had</[></{> no stats<,,>
<$C> <#\>Mmm<,>
<$A> <#\>And the other reason why they employed me was because
they were gonna do case study work <{1><[1><,></[1> and that never ended
up being<,,> case study work where<,,> you go out and
interview people <{2><[2><,,></[2> <#\>It was case study work where you
write case studies up<,> <{3><[3><,> places that</[3> you've never been
to and never seen and <{4><[4>people you've never spoken to</[4> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
<$C> <#\><[3>Oh</[3></{3>     <#\><[4>Of places you've never been to</[4></{4>
<{><[><O>inaudicble</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Sure</[></{> 
<$C> <#\>Thanks
<$A> <#\>It's really good<,,>  <O>Byawns</O> <O>Claughs</O> we
think language is very vibrant <O>BClaugh</O> 
<$C> <#\>Oh boy
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,,>
<$C> <#\>Oh girl <O>BClaugh</O>
<$B> <#\>Oh goddess<,,>
<$A> <#\>So<,,> does that mean that <@>Forename2</@> 's not going to<,>
employ like<,> more women<,> now because<,,>
<$B> <#\>I don't know<,> I don't know if he was just<,> you
know<,,>
<$C> <#\>Do you know how he how he actually found out about
social
science anyway<,,>
<$B> <#\>How<,>
<$C> <#\>Yeah<,> <{><[>I dunno <O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Oh I thought you were gonna tell me</[></{> <,,>
<$A> <#\>Well he's always recruited from there hasn't he
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Well he reckons he didn't get any response from
psych<,,> and that<,> I think basically psych and social
science are the only people who know S P S S 
<$C> <#\>Oh right
<$B> <#\><{1><[1>And</[1> that could've been a central <{2><[2>criteria</[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1> 
<$C> <#\><[2>Because most</[2></{2> of<,> the reason he he gets so many
girls
is because most of the students <{><[>for psych<,> and<,,> the
social sciences are</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Well that's what he said<,> <#\>And for social
science</[></{> are female
<$A> <#\><{><[>Yeah</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>That's what he<,> that's what he<,,> sort of
said
as well<,,> <#\>Well we've sort of got<,> I dunno
<$A> <#\>Well anyway you guys<,,> you always had you had to be
you
had to go through interviews didn't you
<$B> <#\>Exactly <#\>I mean<,>
<$C> <#\>Sort of<,>
<$A> <#\>Well I mean did he talk to you <#\>He sort of said
<quote>well this is what I <{><[> want</quote></[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Well the first time</[></{> <,> 'cos I went for the job at the
same time <@>Forename1</@> got it<,,> um
<$B> <#\>Oh did you really
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>'Cos I<,> I just<,> turned up there but I
didn't
have my um<,,> I didn't have a<,> resume or anything<,> I
just turned up<,> which is pretty stu <#\>'Cos I just saw it and
rang up<,,> <#\>And um<,,> anyway so it wasn't a surprise
because we all know that he absolutely loved <@>Forename1</@> <,> so
that didn't really surprise me in the end<,,> but then<,> he
needed some one else<,> and<,,> <@>Forename1</@> <,> knew about it<,,>
and she said<,> me
<$B> <#\>And what about <@>Forename5</@> <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$C> <#\><[>So I just walked up there and</[></{> said<,>
<quote>hi</quote>
<$A> <#\>Was <@>Forename5</@> working for <@>Forename2</@> too
<$C> <#\>Um<,> <{><[>yeah</[> She was working for him<,,> she was
working for him first maybe
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>     <#\>Before you
<$A> <#\>I think she was working <{><[>before <@>Forename1</@> </[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>'Cos I took over her job</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>Not before <@>Forename1</@> though
<$C> <#\>No <#\>I took over her job
<$B> <#\>That's what I thought<,,>
<$C> <#\>And <{1><[1><,,> but</[1> but the thing is <#\>That's right
<#\>'Cos my
job expanded <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>'Cos originally she was just doing coding
<{3><[3><,,> so I finished that<,></[3> Yeah <#\>I<,> I finished that in
about three weeks<,,> <{4><[4>three or four weeks</[4> 
<$B> <#\><[1>She could've done with <O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>    <#\><[3>And the telephone work <#\>She was ringing up those
people</[3></{3>     <#\><[4>'Cos <@>Forename1</@> rang</[4></{4> <,> 'cos<@>Forename1</@> rang us up<,>
at
our house<,> and sort of offered it to one of the three of us
<,,>
<$C> <#\>Oh right
<$A> <#\><{><[>Whoever wanted it type thing</[>
<$B> <#\><[>And um</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,,> <#\>We all talked about it and because it was
initially phone work and ringing up companies and stuff<,> I
sort of said to <@>Forename5</@> <quote>oh you go for it</quote> <#\>And
I didn't even<,,> go for it at all <#\>I prob'ly should've<,> but
I didn't <#\><{><[><,></[> And <@>forenameB</@> <,,> had her tutoring work so she
didn't have the time
<$C> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>     <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,>
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>So because<,,> Yeah <#\>Anyway <O>inaudible</O>
or
something<,>
<$A> <#\>So what d'you think he's like as an employer<,,>
<$C> <#\>I don't think this is very spontaneous<,>
<$A> <#\>Well it doesn't have to be spontaneous
<$C> <#\>OK<,,> Well he's alright <#\><{><[>I mean</[> 
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> get played<,> a bit slow
<$C> <#\>Yeah<,> I don't want him to hear this<,>
<$A> <#\>Oh well<,> we'll<,,> can we<,> decode it<,> so it
can't<,>
<$C> <#\>O K um<,,>
<$A> <#\>Don't use his name <O>Alaughs</O> <#\><{><[>Use<,></[> use her
name <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
<$C> <#\>Oh he's OK<,> I just feel like<,,> oh when I come to
work I don't really wanna know<,> their personal problems<,,>
<#\>Like<,> I don't really wanna know what's going on in his
life<,> but I do<,,> I get sick <{><[>of it</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>What</[></{> You do wanna know<,> but <{><[>you don't wanna
know</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>No<,> I don't wanna</[></{> know
<$A> <#\>But you found find out anyway
<$C> <#\>Yeah<,,> And um<,,> I'm stick sick of doing statistics
<O>laughter</O> <#\>And that would make anyone go round the bend
just doing that every time you come into work<,>
<$A> <#\><O>yawning</O> Well that's true<,>
<$B> <#\>Well see I<,,> I like the idea of being friendly with
the people at work and sort of knowing a bit about their
personal life and<,> you know<,> visa versa and stuff like
that<,> I mean<,> it's more that I just don't <{1><[1>like</[1> what
<@>Forename2</@> does in his personal life <{2><[2><,></[2> or his attitudes to
a lot of things<,>
<$C> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>     <#\>Yeah <#\><{><[>Well I mean <O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>I like I</[></{> like having a friendly basis with your boss
and things like that <#\>I think that's <{><[>that's</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>But</[></{> the <{><[>thing is I don't</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>But I think a lot of</[></{> that is just testing for a
reaction<,> <{><[>I mean</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Yeah</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Oh yeah</[></{> <#\>He's such a baiter<,,> <#\>Total baiting
all the
time<,> <#\>He's prob'ly standing at the door
<$A> <#\>I mean<,> it's like with<,> like you and <@>Forename4</@> <,,>
<#\>You and <@>Forename4</@> <,> um<,> <{><[>I mean <@>Forename4</@> and</[> <,>
<@>Forename4</@> 
and <@>Forename2</@> <,,> um<,,> baited<,,> baited you really well<,>
the other day
<$C> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{>     Oh I know<,> and I fell for it <#\>Remember we talked about
it<,> <{><[>afterwards how I fell for it</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>On that<,> <O>inaudible</O></[></{> issue <#\><{><[>Yeah <#\>They
just</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Mmm<,> I know</[></{> <,> I wouldn't do it again though<,>
I've learnt from that experience <#\>I wouldn't fall for the same
arguments again
<$A> <#\>Well they turned the argument from<,> an affirmative
action one into a biological argument <{><[>on the</[> strengths and
weaknesses of women
<$C> <#\><[>Mmm mmm</[></{>     <#\>Mmm<,>
<$A> <#\>And<,,> and<,,> there <{><[>wasn't much you could do</[> about
that
<$C> <#\><[>Which is really stupid</[></{>     <#\>Yeah<,> <{><[>No <#\>I got a<,> I got a <O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>'Cos <O>inaudible</O></[></{> two separate different things
<$C> <#\>Yep <#\>Exactly<,,>
<$A> <#\><@>Forename4</@> was using it as a justification for why women
shouldn't be<,> given<,,> ah affirmative action in<,> in all
types of<,> work<,> because they're biologically different
<$B> <#\><{><[>Oh please</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>And some<,> some women are</[></{> <,> are biologically more
equipped to do jobs<,> s<,,> particular <{><[>jobs<,> or
emotionally equipped or whatever</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>And then there and then there<,></[></{> and then
there's the condescending<,> <{><[>er</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Well</[></{> hang on <#\>What about men<,> <#\>So men aren't
affected emotionally by things <{><[><,> <#\>Is that what he's tryna say</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>But then there was<,> <#\>No</[></{> No <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>There was
the
condescending<,> argument then<,> where he's trying to
redeem<,> I I thought<,> he was trying to redeem himself<,>
when he said that um<,,> well<,,> he's tryna<,> look for a
positive<,> because he'd made all these negatives about why
women can't do work and then he said <quote>oh yeah but then
women are better at stamina<,> than men</quote> <#\>And<,,> and
sort of like well<,,> <quote>yeah <#\>So what</quote> but  <{2><[2>the </[2><,,> the whole object of what he was tryna do was<,> to<,>
find a<,> a positive<,,> to the negative but his overwhelming
views were <{3><[3><,,> negative</[3> 
<$C> <#\><[1>Prob'ly</[1></{1> 
<$B> <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>Yeah <#\>Justifying</[3></{3> the position of men <{><[>in society under<,> subordination</[>

<$A> <#\>I'm sure <@>Forename8</@> thinks that we don't work and that
all
we do is sit around and talk <{><[>and drink coffee</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Well we do</[></{> <#\>That's what happens<,,> <@>forenameA</@> this

<$B> <#\><[>Yeah<,></[></{> <#\>And um<,,> it had all these symptoms<,,>

<$A> <#\><@>forenameB</@> got up and down <O>Blaughs</O>
<$B> <#\>No <O>Claughs</O> <#\>Some one else was just reading

<$C> <#\><[>Who</[></{> It wasn't me 
<$A> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>No <#\>It wasn't you</[></{> <,> but it just reminded me
because
the way you're fidgeting now and going and drawing at the

<$A> <#\><[>Well<,,> what's the longest your concen what's the

the board</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>It depends on what</[></{> I'm doing <#\>It'll vary depending
on
what I'm doing
<$A> <#\>OK <#\>So if you're reading a novel<,>
<$B> <#\>Oh then I'll<,> <{><[>I could<,> Yeah</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>It could be hours</[></{> OK<,> <#\>What about<,> if you're
studying<,,>
<$C> <#\>Four hours<,> for me<,>

<$A> <#\><{><[>Yeah</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Oh I</[></{> might <{><[>get</[> up to go to the toilet<,> or I

<$B> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>Well those sort of things</[></{> that's still<,,>
I
mean<,> I'd have to do that like<,> five to ten minutes.<,,>
<#\>Oh
yeah <#\>Maybe an hour <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\>OK <#\>What about <[><,,> what about</[></{> listening to
lectures<,,>
<$B> <#\>It depends on what I'm doing    <#\>Oh god<,> <#\>Forty minutes<,>
<$A> <#\>Forty minutes <#\>So do you think it's got something to
do
with ah<,,> passive and active interaction<,,> <#\>Do you know
what I mean <#\>Like<,> if you're passively<,,> if you're
passively receiving something<,,> that<,> your attention span
is<,> <{><[>not as great as if you're actively</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>But<,> when I'm at work<,,> I'm not passively</[> receiving something and I<,> get really bored
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O> you couldn't passively receiving
something</[></{>
     <#\>You're passively receiving something reading a novel<,>
but it's that you're interest is being captured
<$A> <#\>Do you think that's passive<,> or do you think you're
ac
actively<,> <{1><[1>taking part in<,> in</[1> formulating the ideas of
that novel<,> <#\>Do you know<,> I mean <{2><[2>there's lots of ideas
there but your<,,> utilising it</[2> whereas some one else is<,>
they're lecturing<,,> are throwing information at you<,>
<$B> <#\><[1>Because you've chosen to read that novel</[1></{1>     <[2><O>inaudible</O> process of utilising the action <#\>Mmm</[2></{2>     <#\>Mmm<,> <#\><{><[>That's true</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>But then again</[></{> <,> if you've got TV<,,> it's so easy
to
be involved in TV passively isn't it
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,,>
<$A> <#\>Because TV just<,,> it gives information as well<,>
<$B> <#\>And it's also an a very individual thing as well<,,>
because<,,> <#\>I mean I'm sort of one of those people I think
that<,> thinks about<,,> you know<,> ten different things at
once<,> and stuff like that<,> <#\><{><[>You know like a tandem</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>What <#\><O>inaudible</O> one to achieve</[></{> 
<$C> <#\>So you're saying that<,> saying that you're a

<$B> <#\>No<,> <#\>Well just like last night I sit there and
watch<,>
television with <@>forenameC</@> I'm in<,> I think I do it all the time<,>
