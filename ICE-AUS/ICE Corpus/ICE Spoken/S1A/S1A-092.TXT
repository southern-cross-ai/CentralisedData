only<,> what four and a half weeks I think
<$B> <#\>Mmm <#\><{><[>It's not very long</[>

something that you're not going to use every bit of
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm
<$B> <#\>Now the difference for instance I got a whole
cauliflower for a dollar ninety nine <{><[><,></[> whereas up in
Woollies they're a dollar fifty for a half

forename6</@> because
um<,> I had made the dinner and it did look a bit sparse
because <{1><[1><,></[1> it was made for four and it had to stretch
to six <{2><[2><,></[2> and um<,> even so we had a nice meal <#\>It
was enough if you were served it in a restaurant you'd say
<quote><#\>That's terrific</quote> you know <{3><[3><,></[3> and I
went into the kitchen and I was waiting <#\>I don't know who I
was waiting for <#\>One of them was<,> a bit slow with their
meal <{4><[4>and I was</[4> waiting for them to finish  so that I and and then  I was going to give

out and he said <quote><#\>Oh I think  I I 
might wait</quote> <O>laughs</O> <#\>So he he went back to the
table and of course by the time they'd had their ice cream
<{5><[5><,> and</[5> their apple pie and their cream and then
finished off with home-made scones he didn't really want his
toast <O>laughter</O> <#\>Aren't I awful
