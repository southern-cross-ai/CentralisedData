<S1A-097>   <2005>
<I><$A>   <#\>There's a copy down in the library
<$B> <#\>Is there really
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>Like we have to hand a copy of our <{><[>M-A
thesis</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>And they</[> </{> put it in the library
<$A> <#\>They put it in the<,> NCELTR<,> resource library
<$B> <#\>Oh right <#\>Over on level three
<$A> <#\>Yeah <{1><[1><,></[1><,> and like everyone's thesis is there
and it's a blue cover with gold lettering<,,>  <{2><[2>and</[2> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1> </{1>        
     <#\><[2>Uhuh</[2> </{2> just like everybody else's
<$A> Just like everyone else <O>Blaughs</O> <#\>Oh some
people<,> have different bindings but yeah that's the<,>
particular popular one
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Pretty standard <#\>What's it actually
called
<$A> <#\>It's called taboo and avoidance language
<$B> <#\>Taboo and avoidance language <#\>I've actually
heard<,,> <#\>Someone's actually mentioned that to me <#\>An
M-A thesis called taboo and avoidance language
<$A> <#\>Oh right
<$B> <#\>So there you go <#\>There are people reading it
<$A> <#\>There are <#\>Fantastic <#\>It's full of errors as
well <#\>Sort of<,> typos and<,,> you know little<,>
<O>inaudible</O> missing
<$B> <#\>Right <#\> Did you <,>so you 
actually typed it yourself
<$A> <#\>Yeah typed it yeah using word perfect five one 
<$B> <#\>Right<,> <#\>Yeah so I've kind of figuring on doing
mine myself too <#\> I can't I don't  think
I'll ever have anything ready in time for some one else to
type it
<$A> <#\>But like<,,> if you let <#\>Yeah I dunno <#\>Leaving
it for some one else to type you have to like<,> print it<,,>
neatly anyway and<,> <{><[>I</[> always use to type directly
from scrawl so
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[> </{>   
     <#\>Yeah yeah <#\>Well that's fair <#\>Yeah I find my
 writing's writing's  unreadable <#\>How
long is it
<$A> <#\>It's about fifteen thousand words
<$B> <#\>And<,> so tell me about it<,> 
<$A> <#\>Well it was really interesting <{1><[1><,></[1> and<,,> I
did it because<,,> well I dunno <#\>I was really interested in
second language acquisition <{2><[2><,></[2><,,>  and but  kind of like having done<,> second language
acquisition option in the M-A and<,> it kind of like seeing
 the the <,,>you know the  mile upon mile of
literature and stuff <{3><[3><,></[3> and like<,> you know people can
get easily bogged down in like second language acquisition
research so I thought <quote>no stuff it <#\>I'm gonna<,,> go
for something that I<,,> like really enjoy and something
that'll hold my interest</quote> <{4><[4>so</[4> I just<,> you
know I just<,> yeah <{5><[5>chose that topic</[5>
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>    
     <#\><[2>Mmhmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmhmm</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>So did you</[5></{5> actually do research on that
<$A> <#\>I'll tell you how it started
<$B> <#\>Yep <#\>Tell me how it started
<$A> <#\>Um<,,> I was in Japan <{><[><,></[><,>  and I went
to Ja like did my B-A  and then went  to
J straight to Japan  so I was in Japan eighty-
seven and eighty-eight
<$B> <#\><[>Mmhmm</[></{>    
     <#\>What <#\>Teaching English <{><[>or</[> trav
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[> </{>
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Teaching English <{1><[1><,></[1> and um<,> in my first
year I was in this um <#\>They call them <O>inaudible</O>
houses there<,,> like these ah  get hou guest
houses  <#\>Mostly foreign people live there
<{2><[2><,> in like</[2> dormitory situation or<,,> usually
yeah or maybe sometimes little private rooms <{3><[3>but</[3>
anyway I was there and one night<,,> you know I was<,> hanging
out with<,> some<,> people at the table<,> and they were all
men<,> funnily enough at this particular stage <#\>But like we
just started talking about<,,> like swear words
<{4><[4>and</[4> like<,> I dunno just listing all the words we
knew for like penis and vagina and fuck off <O>Blaughs</O>
<{5><[5>all</[5> the equivalents<,> <{6><[6>we</[6> could
think of <#\><{7><[7><O>inaudible</O></[7>
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah <,> yeah</[1> </{1>
     <#\><[2>Oh right</[2></{2>    
     <#\><[3>Uhuh</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmhmm</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Yeah</[5></{5>
    <#\><[6>Yeah</[6></{6>
     <#\><[7>I think we've</[7></{7> all had those sorts of
conversations <{1><[1>yeah</[1> <#\>Yeah I've had those
<{2><[2>sorts of conversations</[2> <#\>Yep
<$A> <#\><[1>Hey</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>You have haven't you</[2></{2>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>I mean they're just so good and like<,> I
ended up with this initial lexicon basically <w>'cos</w>  we spent we talked  for hours <{><[><,></[><,>
<#\>We must've talked for three hours easy 
<$B> <#\><[>Mmhmm</[></{> 
     <#\>Can I ask you  what were they all what
nationality  were <{><[>these people</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Heaps of</[></{> nationalities
<#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O> and um</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Really<,,> but all  Eng</[></{> native  English speakers
<$A> <#\>Yep <#\><{1><[1>An</[1> American a Canadian<,> an
Australian<,,> and  that's at least there were at
least  three of us talking <{2><[2><,> from those</[2>
three different nationalities and<,> it was just a really long
conversation <#\>A very interesting <{3><[3>conversation</[3>
<#\>We just listed <#\>We just wrote down all these words we
knew for penis for example and we just like come up with a
list of about almost two hundred or a hundred and
<{4><[4>fifty words</[4>
<$B> <#\><[1>Uhuh</[1></{1>    
     <#\><[2>Right mmhmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmhmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>I was gonna say</[4></{4> there would be a lot of
words <{><[>yeah</[>
<$A> <#\><[>There's</[></{> lots <#\>There's lots  but and   there's more <,>there's a
few more  for penis than there are for vagina too
though
<$B> <#\>Yeah quite <#\>Did you find a substantial number more
<$A> <#\>Ah<,> noticeably more <{><[><,></[><,> but maybe that's
<w>'cos</w> we were coming from the male perspective <#\>I
dunno 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah yeah</[></{>   
     <#\> No I no I  think that men have
more names for it than women do <{><[>actually</[> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\><[>Probably</[></{> 
     <#\> But it was that's  where it
started so I got this lexicon together of um body parts body
functions<,>  <O>Blaughs</O> um abusive epithets <#\>All kinds
of different stuff <{1><[1><,></[1><,> and<,> I thought well this is
interesting so when I came back<,,> doing the M-A and I was
 thinking for thinking about   a<,,> a
a a  special topic I thought <quote>well you know
I wanna do something interesting <#\>I'm not gonna do E-S-L or
second language <{2><[2>acquisition</[2></quote> <#\>You know
boring <#\>Oh I mean very interesting but I don't wanna do a
thesis on it you know <{3><[3><,></[3><,> <#\>And ah<,> so I did that
and it was really yeah it was fun<,> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmhmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Mmm mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmhmm</[3></{3>
     <#\>What and so how did you actually approach it<,>
<#\> What you you went did you <,> run
surveys by people or did you<,,> 
<$A> <#\>Yeah well that was the research part
<$B> <#\>Yep
<$A> <#\>Like the research part was um<,,> like yeah
<#\> The f the research focus  if you like
was<,,> I did questionnaire based research in um<,> ah what
d'you call them um<,> um um um<,,> ah at a<,> teaching
English to migrants A-M-E-S centres <#\><{1><[1>That's
right</[1> <,> <#\>Ah like<,> teacher questionaries and in the
questionaries I asked<,,> um<,> er about teacher's experiences
with swearing<,,>  in a in their  classes
and<,> stuff like that <{2><[2>and that was that</[2><,> focus
but<,> the rest of it was theoretical <{3><[3><,></[3><,> and I gave
a <#\>The first chapter was um<,,> after the introduction was
 a a  very broad<,> kind of like
anthropological perspective on the whole deal
<#\><{4><[4>The</[4> origins of<,> like<,> ah taboo in general
 and and   how <,>how 
they you know<,> tabooed language and things  specif specifically  and <{5><[5><,></[5> stuff like that
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmhmm mmhmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Mmhmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmhmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Mmmhmm</[5></{5>
     <#\>Oh that sounds <{><[>really interesting</[>
<$A> <#\><[>And ah</[></{><,> it was very good <#\>Yeah and
in the second chapter <#\>That was the second chapter
<#\>Third chapter was<,,> about<,,> you know the lexicon of
swearing <{1><[1>and</[1> the fourth chapter was<,> about the
grammar of swearing <{2><[2><,></[2> and I tried to come at it from
a<,,> systemic functional perspective
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmhmm</[1></{1>  
     <#\><[2>Mmhmm</[2></{2>
     <#\>Right <#\><{1><[1>Well</[1> see  that that  book that um<,> <#\>What was it<,> <#\> That <,>you know  dedicated to Arnold<,> Zwicky
about you know<,> lectures in left out <{2><[2>field</[2>
or whatever it was called <{3><[3>had</[3> a lot of
interesting things to say about the grammar of swearing
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\>Yeah right
<$B> <#\>About how<,,> swear words couldn't be used<,,> um
as<,> normal verbs and so on
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\> Swearing the grammar  of
swearing  is is is  quite<,> either very
different <#\><{1><[1>Like</[1> it has it's own special
grammar  that<,> that that that and  they
use like  s special  constructions that you
don't use in<,>  every day <{2><[2>other</[2><,> par
every every every day  conversation <#\>Either
that or they've tended to favour<,> certain types of<,> um
very particular<,> constructions <{3><[3>that</[3> already
existed  in in  the other areas of
language<,> <{4><[4>but  mostly</[4> yeah mostly
swearing  had its own special grammar which was very
interesting
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmm mmm</[4></{4>
     <#\>So you got to analyse that <#\><{><[>That must've
been fascinating</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah I got to analyse that</[></{> and um<,,>
delved into that reasonably so <#\>Like Brian<,> somebody or
other at Sydney Uni who's also  very <,>very  much into swearing research <{1><[1><,></[1>
did a basic outline of the grammar of swearing<,> like the
constructions in his <#\> He he  wrote two
very<,> very good very important kind of like landmark
papers<,> um  in in  the sociolinguistics of
swearing <{2><[2><,></[2> and um<,> yeah he went into that so<,>
yeah they were<,> a couple of my major articles that I based
the thing on
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Mmhmm</[2></{2>
     <#\>Mmm <#\>It's funny I imagine that  when if  you tell people that you're doing serious
research on swearing they just don't take it seriously
<$A> <#\>They don't <#\>They la <{><[>they think
it's funny <#\>Yeah</[>
<$B> <#\><[>They think it's a joke <#\>Yeah</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>They think it's a joke and<,> I had the last laugh
<$B> <#\>Yeah wh
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>Well I mean you know it's something that I
enjoyed doing and I got an A for it <{1><[1>and</[1> um <,,>
ah you know <#\><{2><[2>Good luck to them</[2><,> if they
wanna do other things but that's what I wanted to do
<$B> <#\><[1>Yep</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Yep yep</[2></{2>
     <#\>No that's good <#\>Well<,> in some ways that's
similar to<,> kind of <w>linguists'</w> approach to or
attitude to <#\>Oh not so much now I guess but in the past to
pidgins and creoles  is <{><[><,></[> is 
that it's not a credible topic
<$A> <#\><[>Right</[></{> 
     <#\>That's it <#\>That's it <#\> <{><[>Which
is</[> which is a  fucked attitude
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>Yeah it is
<$A> <#\> It's really it's it's  like<,> an
attitude and it's not a result of<,,> you know any genuine
linguistic enquiry <#\><{1><[1>It's a result of</[1> people's
ah<,> own left over shit from the way they've<,>
<{2><[2>been</[2> brought up and the way they've experienced
the world which is<,> very<,> very<,,> limiting <#\><{3><[3>But
that's not only for</[3> linguistics but it's like  all all <,,>all <,> academic subjects
<{4><[4>are affected</[4> with this attitude
<$B> <#\><[1>No it's just a prejudice</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Yep</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yep absolutely</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Well it's not</[4></{4>
     <#\>Yeah it's true but not<,> just academic subjects
<#\>I mean there's always a prevailing ideology in any<,,>
given culture<,> <{1><[1> that that </[1>
kind of makes everything seem commonsensical  but <,>but  that's only because it's what we're used to
<{2><[2><,></[2> so we think that it makes sense but it's<,>
really<,,>  you know prac you know habit 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah I guess so</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\>Mmm
     <#\>Habit of thinking <#\>That's what I'm interested in
challenging in my <{><[>research</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Habits of</[></{> thinking <#\>You go for it<#\><{><[>You</[> go for it
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>  
     <#\>Yes it's to kind of use a research approach that
says<,> that  a prevailing<,> approach the the
prevailing ideology  isn't necessarily acceptable and
that research isn't neutral <{1><[1><,></[1> and that if I'm going
to say something and try to pretend it's neutral all I'm
really doing is reinforcing the status quo <{2><[2><,></[2>  and and  I'm not interested in doing that
<#\>I'm interested in challenging it <{3><[3><,></[3><,> <w>'cos</w>
people are oppressed you know
<$A> <#\><[1>Definitely</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Excellent good on you</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Good on you</[3></{3>
     <#\>People are <#\><{><[>That's right</[>
<$B> <#\><[>And<,> </[></{> you know the Aboriginal people
are oppressed
<$A> <#\>They are
<$B> <#\>You know<,> different socio-economic groups are
oppressed
<$A> <#\>Yep
<$B> <#\>It's just not good enough <{><[><,></[> basically 
<$A> <#\><[>Good on ya</[></{> <#\>No I'm<,> really really
glad that you're going for that <w>'cos</w> that's really
excellent <#\><{><[>An</[> excellent way to use<,,> like
the tools of linguistics in a<,> like a very very worthwhile
applicable way instead of just like some wanky way you know
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah um</[></{> 
     <#\>Yeah well  I I  feel strongly
that<,> linguistics has a lot to offer the world <{><[><,></[>
and I tell you um<,,>  that<,> yeah that that  language is about how people see the world
<#\>It creates people's perspectives on reality and  if <,>if  people can<,> broaden their<,>
perspective on reality<,> then they need to um<,,> yeah and
they need to broaden<,> their understanding of things I guess
<#\>I don't really know what I'm trying to say there  
<$A> <#\><[>Oh yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>No yeah <#\> I know what you are I know
what you're  trying to say<,> 
<$B> <#\>Yeah it's  <{1><[1>just</[1> <,>just  not good enough<,> oppression<,>
<{2><[2>basically</[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Cool</[2></{2> yeah <#\>That's excellent <#\>Go
for it <{><[><,></[> <#\>You've got my support
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>Thank you
<$A> <#\>Yeah you bet 
<$B> <#\>Thank you <{><[>um</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[> </{> all the way through<,> 
<$B> <#\>I'll have to tell you about my exciting and thrilling
ideas about it <#\>I haven't actually <O>laughing</O> got
anything on paper yet 
<$A> <#\>You haven't got what
<$B> <#\>Put anything on paper yet
<$A> <#\>Oh right
<$B> <#\>I hate writing
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>I like reading <#\>I like thinking<,> and I like
talking
<$A> <#\>But not writing <#\>Yeah <#\>Writing sucks a little
<{><[>bit</[> doesn't it
<$B> <#\><[>And</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>I find it intimidating <#\><{><[>If</[>
you write it down people can read it even if you're not there
to explain what it really means
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>  
     <#\>Mmm<,> 
<$B> <#\>And you know  I guess I just maybe I
don't  trust my own<,> ability to express myself<,>
