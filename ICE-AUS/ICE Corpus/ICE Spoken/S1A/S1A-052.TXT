<S1A-052> <2003>
<I><$A>   <#\>I went and saw <@>forename1</@> 's sister's wedding 
<$B> <#\>Oh how was it
<$A> <#\>It was good <{><[>except</[> we were late<,> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>How come<,,>
<$A> <#\>Well <@>forename2</@> came up to see me<,,> and I said to her
<quote>are you gonna come</quote><,> <O>window closing
noises</O>
<$B> <#\>That's not gonna make any difference is it
<$A> <#\>And she said <quote>oh yeah</quote> so we we  went to like and I said <quote>oh well
let's go then</quote> and she goes<,> <#\>This is you know
we'd been getting ready for a while<,> and she goes
<quote>well I'll just go and ring <@>forename3</@> and tell him that
we're leaving</quote> and I'm thinking<,> <quote>well why
didn't you ring <@>forename3</@> ten minutes ago</quote> <#\>And she rang
him and then her car wouldn't start<,,> but I didn't know that
<w>'cos</w> I'd already driven down to the bottom of the drive
and expected her to be following me and five minutes later
when she hadn't come up behind me I sort of thought<,> oh
<#\>So anyhow then she came and she followed along behind me
<#\>She was driving incredibly slowly and I just thought it
was <@>forename2</@> <,,> and then her car stalled at Richmond<,,> so I went
back around the block and then came back and sort of saw
it was <,> see what was  wrong and then it like<,>
started going again<,,> <#\>So by the time we'd done all this
we'd wasted about ten or fifteen minutes
<$B> <#\>What sort of car is it<,,>
<$A> <#\>Commodore<,,> <#\>And<,> so we got out to Riverside
Oakes at<,> like<,> <#\>The wedding was five thirty and we got
there at twenty five to<,,> and of course they must've been
right on time or early or something not knowing how
<O>inaudible</O> <#\>We got there and the service had already
started<,,> <#\>So we snuck in quietly <w>'cos</w> I thought
oh we'd come all this way you know
<$B> <#\>I agree <#\>I would've 
<$A> <#\>And then there were no seats at the back<,,>
<#\>Clunk clunk clunk<,,> <#\>But it was really nice
<#\>Like<,> when you walked in it was a big conference or
whatever<,> and like<,> straight looked like
straight ahead  of you there's all glass windows<,,>
and like the seating was all there and then it went down a
step and then that's where<,> they were all standing out the
front and then<,> the glass windows all look out over the golf
course
<$B> <#\>Oh that would've been nice
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>It looked really pretty<,,> <#\>And<,,> the
stupid minister kept getting <@>forename4</@> 's name wrong<,>
<$B> <#\>What'd he keep saying
<$A> <#\>He called him <@>forename5</@> for about the first half of the
service then he called him <@>forename6</@> <,,> <#\>By this stage
everyone's sort of going like<,> <#\>And then when
<$B> <#\>I'd've corrected him
<$A> <#\>I that's what that's what  <@>forename2</@> said
<#\>She said <quote>I couldn't've helped myself <#\>I would've
just leaned forward and said excuse me it's <@>forename4</@> </quote><,,>
<#\>And then when <@>forename4</@> said <quote>I <@>forename4</@> </quote><,> and
then<,> when <@>forename7</@> said you know <quote>I take <@>forename4</@> </quote> he
sort of caught on<,> to it<,,> <#\>But umm <,> No it was good

<$B> <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>But by then he'd used the name so many
million times 
<$A> <#\>That's right <#\>Like everyone gonna say
<quote>what about how he kept getting your name wrong</quote>
<$B> <#\>Yeah but I just think when that that
when  things like that happen it seems <{><[>so
impersonal</[>
<$A> <#\><[>That's what I</[></{> that's what
I  said to mum <#\>I said <quote>it makes it so obvious
that they don't have a clue who you are <#\>They don't know
you from</quote>
<$B> <#\>And that and that  they just don't
care <#\>I mean like the celebrant we had<,> <#\>Like you know
she met with us before hand and she was really particular<,>
<{><[><,></[> <#\>She you know <#\>It was very much <quote>this is
your wedding you know do it just how you want</quote> and she
was like you know<,,> um<,> <quote>okay you know it's <@>forenameB</@> 
and <@>forename8</@> <,> but you know you don't have any strange
pronunciations sorta like different ways of saying it </quote>
and you know<,> she was really<,,> really fussy about that and
it was nice<,> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Mmm<,> well when <,> at your marriage and they get
your name wrong<,,> um<,>
<$B> <#\>The ministers are so awful
<$A> <#\>He seemed like a nice minster though<,> as far as
they go<,,> <#\>But Shell looked nice <#\>She had<,,> <#\>They
had two bridesmaids<,> and<,,> it was like a really deep
burgundy<,> shot with blue <#\><{><[>You know how you get
that green</[><,> <#\>Yeah and they were long and straight<,>
very fitted and they came down to about there<,,> and<,> like
you know those like sort of a bit across like we had on
yours<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> only it just went straight across and it
just like<,> sat off<,,> <#\>It looked really nice
<$B> <#\><[>Oh that would've suited her</[></{>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>And <@>forename7</@> 's dress was straight<,,> but I didn't get
that close a look at it really <#\>She had a huge veil<,> and
it was lace up the top <#\>That was nice<,,> and I couldn't
work out whether like  from the waist
down whether it was<,> silk or<,> satin <w>'cos</w> I didn't
get that close but it looked nice <#\>It looked really pretty
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,> <#\>Oh that sounds nice
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>It was nice
<$B> <#\>It was good that you went <w>'cos</w> <@>forename1</@> always
comes to <O>inaudible</O> She's really nice like that
<#\>She's really sort of you know<,,> diligent in that
way<,,> Mmm<,> <w>'cos</w> I thought it was nice when she
came to mine
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>It is nice when people just<,> <{><[><,></[> come
to see 
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\><w>'cos</w> then you feel bad <w>'cos</w> you haven't
asked them<,> and they come<,> and other people that you've
asked<,> like
<$A> <#\>Oh but I don't think you need to feel bad <#\>I think
they're just sort of interested and they wouldn't expect to be
invited
<$B> <#\>Mmm exactly<,>
<$A> <#\>And they just<,> curious to have a look
<$B> <#\>But you know like we asked some people who accepted
and then<,> just didn't turn up
<$A> <#\>Did you
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Only two but 
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>I didn't know that<,,>
<$B> <#\>Mmm <#\>It's just like<,> you know<,,> and didn't
like call and say you know <{><[>something last minute's
happened</[> you know <#\>The children have taken sick or we
can't get a babysitter or anything like that <#\>They just
didn't show up<,,>
<$A> <#\>That's terrible<,>
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,>
<$A> <#\><[>Something's come up</[></{>
     <#\>No <#\>It looked like a really nice spot <#\>It
was<,,> sort of <#\>looked really green because of all the
<,,> golf course and that sort of thing<,>
<$B> <#\>One of the girls I work with was saying um<,> that
she had to go to a wedding on Saturday <#\>The wedding was at
two o'clock<,,> at Burwood and the reception was at Fairfield
at seven<,,>
<$A> <#\>What were you meant to do in the meantime
<$B> <#\>Well they'd apparently hired a hall somewhere near um
Burwood<,> for people to just have drinks and nibblies<,,> but
basically <{><[><,,> her father</[> had insisted that he
wanted the reception at this certain place<,,> and she wanted
the church<,> like to be<,> this place where she lived<,> and
that was the only times they could get<,,>
<$A> <#\><[>How bored would you be</[></{>
     <#\>But even if you went for nibblies you'd be bored out
of your mind after five hours of nibblies<,,>
<$B> <#\>Well it's three<,>
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> 
<$B> <#\>so three hours<,,> <#\>Three hours of
standing around a hall<,> waiting for the reception<,>
<$A> <#\>I'd I  would've gone home
<$B> <#\>That's nearly the whole recep reception  <#\>Yeah but what d'you do when you live
out say somewhere like here
<$A> <#\>I would've gone shopping <O>ABlaugh</O> <#\><{><[>I
would've gone somewhere and had coffee</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>I would've done something too</[></{>
<$A> but <{2><[2>like<,> 
<$B> you know Burwood</[2> <#\>It's an hour and a half home<,>
<{3><[3><,></[3> and an hour and a half back you know
<$A> <#\>That's incredible
<$B> <#\><[2>I would've gone for coffee</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\>Unbelievable
<$A> <#\>People get so bizarre about weddings and what they're
gonna do and
<$B> <#\>They get so rigid<,,> <#\>You know<,> like rigid
about dates <#\>Like once I sort of thought oh well you know
the great hall would be good<,> and I sort of you know
suggested <,> I suggested  a date in November
<#\>No no <#\>You know<,> <#\>And it was just like <quote>well
this is the date <#\>Do you want it</quote> <#\><quote>Yeah
yeah <#\>That's fine</quote><,> <#\>Basically I ended up
saying <quote>well when is it ready<,> <{><[><,></[> <#\>When
would be possible<,> <#\>Well that'll be good</quote>
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>I don't think it I couldn't 
really see any month mattering <w>'cos</w> you can have a bad
day any month
<$B> <#\>That's right
<$A> <#\>So<,,> <#\>Oh and the sleeves were really nice on the
dresses too <#\>They were short <#\>They looked like they'd
been pushed <w>'cos</w> they were like<,,> I guess ruched all
the way around and it looked like they'd just sort of <{><[>been<,,></[> pushed up and they they  looked
really nice<,> <#\>Mrs <@>surname9</@> made the bridesmaid dresses<,>
the wedding dress<,> the wedding cake <#\>She made all the
centre pieces for the tables <#\>Like those little topiary<,>
plants or<,,> you know with the potplant<,> stems<,,> <#\>I
don't know how she did it all
<$B> <#\><[>Oh that's nice</[></{>
     <#\>Is she quite crafty is she<,> <#\>Obviously
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,> <{><[>very</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Unbelievable</[></{><,,>
<$A> <#\>She's good at the wedding cakes
<$B> <#\>Is she
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>She does a really professional job
<$B> <#\>Well that's nice<,,>
<$A> <#\>took lots of photos
<$B> <#\>Yeah <O>Blaughing</O>
<$A> <#\>Got carried away really<,> <{><[><,></[>
<$B> Oh you know that film I had in on Thursday Friday  night <O>cuckoo clock sounds</O><$A> <O>Alaughs</O> Ahh I'm going to kill that cuckoo
clock<,,> <#\><O>inaudible</O> twelve noon
and twelve midnight
<$B> <#\><[>Why</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>That's true<,,> <#\>Um
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <O>Alaughs</O>
<$B> <#\>Um<,> yeah that film I had in the camera on Friday
night<,,>
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,>
<$B> <#\>Just <,> it  got to thirty six<,,>
thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine <#\>Something like that
<#\>I think there's something wrong with this though
<#\>There's something wrong with it <#\>either the film <#\>He
thinks he's already rewound the film and not taken it out of
the camera<,,>
<{><[><,></[> and so in fact I took photos of nothing<,>
<O>Blaughs</O> <#\><{2><[2>All that effort</[2> <#\>I lugged
that stupid thing everywhere<,,>
<$A> <#\><[>Oh right</[></{>
     <#\><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2></{2>
     <#\>Did the video last the whole time
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Like<,> had they turned it off<,> just while it the  stage was dark
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>They kept turning it off<,> every time the
stage went dark <#\>It looked really good <#\>I had a look
at it and it looked really good<,,> <#\>So um<,,> <#\>But<,>
I mean it was the same with the video <#\>All that effort to
get up during the night <#\>The batteries<,> <#\>I don't know
why he said charge all the batteries <#\>He should've just
said bring the power lead <O>Alaughs</O> <#\>Oh dear<,,>
<#\>It's one thing after another<,>
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>What time did he get home yesterday
<$B> <#\>He<,> or me
<$A> <#\>He
<$B> <#\>Oh he had to be home <#\>He didn't go home till about
eight o'clock <w>'cos</w> I had to go to work and
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> <,,> 
<$A> <[>Oh right</[> </{><,> Ohh I see
<$B> <#\>He's staying in town <,,> for his graduation
night<,> <{><[>or his ambition <O>inaudible</O></[> <,> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\><[>When's that not this week but next</[></{>
     <#\>And are you going to stay at the Hilton or you
haven't organised it yet
<$B> <#\>I don't know whether we going to stay at the Hilton
or somewhere different <#\>I was just gonna get a couple of
prices <#\>If it's much dearer we'll stay somewhere else we'll
stay at the Hilton but if it's sort of a similar price<,> we
might stay somewhere different just for a change<,,> <{><[><,></[>
<#\>You know<,> because we've stayed at the Hilton <#\>I mean
it's nice but<,,> you know <#\>It'd be nice to stay somewhere
else for a change
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>It'd be nice</[></{>
     <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>I think there probably is quite a
difference in the prices<,> <#\>The other place that's
cheapish is<,,> the Novotel at Darling Harbour
<$B> <#\>Is it<,,>
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Well that'd be nice <#\>Just I'd
just  like something <{><[>different <#\>You
know</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Different <#\>Yeah</[></{> <#\>I think it's
probably<,> <{1><[1>cheaper</[1> <#\>I don't know if it'd be
cheaper there because<,> you're catering to<,>
<{2><[2><,></[2> Japanese tourists
<$B> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>Anyway I thought I'd just ring a couple
<#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>That looks nice though <#\>Dad was it</[></{> the nikko that dad said had the really
nice Japanese restaurant
<$B> <#\>I think so <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Not that we'll be eating
there <w>'cos</w> we've got the ball
<$A> <#\>Ah yeah <#\>That's right
<$B> <#\>But um<,> <#\>I was just sort of thinking you know<,>
like the ball's sort of <#\>There's the admission during the the  day<,> and I thought<,,> rather than
sort of get ready from here and then go in and then come back
to here<,,> if we can check in say you know sometime around
about midday<,> well we can actually get ready from there
<$A> <#\>But you should be able you can check
in  anytime can't you</I>
