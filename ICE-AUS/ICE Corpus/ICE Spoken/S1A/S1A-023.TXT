<I><$A> <#\><O>laugh</O> Okay <#\>What did<,,>  <{><[>whatsaname
say</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Okay</[></{> <#\>Mr No Personality rang<,,> 
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm 
<$B> <#\>and said that they won't be selling the house this
year<,> <{><[>because</[>
<$A> <#\><[>fabulous</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>um<,> one of <@>forename1</@> 's sisters has got a malignant
tumour<,> that will need<,> <{><[>operating</[> on
<$A> <#\><[>Oh</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>I didn't ask which which sister <#\>Um<,,> so<,,>
that<,> they just won't do anything about it this year <#\>So
we're <{><[>set</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Oh</[></{> that's fabulous <#\>That means we haven't got
to keep looking for um <{><[><O>inaud</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>No house searching</[></{> <,> 
<$A> <#\>All rightie
<$B> <#\>And<,> I guess<,> he'll advise us <#\>I also<,> put
in a little ah thing about the bond<,,>  <#\>I <{><[>said to him</[> 
<$A> <#\><[><O>laughs</O></[></{> 
<$B> <#\>ah <quote>just out of curiosity I'd like to know<,,>
whose name<,> our bond is deposited under</quote>  <#\>I said
<quote>the reason I'm asking is that <@>forenameA</@> and myself want to
know if <@>forename2</@> <@>surname2</@> 's <{><[>name</[> <#\>is still on the rental<,> rental bond board list and whether in fact we should remove it</quote>
<$A>  <#\><[>Oh</[></{> <#\>Well done
<$B> <#\>But<,> he doesn't have that information <#\><@>forename1</@> 
is in the Philippines till Wednesday and he will ring us
back<,>  <#\>And if he hasn't rung by Friday then I will ring
him
<$C> <#\>It's not with them because the interest cheque comes
out<,> to this address
<$B> <#\>Does it <{><[>really</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>In whatever</[></{> name but it comes out anyway
<$B> <#\>Is that <{><[>right</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Does it</[></{> <{><[>really</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>Cos we used to get it something you know ten dollars
or something <#\><{><[><O>inaud six syll</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Well we've certainly got them</[></{> by the short and
curlies, haven't we
<$B> <#\>So what do we do about it though if he comes wh oh
OK <#\>Well we'll just wait till <@>forename1</@> gets back
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm<,,>  <#\>Well it's good to know that we
haven't gotta worry about moving
<$C> <#\>It is rather
<$B> <#\>So we can stop<,> looking
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>We <{><[>can</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Not</[></{> that we were doing much looking
<$A> <#\>No <#\>We sort of went off it <{><[>in the</[> last few
weeks
<$C> <#\><[>Problems</[></{> <O>laughs</O>
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>OK so um<,> we'll see what he says about the
bond
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>And whether we want ah want to attack him<,,> now
about it I'll see what<,> <#\>But surely we're gonna have them
worried
<$A> <#\>Oh I think so<,> <#\>I think so
<$C> <#\>He didn't say anything about changing the lease
though<,> did he <#\>Interior decorating
<$B> <#\>No <#\>All he said was <quote>oh we'd have to paint
it before we tried to sell it</quote> and I just went
<quote>mmm</quote> <O>ABlaugh</O>  
<$A> <#\>I think my no must've been quite um <,>
<$B> <#\>Well I figure that <{><[>you know</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>sensitive</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>when once he said that it wouldn't happen this year I
didn't feel the need to ask
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Because<,> we've got the rest of this year
<$A> <#\>Yeah brilliant<,,> <#\>Absolutely brilliant
<$B> <#\>So<,> there you go 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>So let's wait and see <,>
<$A> <#\>So you'll have somewhere to come home to
<$B> <#\>That's right <#\>So we'll just wait and see um what
happens about the bond board
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>Fair enough  
<$B> <#\>Yeah see so um  <,,>
<$A> <#\>Did he tell you wh wh wh where the operation was
going to be
<$B> <#\>No <#\>I asked <#\>He said they didn't know 
<#\>They're waiting for the first available private bed 
<$A> <#\>Well I'd say in that case it's <@>forename3</@> <,,> because of
ah um um <@>forename4</@> is in the States
<$B> <#\>Is she
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>It must be <@>forename3</@> then <#\>Is she the oldest
<$A> <#\>I think she is <#\>She's the nicest too <,,>
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>Although she is the one we had the problem with the
ah water bed <#\>When she couldn't make a decision until
she'd spoken to <@>forename1</@> <,,>
<$B> <#\>Mmm <,,>
<$C> <#\>They all own this place together do they
<$A> <#\>The three of th ah hang on  <#\>No <#\>I think it's
only <@>forename3</@> and <@>forename1</@> now <#\><{><[>I think</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <#\>One of them sold out 
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>I think <@>forename4</@> sold out when um <,> she
went overseas  <#\>She got um<,,> she married a guy with US
residency<,> and she's been living there ever since I believe 
<$B> <#\>Maybe I can go and say gooday when I um go over and
visit, huh

actually <{><[>start</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Can't</[></{> afford it <#\>But it's not that far I mean
really
<$B> <#\>No <#\>I guess not
<$A> <#\>And I mean it's um<,,> if I can pick up one of those
bargains <,>
<$B> <#\>Flights
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Flights six nights accommodation, um<,>
entry to Disneyland, tour of Universal Studios, about fourteen
hundred
<$B> <#\>Uh

too<,> <#\>It'll be between the summer and the ski seasons
<,,>
<$B> <#\>Um
<$A> <#\><{><[>So that should be <O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>You'll have a brilliant time</[></{> <#\>Disneyland is
the most brilliant place on earth
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>I'm looking forward to that<,> plus I
figure<,,> I wanna see how the Americans celebrate Halloween
<$B> <#\>Oh it's brilliant
<$A> <#\>What a way to have a birthday<,,> 
<$B> <#\>I um <,,>  I had one Halloween in Texas <,,> <&>cat
jumps onto her lap</&> <#\>Go away Skittles <,,>  
<$A> <#\><&>to cat</&> <#\>You opportunist <#\>I'll get the
clothes basket out to you again  
<$C> <#\>D'you see one of them this morning underneath the
umbrella <#\>It did actually look quite cute <#\>The cat
looked <{><[>cute</[> 
<$X> <X><#\><[>Cleo</[></{> <,,></X>
<$A> <#\>Skittles happened to be in<,,> in a very tempting
place this morning so my clothes basket went over the top of
it
<$B> <#\>How unfortunate
<$A> <#\>It was <#\>Real spooky when the clothes basket
started to move <O>Claughs</O>
<$B> <#\>You're cute when you wanna be <#\>Does he still
hassle you
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>Yes <#\>I'm sure he thinks he's my cat
<$B> <#\>Does he really <#\>He hassles you that much <,>
<#\>He's funny <#\>He's a really cuddly cat <#\>He's a lot
more friendly than the other one
<$X> <X><#\>Right</X>
<$A> <#\>So if he goes missing<,> while we're gone
<$B> <#\>I'll be asking <@>forename7</@> <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$X> <X><#\>Well I was actually worried about you moving because
I thought<,> he might come back</X>
<$B> <#\>Oh
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$X> <X><#\>But anyway</X>
<$B> <#\>Well<,,> I think the thing to do with cats anyway is
you lock <w>'em</w> in the house for the first three days
<#\>You don't let <w>'em</w> out<,,> <#\>I mean um <,>
<$C> <#\>And if that still doesn't work try
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>And when you do let them</[></{> out you let them out
hungry <#\>You don't feed them<,> so then they'll come back
for their dinner and then you lock <w>'em</w> in again
<O>Alaughs</O>
<$A> <#\><{><[>If that's the case</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>We guarantee then</[></{> that they will be here when you
when
you go away <#\>We'll lock them in the room and not feed them
for six weeks <,>
<$A> <#\>In your room
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Stafe<,> safe stench <O>ABClaugh</O>
<$A> <#\>They'll still be here when she comes home
<$C> <#\>They will <#\>Just as you left <w>'em</w> <#\>Just
where you left them anyway
<$B> <#\>Oh you be kind<,,> <#\>They're not bad boys<,,>
sometimes <,,>
<$A> <#\>Some of the time
<$B> <#\>There's been a noticeable absence of dead things
lately I've noticed
<$A> <#\>There has  
<$B> <#\>It's true  
<$A> <#\>Maybe it's something to do with you um chopping the
bushes back  <#\>There's nowhere<,> for them to go hunting
<$B> <#\>Mmm maybe <,,> <#\>We um often would find their gifts
<,> out here<,> or in the laundry
<$A> <#\>Actually we haven't had any throwing up lately either
<O>laughter</O> which is <{><[>nice</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm-mmm</[></{> 
<$C> <#\>There's only the bin turned over at the moment  
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>They've been doing that a bit more<,> but<,>
ah<,> if you take the rubbish out<,> at night
<$C> <#\>I laughed this morning heh heh <#\>I came out bin was
turned over and there was one<,> used<,> teabag in the bin and
I went <O>ABlaugh</O> <quote>ha that must've been satisfying 
<#\>Was it worth the effort guys</quote>
<$A> <#\>Oh god the good old garbage bin trick<,,>  <#\>Mmm
<O>yawn</O> <O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>I'm one step closer to getting rid of the combie
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>I've now got a stereo working in it
<$A> <#\>I'm offended<,>
<$C> <#\>I should've <,> done it before we went to Coffs
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$C> <#\>We could've enjoyed the trip better
<$A> <#\>So stereo's in <#\>Have you got the spotlights off
<$C> <#\>Spotlights come off this afternoon or maybe tomorrow 
<$B> <#\>So when are you going to advertise
<$C> <#\>Next weekend I reckon
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>So if you're woken up at six o'clock in the
morning by the door being banged down by a large crowd of
interested buyers
<$A> <#\><{><[>Surfies hippies</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>We'll point them in your</[></{> direction <O>Claughs</O>

they're not leaving till they've bought it <,,> 
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>That's how it works <#\>If they've got twenty bucks
in their wallet I'll take that and they can have the combie
<$B> <#\>How much do you really think you'll get for it
<$C> <#\>Dunno<,,> <O>inaudible</O><,> how many are for sale
and the ones that're for sale on that week<,> <w>'cos</w> a
lot of them are camper <{><[><,></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
<$C> <#\>campers and they go for more <,> than people like<,>
they're gonna get one of them only want one of them<,> so this
is different to that 
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,,>  
<$C> <#\>But I'm thinking of putting it in for two and a half
then <,> I should be<,> the cheapest one in the paper 
<$A> <#\>Well don't <{><[>you</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>That'll</[></{> normally you get <{><[>more calls</[>

<$A> <#\>Mmm  <#\>What about Trading Post
<$C> <#\>I'll do the Trading Post<,> on Wednesday<,> and that
then hangs around for two weeks <,,> so I could do that <#\>I
might do that <,,> <#\>It's cheaper <,,>
<$A> <#\>Give that a shot first and then um<,,>  
<$C> <#\>Could always try Victoria Street if it came to it
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,>   
<$B> <#\>How long does it take water and sugar to turn into
caramel
<$A> <#\>A long time<,> <#\>You've got and then then you've
got to catch it at the the right time or it burns <,,> <#\>It
just goes like a <{><[>sss</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>It's a</[></{> <,> very very pale pale pale brown at the
