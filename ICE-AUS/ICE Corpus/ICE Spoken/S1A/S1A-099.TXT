<S1A-099> <2013>
<I><$A>   <#\>Well oh I had a pretty action packed day um
<#\>What've I been doing<,> <#\>I um kind of jumped the
university boat ah midway through the day and went and had a
bit of a lunch over at smackers
<$B> <#\>Oh pretty good 
<$A> <#\>I was actually hoping to have ah one with
<@>familiarname1</@> as well but um like as in the same type
of lunch <O>Blaughs</O> but ah this did not eventuate as
<@>familiarname1</@> got an attack of calvinistic bad luck and
decided he just had to go<,> and um assuage his guilty
feelings
<$B> <#\>Right
<$A> <#\>I think it's purely a matter of luck to whether he
feels guilty on that sort of thing
<$B> <#\>Studying as atoning for his sins
<#\><{1><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1> <#\>Yeah I use to feel that
way <quote>oh look I've been bad lately I should go to a
tutorial</quote> <O>ABlaugh</O> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yes</[1></{1> 
     <#\>It'll make me feel better <{2><[2><O>Alaughs</O>
<#\> The the  panacea</[2>
<$B> <#\><[2>It will yes <#\><O>inaudible</O></[2></{2>
<#\>I've been indulging in pleasures of the flesh so I must go
and um<,> do some more chemistry study
<$A> <#\>Do you think tertiary education is preventing a
revolution in Australia
<$B> <#\>Ah no um no
<$A> <#\>No
<$B> <#\>I don't see it as a major safety valve  to um to  let off the steam and the<,> anger and the fury
of um young people
<$A> <#\>No
<$B> <#\>No <#\>I think that's Arnold Swarzenegger movies
<$A> <#\>Oh right oh right <#\>I wondered what they were for
<O>Alaughs</O>
<$B> <#\>Definitely<,> <#\> They're they're 
the backbone of our culture nowadays <#\> they're they're  what we're all for <#\><{1><[1>I
appreciate</[1> <#\>Yeah I had a day which went rather longer
than I had intended <#\> I um yeah I roamed 
around<,> got very warm out at<,> Dulwich Hill and
Marrickville and places <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Were you</[2></{2> um trying to flog cheap wine
in exchange for questions
<$B> <#\>Um no <#\>I wasn't even flogging cheap wine <#\>I was
just um handing out the questions and um demanding answers and
the trouble is like  when er when  a
sort of um bald white person who's twice as tall as you walks
into your shop and um <O>Alaughs</O> starts speaking to you
very fast in a language which <{1><[1>is not your own</[1>
demanding information 
<$A> <#\><[1><O>Alaughs</O></[1></{1> 
     <#\>Like for example English
<$B> <#\>Exactly
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>Um well it's the second language so um yeah <#\>And
starts demanding information and you don't know why or who
he's from or anything about him <{1><[1>and</[1> yeah you'd
probably get a bit of an initial negative reaction and even
<O>inaudible</O> <{2><[2>as well</[2> <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2><O>Alaughs</O></[2></{2>
     <#\>It's your enormous body <@>forenameC</@> <#\>You
overpower them and  they they  feel small
and insignificant and liable to be squashed against the wall
like an insignificant fly
<$B> <#\>Well that doesn't help ah <#\>Maybe if I kneeled
<$A> <#\>Maybe if you kneeled
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\> I think I still think  you should
have long hair so you have that bushy sort of hippy you know
couldn't possibly connect  finger with or er <,> fist with jaw  type person um
<$B> <#\>No that doesn't work 
<$A> <#\>You know you need to look like a pacifist <#\>You
need some beads
<$B> <#\>Um are you familiar with the um hair length of the
members of Metallica and or Megadeath <O>Alaughs</O> um
<$A> <#\>Touche 
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\><{1><[1>It</[1> doesn't follow
<$A> <#\><[1>Um</[1></{1>  
     <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>Anyway so yeah um so that ended then I went into work
and dotted all the i's and crossed all the t's and did some
boring paper work and that finished at nine thirty <#\>Oh god
<$A> <#\>You can make the paper work last if you really want
it to
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Oh
<$B> <#\>So yeah so um now it's all over thank god 
<$A> <#\>Oh dear
<$B> <#\>The reason I'm calling is <{1><[1><,></[1><,> um drum roll
please um <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> for a cycle in the
park on Saturday
<$A> <#\><[1>Yo</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2><O>drum roll sounds</O></[2></{2>
     <#\>The day of sat
<$B> <#\>Sorry
<$A> <#\>Yes good um <#\>That sounds lush
<$B> <#\>Yes and ah I was wondering um <#\>I saw
<@>forename2</@> yesterday in fact he dropped by and I was
just sitting there naked on my bed as one does on a really hot
afternoon when there isn't a hell of a lot to do
<O>Alaughs</O> and ah
<$A> <#\>Sorry who was this
<$B> <#\>Sorry <@>forename2</@> 
<$A> <#\><@>surname2</@> 
<$B> <#\>Yes <{1><[1>right</[1> <#\> And so and  ah <@>forename1</@> says
<quote><@>forenameC</@> you have a visitor</quote> so I um
had to<,> get dressed and um open the door and um say
<quote>hello look I'm naked but</quote>
<$A> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>
     <#\>But we can still be friends
<$B> <#\>Exactly yes
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>Why don't you take off yeah well
<O>laughs</O>
<$B> <#\>No <quote>look I'm in the neighbourhood <#\>Can I
stop by <#\>Are you there</quote> <{1><[1>but</[1> I dunno
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\>What was he doing wandering vaguely through the
streets of Chippendale <#\>I mean shouldn't he have been  wandling wandering  vaguely through I dunno the
streets of Darlinghurst or some place a lot more hip or<,>
<{2><[2>happening</[2>
<$B> <#\><[2>I believe</[2></{2> he started wandering in Glebe
which is fairly hip nowadays in a <{3><[3>sort of</[3> Balmain
kind of way 
<$A> <#\><[3>Yeah but</[3></{3> 
     <#\>I wonder about a person  that that 
wanders through Glebe and then wanders over Parramatta Road
<#\>I mean he must  be have  some
amazing sort of sixth sense to get him through that traffic
without um losing bits of himself
<$B> <#\>This is true yeah <#\>He was um wandering in much the
state as you described <#\>He apparently hadn't actually been
to bed the night before so <{1><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1> like
five o'clock in the afternoon
<$A> <#\><[1>Ah</[1></{1>  
     <#\>Bit of an all nighter
<$B> <#\>Yep
<$A> <#\> Was he um <{1><[1><,></[1> he
hadn't  used certain mind altering substances or
something
<$B> <#\><[1>All nighter again</[1></{1>    
     <#\>Um not noticeably no
<$A> <#\>Mmm 
<$B> <#\>So just um tired and hanging out <#\>I gave him
coffee so that might've altered his mind although
<O>inaudible</O> <O>Alaughs</O>
<$A> <#\>Oh well coffee is often a good hit
<$B> <#\>Indeed um <#\>Did we agree that yes we would both
like to um go to the Opera in the Park <{1><[1>and</[1> hang
out <{2><[2>and</[2> this ensures that it will rain
<O>Alaughs</O> but alright that's life
<$A> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\>Well look no but  that's <@>forename2</@>   has gone um up the coast so<,>
it's gonna stop raining soon
<$B> <#\>Oh right
<$A> <#\> When she  sort of arrived and it
started to rain  and and <,> then she left
and we had a couple of sunny days <{1><[1>so</[1>  I I  assume
<$B> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>   
     <#\>You're burdening the poor girl with um
<$A> <#\>The guilt
<$B> <#\>Indeed
<$A> <#\>Mmm well  I'm I'm  hoping she'll go
to Walgett and visit all sorts of inland towns <#\>I told her
that Warumbungles were very nice   
<$B> <#\>Well you'll have to get her to go to Cobar as the
place to bring rain and it'd be handy  
<$A> <#\>Yeah come to scenic Cobar
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> she wasn't Swedish <w>'cos</w>
Sweden's suddenly become and arid dust bowl of a
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Plenty of rivers in Sweden
<$B> <#\><{1><[1>I s'pose so</[1>
<$A> <#\><[1>Hey  did you </[1></{1> did
you  see the <@>forename3</@> <,> <#\><@>forename3</@> <#\>I always call him
<@>forename3</@> <w>'cos</w> all Liberals are called <@>forename3</@> <#\>Did you see
Alexander Downer's um latest effort
<$B> <#\>No <#\>I <O>inaudible</O> in the last few days
<$A> <#\>Oh<,> well it was just today's and  he's he's  saying um <quote>I like rivers  and and  we should have more of them and I'm gonna look
after them and be nice to them</quote> basically <#\>Like<,> 
they're talking about the problems of rivers  and and <,> just coming up with absolutely nothing
concrete at all beyond <quote>I like rivers</quote>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> infantile  <O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>And oh I dunno <#\>He's a strange man
<{1><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1> him become the leader of a major
political party <#\>I wonder if he had a sense of humour but
not a lot of nous so
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\>Yeah <#\>You think it's evidence that god has a sense
of humour
<$B> <#\>Definitely
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>Um and that Alexander Downer doesn't <{1><[1>but</[1>
that's another story
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>    
     <#\>Ya ya well <{2><[2>look um</[2>
<$B> <#\><[2>Stories of um</[2></{2> yeah great moments in
market research today <#\>Westpac um tripling the fees of the
whole um greater Hunter Newcastle area
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>That was beautiful
<$B> <#\>I thought so and then seeing what the reaction was
<O>Alaughs</O> <#\>The simple thing is to close down the
greater Hunter Newcastle region <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>It's good um <#\>They have a new marketing manager
who doesn't like Research International very much
<#\>Hopefully they're new marketing manager will become an old
marketing manager as a result of this and we'll get some one
who loves us more <{1><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1> so this is
good news for us <#\>Bad news for the name of market research
in general but good news for our <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh yeah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2><O>Alaughs</O></[2></{2>  Just you're
just  glad it wasn't yours
<$B> <#\>Definitely
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Ah  this this  has the distinct
stamp of <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>What like the bank saying <quote>well like
if we want to get this number from those numbers what we
should do is charge five dollars</quote>
<$B> <#\>Yeah <O>Alaughs</O> but um
<$A> <#\>Um numbers to numbers bringing the bank to great
disrepute
<$B> <#\><w>'Cos</w> no consultancy would ever have the nerve
to suggest that a bank actually does something like that to
its own customers <{1><[1>though</[1> we don't think but it
could be <{2><[2>but</[2> anyway yeah <#\> So um so
that  was fun but that's some news that I have just
caught while I was waiting for you to call actually um on the
late night <O>inaudible</O> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
     <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>Yeah um
<$A> <#\>It looks like a whole lot of people here are just
arriving <#\><{1><[1>Like we've</[1> got I think <{2><[2>it's
a group of five</[2>
<$B> <#\><[1>Oh yeah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Why am I not invited</[2></{2>
<$A> <#\>Um because you haven't left  heap heaps
and heaps  of junk in our spare room <{1><[1>ah</[1>
<$B> <#\><[1>I</[1></{1> couldn't think of that
<$A> <#\> We we  figured we'd invite these
people and then close the doors <{1><[1><,></[1><,>  and then
and and  sort of not open them until they'd
removed the stuff <w>'cos</w> they might move in <#\>You never
know
<$B> <#\><[1>Oh right</[1></{1>
     <#\>How can they remove it if they um ah have the doors
closed 
<$A> <#\>Right  there's there's  one line of
the derivation I left out there which is that if they are
carrying stuff the doors will magically open<,,> <#\>Hi
<@>forename3</@> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Um
<$A> <#\>Yeah anyway <{1><[1><,></[1><,> it's getting noisy here
so<,,> um anyhow er <#\>What was <{2><[2>I thinking <#\>Opera
yes</[2> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Opera</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>I thought that</[2></{2> assuming it was a
reasonable day I might turn up at about well lunchtime
<$A> <#\>Cool
<$B> <#\>And um create some kind of space
<$A> <#\>Space yeah righto
<$B> <#\>And then other people can turn up about <#\>It starts
at eight so <O>inaudible</O> seven
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> to eat and that kind of thing um
<$A> <#\>Food is a good concept <#\>Are you gonna be um taking
baskets of stuff
<$B> <#\>Sorry um no <#\>I thought I'd might just do the sort
of Turkish bread and dip arrangement and um a certain amount
of alcohol
<$A> <#\>Just <w>'cos</w> um<,> the food provisioning there is
notoriously boring and fatty and it only contains two of the
five food groups like fat and bread
<$B> <#\>Oh yeah <#\> Oh you can't oh you
can't  eat the fast food at the Domain  
<$A> <#\>No <{1><[1><,></[1><,,> not a good call um but you thinking
you going down to Affairs and picking up a couple of buckets
something lush <{2><[2>and</[2> 
<$B> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>  
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2> before actually getting there
<$A> <#\>Mmm that'd be nice <#\> That that's  good all weather type food
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> except for rain um you know
<$A> <#\>Well you know you can always pretend it's soup or
something
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> good idea um <#\>It looks like at
this stage that I'm gonna be doing that alone<,> 
<$A> <#\>Oh look well look <O>inaudible</O> look ah maybe I
can<,> be part of that um <O>B makes whining noises</O>
<#\>Midday thinks <#\>Um one o'clock <#\>I dunno <#\>Um gotta
be able to listen to the Goon Show you know
<$B> <#\>So bring a portable radio
<$A> <#\> Do you yeah I  could do that
<#\>Are you seriously<,> talking um<,> middle of the day <#\>I
mean sitting <{1><[1>there</[1> for eight hours
<$B> <#\><[1>Well</[1></{1> 
     <#\>One o'clock probably
<$A> <#\>You'll get to know all the grass blades by name
<$B> <#\>Haven't you ever done this <@>forenameA</@> <#\>It's
tons of fun because I mean everyone else is too and um you get
to see the people and hang out with the sights and enjoy and
<{1><[1>if</[1> you're bored you can<,> head over to the art
gallery and sort of um do things there 
<$A> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1> 
     <#\>Re ah Kee
<$B> <#\>It can be cool um
<$A> <#\>Alright well ah yeah <{1><[1>um</[1>

um
<$B> <#\>That's what I told her
<$A> <#\><O>Alaughs</O> Well I think it isn't anyway
<$B> <#\>What if they held an I V and nobody came <O>Alaughs</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes um I think what we'll do is yeah also um <@>forename3</@> D's
