had<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> <@>forename2</@> come Tuesday afternoon and I
thought<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> we've had that a couple of times so I
took him to the doctor<,> <{3><[3><,></[3> and he hasn't got any
infections <#\>He's just got um<,> inflammation of the ear
canals<,> <{4><[4><,></[4> rather than the eardrum<,> <{5><[5><,></[5> so
it's not as bad as it could've been<,,> <{6><[6><,></[6> <#\>So  he <,> um he  didn't go to gym this
<O>inaudible</O> <#\>He decided that he needed to sleep in and
he didn't go at all in the afternoon <#\>He didn't go to
swimming or anything<,> <{7><[7><,></[7> <#\>And ah<,> he';s gone off

<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Oh<,>  he's ah<,> he  seems

pretending<,> <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>He said he had a sore stomach and
guess what <#\>I've got a sore stomach too so<,> <{4><[4><,></[4> he

<$B> <#\>Oh<,> does <@>forename5</@> get sick
<$A> <#\>No hardly ever
<$B> <#\>Oh <O>Alaughs</O> maybe it's because we're always

with it yeah<,> <#\>And ah how are you

<O>inaudible</O> is<,> also from the same background<,>
<{5><[5><,></[5> and<,> she liked <@>forename8</@> and they all had a vote on
the name and they wanted <@>forename7</@> and so <#\>The teenage girls had
a vote as well <{6><[6>so</[6> they decided on <@>forename7</@> which we
all love<,> <{7><[7><,></[7> <#\>It has happy memories for us as well
with the <O>inaudible</O> <#\>They've got a<,,> <{8><[8><,></[8>
couple of lovely uncles who're <@>forename7</@> <,> <{9><[9><,></[9> and he's

than it sounds<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Her husband's a teacher and he
sometimes has<,> half days and<,> <{2><[2> ah</[2><,> so I think
sometimes<,> she can take him into the office with her<,>
<{3><[3><,></[3> sometimes she can work at home and then have
<O>inaudible</O> at the office say when he gets home<,>
<{4><[4><,></[4> <#\>She must be exhausted 
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh right</[1></{1>

so ah<,> I'll have to go home and ring the mother up and say
what does he want <O>Alaughs</O>
<$B> <#\><[>Oh dear</[></{>
     <#\>Mmm <#\>It's all <O>inaudible</O> <#\>How old is
<@>forename10</@> 
<$A> <#\> <@>forename10</@> 's He'll  be eight in June
and  this <,>this  boy's just turning
<#\>Yeah this boy's just turning seven<,,> <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>He's
a very bright little boy <#\><{2><[2>He's in <@>forename10</@> </[2> <#\>Yeah
<#\>He's is <@>forename10</@> 's class at school<,> <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>I went to
the<,> counsellor about <@>forename10</@> <w>'cos</w> he wasn't settling
in<,> <#\>The school counsellor
<$B> <#\><[1>Oh boy</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Is he</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Oh right</[3></{3>
     <#\>About <@>forename10</@> 
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\><{><[><@>forename10</@> was</[>
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> be <@>forename11</@> 
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>Oh look</[></{> you won't believe it <#\><@>forename11</@> 
 is just  loves school <#\><{1><[1>He's just<,></[1> right in his element<,> and um<,> he's got no
problems <@>forename11</@> <O>Alaughs</O> <#\>But <@>forename10</@> 's been<,> the one
with sort of<,,> all the<,> funny little complaints and
traumas and so on<,> so I went to see this counsellor about
him and<,> he was just brilliant<,> this guy <#\>He's just
fantastic<,> and um<,,> actually  he <,>he 
was telling me that that school <#\>We just happened to land
into a very<,> competitive school<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> and  it's
also when they  do the basic skills test it gets
into the top five in the state<,,> <{3><[3><,></[3> so um apparently
people so coming <#\>It's like going to a private school
without paying the fees <#\>People are coming from everywhere
trying to get their kids in
<$B> <#\><[1>Oh great</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Oh</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Wow</[3></{3>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>That's a sign from <@>forename10</@> that he doesn't
even  know <,>know  what's happening
<#\>It's just<,,> <{><[><,></[> the feeling of not knowing why
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <#\> I'm I'm  sure <#\>Look
there's a lot of competition and  he's not <,>he's  doing very well for all the gaps he's had
and the school he's missed<,> and he's still sort of like in
the top spelling group in his class but it's a strain you
know<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> and um<,> well he doesn't get any awards
because he's sort of average compared to<,> the other kids I
guess <#\>I Don't know but I never see<,> <quote>good
work</quote> on his page or anything<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>Yeah
<#\>So
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Oh really</[2></{2>
     <#\>Oh that's not very good <#\>Teachers need to
encourage every kid
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>I think so <#\>Well I'm going into see them
because he always comes home with these crummy little bits of
paper<,> <#\>You know  he's he's  traced
around a coin or something<,>and not very well <,>
with<,> good work stamped on it<,> and just ripped off  bits of bits of  a computer paper and <@>forename10</@> 
doesn't<,> you know get anything and he's doing proper work
and I just feel a bit<,,> as though you know <@>forename10</@> sees the
contrast<,> <,> <#\>You know I guess <@>forename11</@> 's teacher is
very lavish with the praise and<,> <@>forename11</@> is thriving<,,> and um
<@>forename10</@> 's teacher is sort of gets annoyed <w>'cos</w> he loses
his books all the time and<,> you know whinges about who he's
sitting next to<,> and so I went to see the
counsellor to just say <quote>well he's just had so much
stress the last year he's not gonna cope very well and you
know could the teacher just<,> be patient with him and be
positive and<,></quote> so I'm going to see her next week</I>
