<I><$A> <#\>Actually I was feeling a bit hungry <{1><[1><,></[1> when I
came up here so I thought<,> and I completely forgot that she
offered tea and coffee <{2><[2>and biscuits</[2> 
<$B> <#\><[1>I know</[1></{1>
    <#\><[2>So did I</[2></{2> I remember the tea bit <#\>I forgot the
biscuits <{><[><,></[> <#\>The most important bit <O>ABlaugh</O> 
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>      <#\>So that's why you wanted to do this hey <@>forenameB</@>
<$B> <#\>Mmm mmm<,,> <#\>Of course that's my main reason behind
it
Mmm<,,> Yeah Did you did you know about that<,> at Macquarie 
<$A> <#\>No <#\>You didn't tell me about that
<$B> <#\>No um <#\>They also offer<,> speech therapy <#\>Did I
tell you
how they offer speech therapy at Newcastle
<$A> <#\>You did <#\>You were telling <{1><[1>me</[1> <O>inaudible</O>
<{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah<,> but</[2></{2> that was cancelled and and<,> I was
talking to mum on the holidays and she<,> has um<,> she rang
up the<,,> um university in Newcastle and<{><[><,></[> they hope to
offer it again this year 
<$A> <#\><[>Mmhmm</[></{>      <#\>Really
<$B> <#\>Yeah but you can't apply through UAC<,> the um <{><[><,>
yeah
<,> yeah</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>That's the <O>inaudible</O></[></{> Mmm
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>And um so<,> 
<$A> <#\>How do you apply
<$B> <#\>You have to write a letter to them<,> I think<,> to the
department or something<,,>
<$A> <#\>Is Newcastle far away from here<,,>
<$B> <#\>Um<,>
<$A> <#\>Or is it like<,> closer to Sydney<,,>
<$B> <#\>It's on the coast I think 
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,,>
<$B> <#\>I think it's closer than Sydney <#\>I don't know<,> I've
got
no idea
<$A> <#\>Neither do I <#\>I've never been there
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,,>
<$A> <#\>It'd be good <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Be so <O>inaudible</O> <{2><[2>but</[2> I don't
want to leave Brisbane though<,> <#\>Would you wanna leave
Brisbane<,> I s'pose you already left your <{3><[3>home so it's</[3> like nothing really<,> <#\>I kind of feel like<,> oh I really
<#\>Like<,> even when I went away for two weeks I missed my
family
so much <{4><[4><,></[4> <#\>Isn't that strange <#\>And yet <{5><[5>I'd</[5> spent
a
year away <{6><[6><,></[6> last year <#\>I just sort of couldn't wait to
get home and just see my mum and dad and 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Mmm mmm<,> mmm</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4>      <#\><[5>Mmm</[5></{5>      <#\><[6>Mmm</[6></{6>      <#\>Did you miss your family much in Norway
<$A> <#\>No not at all <O>Blaughs</O>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> when I was in Sweden
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>What <#\>Did you just go by yourself
<$B> <#\>No<,> <#\>Oh<,,> the family went over there <{1><[1><,></[1> and
um<,,> mum stayed for six months and dad stayed for<,,> I
think<,> eight months <{2><[2><,></[2> and my brother and I stayed on
with our grandparents for the full year <{3><[3><,,></[3> and when
the<,> like<,> so mum was only there<,,> for half the time
with us <{4><[4><,></[4> and after that<,,> yeah we were there by
ourselves my brother and I but<,,> I didn't miss my parents <#\>I
was just <#\>It sounds <{5><[5>terrible</[5> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Oh yeah</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Uhuh</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Uhuh</[4></{4>      <[5><O>inaudible</O></[5></{5> <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>I don't<,> <#\>We've never been homesick people <{1><[1><,></[1> like
my brother and I <{2><[2><,></[2> because when we went away to boarding
school<,,> like nineteen ninety one when I went<,> in grade
eleven <{3><[3><,></[3> um<,,> ah<,> a lot of<,> there was<,> <#\>Not that
many people<,> go to boarding school in grade eleven <{4><[4><,></[4> <#\>They either go in grade eight or<,> a couple of them
<#\>There was only there was only a few new<,,> um boarders in grade
eleven <{5><[5><,></[5> and<,> I wasn't homesick <#\>I I was<,> because I don't know I'd just really look forward to you know<,>
<$A> <#\><[1>No</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Uhuh</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Mmhmm</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4>     <#\><[5>Mmhmm</[5></{5>      ta new challenge sort <{><[>of thing</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <#\>That's right <#\>I think<,> you know make
new <{1><[1>friends <#\>Meet</[1> meet lots of the new people <{2><[2>and</[2><,,> things
like that <{3><[3><,></[3> and um<,,> so<,> I didn't um<,> <#\>I dunno
<#\>I just<,,> wasn't really homesick <{4><[4>and</[4> I was just really
looking forward to you <{5><[5>know</[5><,> change of life<,> step<,>
step in <O>Alaughs</O> you know just a step forward or a step
in an <{6><[6><,></[6> you know<,> and um<,,> so then<,,> <#\>And<,> there
was<,> a couple of girls there in grade eleven <{7><[7><,></[7> and they
were just so homesick  
<$A> <#\><[1>Friends <#\>Yeah</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>     <#\><[4>No</[4></{4>     <#\><[5>Yeah</[5></{5>     <#\><[6>Mmm</[6></{6>     <#\><[7>Mmm</[7></{7>      <#\>Is that right
<$B> <#\>Oh I went down <#\>I was talking to<,> <@>Forename1</@><,> and
um<,> she was talking<,> to her parents on the phone <{1><[1><,></[1> and I was waiting for the phone just sitting there <{2><[2><,></[2> and
<@>Forename1</@> got off the phone and she was in tears and she was
<{3><[3>crying</[3><,> and I didn't know what was wrong <{4><[4><,></[4> so I
said<,> you know <quote>what what's happening</quote> and she
goes <quote>I was just talking  to my parents on the
phone</quote><,,> and I thought <quote>what's happened</quote>
and she goes<,> <quote><O>inaudible</O> I'm just
homesick</quote> <{5><[5>and</[5> I was talking to <@>Forename1</@> after that
and I thought <{6><[6><,></[6> <quote>grade eleven you know <#\>You're sort
of at that age you know</quote> <#\>You should be<,,> <#\>I know
<#\>Ididn't think many people got homesick at grade eleven<,> <#\>I
<{7><[7>mean</[7> all the grade eights<,> new grade eights were homesick
<{8><[8><,></[8> but<,,> then<,> I thought<,,> I was a bit younger than
grade eight when I was overseas and <{9><[9><,></[9> I wasn't really
homesick
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmhmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Crying</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Yeah</[4></{4>      <#\><[5>Oh</[5></{5>      <#\><[6>Mmm</[6></{6>      <#\><[7><O>inaudible</O></[7></{7>      <#\><[8>Yeah</[8></{8>      <#\><[9>Yeah</[9></{9>      <#\>I think it depends on what sort of person you are <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Like I know there were a lot of my friends who're exchange
students last year and they were just<,> they'd never wanted
to talk to their parents because they'd just get got so upset
<{2><[2><,></[2> all the time <#\>Yeah <#\>Like I rang mum and dad once a
week
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Really</[2></{2>      <#\>Really excited
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\><{1><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1> this and this and this
and<,> like I mean<,> occasionally I sort of thought oh you know<,>
wouldn't be nice to go home now <{2><[2><,></[2> it's Christmas time and
<{3><[3>I</[3> feel like seeing mum and dad or it's their birthday or
<{4><[4>something</[4><,> but like overall<,> I <{5><[5>mean</[5> I just<,,> had
an absolute ball <#\><{6><[6>You</[6> know what I mean <#\>Like I just
<#\>I don't know why in these last two weeks I just<,,> <#\>It's so
weird <#\>I mean I had a really good time and we were just like
partied all the time and stuff but<,,> it was just towards the
end of the week I thought<,> <quote>I'm ready to go home now
<{7><[7>I</[7> wanna see my mum and dad and</quote> <{8><[8><,></[8> <#\>I dunno why
<$B> <#\><[1>I've done this <#\>I've done that</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Yeah</[4></{4>      <#\><[5>Uhuh</[5></{5>      <#\><[6>Yeah</[6></{6>      <#\><[7>Yeah</[7></{7>      <#\><[8>Yeah</[8></{8>      <#\>I think it does depend on the people you are <{1><[1>'cos</[1><,>
my brother and I<,,> neither of us are very homesick <{2><[2><,></[2> I
remember I used to up to my like this is when<,> when we were
in primary school really little <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>I used to go up to my
cousin's place all the time <{4><[4><,></[4> in Yeppoon <{5><[5>which</[5> is<,,>
an hour and a half away <{6><[6><,></[6> from where we live <{7><[7><,></[7> and<,> she used to come down to our place and stay at the farm
for a while <{8><[8><,></[8> but<,,> um<,,> she she stay you know she'd
plan on staying for a week <{9><[9><,></[9> but she'd ring home<,> the
second night and she'd get so homesick <{10><[10><,></[10> <#\>She'd cry to
her mum <#\>She'd miss her mum <{11><[11><,></[11> <#\>And she'd never stayed
at our place very long <#\>She had to go home <#\><{12><[12>She was</[12> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1> 
    <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Mmhmm</[4></{4>      <#\><[5>Yeah</[5></{5>      <#\><[6>Uhuh</[6></{6>      <#\><[7>Uhuh</[7></{7>      <#\><[8>Mmm</[8></{8>      <#\><[9>Mmm</[9></{9>      <#\><[10>you're joking</[10></{10>      <#\><[11>Oh</[11></{11>      <#\><[12>Isn't that</[12></{12> funny

<$B> <#\><{><[>So I think it</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>So I think it</[></{> yeah<,> depends<,> what you're like
<{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>I know I tend to really look forward to things like
<{2><[2>that</[2><,> <#\>Like you know<,> I remember<,,> 'cos like I caught
the plane over to New Zealand by myself and like
<O>inaudible</O> <#\>Oh<,> so exciting <#\>Like I'm my own person
and I can do what I want and<,> it was so exciting like you
just sort of thought<,,> <#\>It kind of hit me that<,> oh
<quote>I'm a big girl now</quote> <{3><[3><,></[3> sort of thing <#\>Like
<quote>I don't need <{4><[4>mum and dad</[4> to hold my hand <{5><[5><,></[5> and<,> do everything <{6><[6>for me</[6></quote> <#\>Yeah <#\>Exactly <#\>I
know
it sounds silly but <{7><[7>it's true</[7> <#\>I can do things by myself

to me now <#\>It's like no one else <#\>I can't blame anyone else
if
something goes wrong <{10><[10><O>inaudible</O></[10> <#\>It's like my fault

just <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> <#\>I really wanna live in France<,>
<{3><[3>like</[3> <#\>Mmm <#\>I'd like to live there just for like a couple of

just move on somewhere else
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm <#\>I know</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>I really want to that</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>France</[3></{3>      <#\>Mmm <#\>I'd like to do that through Europe <{><[><,></[> but
actually<,,> France is probably one country that's never ever

<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>Um<,,> I dunno<,> <#\>I think mainly because<,,>of
the<,>
impression<,> French people <{><[><,></[> give <#\>They're very
ignorant 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>They're very yeah <#\>They're very rude 
<$A> <#\>Yeah to people who don't speak their own language <{><[><,></[> which<,,> <#\>I dunno <#\>Like when I see a tourist I just love
talking to tourists 
<$B> <#\><[>Yep</[></{>     <#\>Oh me too
<$A> <#\>And I love finding out about them <{1><[1><,></[1> and their
language and how long they've been here <{2><[2>and</[2> where else
they've travelled in the <{3><[3>world<,></[3> <#\>That's why I love
working on Keppel<,> 'cos you just meet so many people
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Yeah yeah</[3></{3>      <#\>Oh you'd get heaps of people <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>I know</[></{> <#\>There's a lot of Germans last time
<$B> <#\>Is that right <#\><{><[><,></[> <#\>Oh so you got to use your
German<,,>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>Oh<,> not really <#\>No
<$B> <#\>But you got a six for German didn't you <{><[><,></[> <#\>That's
excellent
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>      <#\>But<,> um<,,> I understand German really well <{1><[1><,></[1> especially because Swedish helps me out with that <{2><[2>but</[2><,> um<,,> <#\>It's different like <#\>It's it's really hard talking <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>It's really hard speaking it<,> because<,,> um<,> it's ike different word order<,> to English <{4><[4>and</[4><,,> and it's<,,> and<,> it's closer to Swedish the word order <{5><[5><,></[5> so if I try to think in Swedish<,> then because there's a lot of words the same <{6><[6><,></[6> I start speaking German<,> and I just switch into Swedish 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>      <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4>      <#\><[5>Mmm</[5></{5>      <#\><[6>Mmm</[6></{6>      <#\>Is that right
<$A> <#\>Or either I put Swedish words in the German sentence
<O>Blaughs</O> and I really have to concentrate and I'm
just<,> <#\>There's like pauses<,> and concentration and <{><[><,></[> it's not like fluent
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>      <#\>But that would come <{1><[1><#\>Like<,> if you went to Germany<,></[1> and you know like stayed there <{2><[2>for a month</[2> or
so <#\>You'd have to speak it every day <{3><[3><,></[3> it would you'd
soon flow
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah <#\>I s'pose it would<,> <#\>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah<,> yep</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>      <#\>Yep <#\>Mmm<,>
<$B> <#\>You should do that
<$A> <#\>Yeah but that's<,,> <O>inaudible</O> didn't really speak
to that many Germans <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>I understood them<,> <{2><[2>like</[2> I
can understand them <#\>No worries <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>Mostly
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Uhuh</[3></{3>      <#\>It's more the million Japanese <{1><[1><,></[1> I<,> I find it
really interesting but <{2><[2><,></[2> they just go so fast 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>      <#\>Oh but you've also learnt French <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>That'd be
good
<{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>Well you really should <#\>We should travel Europe
together
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>      <#\>I know
<$A> <#\>You you can speak French <#\>Oh well you've studied
French
<{1><[1><,></[1> and I'm studying German and you're studying <{2><[2><,></[2> Japanese<,> <#\>A little out of context in Europe but
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Japanese</[2></{2>      <#\>Just imagine<,> you know<,> we could meet some tourists
on the way 
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> yeah<,,> <#\><{><[>I'd really like to travel Europe</[> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\><[>And we've got Swedish and Norwegian</[></{>      <#\>We're set <#\><{><[>Let's go</[>

<$B> <#\>Spanish 
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>That's similar to French <$A> <#\>Is it
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,> <#\>It's Italian<,> French and Spanish
<#\>They're all
really similar <#\><{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>You'd have learnt that in
linguistics
<{2><[2>I'd say</[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Yeah yeah</[2></{2> About Romance <{><[><,></[> languages
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <O>Inaudible whispering</O> <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\>No linguistics is amazing
<$B> <#\>And we can go to Ger ah Switzerland<,> because you speak
German<,> I speak French
<$A> <#\>Yes<,> yes <#\>That's true <#\>Yeah<,>
<$B> <#\>We're on a roll <#\>The only places we couldn't speak

like Czechoslovakia <{><[><,> ah</[> Yeah
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>Hungary</[></{>      <#\>Finland

<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>What's it like<,>
<$A> <#\>It's really beautiful actually
<$B> <#\>Is it similar to Southern Norway
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>It's very similar to Sweden or<,> but they have
a
lot of lakes in Finland
<$B> <#\>Oh do they <#\><{1><[1>And forests and stuff</[1> <#\>Do they<,>
understand Swedish most of them <{2><[2>don't they</[2> <#\>But not<,>
they're pretty reluctant to<,> to speak it aren't <{3><[3>they</[3> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah<,> yeah</[1></{1>      <#\><[2>Most do</[2></{2>      <#\><[3>Oh</[3></{3><,> I don't know<,,> <#\>We didn't really have that
