<$B> <#\><[>Nuh</[></{>
     <#\>No <#\>I could not come up with <#\>Green wouldn't
come up on the computer even<,,> so I sort of thought well I'm
<{><[>gonna go without it</[>
<$A> <#\><[>We should ask</[></{> about that <#\>You should
ask um<,> <{><[><,></[> Edith <#\>She should be able to help us<,>

     <#\>Yeah I got Aaronson

<$B> <#\>Boone<,,>
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>I looked at Wilson<,>
<$A> <#\>Do I have Wilson <#\>No <#\>Well he's probably into
children
<$B> <#\>Andrews<,> I had<,,>
<$A> <#\>Did youwas Wilson okay<,>
because didn't you have trouble finding things on<,,> child
voice 
<$B> <#\>Yeah oh no <#\>I didn't get Wilson by the looks of
things but I did get Andrews<,>
<$A> <#\>Did you <#\>What was it like<,,>
<$B> <#\>Not a lot in it but if there was<,> anything in it
that I used I photocopied it<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> so I'll have a look
through my photocopies and see what I've got<,,> and um<,,>
<{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>Yeah well it's a bit short on the child
pragmatics <#\>That's why I went and <{3><[3>got those
books</[3> <#\>And Obler<,,>
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>I've got this</[3></{3>
     <#\>No I haven't got Obler <#\>What's that 
<$B> <#\>And Wilder
<$A> <#\>I got Wilder <#\>I did <{><[>to</[> some of that
today
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>Obler I had
<$A> <#\>Well I think that's enough then because <{><[><,></[>
pragmatics elderly
<$B> <#\><[>I think so</[></{>  
     <#\>Well when you have to look at what we have to do with
it that was the other thing
<$A> <#\>What a pragtmatics elderly is what <#\>What we doing
with that
<$B> <#\>Um<,> just a group report<,,>
<$A> <#\>Oh well we don't need much there
<$B> <#\>So we're not <,> gonna need stacks and stacks of
references
<$A> <#\> no
     <#\>The pragmatics child is the oral so we need a bit
there
<$B> <#\>Well<,> yeah <#\>That's why I thought<,> pragmatics
child we'll need to put a bit in your oral because<,,> if the
others speak first and we're not allowed to repeat what they
say<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> so you're gonna end up with nothing<,,>
<{2><[2>left</[2> to say<,,> <#\><{3><[3>This</[3>
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>But</[3></{3> hopefully it'll goit
does<,> develop so we will be going first
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Which'll be good<,>
<$B> <#\>These here<,,> <{1><[1><,></[1><,> <#\>I couldn't find that
<#\>I had Gallagher's book and I couldn't find it anywhere<,>
<{2><[2>But</[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>No</[2></{2> <#\>No I had Gallagher's
<{3><[3>book</[3>
<$B> <#\><[3>What do</[3></{3> they mean<,,>
<$A> <#\>That just shows the development of
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[>I mean reresponse</[></{>
to contingent queries<,,> <#\>Contingent queries is um<,,>
who why when and where systems isn't it
<$A> <#\>I don't know
<$B> <#\>Well that's what I was looking at and this<,,>
mathetic textual <{><[><,></[> and I couldn't find a book
with his name <#\>I looked for it today
<$A> <#\><[>Oh right</[></{>
     <#\>Halliday
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,,> <#\><{><[>But I've</[> got quite a

     <#\>Right so and the<,> voicethe case report
is on voice adult<,> <{><[><,></[> <#\>We've got a fair

<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Um<,,>
<$A> <#\>Greene and the Carne<,,> <#\>His aging there<,>
<{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>There's two photocopied <{2><[2>articles</[2>
and I've had the<,> Aaronson and Boone<,> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
<$A>      <#\>That's like<,,>Wilson was
in central <#\>Did<,,> <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>So <{2><[2>that's why you
<O>inaudible</O></[2>
<$B> <#\><[1>Now</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>That was what I can't </[2></{2> <#\>That's mymy notes for my oral<,,> <#\>Um<,> I only
got them done because I had to do mum because she was going
away<,> and I thought I'm gonna be stuck if she goes away<,,>
<{1><[1><,></[1> and I've haven't done it<,> <w>'cos</w> she's not
getting back till the thirtieth<,,> <{2><[2><,></[2> and that's<,>
the notes for motherese<,> <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>Hedge had a good bit
on hermotherese 
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yes</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmhmm</[3></{3>
     <#\>Oh did they
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Oh I should've got that
<$B> <#\>Um<,> I can't remember whether I photocopied it or
not but<,> if she's gotyou know how she
has it nice and clear<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> in it was <#\>That's
all<,> that first half <{2><[2>I think is
Hedge</[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>I might be able</[2></{2> to copy him<,>
<$B> <#\>Well even between three and four because we're only
at the Able-Smith<,> <{><[><,></[> this afternoon
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Do some more photocopying <O>Alaughs</O>
<$B> <#\>wow yeah<,> <#\>But that was<,,> and this was
my um<,,>well that was the start<,> on<,> the
pragmatics child which I was doing a lot more of<,,> because
that's the one that's gonna be marked so I thought I'd better
have a bit more<,,> but I've gotta fill these in<,,>
<$A> <#\>And did you fill in thethe<,>
pen<,> <{><[>and <O>inaudible</O></[> business report
<$B> <#\><[>Yep<,> yep</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>I found <{><[>one</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Quite</[></{> difficult<,> <{><[><,></[> <#\>Don't
you think
<$B> <#\><[>The worst</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>It wasn't easyas easy
as it looked<,> <#\>But I found thing that was surprising and
<w>'cos</w> it was mum I was doing it with I said to her
<quote>alright <#\>Why</quote><,> <#\>She doesn't make hand
gestures<,,>
<$A> <#\>Doesn't she
<$B> <#\>Very very rarely and I said why<,> <#\>And she said
<quote>because we were brought up that that was theatrical and
showy <{><[>and nice people didn't</[></quote>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah perhaps</[></{>perhaps mum doesn't either
<$B> <#\>And I thought <quote>mmm that's a nice point I could
put in<,> <{1><[1><,></[1></quote> <#\>You know that<,> basically<,>
she doesn't make hand gestures because her upbringing<,>
<{2><[2><,></[2> was that only<,,> <#\>She said <quote>only Italians
and people like that do<,> <{3><[3><,></[3> hand ges gestures do this
<#\><{4><[4>We</[4> were taught to talk and keep our hands
<{5><[5>still</[5></quote>
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Yes</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Does she</[5></{5>does she
do it on the phone
<$B> <#\>Nuh
<$A> <#\>My mother does on the phone 
<$B> <#\>She doesn'tshe might doodle<,,>
you know with a pen but she doesn't sort of throw her hands<,>
or move<,> <#\>She virtually sits still when she's talking to
you<,>
<$A> <#\>Poor woman <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$B> <#\>I couldn't<,>I couldn't talk if
I couldn't move 
<$A> <#\>Well <{1><[1><O>inaudible</O> you hands</[1> <#\>Yes
I'd be lost if I <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2>
<$B> <#\><[1>I'd be gone</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>and I</[2></{2>it was so
noticeable that I actually asked her <#\>I said <quote>Mum how
come</quote><,> <#\>And she said <quote>oh no</quote> she
said<,> <quote>we were brought up that<,> nice peyou know<,,> well brought up ladies in the
Methodist ladies college<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> they don'tthey don't<,> wave their hands around<,> <#\><{2><[2>They let thethey let the</[2> words
carry themselves</quote><,> <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>So I thought well
that's an interesting<,> um<,,> you know it's
an interest wellinteresting thing
I could say<,> that maybe if you're interviewing and assessing
an old person and they don't wave their hands around<,,>
<{4><[4><,></[4> it maybe<,> that that's just the way that they were
<{5><[5><,>brought up</[5>
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Well I might go to</[5></{5> central and try and
find that Wilson<,> <{><[><,></[> <#\>Oh no that's children
<#\>We're looking for<,,>for adult
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>I can get it out on child's voice <#\>What're we
suppose to do on child voice <#\>Is it a
<$A> <#\>It's only a group handout<,,>group
report group report
<$B> <#\>Oh that's not so bad then<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> but we must
catch up with these <O>inaudible</O> and work out <{2><[2>when
we're gonna do that</[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>But the screen</[2></{2>the
screen is one<,,> <#\>you should get or otherwise
just find another book on voiceadult
voice<,> <#\>One that she <{><[>hasn't
mentioned</[> which would be better
<$B> <#\><[>Well I've got</[></{>
     <#\>Um<,> who else did I have on voice<,,> <#\>I had a
few that were outside of<,> <{><[>the <O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>so did I</[></{> but I don'tI think mine were promatpragmatic
ones 
<$B> <#\>I had one voice one that wasn't on there<,,> <#\>But
I<,> just thought well<,,> the group handouts we'll have to
get with the <O>inaudible</O> and work out when they wanna<,,>
you know put our heads together for it
<$A> <#\>Yes<,> yes
<$B> <#\>And um<,,> I thought well I'll put more into the
pragmatics<,,> <w>'cos</w> that's the oral one that's gonna be
marked<,> <{1><[1> and</[1> then um<,> I was just trying to get up
enough references and that<,,> <w>'cos</w> this <#\>Adult
voice<,,> <#\>If they've got a normal voice there's not a lot
you can do to make up a decent <{2><[2>report</[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>well you see</[2></{2> your mother's<,> not really
like an aging voice yet is she <#\>So she's on the
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[>That's what</[></{> I said 
<$A> <#\>Oh did you <{><[><,> <#\>Probably on the younger
side of old</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Yep<,> <#\>I said that sheshe's um</[></{> <#\>Well according to one book
I read<,,> he doesn't take elderly<,> until they're sixty
nine<,,> <{1><[1><,></[1> so I sort of could make the point that<,>
as far as he was concerned<,,> she's not elderly <{2><[2><,></[2>
so therefore<,,>and the changes in her
voice may well not be<,> age <#\>It maybe
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh right yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\>Yeah and I read um<,> somewhere<,,> where um one of
the problems with aging voice is they're not using their voice
so much because they're alone and that <#\>Well she's not
<{><[>alone <#\>She's using</[> her voice all the time
<$B> <#\><[>Well she's not alone <#\>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>And she says that it's um<,,> lowerthe
pitch is lower and it is low pitched her voice
<$A> <#\>But has it always been<,,>
<$B> <#\>Well she said yes<,,> since she had a big serious
<O>inaudible</O> <#\>She said I was only small <#\>She had
chronic laryngitis<,> for like<,,> six months <{1><[1><,></[1> but
it was one of those persistent things <#\><{2><[2>They</[2>
couldn't get rid of and she said it left her with a lower
pitch voice <{3><[3><,></[3> so I thought <quote> good I'll can
write in there that that's what she attributes it<,>it to</quote> <#\>I don't know
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Oh</[3></{3>
     <#\>Does she drink lots of tea and coffee
<$B> <#\>Um<,> no <#\>Half a dozen cups a day
<$A> <#\>Did she ever smoke
<$B> <#\>No<,> never smoked
<$A> <#\>Did your dad ever smoke that she was<,,> like passive
smoking
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> but not in the last twenty years<,,>
<$A> <#\>Damage could've been done<,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah well see the books sort of say thatthat<,> <{><[>women's <O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>Does she cough a lot </[></{>clear her throat a lot
<$B> <#\>No<,> no <#\>But they sort of say that the voicefemale voice lowers<,,> <{1><[1><,></[1> to
seventy then it tends to rise again <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>Well
she could be<,,>it could be age is<,,>
dropping it down<,> lower than it has been <{3><[3><,></[3> or it
could be that the um<,,> you know
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Oh</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>    
     <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>But oh well what the heck
<$A> <#\>Well I haven't got as far into it so I'll
just<,,>but I've just gotta concentrate on
these two<,> <{><[><,></[> and just get those others done <#\>So I
think I've got enough for the others
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>I I only wanted particularly a little bit
more on um<,,> the pragmatics and the child
<$A> <#\>Oh there's so much you canyou
can 
<$B> <#\>Only because everything I've got so far talks about
preschool children and older children<,,> <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>We're
back again to ours are <{2><[2>too young</[2><,,> <#\>I had a

     <#\><[2>Yes<,> yes</[2></{2>
     <#\>Did you
<$B> <#\>I ended up having it for four days<,>
because mum and dad went away without giving<,>
<@>Forename1</@> enough notice to arrange time off<,> so she said to
