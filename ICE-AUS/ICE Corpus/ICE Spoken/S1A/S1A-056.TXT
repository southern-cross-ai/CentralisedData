<I><$A> <#\>Mrs <@>surname1</@> gave me those exactly the same
comments
<$B> <#\>Did she <#\>What'd she say
<$A> <#\>And she gave me the same last time too
<$C> <#\>That's one and two <#\>Has she got one as well
<$A> <#\>What
<$C> <#\>Did <@>forename2</@> get hers as well<,,>
<$A> <#\>No<,> <#\>She di she doesn't get her two unit mark
<#\>It
doesn't count on this <w>'cos</w> she chose four unit right <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>She didn't she didn't come first in two unit right
<O>inaudible</O> some one else did but<,> she came first in
four unit and I think<,> second in two unit in three unit
sorry <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\><w>'Cos</w> I came third in three unit <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\><quote>A fine
performance from a gifted student <#\>These are outstanding
results</quote> <#\>It's just so tacky <#\>Like<,> it's so uncool
to
<O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Oh right</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>That's good</[3></{3> 
<$B> <#\>Is it personal
<$A> <#\>I dunno <#\>This is er the printout you know <#\>That's
what
you have for good student sort of thing<,,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,,>
<$A> <#\>Oh<,,> Mrs <@>surname3</@> said <quote>a fine
performance from
a<,> good student</quote> as well
<$B> <#\>You must be<,> a gifted student who puts in a lot of
fine
performances<,,>
<$A> <#\>Oh I must be<,> <#\>Oh right <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,,> it was interesting um<,> what <@>forename2</@> 
was saying about scaling up four unit marks wasn't it
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>I know they have<,> <#\>They've done it for
<$B> <#\>How much have they done it
<$A> <#\>Lots<,> I know they've done lots<,,> <#\>But I mean I
can't
do anything about it<,> <#\>I mean it sounds like it's sour
grapes if mum goes in and says <quote>oh well my daughter
should've
done this and this and this because<,> you know just because
she doesn't four unit get a good four unit maths mark</quote>
<$B> <#\>I think they scaled the three unit marks up
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>My three unit mark was scaled up one<,,>
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,> <#\>It's just that's it's it's not fair because
that's not what's going to happen<,> and so they give people
false expectations about what their<,> you know<,> final
result is going to be<,>
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,> <#\>Perhaps I'll just
<$C> <#\>They're not likely to do that this year though are they
<$B> <#\>They've done it
<$A> <#\>They've done it<,,>
<$C> <#\>What've they done
<$A> <#\>In the half yearlies<,> <#\>They've scaled up the four
unit
maths mark<,>
<$C> <#\>How much do they scale up to
<$B> <#\>Quite a lot I feel<,,>
<$C> <#\>Oh pity <#\>You told mum<,,>
<$A> <#\>No <#\>I<,> I don't want mum to make a huge big scene
<w>'cos</w>
Ms <@>surname1</@> will know that it's my parents and then
it'll sound like it's sort of sour grapes on my part<,,>
<$C> <#\>Shouldn't you tell her though
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>I know but<,,>
<$C> <#\>There's no reason to scale them up
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>I know that<,> but I I just don't want mum
making a
huge scene about it and <,,>
<$C> <#\>Mum won't make a huge scene about it
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>Well you know<,> <#\>As as <{><[>long as it doesn't get back to Miss <@>surname1</@> </[> I don't want it to get back to
Miss <@>surname1</@> <#\>That's all<,> <#\><w>'Cos</w> she's still my
teacher nine periods a week
<$C> <#\><[>She'll make a few pertinent comments which are relevant</[></{> <#\>Well<,> who takes four unit <#\>Miss <@>surname1</@> 
<$A> <#\><@>surname1</@> <,,>
<$B> <#\>The thing is like it's expected <#\>I think in the maths
department it's expected that they would scale it up<,>
because they've done it for so long you know <#\>I think<,> I
don't think it's Miss <@>surname1</@> who<,> wants to scale it
up <#\>It's just that they have to<,> I mean<,> that they
do<,,>
<$C> <#\>So they scale the actual mark up
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>Well my three unit <#\>They scaled the three unit ones
like<,,> one or two marks <#\>Mine was scaled up one<,,> <#\>But
that was that was only to make the median to<,,> twenty three
or twenty five or something <{><[><,></[> <#\>I think four unit was
scaled up like<,,> quite a lot<,,>
<$C> <#\><[>Yes</[></{>    <#\>If they're<,> if they're<,> assessing properly<,,> then
they shouldn't scale it at all <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>I I I really think they shouldn't</[></{> I really think that
they <{><[>shouldn't</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>There</[></{> should be no scaling at all<,,> <#\>Well
what're
your plans this afternoon<,>
<$B> <#\>I've gotta write my essay
<$A> <#\>I wanna watch this<,> <O>inaudible</O> if that's alright
<$C> <#\>Yes<,>
<$A> <#\>Do you wanna watch it with me
<$C> <#\>Yes <#\>I'll watch it with you
<$B> <#\>Appar apparently it's a really slow movie
<$C> <#\>Have you seen it
<$B> <#\>No <#\><{><[>I haven't</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>No <#\>But they</[></{> they move around quite a lot <#\>They
go to
a bar and stuff and <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Oh are they</[></{> 
<$C> <#\>Oh<,> there's this one scene where they change the<,>
they change the location <{><[><,> er</[> <#\>That actually<,> is
ah<,,>
I think a mistake 
<$A> <#\><[>And it's slow at that time</[></{>     <#\>The whole idea's s'pose to be that it's<,,> sort of
enclosed<,,>
<$B> <#\>I should read it<,> <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>I probably will anyway actually<,,> for fun
<$C> <#\>You must remember the play too <#\>If you've never seen
it
before<,,>
<$A> <#\>Oh oh well um<,,> a couple of my friends were saying
that
that their relatives and stuff<,> have been watching the play
since they recorded it<,> and they said they didn't understand
it because<,> unless you've<,> sort of<,> studied the book and
you know all about the subject you won't really understand
what's happening<,,> and so<,> I mean
<$B> <#\>But <{><[>you said</[> 
<$C> <#\><[>This is what I</[></{> <,> sorry
<$B> <#\>But you said that this Australian woman<,> the the
Palestinian <O>inaudible</O> person<,> has er a um a master's
degree in English literature
<$C> <#\>Yeah <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Was married to a one time rock musician</[></{>
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>Well he apparently maintained the household<,,>
<#\>Somebody had to
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,,>
<$C> <#\>I think a lot of plays <@>forename4</@> <{1><[1><,></[1> are not
really understood by the people who who watch them <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>A
an enormous number of<,> amount of symbolic stuff like<quote>The
Crucible</quote>and ah <{3><[3><,></[3> <O>inaudible</O><,> <#\>Now I think a
good play<,> is capable of being looked at at different
levels
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Yeah <#\>That's</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>yeah</[3></{3> 
<$B> <#\>I think I think you get a lot more out of it if you read
it as a book rather than at first<,> before you see it as a
play
<$C> <#\>A good play<,> you can read at all sorts of levels
<{><[><,></[> <#\>You can and you can understand it at all sorts of
levels so that<,,> a person who's<,> not had the advantage of
university lectures in English can go to a play<,,> and
understand it but a person who has had<,,> will see it at a
totally different ah
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>     <#\>Mmm <#\>But even even like the same person<,> what
they've
done<,> <#\>Like I wouldn't've understood Anthony and Cleopatra
at all<,,> with like special <O>inaudible</O> f I hadn't read
the hadn't studied the book
<$C> <#\>Yeah<,,> <#\>Did you find it helped having the video<,,>
you
saw
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>Yeah <#\>I'm gonna watch that again in the
holidays
<$B> <#\>I think a film will spell things out a bit more than a
play <{><[><,></[> because films don't have the assumption that
people have read it<,,>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>     <#\>Yeah <#\>That's true too<,> <#\>Actually they change
things and
chop things out though <#\>It's a<,,> pity in a way
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>I hate it when they do that to classics
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O><,>
<$C> <#\>It makes a difference <#\>I think film versions make a
hit
from<,> the words out of it<,,> and that's what the old joke
about you know <O>inaudible</O> <quote>no thanks <#\>I'll read
the
book</quote> or <quote>no thanks <#\>I've seen the
film</quote><,,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>But doesn't this <O>inaudible</O> look
revolting
<O>inaudible</O><,> <#\><{1><[1>Wouldn't it</[1> be painful
<{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh yuk</[1></{1>     <[2><O>inaudible</O></[2></{2> 
<$C> <#\><O>inaudible</O> astrological science
<$B> <#\>Have you read this article on <quote>frozen embryos
<#\>To destroy
or donate</quote> <{><[><,></[> <#\>You wouldn't think that that would
be a
problem would you<,> I mean<,> all you see is
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>     <#\>Well I'd be a bit worried about donating embryos that
were eight years old anyway
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>I know but like even the idea that it would be
a
problem like<,>
<$C> <#\>What <#\>You're worried about who's who's getting an old
embryo<,>
<$B> <#\>Well it's eight years old <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Don't you think they're</[></{> becoming a bit elderly <#\>I
mean
<{><[><,></[> it doesn't sound like a very um<,,> good medical
practice to me <O>inaudible</O> <O>ABlaugh</O><,,>
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>     <#\>Don't you think they look like fish hooks <O>Alaughs</O>
<$A> <#\>Dad <{><[>singularly</[> uncomfortable fish hooks
<$C> <#\><[>They are fish hooks</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,><#\>They look like they'd catch you
<$C> <#\>They are fish hooks <{><[><,></[> <#\>That's the whole point
of
them isn't it<,>
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>Mmm <#\>No <#\>They're earrings<,,>
<$C> <#\>They are definitely fish hooks <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>They certainly look like them don't they
<$C> <#\>I mean if you<,> if earrings they'd be hung on fish
hooks
<$B> <#\>Oh<,> maybe that's <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$C> <#\><[>Hung on fish hooks for display</[></{> <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
<$C> <#\>And they call them earrings<,>
<$A> <#\>Oh I see
<$C> <#\>They'd drag on the<,,>

<$A> <#\>Do you have any slices

<$A> <#\>Dad<,> do you want any
<$C> <#\>No thanks honey
<$B> <#\>It was nice slice though <#\>Did you make it up
<$C> <#\>Which<,,>
<$B> <#\>The<,> the slice
<$C> <#\>Oh no <#\>That's a<,,> that's a<,> catholic recipe <#\>I
put
more chocolate in it in case I put more cherries in it<,,> I
doubled the amount of cherries<,,> and I doubled the amount of
chocolate
<$A> <#\>Yum<,>
<$C> <#\>Twice as much chocolate<,> twice as much cherry
<$A> <#\>Very wise<,>
<$C> <#\>I think it makes it better<,>
<$A> <#\>Definitely<,,>
<$C> <#\>On the drive this morning <@>forename4</@> <{1><[1><,></[1> the
park on the<,> Thompson's Corner which is a righthand way
<{2><[2><,></[2> <O>inaudible</O> any alternatives <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>And you knew
it went back to Epping <{4><[4>station</[4>
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>Nah</[3></{3>     <#\><[4>Mmhmm</[4></{4> <#\>Easy<,>
<$C> <#\>Did you manage <O>inaudible</O> to get over the right
lane there <{><[><,></[> when you pass the double lights<,,>
<$A> <#\><[>Mmhmm</[></{>     <#\>I don't have any problems with that area now that I've
done it
<$C> <#\>No <#\>No<,> <#\>You once you've done <{><[>something</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Where was</[></{> it <#\>Castle Hill
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,,>
<$C> <#\>It's quite tricky <#\>I mean<,> it's only
<{1><[1>performance</[1> <,> 
four <#\>It's just remembering where to turn <{2><[2><,></[2> and now
you've done that<,,> you're halfway to Blacktown<,> if you
were going to Blacktown <O>ABlaugh</O> <#\>I'm serious<,> <#\>If
you
are<,> that's the way you go to get Sunnyholt Road <#\>You just
go down to Showground Road<,>then onto Kellyville Road and
then turn off right and then left and that's Sunnyholt Road
<{3><[3><,> <O>inaudible</O></[3> 
<$A> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>    <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>Actually I remember that</[3></{3> <w>'cos</w> that's where
<@>forename5</@> used to live
<$C> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>And once you've been that trip once<,>
that<,>
that's<,,> I mean it's not far from there to Windsor
either<,,> <#\>So if you want to go out to Richmond and
Windsor<,> you're on the border <#\>That's <{><[>on</[> the <[>same
line</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> Richmond's actually surprise surprisingly easy
to get to<,>
<$C> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>If you want to go to Dural<,,> <#\>You can
go to
Dural two ways <#\>Either via Castle Hill<,,> the way you went<,>
or you can go<,,> you know at the<,> triangle trees <{1><[1><,></[1> instead of turning left you turn right<,> and go up the road
to Boundary Street <{2><[2><,></[2> and you turn left to get Boundary
Street <#\>Just up the next set of lights<,> you go left and that
brings you to Dural
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>Oh yes</[2></{2>     <#\>Oh<,,>
<$C> <#\>So you<,> you know once you get the hang of it<,>
<#\>You
should<,> always look carefully at your map <{1><[1><,></[1> afterwards<,,> so you can<,> see what's<,> what's around that
area <{2><[2><,,></[2> <#\>That's how you learn<,> what Sydney's like<,,>
<@>forename6</@> 's been <@>forename6</@> 's been driving out
to <{3><[3><O>inaudible</O></[3> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>    <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>Well all these debates</[3></{3> you should get to know the
city
pretty well<,> especially in the dark <O>Blaughs</O>
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Last night was really easy actually because
once
I got to Boundary Road I just basically had to keep going
straight<,,>
<$C> <#\>Boundary Road <{><[><,,> Boundary</[> Street up here
<$B> <#\><[>Isn't it called Boundary Road</[></{>     Boundary Street <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>In Chatswood<,> <#\>Well once I
was
on that<,> <{2><[2>it was just a really easy one</[2> I just had to go
straight<,,> right until the end<,> and then <{3><[3><,></[3> and then
just turn left onto Pittwater Road<,> and we were there
<$C> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>     <#\><[2>You just have to go straight as a beeline</[2></{2>     <#\><[3>Beeline</[3></{3>     <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>Well that's the <O>inaudible</O> is just
across
from there
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>It is <#\>It's in Dee Why<,> 
<$C> <#\><O>inaudible</O> over the road<,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>Freshwater
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,,>
<$A> <#\>I think they are
<$C> <#\>Long way
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>It is
<$C> <#\>How long did it take you last night <#\>An hour
<$B> <#\>Oh<,> it took me about fifty minutes to actually get
over
there<,,> <#\><{><[>I was still the first person there</[> 
<$C> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> 
<$B> <#\>Oh I left at<,,> we were going out the drive by about
