 <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Well it was half past six <#\>It must've
been half past six <w>'cause</w> it was still dark
<{2><[2>and</[2> then <{3><[3><@>forename2</@> </[3>
<$B> <#\> <[1><O>inaudible</O> he really is </[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Did he go in</[3></{3> with what's his name
<$A> <#\>No he drove to Beecroft himself this
 <{1><[1>morning</[1> <#\> He had a  <,>  he had
a  meeting on before his conference  <{2><[2>that's why</[2> that's why  he had to go

     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\>Does he <{><[>Park in Wongola Crescent</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Do you want a piece of</[></{>
<$B> <#\> Just just  a little bit and a
biscuit <#\>Does he park in Wongola Crescent
<$A> <#\>No oh well it depends
<$B> <#\>Because I've got the you know the Beecroft news thing
they send out every month
<$A> <#\>Oh right
<$B> <#\>That was ah in the letter box this morning
 <{><[>and</[> apparently they're trying to get <,> to have
more um spaces in Wongola Crescent for time limit parking
<$A> <#\> <[>Yes </[></{>
     <#\>Mmm so that would get out all these
<$B> <#\> For for  the shoppers so that
there you know there may not be as many spaces there but if
he's going at half past six he's bound to get one
<$A> <#\>Well he I guess when was it <#\>Monday he took
<@>forename3</@> to school and um  he was he  parked
in Copeland Road just outside the bowling club
 <{1><[1><,></[1> and that was fine <#\><{2><[2>Other</[2> days
 he he  parked sometimes in Hannah Street
<#\><{3><[3>Other</[3> days he parks <,> um on the other side
of the line <#\>Not Wongola I don't know what <#\>Is it Morton
Road or
<$B> <#\> <[1>Yes </[1></{1>

Sutherland Road <#\><{1><[1>It runs</[1> down into Morton
Road <{2><[2>and</[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2> because sometimes he's got to park
there <#\>He has to go where he can <#\>But um <,> it's still
not registered <#\>Like I paid for the registration but we
haven't put the sticker on
<$B> <#\>Haven't you <#\>Oh dear have you got it with you
<$A> <#\>No still at home hopeless <O>laughter</O>
