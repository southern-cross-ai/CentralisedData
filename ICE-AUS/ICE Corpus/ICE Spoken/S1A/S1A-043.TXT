<$A> <#\><[>Yeah<,> yeah <#\>I like pretty</[></{> weird
films meself <#\>Don't you
<$B> <#\>I do like pretty weird films <O>Alaughs</O>
<$A> <#\>Oh yeah <#\>Peter Greenaway fan <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$B> <#\>I'm not a Peter Greenaway fan <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\>Stanley Kubick 
<$B> <#\>You're the one who <O>inaudible</O> wire fences
<$A> <#\>Oh that was a weird movie wasn't it
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>It was a weird movie
<$A> <#\>It was quite disgusting
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> but we won't talk about that
<$A> <#\>No um<,> well<,> I've got done here to w to to discuss what we did over the holidays<,> but I
mean we sort of know<,> <#\>I mean<,> You we did a lot of work experience at Mitsui<,>
<{1><[1><,></[1> and which was for quar two three
wasn't it<,,> <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>Yeah <{3><[3> and they</[3> kept
you pretty busy
<$B> <#\><[1>yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Three weeks</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Three weeks</[3></{3>
     <#\>They did<,,> <#\>Too busy really for unpaid labour
<#\>but<,> we won't go into that <O>Alaughs</O> <#\>I'm not
<O>inaudible due to Alaughter</O> 
<$A> <#\>Yeah well um<,> <#\>I've just sort of I
sort of assumed that they'd give you a bit of a golden
handshake at the end of it <w>'cos</w> you've done
<{><[>lots of work for them</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah<,> well I wouldn't've</[></{> done it
otherwise <#\>It wasn't fun<,> <#\>I mean
<$A> <#\>But um<,> the ah<,,> the you know the pricks decided not to<O>Blaughs</O>not to be forth coming with the cash
so<,>
<$B> <#\>They'd be<,> right<,,> to be honest <#\>I mean<,> I
even knew that going in there that I wasn't gonna get paid
<#\><{><[>I didn't expect anything so</[> <#\>They were
very nice to have me <#\>It looks good on the resume<,>
<#\>That's important
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah true<,> true<,,> true</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah well apparently they the
extension like work experience is unpaid holiday work is va vacation employment is s'posed to be paid so
if you see the sign saying vacation employment<,> then that's you're paid<,> to do it<,> apparently
<$B> <#\>Oh right <{><[>really</[>
<$A> <#\><[>So</[></{> there there's a
distinction between the two like <#\>I know<,> with
advertising agencies there are some<,> who offer vacation
employment and some<,> work experience<,> <{><[><,></[> so and vacation employment ones seem to go very
quickly amongst people who<,> run the student marketing
association
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>So there's employment <{><[>do you think</[>
<$A> <#\><[><O>laughs</O></[></{> I don't really let anyone
else <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <#\>If it's employment it means that
you get paid
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> I think so <#\>Like they don't pay a lot but
they do pay you something <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>and It allows
them because there's a there's
some sort of law that doesn't let you do certain
clerical stuff if you're not being paid <{2><[2><,></[2> so<,>
that mean means they can give you all
sorts of stuff to do<,> if they pay you
<$B> <#\><[1>Oh right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Oh really</[2></{2>
     <#\>Oh I see <#\>So you get<,>
<$A> <#\>Shit <#\>You're a shitkicker<,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>So you get very skilled at making cups of
coffee <{1><[1><,></[1> and filing <{2><[2>things</[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>And filing</[2></{2> yeah <#\><{><[>That's right <#\>Yep<,> yeah <#\>Oh so do I </[> <#\>That's what I
do<,> <#\>That's what I spent three four
years at university so far to be a filer
<$B> I love filing
     <#\><[><O>inaudible</O> licking stamps</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah<,> yeah <O>Blaughs</O> <#\>What d'you think I'm
here for <O>Alaughs</O>
<$A> <#\>Bachelor of filing
<$B> <#\>Bachelor of filing <O>ABlaugh</O> <#\>Well I mean
what d'you reckon about this Japanese <#\>I mean<,,>
<$A> <#\>Well I think I've gotta learn it<,> <#\>I think it<,>
enhances my job prospects if I do Japanese<,> and since I've
already done some<,,> I think it's well worth doing some
more<,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> yeah
<$A> <#\>Well at least till it's being fluent<,>
<$B> <#\>Well that's true I s'pose yeah<,> <#\>But then<,>
<{><[>you know <O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>At least then if I don't get a </[></{> job too
that gives me something more to study<,,> and it's
better to be out I think it's better to be at
uni than on the dole
<$B> <#\>Oh <{><[>it's</[>
<$A> <#\><[>No not</[></{> much better<,> <{><[>but um</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Well<,> it's</[></{> more of the same really
isn't it <#\>I mean <O>Alaughing</O> 
<$A> <#\>Small improvement<,> <#\>It's just a status thing
really <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$B> <#\>But it's about the same money you get on the dole as
you do<,> having being a student I mean
<$A> <#\>Well being at uni obviously there's a a paycut involved <{><[><,></[> from being on the
dole
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <{><[><,></[> well that's right<,> <#\>Well I don't I don't think it's called <quote>on the
dole</quote> <#\>It's called on the<quote>on
the commonwealth government payroll</quote>
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>You're quite right
<$B> <#\>You know work work<{1><[1>working
for Paul Keating</[1> <#\>Speaking of Paul Keating<,>
what an absolute <{2><[2>fuckup</[2> <O>AB laugh</O> <#\>Yeah
um<,> well it's pretty dangerous to talk about the Labor Party
in a in a educational institution because they've all
<{3><[3><O>inaudible</O></[3> so you have to be quite careful
what you're saying
<$A> <#\><[1>With Paul</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2><O>Alaughs</O></[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>It is<,> <#\>It is</[3></{3>
     <#\>you do but ah<,> I think we're all right<,> because
um<,,> they asked us<,>
<$B> <#\>Well they did<,> and really they're gonna have to
listen to my political beliefs <O>Alaughs</O> <{><[>and I
might say<,> I might say</[>
<$A> <#\><[>They're gonna be subjected to two hours
of</[></{> beliefs <@>forenameB</@> 's political
beliefs
<$B> <#\>And I might say that um yesterday I was approached in
the refec by a socialist ah<,> person of female persuasion
with a Mabo a big fat Mabo badge on
her on her clothes wearing a<,> customary
tie-dyed shirt<,> telling me shoving down my
throat while I was trying to eat my ham and coleslaw
sandwich<,> why<,> um<,> I should not have to pay HECS<,,>
<{><[>and</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Well</[></{> that's not bad <#\>I'd listen to
that <#\><{><[><,> Why shouldn't</[> why
I have to pay HECS
<$B> <#\><[>Well I mean</[></{>
     <#\>You should have top pay HECS
<$A> <#\>You should
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,,>
<$A> <#\>Well<,> I don't like having to pay HECS
<$B> <#\>Yeah oh I don't like it but I think it's it's fair that you have to pay its put something back into the system
<$A> <#\>Well<,,> I think actually I put a lot of hard labour
back into the system <#\>I put a lot back in this year
<$B> <#\>That's absolute garbage <O>Alaughs</O>
<$A> <#\>I do so<,> <#\>I work hard<,>
<$B> <#\>Yes but<,> <#\>The bare fact is that I think that you
get a lot more benefits than the average sort of factory
worker
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> yeah <#\>No I'm happy to<,> <O>inaudible</O> 
<$B> <#\>Yeah well I don't pay them up front I pay them um
<$A> <#\>I don't have to pay for it in tax until I've got<,>
<{1><[1><,></[1> an income of over about thirty grand or something

     <#\>What do socialists believe in if not
<$B> <#\>Oh<,> the dictatorships
<$A> <#\>No that's communism<,>
<$B> <#\>But they're sort of the same<,,>
<$A> <#\>Mmm<,,>
<$B> <#\>Socialists like those countries
in in the Soviet Union are called
socialist<,>
<$A> <#\>Yes so they're actually communist

to be impressed with that one <O>ABlaugh</O> <#\>Yeah um<,> I
