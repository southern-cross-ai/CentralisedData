<I><$A>   <#\>So they just they have no idea <#\>I just
<$B> <#\>How you got through it<,> and <{><[>it<,></[> was
a really run
<$A> <#\><[>No</[></{>
     <#\>It was just out here actually <O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>Where where
<$A> <#\>Just actually  it would straight
to start here honestly cos I remember <{><[>lying on the
side of the road</[> <#\>No no On the freeway
<$B> <#\><[>In the<,> car park</[></{>
     <#\>On the free <O>Blaughs</O> on the
freeway 
<$A> <#\>And they had the traffic banked back <#\>Like it went
right across the bridge and out that way and they had the
ambulances coming backwards down the road <#\>So they they  were coming 
<$B> <#\>But you weren't in the car
<$A> <#\>I was outside the car
<$B> <#\>Well why were you outside the car on that
<{><[>freeway</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Because<,></[></{> my tyre blew
<#\><{1><[1>Like the tyre</[1> blew right off the wheel
<{2><[2>so</[2> I was getting a tyre out of the car and I
couldn't go anywhere because there was absolutely nowhere to
go and I was trying to get to <#\>I was with a friend
<{3><[3>and</[3> um just could not get to one of the islands
cos the islands are on the right-hand side <#\>We were on the
left-hand lane so we just couldn't get across<,> and I'm going
<quote>Oh god <#\>Oh my god</quote><O>Alaughs</O>
<$B> <#\><[1>Ohh</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Oh</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\>Did you have any feeling that you were<,> in this
dangerous situation
<$A> <#\>Oh definitely <#\>We were so careful <#\>We were in
like a car<,> like this colour which is a bright bright yellow
<$B> <#\>And yeah the lights were flashing <{><[>and they
still didn't</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Lights <#\>Oh we had</[></{><,> lights coming
down on top of us <#\>I couldn't find the hazard lights<,>
because I was in a car that I wasn't familiar with so we did
absolutely everything else right <#\>We got out on the side
where the cars couldn't knock us off <{1><[1>and</[1>
everything and it was just oh it was awful 
and the most amazing part was you know when you're standing
there and you turn around and I just remember<,> my friend
turned around and we were actually on our way to see a play
and um<,> we'd just been down to the close because a friend of
mine's been away and I was just sort of sitting there
reminiscing and everything and this other guy had just broken
up with his girlfriend so we thought oh we'll go down to the
beach and sit on the beach and maybe feel better for a little
while and <{2><[2>um</[2>
<$B> <#\><[1>Oh</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>And</[2></{2> that was the day
<$A> <#\>Yeah and we got back and we had like this beautiful
day and we just went down to the beach and everything and we
came and um<,> we were on our way <#\>Hey did you go and see
kissing frogs
<$B> <#\>No
<$A> <#\>It had Glynn Nicholas in it <#\><{1><[1>It</[1> was
supposed to be fantastic <#\><{2><[2>We</[2> had like<,>
these tickets and it was something like twenty eight dollars
each <{3><[3>or something</[3>
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>For that</[3></{3> night
<$A> <#\>Yeah <O>laughter</O> 
<$B> <#\>And <{><[>obviously<,> you</[> couldn't go
<$A> <#\><[>So here we are</[></{>
     <#\>We couldn't go <O>Blaughs</O> <#\>And I'm
like<,> I'm lying  there and I'm going
<quote><@>Forename1</@> give give  somebody the
ticket</quote> <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> and I'm
going the first thing  I said was <quote>oh my
god did we damage the car <#\>Put the tyre on the wheel
<#\>Get the car off the road</quote>
<$B> <#\><[>And you were worried about that</[></{>
     <#\>That's like with me with my accident<,> in in  intensive care<,> and I'm saying to my mum
holding her hand <quote>is is  the car
going to be alright<{><[><,></[> <#\>Is the car alright</quote>
cos it was her car that that  I was driving
<$A> <[><O>laughs</O></[></{> <#\>So what happened to you
<$B> <#\>I was um driving on the um<,> Bruce highway to<,>
<#\>I was travelling to work and a car cut across the two
lanes and I tried to prevent myself from running into that car
so I sort of<,> put the brakes on swerved<,,> and um ran into
a tree<,> and then yeah<,> <{><[><,></[> <#\>It happened so easily
I mean but I'm lucky <#\>I can't remember the accident
<#\>Can can  you remember yours
<$A> <#\><[>Oh</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <O>Alaughs</O> <#\>I<O>laughter</O>
I  remember <#\>You know like you remember<,,> it's
funny<,,> the smell of burning rubber<,> because<,> that girl
had her brakes on for so long <#\>She just braked and braked
and braked
<$B> <#\>She must've been a wreck
<#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>She was<,></[></{> she was 
lying on the side <#\>I re I remember ah<,> I
<O>rustling packets and laughter</O> um I just
remember  the<,,> <#\>Like I turned around <#\>I
remember hearing the tyres squealing and I was
thinking I was so conscious <,> of being really
good and not causing an accident and I had a white jumper on
and everybody else could see me and they were driving around
and around<,> and I was just I was  trying
to be so good and everything and all the cars were driving
around and I thought <quote>I <O>inaudible due  to background
noise</O></quote> <#\><@>Forename1</@> was standing under the car
jacking it up and I was getting the tyre out of the boot and
all I heard was the squealing of brakes <#\>You know that
really awful high pitched noise and there was just that and it
just went for ages and I had enough time to think <quote>oh my
god I'm going to cause an accident</quote> and I turned around
and this light was coming straight for me and you know when
you see bunny rabbits and they just stop right in front of the
lights and I'd always wondered what I'd do if anything like
that ever happened and I sort of thought <quote>okay oh my god
I've gotta move <#\>I've gotta move</quote> and I turned just
enough that <#\>My mum and dad've got my dad has
this  fetish<,> absolute fetish for having a trailer
<#\>All he ever wanted was a trailer <{><[>so he could</[>
take<,> his grass clippings and all that sort of stuff to the
<O>inaudible</O> 
<$B> <#\><[><O>laughs</O></[></{>
     <#\>Oh wow what a dream <O>laughs</O>
<$A> <#\>So he got this trailer for the back of the car and
anyway he had a put<,> a towbar on the back of the car
<{><[>and</[> um that's what's actually saved my legs was
<#\>The towbar saved one leg and the other leg<,> had<,> <#\>I
turned
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>Why <#\>Because it was right <{><[>behind it</[>
<$A> <#\><[>It was</[></{> I had it it
just  stuck out just enough that it <{1><[1>just</[1>
covered my leg <#\>It took the impact <{2><[2><,>
<#\>Except</[2> you should've seen the dent in the front of
the car <#\>She was hurtling along <#\>She really was<,> and
then they 
<$B> <#\><[1>Ohh</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Oh god</[2></{2>
     <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>It was just amazing<,> <#\>And then they
<{><[>just</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Oh but</[></{> you're so vulnerable <#\>Like I
mean I can't remember mine which was good but I was like in a
car but you were just so vulnerable because you didn't
have just because you  were out in the middle of
the freeway <#\>I <{><[>couldn't even</[> imagine it
<#\>Yeah<,,> <#\>It's good to talk about it though<,,>
<#\>Are you o do you get pain in your legs when
they get cold and stuff like that<,>
<$A> <#\><[>Were you by yourself</[></{>
     <#\><O>inaudible</O> really depressing isn't it
     <#\>I I used to say<,,> you know the
doctors  would say that to me and all the medical
reports and stuff and<,> I'd say <quote>no no no no you know
<#\>That's not going to happen to me</quote><,,> cos I would
think mind over matter but<,,> I have to admit it<,,>
<#\>There's a<,> bit of a difference <O>laughter</O>
bit of a difference  now to when I was<,> before the
accident in the cold weather you know <#\>It's different
<$B> <#\>Oh yeah <#\>And you can feel it
<$A> <#\>Oh<,> yeah <#\>I got a dint <#\>My flat mate goes
<O>laughter</O> <quote>look at the dint <#\>She's got a
dint</quote> 
<$B> <#\>As in your knee
<$A> <#\>No it's it's  the side of my
leg<,>
<$B> <#\>See it's you you broke  it
<#\><{><[>How many places</[>
<$A> <#\><[>No<,> no I didn't</[></{> <{><[>break it<,>
<#\>I didn't break it</[>
<$B> <#\><[>You didn't break it You didn't break it
<#\>That's</[></{> incredible
<$A> <#\>They they  just said 
<$B> <#\>It'd be all the<,> muscle damage that's why you'd
have <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <#\>It's what 
happened was it ripped the muscles apart<,> and then because
my legs were so swollen I couldn't do anything with them and
then<,> what happened was they ended up<,,> because I wasn't
moving they com like all the blood 
congealed and then<,> I couldn't move at all and I had drop
foot 
<$C> <#\>Hoy
<$A> <#\><O>laughs</O>Oh hello
<$A> <#\>Did you get that
<$B> <#\>No I haven't but I know people who have
<O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\>like you like you can't do anything  <#\> so
anyway <,> I had to go to physio and we had to retear
all the muscles<,> and um
<$B> <#\>So they were pulling it
<$A> <#\>Yeah and then I just had to we
stretched  it and everything and I was in so much pain
<#\>The doctors <{><[>wouldn't</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Did you</[></{> bend your <#\><{1><[1>You
couldn't really because it was  swollen you
couldn't bend your knee<,></[1> <#\>So<,> yeah see that's what
happened with both my legs <#\>Like I worked for<,,> a long
time getting the mobility and and  the<,>
different<,> you know degrees in each leg back so it was<,>
the same thing for you <#\>Did it take you time to get<,> all
the mobility <{2><[2>back</[2>
<$A> <#\><[1>I couldn't<,,> do anything</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2><,> <#\>I still find I limp now
because it's only been a year but like<,> <{><[>unless
you</[>
<$B> <#\><[>You can lose</[></{> that <#\>You just have to
<{><[>work</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{><,> <#\>I sort of made it<,> harder
even
<$B> <#\><O>laughing</O>I don't know <#\>I'm lucky <#\>I mean
I maybe  I was unlucky cos I broke like
both legs were damaged so<,>
<$A> <#\>How did where did  you break
<{><[>them</[>
<$B> <#\><[>I had</[></{> like five fractures in the right
femur<,> and four fractures in the left femur <{><[><,>
and</[> fractured metatarcles in the left foot <O>Blaughs</O>
<O>inaudible</O> 
<$A> <#\><[>Oh <O>inaudible</O></[></{>
     <#\>You did it well I'll give you that <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$B> <#\>Yeah so maybe cos I I've  thought
about this <#\>I've thought you know<,> even though I did
work<,,> really hard to avoid having a limp but I think maybe
I was lucky because I had two damaged legs and I had to
almost<,> relearn how to walk
<$A> <#\>You would definitely
<$B> <#\>So maybe like<,> with only one leg damaged the other
one really compensates a lot so you've got more chance for a
limp <#\>I don't know<,>
<$A> <#\>I just find that<,> I understand 
what you're saying <{1><[1>and</[1> I definitely agree <#\>I
just find that I<,> I don't in in summer 
I'm fine<,> because I'm warm <#\>I <{2><[2>just</[2> find I
limp when I get really cold and the damn thing hurts<,> but
it's not it doesn't  hurt  
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\>No an aching
<$A> <#\>It's just this
<$B> <#\>Dull
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>It's a pain in the
<$B> <#\>It's just there hey
<$A> <#\>Yeah and you sort of think okay but I sort of
well I take  my my  tube of
Dencorub with me <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$B> <#\>You've gotta look after yourself huh<,> and maybe
just extra warm tights or something
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> so it's definitely I'm O K but I hate sitting
in air conditioned rooms for a long time<,>
<$B> <#\>And do you still swim or do you um
<$A> <#\>Yeah actually I um
<$B> <#\>And you're exercising a lot
<$A> <#\>Yeah I swim every day
<$B> <#\>That's great<,>
<$A> <#\>Not during winter <{1><[1>but</[1> during summer I
swim about a kilometre a day <#\><{2><[2>I just</[2> go
down oh well at work they've  got the pool and
everything so I just run down during my lunch hour and I play
tennis
