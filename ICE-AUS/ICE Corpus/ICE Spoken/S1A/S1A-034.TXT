<S1A-034> <2017>
<I><$A>   <#\>Um and then I worked<,>
waitressed at a French restaurant now which has since
closed down <#\>That would've been<,,> almost inner city<,,>
<#\>No not inner city<,,> <#\>Not quite
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[>What</[></{> was the name of the French
restaurant
<$A> <#\>Oh look it only stayed open for about eighteen months
and then he realised it wasn't viable
<$C> <#\>What <#\>Was in Toorak Road
<$A> <#\>No it wasn't <#\>It was on a<,>one of the main roads<,,> ah heading sort of
across the river way <#\>You know how you get to there's
aif you're travelling over
<{1><[1>towards</[1><,,>travelling that way
towards St Kilda <{2><[2><,></[2> you paceyou
pass a major<,,> ah car <{3><[3><,></[3> yard on the
right <#\>I <{4><[4>think it was</[4> on the <O>inaudible</O>
somewhere <#\>I think it was on the right wasn't it
<#\>There's a major car yard <#\>There's a major intersection 
<$B> <#\><[1><O>inaudible</O></[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmhmm</[2></{2>
<$C> <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>On the right</[4></{4>
<$B> <#\>On St Kilda Road
<$A> <#\>No no no no no <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>on a different road</[></{>
<$C> <#\>Not near Christ church South Yarra<,>
<$A> <#\>Well I'm not sure where Christ church <{><[>is</[>
<$C> <#\><[>Christ church</[></{> is on the corner of
Toorak Road and Pumper<,> yes
<$A> <#\>Along
<$C> <#\>And sort of down the hill going towards Commercial
Road was it
<$A> <#\>Oh I can't remember where exactly <#\>I mean
<$C> <#\>Mmm <w>'cos</w> there's a little restaurant down
there that's been there for years but it keeps changing
whatever it is <#\>It was called Percy Pringle's at one stage
<$A> <#\>Well it was probably that restaurant 
<$C> <#\>And it  was next door to<,,> ah<,> Pitstop Toyota<,>
I think<,,> 
<$A> <#\>Inyeah I think that's where it
was<,> <#\>Well I worked there for a while <#\>That
wasthat was good and um<,> it was lovely
because it was a very small restaurant so
<$C> <#\>Yes just a little single shopfront
<{><[>terrace</[>
<$A> <#\><[>The chef</[></{> and his wife ran it <#\><{1><[1>It's</[1> ah whenever we had
finished<,> <{2><[2>um<,></[2> we'dwe'd
all sit down <#\>He'll cook us a meal<,> <{3><[3>andand open</[3> a bottle of French wine
<#\><{4><[4>It was beautiful</[4><,,> <#\>Um<,> and then<,>
from there I went to<,,> <O>inaudible</O> worked at Maria and
Walter's I think
<$C> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>You'd get to eat</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Oh that'd be nice</[3></{3>
<$B> <#\><[4>Oh sounds awful</[4></{4>
<$C> <#\>Did you really <#\><{><[>Goodness</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah but</[></{> then<,>
<$C> <#\>They've moved into Southcote now you know
<$A> <#\>Oh have they
<$C> <#\>Walter's <{><[>wine bar <O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>I didn't</[></{>I only
worked there I think<,> er<,,>
<#\><@>Forename1</@> <O>name</O> had been doing a lot of work for
Maria and Walter's and I did a little bit but um<,> I was
mostly at Shokahari there
<$C> <#\>Oh right mmm
<$A> <#\>And ah<,,> Walter is a<,,> <#\>Itit was um <{1><[1><,></[1> a right pain <#\>It was it was um of the places that I've
worked probably Shokahari was the best in terms of<,> getting
to know staff <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> <#\>were some
dippy people but<,,> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\><[1>Hello Walter</[1></{1>
<$C> <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
     <#\>I never got into waitressing <#\>I don't know why<,,>
<$B> <#\>Where was Shokahari
<$A> <#\>In Carlton<,> in Lygon Street<,>
<$C> <#\>Was it on the corner of Lygon street and the lane
that led to the parking area <{1><[1>behind</[1> Jimmy
Watson's<,>
<$A> <#\><[1>Yes<,> yes</[1> 
<$B> <#\><[1>That's right</[1></{1>
     <#\>still is<,,>
<$C> <#\>Ithe only time I've ever eaten
there I think was with the <@>forename2</@> <@>surname2</@> s <#\>When my Jewish
friends come home from Israel<,> it's always a problem to find
where we can eat<,> <w>'cos</w> they virtually have to eat
vegetarian <w>'cos</w> being orthodox Jewish they can't eat in
a regular restaurant <{1><[1>where the meat</[1> and the
milk might all get mixed up together<,> <#\>You can't invite
them home to eat <#\>That's a major disaster<,> so I usually
leave it to them to choose <#\>So I've eaten at Shokahari
<{2><[2><,></[2> at a place that used that used to be down in
Collins street<,> underneath<,,> Howie court <#\>Howie Court
<#\>Where the Manchester Unity arcade is <#\><{3><[3>It was
called</[3> the South Seas in those days <#\>Maybe Howie
Court's further down <#\>And then at the um<,,> oh the Hari
Krishna restaurant <{4><[4>at</[4> Thompson street <#\>Did you
ever there
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh that's right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
<$B> <#\><[3><O>inaudible</O></[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmhmm</[4></{4>
<$A> <#\>I haven't <#\>No
<$C> <#\>And then the last time I ate with them was actually
the night before dad died<,> and they took me to a Jewish
restaurant in Caulfield<,> <w>'cos</w> there are very few
Jewish restaurants in Melbourne <w>'cos</w> the Jews tend
mostly to eat at home <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>That is the
orthodox Jews so there are<,> only one or two kosher
restaurants<,,> and this one served great big helpings of you
know really sort of good sensible food
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>There's nothing flash about it<,,>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Did some market research too whilst I was in
<{1><[1>Melbourne</[1> <#\>That was<,,> just awful 
<#\>Trapping around places like Footscray<,> um <#\>It was sort of
real pensioner area too <{2><[2>which you know</[2> you leave
with six samples and then you come back in three weeks time to
see what <{3><[3>they use it</[3> <#\>Yeah<,,> <#\>And ah<,>
because I didn't have a car<,> like stupidly didn't think
you'd need a car or so on <#\>I mean<,,> I had this enormous
basket<,> <#\>I was lugging it <#\>Yeah I think it's the big
you know the really big cane basket I've got <{4><[4><,></[4>
<#\>You know lugging around<,> a hundred cans  
<$C> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Oh yes</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3><O>inaudible</O></[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Yeah</[4></{4>
     <#\>How did you get your jobs at uni<,,>
<$A> <#\>Well I applied for theall of
them I think
<$B> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$C> <#\><[>Through the</[></{> appointments board<,,>
<$B> <#\>From the paper
<$A> <#\>No<,> oh no<,> <#\>Oh actually I got one through the
appointments board at uni and that was ah thea week <#\>No a term<,> school camp thing <#\>Oh
not camp <#\>Er School activities for primary schools students
and that was in Princes Hill I think
<$C> <#\>You mean after-careafter-school
<$A> <#\>No that was in the holidays
<$C> <#\>Oh in the holidays <#\>Holiday care
<$A> <#\>Um No the one<,> <#\>The work at the Chinese noodle
shop<,> <#\>I think I went to the restaurants around the area
and asked
<$C> <#\>Oh right<,,>
<$A> <#\>Um<,,> Shokahari was the connection with the Chinese
noodle shop
<$C> <#\>Mmm<,>
<$A> <#\>The work at Maria and Walter's <#\>Oh the other thing
that I did was that I worked for a wholesale seafood place
<$C> <#\>Oh right
<$A> <#\>And the woman who<,> I worked with there<,,> um<,>
<#\>Oh well they served the people who ah ran the French
restaurant <{1><[1>that</[1> I did some waitressing at<,>
andand then I did the move to Shokahari
with the connection with the Chinese noodle shop
<$C> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\>Right
<$A> <#\>And the other waitressing was through a friend of
mine <#\>The one I did <O>inaudible</O> with 
<$C> <#\>But I used to be a part of theI think it
was the Thursday rush up the stairs to the
appointments board to get the notices when they came out<,>
<#\>And II washed up for Jewish new year
<#\>I got a child minding job down at Mornington for a little
boy for the whole of the summer holidays at the end of my
first year<,,> <#\>I did ironing for a lady in South Yarra<,>
<#\>I cleaned house for<,> a couple in Goathouse street and
another lady in Park drive and another woman in<,,> <#\>She
must have been in<,> next to St Cartheges <#\>What's that
<#\>Royal Parade
<$B> <#\>Royal parade is it
<$C> <#\>Yeah<,,> um<,,> <#\>Never took any of the artists
modelling jobs on<,> and I never took on any of the coaching
jobs<,> <#\>Les got into a Jewish family<,> and looked after
their little boy and he used to sort of take him on outings
and train rides<,> and all sorts of odd things that they did
together<,,> <#\>Once upon a time there was an advertisement
for someone to look after the children of Mrs Edward Crooke of
the holy plain in Rosedale and um I was really sorry that I
had told my father I would go home and work in the butcher
shop that year because I'd always wanted to go and see the
holy plain<,,> <w>'cos</w> itit was this
big house that was on the road as we drove into Madford to
visit my grandparents <#\><{1><[1>We'd drive</[1> along the
Princes Highway 
<$B> <#\><[1>Oh yes yes yes</[1></{1>
     <#\>You were telling me a story about that
<$A> <#\>Yeah that's right <#\>Only in the last couple of
years have I discovered that the house that I've been looking
at all these years was in fact not the holy plain at all
<O>Blaughs</O> <#\>It's a completely different house and I've
never seen the holy plain as it turns out <O>laughter</O><,,>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> oh well we got um<,,>my
father was an unsuccessful <O>inaudible</O> like
yours<,,> um <#\>He really didn't want to own his own shop
<#\>He was quite content with <{1><[1>his</[1> shop rent<,>
<#\>And my mother was a very odd<,,> um dominating woman who
insisted he had to have his own shop   
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\>My mother went out and bought my father a shop
<$B> <#\>Well um<,,> I remember during the depression<,,> when
the shops were involved in <{1><[1><O>inaudible</O> <,></[1>I
pointed out to you in <O>inaudible</O> <,> East Malvern
<,> <#\>I remember seeing his ledger from that and one
night and one<,> ah one family owed him a
hundred and seven pounds<,> <#\>Now a hundred and seven
<{2><[2>pounds</[2> in the nineteen thirties 
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh right mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
          <#\>Oh
          <#\>Mmm
     <#\>Was a lot of money
<$B> <#\>Was a lot of money
<$A> <#\>He'd let it run a bit far
<$B> <#\>He'd let it run up a bit far because he was <#\>This
was the ah <@>forename3</@> <@>surname3</@> family<,,> <#\>And I can even remember
their name <#\>I've seen the ledger as I've said and um<,> he
was too soft to go and say <quote>well you know<,> could I
have a<,>have something on the
side</quote> you know <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>He had to throw the
whole <O>inaudible</O> to keep going
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1>
<$C> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>But to let a hundred and seven pounds run up in those
days was<,> <#\>I mean we ah<,> then went down and lived in
Mordialloc<,,> and then up to Wollmend and then<,> they built
some new shops on the corner of Centre road and Point Nepean
road 
<$C> <#\>They've gone now <{1><[1><,></[1> but they were there
for a <{2><[2>long time when I was a kid</[2> <#\>Mmm
