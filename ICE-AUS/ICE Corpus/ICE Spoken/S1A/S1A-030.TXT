<S1A-030> <2001>
<I><$A>   <#\>They just<,> came up <{1><[1>yesterday</[1>
 and and   I I told I'd
written  a letter to them<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> explaining
everything that that went on<,> and I told them about the two
hundred dollar fine<,> but  they're not going to I didn't ask them  to fork out for me<,,> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm<,> yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yep</[2></{2>
     <#\>Would've they've given it to you do you reckon
<$A> <#\>If I had said<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> you ah well I mean yes<,>
<{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>I mean Not if I had said <quote>can I have two
hundred dollars please <#\>I just need two hundred
dollars</quote>  but if I had said but if I'd said
to them<,,> <quote>I need two hundred dollars to pay off this
fine</quote> I think they'd <O>inaudible</O> and maybe not
even ah expect me to pay it back<,> <{3><[3><,></[3> but the office
here has given me the choice<,,> of not paying it back<,,> in
a way but doing<,> <{4><[4>gardening</[4> work<,,> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Work mmm</[4></{4>
     <#\>When're you going to do that<,,>
<$A> <#\>Well that's an odd bit<,> because I think they might
want me to do it in the holidays
<$B> <#\><O>Blaughing</O>That means you have to pay
<{><[>room board</[>
<$A> <#\><[>That means I have to</[></{>  for to  stay here <#\><{><[>Exactly</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{><,,>
     <#\>Oh <{><[>so they get</[> more dosh from you that
way<,,>
<$A> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{>
     <#\>But still<,,> <#\>Yeah<,> yeah<,> <#\>But uh yeah
I'm gonna have to go up and see if we can work out
something<,,> <#\><O>inaudible</O> because I mean it's
awkward<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> because either I stay during the holidays
and do it<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> or I do it before holidays <{3><[3>but then</[3> got exams <#\>to study <{4><[4><,></[4> <#\>Not that
I'm really big on studying for exams anyway<,,>
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Got exams</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Yeah</[4></{4>
     <#\>Mmhmm<,,> <#\>Did everyone else get two hundreds
except for <@>Forename1</@>
<$A> <#\>No <#\> <@>Forename2</@> and<,,> <{1><[1><,></[1> got <@>Forename2</@> and <@>Forename1</@>  got three hundred<,>
<{2><[2><,></[2> but um<,,> ah<,> <@>Forename3</@> and I got two
hundred<,,> <#\>They reckon this thing's cost them about six
thousand dollars and I <{3><[3>reckon that's</[3> a load of
crap<,,> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Got three hundred</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>You're kidding</[3></{3>
     <#\>How could it cost them six thousand
<{><[>bucks</[>
<$A> <#\><[>I know</[></{> <#\>I know 
<$B> <#\>How much is the fire alarm <#\>It s'pose to be about
a thousand 
<$A> <#\>They reckon it's six hundred<,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>But  it it  didn't work <#\>They<,>
really didn't work it out properly I think<,> because they
said<,,> that if you<,> because you get one free call<,> a
year<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> or every<,> <{2><[2>x number of weeks or
something</[2> <#\>Yeah<,>  and so you have <w>'cos</w>   you know they're  you know
it's  twice a<,>two <O>inaudible</O> <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>And
so the first one wasn't paid for right<,> <{4><[4><,></[4>
<w>'cos</w> that was the free one<,,> <#\>Now this one was
paid for<,,> <#\>They just reckon that somehow it works out
to be six hundred dollars and  they reckon they also from there they  tack on I don't know how<,,>
<{5><[5><,></[5> um<,,> cleaning fees<{6><[6><,></[6> <w>'cos</w> there
was graffiti done and<,,> stuff like that <{7><[7><,></[7> but
that's<,,> not very <{8><[8><,></[8> much at all<,> <#\>And I
don't know where the hell they got six thousand and oh and
they were very gracious  not charging not
charging  us for their time <{9><[9><,></[9> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Right</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Mmm</[5></{5>
     <#\><[6>Yeah</[6></{6>
     <#\><[7>Yeah</[7></{7>
     <#\><[8>Much at all</[8></{8>
     <#\><[9>Mmm</[9></{9> and they got it to six thousand
<$A> <#\>They got up to six thousand <#\>That's pretty
<{><[>bad</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Actually</[></{> it was probably the police<,,>
<w>'cos</w>  if like if  you have an
investigation with the police apparently the charges they
charge you for  the<{1><[1><,></[1>the  cost of
it<,,> <#\>You know that Fairley Arrow case <{2><[2><,></[2>
<#\>They hit her with a twenty five thousand dollar bill for
the time they were looking for her<,,>
<$A> <#\><[1>What</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\>Really
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>That's ridiculous though<,,>
<$B> <#\>gotta make money somehow
<$A> <#\>No<,,> <#\>The police is not there to make money<,,>
<$B> <#\>Maybe that's where they get the six thousand from<,,>
<{><[><,></[> <w>'cos</w> the college did sort of waste their time
in a way<,,>
<$A> <#\><[>Which is</[></{>
     <#\>Whose side are you on here
<$B> <#\>Oh I'm
<$A> <#\>yeah yeah <#\> I I  guess you're
prob'ly right
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> and that's the only way I could see
them getting the five grand out of it <#\>It's not like<,> I
mean they could repaint the whole joint for that much money
couldn't they<,,> or at least one floor<,,> plus get the
spray cans <O>inaudible</O><,,>
<$A> <#\>They should get the graffiti people to<,>
<$B> <#\>The graffiti people
<$A> <#\>Mmm <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>You were asleep by then too<,,>
<$A> <#\>I was asleep for the fire alarm
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> <#\>Alright<,> <#\>Did
you actually wake up for the fire alarm
     
     <O>Next part from both speakers is inaudible</O>

<$A> <#\>Where was god when I needed him to protect me hey
<$B> <#\>Didn't the tutor wake you up<,>
<$A> <#\>Nuh
<$B> <#\>That's a bit <{><[>slack</[>

<@>Surname4's</@> tutor  he um<,,>he 
opened the door and walked in <{><[><,></[> but I wasn't you
know<,>
<$B> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
     <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>You were under the sheets
<$A> <#\>Yeah I guess <#\>I guess<,> or maybe I wasn't
<#\>Maybe I wasn't there <#\>I mean<,> I'm<,> sure I was but
it is a  mine small  tiny possibility<,>
that I was so drunk that I got up<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> went
somewhere<,> the fire alarm went off and I came back to
bed<,,> but that's just minute<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>It's so
small<,,> <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
     <#\>Mmhmm<,> <#\>Fair enough<,,> <#\>Were you parents pissed

<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>I've gotta  cop it cop it
sweet <,> <#\>And I agree<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>But they
didn't come down hard on me like <O>inaudible</O> <#\> I
guess I guess  they were disappointed<{2><[2><,> </[2>
<#\> Cos It's not it's  it's too early
<O>laugh</O> in a way you know like<,>
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>

<$A> <#\>No last week  <#\>Look I've only started wearing them this
Saturday
<$B> <#\>Yeah well hey<,> eight days<,> nine days
<$A> <#\>Yeah well I <{><[>cleaned them</[> and chucked them in the drier
and took them out last Saturday and then just was sitting in
my cupboard 
<$B> <#\><[>ten days</[></{>      <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>You see I I've haven't even<,> you know dried things<,>
never even washed things <{><[><,></[> until I came here
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O></{>  
     <#\>No neither did I 
<$A> <#\>I you know I came out all my all my shirts like shrunk
<{><[><,></[> because I didn't realise that drying certain things
would make them <[><,></[></{> shrink
<$B> <#\>Yeah 
     <#\>Yeah
     my towels all shrunk  <#\>They turned from like you know
normal towels to hand towels<,> yeah<,,> <#\>So you just you'd
give them to mum <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>Oh sure  cos mum doesn't actually you know do an
awful lot at home  <#\>I mean <O>B laughs</O> now I mean now she
doesn't because all the okay I'm the youngest of four <{><[><,></[>
once the youngest has you know she's got<,> not a lot to do
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[> </{>
     <#\>Yeah
     <#\>So you just<,> give her work to do so she felt wanted
<$A> <#\>Yeah I did  <#\>But now she's writing a book<,> and she's
got a small business
<$B> <#\>What's she writing a book in
<$A> <#\>Well<,,> she's<,> made a <O>inaudible</O> in foreign
affairs for many years <{1><[1><,></[1> and um so she's writing a book
on the Australian foreign affairs wives <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>Oh yeah I mean
it's not very deep sounding like
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>   
     <#\><[2>Wow</[2></{2>
     <#\>It probably won't be a best seller
<$A> <#\>No <#\>Probably not probably not  <#\>It's <O>inaudible</O>
actually <{1><[1><,></[1> because you know if you read about like the
first Australian mission in China<,> <O>inaudible</O> <{2><[2><,></[2> it's very difficult for them<,,> <#\>And you know and foreign
affairs wives in certain places at certain times you know
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1> </{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\>Any scandalous kind of stuff<,,>
<$A> <#\>Oh in the department <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>I mean well no I mean its its
in a way its sort of saying that women have had it bad <{2><[2><,></[2> because really you know in a way they have <{3><[3><,></[3> because for
many many years the Foreign Affairs Department before that it
was Department of <,> oh something but uh um <{4><[4><,></[4> you could
if a foreign affairs if a guy who was working in foreign
affairs married a lady who was working in foreign affairs she
wasn't allowed to work <{5><[5><,></[5> she was just you know <quote>well
now that you're married you can't <{6><[6>work</[6> as well </quote> <#\>That's I
think it's only in about the last ten years or something <{7><[7><,></[7> that <O>inaudible</O> could vote <{8><[8><,></[8> whereas it's
interesting subject  <{9><[9><,></[9> <#\>I think she just sort of felt it
needed to be done
<$B> <#\><[1>I mean</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>mm</[4></{4>      <#\><[5>Really</[5></{5>
     <#\><[6>Yeah</[6></{6>
     <#\><[7>Women</[7></{7>
     <#\><[8>Mm</[8></{8>
     <#\><[9>Uh how</[9></{9>
     how far into it is she
<$A> <#\>Oh well she's finished it now already given it to<,,>
<$B> <#\>Does anyone want to publish it  or is it just that
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>No she's</[></{> got a publisher
<$B> <#\>Yeah  <#\>When's it coming out
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> I'm not too sure <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>But um I think
she in a sort of felt it needed to be done because a lot of
the original foreign affairs wives<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> you know felt it
was degrading<,,> <#\>They're dying <O>laughs</O> it's about that
time  now that <{3><[3><,></[3> they're starting to go and die<,,>
<O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>    
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\>Yeah <O>inaudible</O> write up one of my field stories
one day
<$A> <#\>Your field stories
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,>
<$A> <#\>How's that
<$B> <#\>Oh all sorts of things happen in the field like jumping
on black snakes and<,,> you know things like that<,> rolling
vehicles<,,> you know all the things that make life exciting 
<$A> <#\>Oh yeah.  <O>inaudible</O> tortured and all
<$B> <#\>I could write<,> like I mean I think I could probably do
a um sort of Murder She Wrote kind of thing</I>
