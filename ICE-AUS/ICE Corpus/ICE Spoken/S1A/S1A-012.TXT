 <$B> <#\>Oh well  not much
 <$A> <#\>{laugh} Oh right <#\>Leave it to morning<,,> original
<#\>He doesn't know anything about it<,,> <#\>I saw him  like hi!
<#\>You
know that big smile<,>  but<,,> anyway
 <$B> <#\>At least he says hello <,,> <#\>How's <@>Forename8</@> 
 <$A> <#\>I haven't seen him <,,> <#\>Oh  actually I lie  I have
I think it was a few weeks ago  but I told you nothing <#\>Just
walked past  don't say hello  nothing<,>  that's it
 <$B> <#\>He's sick
 <$A> <#\>He's very weird because initially I started very
friendly with him
 <$B> <#\>Me too<,,>
 <$A> <#\>I don't know
 <$B> <#\>He reminds me of <@>Forename9</@> 
 <$A> <#\>How are things with <@>Forename9</@> <,,>
 <$B> <#\>We're <{><[>not</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>You're not</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>speaking again  cause I told her off again <#\>And
that's it
 <$A> <#\>What happened <#\>And how's <@>Forename10</@> 
 <$B> <#\>Huh  he's o k <#\>I'm getting along better with him
 <$A> <#\>Are you serious
 <$B> <#\>Hahm
 <$A> <#\>Is he sort of looking out for friends now is it
still just the two of them
 <$B> <#\>See now's exam time so I don't really know <,,> what
they do
 <$A> <#\>Well they're doing the same subjects  I'd imagine
they  does she see him on weekends
 <$B> <#\>I think she spends all her weekends at his house
 <$A> <#\>Are you serious
 <$B> <#\>She has no social skills whatsoever <#\>Um<,,>  I
thought it was just in front of me  but I was spending lunch
with them once  'cause I was walking past and <@>Forename10</@> 
goes  oh come come come  come spend lunch with us and um
 <$A> <#\>Was this recently
 <$B> <#\>About<,>  that was on my I'm gonna defer bit
 <$A> <#\>A month ago
 <$B> <#\>Hmm <,,> <#\>Anyway in the middle of it I turned my
head quickly to the other side for a second cause I was
sitting on the floor and they were sitting on the bench  turn
back  she's rubbin' her fucking finger down his fucking nose
 <$A> <#\>Hmm
 <$B> <#\>Sort of like <,,> in front of me  I mean in front of
anyone
 <$A> <#\>Hm
 <$B> <#\>I almost choked<,> <#\>Anyway  I thought it was me 
trying to show off or something
 <$A> <#\>Mmm
 <$B> <#\>But when <@>Forename6</@> was with them a after
<@>Forename3</@> 's wedding she went back with them to <O>inaudible</O>
 <$A> <#\>Most couples are like that though <@>forenameB</@> 
 <$B> <#\>Not in front of people
 <$A> <#\>Depends where they are
 <$B> <#\>Well not not the type of people that I  it's not a
type of people <O>inaudible 16 syllables</O> it's not the type of
people that I know <#\>I mean you know <#\>If everyone around you
is
<,,>getting on to each other and you're in that environment 
if you are holding conversation with one other person
 <$A> <#\>Mm 
 <$B> <#\>and there's three of you well then you do not go off
and do the things in front of that person while they're
standing talking to you  that's just down right rude
 <$A> <#\>Mmm
 <$B> <#\>First of all it doesn't make the other person feel
comfortable  second of all it doesn't make the person feel
that they want to be there because maybe the couple the couple
wants to be off on by themselves <#\>I mean you know and then you
don't know what to say  you don't know what to do because you
can't even join in or  there is nothing for you to do but
stand there and just like a dick
 <$A> <#\>What did you do
 <$B> <#\>Nothing <#\>I just brought up some conversation but the
funny thing is <@>Forename6</@> was telling me that <O>cough</O> she was
at her <@>Forename9</@> 's house  after the wedding  'cause
<@>Forename9</@> 's mum was gonna drive <@>Forename6</@> home
 <$A> <#\>Mmm
 <$B> <#\>and <@>Forename9</@> 's parents were there and
<@>Forename6</@> was there and <@>Forename9</@> 's just caressing
<@>Forename10</@> 's face with her hand dadada in front of her
parents and her legs were flying all over each other  and
that's fine
 <$A> <#\>In front of whose parents <#\><@>Forename6</@> 's
 <$B> <#\><@>Forename9</@> <#\><@>Forename9</@> 's parents
 <$A> <#\>Oh
 <$B> <#\>But
 <$A> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[><@>Forename6</@></[></{> just sitting there she's in the
middle of talking to them
 <$A> <#\>Mmm
 <$B> <#\>and <@>Forename9</@> just. <#\>I don't know how
<@>Forename10</@> sort of goes in for that sort of thing but
<@>Forename9</@> 's <{><[><O>inaudible 2 words</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>What</[> </{>
<$B> <#\>I know but he knows that it's not socially sort of
acceptable  in my books <#\><@>Forename9</@> just has absolutely no
<#\>And it's not that he does it to her <#\>He does things but
he
doesn't do it  I mean  you know  usually he's talking to you
and he's holding her arm or rubbing up her leg or something
like that
 <$A> <#\>Mm <#\>Yeah
 <$B> <#\>But  she takes it even further <#\>Like if you're
talking to someone and looking at their face  now if you're
touching their face  then you can't talk to them <#\>There's
nowhere else for you to look <#\>I mean it's just  you know  she
a  thinks that she's being so<,,> I don't know  so
experienced and sort of uninhibited or whatever but  the point
that that she's trying to make is
 <$A> <#\>I don't think she's making any point
 <$B> <#\>That's right <#\>But the point she's making is that
she's so socially inept <#\>I mean it's just  i it's not  the way
in this society  as far as I'm concerned  it's not the way it
done <#\>And if it is  then I'm not friends with such people
because that's not the way I think you you interact with
people  because you don't want that <{><[>sort of <O>inaudible 3
words</O></[> 
 <$A> <#\><[>Depends on the environment</[> </{><#\>It's just that it's
<{><[><O>inaudible 5 words</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Well wha what environment</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Like I said it depends on where you are and the type
of people you're with and<,>  I mean<,,> <#\>I don't think it
requires um<,,> <#\>What you sort of think that the face area
only
can't be touched and the rest can
 <$B> <#\>No I don't that at all actually <#\>I mean  depends on
how <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>are they allowed to hold hands</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>Yeah but it depends  like if they give you to
<O>inaudible</O> they want to go off into a corner 
 <$A> <#\>Mm
 <$B> <#\>Then go off into a corner but don't do it
continuously in front of someone else to make them feel as
though they don't want to be there
 <$A> <#\>Well maybe she's trying to show that she's
experienced because she knows that at a certain stage you knew
she wasn't <#\>I mean  when <@>Forename11</@> and her boyfriend are
together 
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>they hold hands and when you're you're you you've
turned round or something they'll go round and look and give
each other a kiss or something or  joke
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>But  you know  you always  <O>inaudible</O> like that and
<O>inaudible</O> he'll give you a wink or like you know <#\>It's sort
of  the socially accepted we standard of what's allowed in
public <#\>Like kissing  holding hands  playing <O>inaudible</O> slap
on the bum or something like that
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>But not anything major  you know
 <$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
 <$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> That's what I think <#\>When <@>Forename12</@> 
and <@>Forename13</@> were in Paris  he was walking around all the
time with his arm around her <#\>That didn't bother me 
 <$B> <#\>What I'm just trying to find out what the stage that
bothers you  that's all I'm saying  because all this holding
hands  kissing and whispering  
 <$A> <#\>What bothers me
 <$B> <#\>that's normal
 <$A> <#\>It's not <#\>What bothers me is if you're talking to
them and you can't because they're engrossed in each other
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>And not in a way that <O>inaudible</O> <#\>You could  at a
certain part  contribute or you could listen or  like you
would in another situation <#\>But when there is absolutely no
role for you to play 
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>and not even a listening role 
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>that's what I'm  that's what bothers me <#\>I think
it's rude and socially inadequate <#\>It's just like  it's just
not on <#\>It's just not not the right way to behave <#\>Not
taking
other people into into consideration
 <$B> <#\>Mmm
 <$A> <#\>And not when  especially when there's just three of
you <#\>I was just saying when <@>Forename14</@> 
 <$B> <#\>Is she still friends with <@>Forename2</@> and
 <$A> <#\>Na
 <$B> <#\>Is she friends with anyone
 <$A> <#\>Na
 <$B> <#\><@>Forename15</@> 
 <$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> Um  when  I was just <O>inaudible 6
words</O> in Paris  they used to be all over each other
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>And um  and a couple of times they were getting with
each other and whatever  but that was with other people around
me  whatever  and  you know  I I or <@>Forename 12</@> had someone
to talk to 
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>It wasn't that made me feel comfortable  I mean and
<@>Forename12</@> was even being  actually I was talking to
<@>Forename13</@>  and he said <@>Forename16</@> go away  that's in
the middle of of his speech
 <$B> <#\>Oh yeah  yeah
 <$A> <#\>And like  and she told him <#\>She said look you know 
you just don't do that to people
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>It's just not the way you behave <#\>You know <#\>And
that's just what I think and so  you know <#\>The fact that she'd
take it to such extremes  to me shows that she's trying to be
something she's not  trying to be something that's not natural
for her <#\>And she doesn't  it's not socially  well  'cause
she's not  she doesn't know how to behave
 <$B> <#\>I don't think she  it's an act that she's doing <#\>I
think that that's the norm for her 
 <$A> <#\>Yeah
 <$B> <#\>Why would she  you know  purposely sit there and do
this
in front of someone <{><[>else</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Because</[></{> as far as I see it you don't normally do
such things <#\><O>inaudible</O> you know  you don't normally run your
finger down his nose in front of someone else who <O>inaudible</O>
any person sitting there in front of you
 <$B> <#\>Mm
 <$A> <#\>Like it's just  you know  you you <{><[>do it if you
were</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Not acceptable</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>You do it if<,,>  you know you if if you were
showing <O>inaudible</O> not interested in anything else <O>inaudible
2 syll</O> sitting next to you <#\>And you just have to hint  well
then it's a very good hint <,,>
 <$B> <#\>But you don't talk to her properly about these
things any more</I>
