up arguing 
<$B> <#\>Oh well <,,> <#\>These things also happen
<$A> <#\>Mmm oh well <w>'cause</w> like <,> my father he gets
bored during the day and just <#\>He wanders around the house
calling my mum <#\><{1><[1>He's like a</[1> puppy
calling for just like a little kid calling their
mum and he follows her around the house <{2><[2><,></[2>

<$B> <#\>Yeah I mean like <,> all tension's over right
<$A> <#\>Oh yeah yeah 
<$B> <#\>That's good 
<$A> <#\>Yeah oh except for my parents but <,> that's going to
take a bit of time 
<$B> <#\>Well that takes time to adjust <#\>All parents are
pretty iffy about new boyfriends though 
<$A> <#\>Yeah true <,> <#\>Like they've reacted a bit <,>
whenever it was that way <,> <#\>I think it was Wednesday
night <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> was a bit
<O>inaudible</O> and he got a bit annoyed
<$B> <#\><[>Oh yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Oh never mind <#\>You're gonna do that every now and
then haven't you
<$A> <#\>Yeah <,> yeah <,> just to let them know I'm still
around <O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>Yes <,> I'm just trying to keep mine well and truly
out of the whole scenario
<$A> <#\>Yeah 
<$B> <#\>They don't know <O>inaudible</O> and they know pretty much
nothing about what's going on
<$A> <#\> But even if like I try  not
to tell my parents anything but <,> and they <,> like it was 
fine until my mum came back and now she goes and she's really
nosey <#\>She's asking me all these questions <quote>what's
going on</quote> blah blah blah I've heard all these
stories <,> <#\>Ah it just gets really annoying
<$B> <#\>Mmm mmm <,>
<$A> <#\>Like I stood up to her this morning <#\>I said
<quote>oh look it's none of your business stop it <#\>Stop
jumping to conclusions</quote> <,> <#\>She got a bit upset
about it but <,> she's a bit touchy <#\>She's too touchy <,,>
<$B> <#\>Oh yeah <,> mothers just tend to like to know what's
going on especially seeing like they think <,> and often they
think really hard and jump too far <{><[>and</[> sometimes
 they they  are concerned that they are
jumping too far 
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah 
<$A> <#\>I mean I don't know <,> <#\>Mum's been really good
with me <,> <#\>It'll be interesting to see what happens in a
couple of months time though <,> <w>'cause</w> like um <,> let
me see now we're  finally talking to <@>forename3</@> <{1><[1>o
k</[1> <#\>That's nice except I'm still having a few problems
<,> handling  the the  idea that one I'm
never going to get him back again and two there's another girl
on the scene in his sphere <{2><[2><,></[2> and I don't know
who she is <#\>Apparently  but he he's  been
asked to her formal <{3><[3><,></[3> and he doesn't want to go
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Really</[3></{3>
     <#\>He doesn't want to <,>
<$A> <#\>Yeah and <,> from what <@>forename4</@> was saying I heard
 he is he is  actually attracted to her
though but he just hates formals 
<$B> <#\>Oh right <,>
<$A> <#\>And  that that yeah that 
one's hard to handle <O>laughter</O> <#\>Then there's this
sort of like vague attraction to some one at church which I'm
gonna have to put a stop to <{1><[1><,></[1> and then there's
also <@>forename4</@> 's just broken up with <@>forename5</@> <#\><{2><[2>He</[2>
actually broke up on Wednesday night <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>Yeah
well the <quote>oh dear</quote> is even bigger <@>forenameA</@> 
<{4><[4><,></[4> <#\>Apart form the fact that the situation
with him and <@>forename5</@> was very much like me and <@>forename3</@> <,>
<@>forename4</@> wants me back
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Really</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Oh dear</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4>
     <#\>Really
<$A> <#\>Yeah <,,> and it's not like I'm adverse to the idea
<#\>It's just <,> well you know that could cause a lot of
trouble <,> and I don't want <@>forename5</@> hating me
<$B> <#\>Yeah <,,>
<$A> <#\>So  I I've  got myself into a nice
little fix <,> and like I didn't discourage him either which
was <#\>We got ourselves into a sort of a situation <#\>You
know what I mean <{1><[1><,></[1> and um oh god <@>forename3</@> was
driving past and he actually saw us <w>'cause</w> we were in
the car <,> <{2><[2><w>'cause</w></[2> we went to Manly on
Tuesday <{3><[3><,></[3> and the situation got a little out of
hand then <{4><[4>but</[4> then it got back into control
<O>laughter</O> <#\>We got back and sort of saying good bye
and all that and then <@>forename3</@> drove past with <@>forename5</@> <,> and
he had to go past twice <w>'cause</w> he saw us both times
<{5><[5><O>laughter</O></[5> <#\>Hopefully <@>forename5</@> didn't see
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Oh no</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Oh no</[5></{5>
     <#\> What do  you reckon that's the
reason why they broke up 
<$A> <#\>No <,> it's not the reason no <#\>Um apparently the
situation's just like  and I can see that how it means
like <@>forename3</@> and I  <,> <#\>Um ask either person
how long it's been since you've had fun <,> together
<{1><[1><,></[1> and the person sits there <quote>ummm I know
there's a time <#\>I know <#\>Just hang on hang on <#\>I'll
think of it</quote> and you can't think of anything at least
within the last <,> four months three or four months you know
<,> <#\>That's what it was like <#\>That was like it was like
with us <,> and with <@>forename4</@> and <@>forename5</@> <,,> but I mean I
still  real feel  really uncomfortable that
he wants me back <{2><[2><,></[2> with the <@>forename5</@> situation
<#\>No well <{3><[3>I</[3> <,,> dunno <,> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Do you</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\>Well maybe you should just  let things let
him  <,> think about what he's doing first <,>
<$A> <#\> He I'm  not going into anything
before the exams <,,> <#\>This whole thing can wait till
December 
<$B> <#\>Mmm <,>
<$A> <#\>But it oh 
<$B> <#\>You never know what your birthday present could be
<O>laughter</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>Where are you at the moment <#\>Are you at uni
<$A> <#\>Now um I'm in an office <,> in W six A and it's top
floor <,> and it's looking over the carpark near the front
gate
<$B> <#\>What a view 
<$A> <#\>It's actually not bad <w>'cause</w> there're all
these trees and you can see all the houses and you can see all
these people moving in and out of the carpark <#\>You can see
Epping Road
<$B> <#\>Really oh right
<$A> <#\>It's not a bad view <#\>I mean  it's not <,>
it's better  on the other side of the building
<w>'cause</w> then you can see over the park and the grounds
but <,> it's not bad <,,> <#\>I mean it's not wonderfully
interesting <,,> <#\>No I can't see anything of interest <,,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah um <@>forename6</@> called me last night
<$A> <#\>Did he <#\>I haven't seen him  for since  Monday
<$B> <#\><w>'Cause</w>  he um he  won
tickets to go to see Caligula <{1><[1>at</[1> <,> a nightclub
or something <,> and like  it didn't it
doesn't  still midnight and  he he 
rang up and asked me if I wanted to go <,> which is really
stupid because he knows I can't go out <w>'cause</w> I've got
exams <,> <#\>I was a bit annoyed that he did that <,> but um
<,> I was his third choice by the way <#\><{2><[2>He was</[2> 
going to take <@>forename7</@> but <@>forename7</@> um <,> sort of fainted <,> in
lectures um on Tuesday or something so she's not very well
<{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>And so then he asked <@>forename8</@> <,> which
annoyed me <O>laughter</O> but well I just got off the phone
to <@>forename8</@> then <{4><[4><,></[4> like <O>inaudible</O> but
we're all trying to study and he's trying to drag everyone out

<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Were you</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmhmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmhmm</[4></{4>
     <#\>Mmm mmm yeah I know <#\>Oh he's just trying to do
something with himself <#\> I I  told him to
go down to the <#\>Oh no I didn't <#\>I told <@>forename3</@> that
<#\>He's gotta go down to the careers service and look up the
<,> folder and get himself a job <#\>Do what I'm doing and
spend hours on the phone trying to organise job interviews 
<$B> <#\> Does he does he get has have you  got a job
<$A> <#\>No not yet 
<$B> <#\>Didn't you get that waitressing one
<$A> <#\>No <,,> no I'm just <,> still trying 
<$B> <#\>I have to pay nine hundred and forty dollars for the
privilege of <,> getting a job <O>laughter</O> <#\>Going all
the way up to Queensland <,>
<$A> <#\>Well it's more than just a job though <#\>It's like a
holiday for you
<$B> <#\>Yeah true <,>
<$A> <#\>But <{><[>I mean go</[>
<$B> <#\><[>See mum and I</[></{> were working out this
morning trying to work out how much money I'd earn <,> <#\>So
if I was working like about forty hours a week and I'll be up
there for about six weeks <,> at ah seven dollars an hour I'll
be getting like <,> um almost two thousand dollars <,,>
<$A> <#\>Oh that's good <#\>You can pay for your own airfare
<$B> <#\>Yeah then mmm um I'll have for my air fare and still
have money left over <,> <#\>I thought that was pretty good 
<$A> <#\>Mmm <,> god and  you could also have the
leftover money  would be just enough to cover transport
for first semester <,> <#\>No actually for the whole year <,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah  and or  <{><[>I could pay
my uni fees</[> myself and stuff <,>
<$A> <#\><[>Just I think</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>But then there goes all my <,> spending money 
<$A> <#\>Oh no <#\>I mean I was only kidding I don't expect
<O>laughter</O> <#\>I wouldn't either but I mean it's a good
way of working out how much money it means how much it means
<{1><[1>you</[1> know by working out how much travel you've
got <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>The more travel you've got the more
 it the money  means the more amount of
money it is <#\> It er but it it it just  oh
<,> means more <,> if you work it out in material terms rather
than dollars and cents
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\>Yeah <,>
<$A> <#\>But um
<$B> <#\>So that's good <,,> <#\> Like like 
a thousand dollars is one third of <@>forename4</@> 's car <,> <#\>I sort of
think wow <,> in a few years I could maybe buy a car myself
<O>laughter</O> <#\> Like if I  like <,>
after I come back <,>  I'll probably have I'll
have  more experience and then maybe hopefully I'll be
able to get a job in Sydney 
<$A> <#\>Yeah <,> yeah and then buy a car and out-car him
<#\>Gees I'd love to do that to <@>forename3</@> 
<$B> <#\>No  I'd I  don't really want to do
that <w>'cause</w> like we've got so many cars at home</I>
