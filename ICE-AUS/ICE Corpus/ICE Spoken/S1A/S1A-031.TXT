<I><$A> <#\>Oh don't do that <O>laughs</O>

<$B> <#\>Oh <#\>That's right
<$B> <#\>He gives this little
<$C> <#\>There's a guy that uh he gets everyone's um scores and
things off the tennis news and puts them into a little computer
and uh works out who's coming where and what their chances and
and then he'll let you know when you see him <{><[><,></[> or play him

haven't yet learned that uh that<,> you can lose and it's okay
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <O>laughs</O>
<$C> <#\>I think they get very stroppy
<$A> <#\>Yeah

convincingly <#\>And then the guy that was playing with this girl
said <quote>Oh wouldn't it be funny if we lost this set six
two</quote> <#\>Anyway they started mucking round and hitting all
the balls everywhere <O>inaudible</O> lost six two
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm
<$B> <#\>And the girl wouldn't talk to him for three weeks<,>
after that because of that
<$D> <#\>Oh
<$B> <#\>And apparently whenever he rang her up just to sort of
explain the situation she got her husband to tell him that uh
 she was in the bathroom
<$C?> <#\>She was in the bath 'cos she wouldn't talk to him
and stuff 
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\><?>Oh</?>
<$B> <#\>she didn't wanna talk to him <O>inaudible</O> losing one
set 
<$A> <#\>And they were all on the same team they were team-mates
<$B> <#\>yeah well at the time
<$C> <#\>There's so many <O>inaudible</O> guys <O>inaudible</O>
<#\><O>inaudible</O> but I find more with some of the guys they
uh tell the girls what to do all the time
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>And it just is really and the poor girls don't uh get
to enjoy the game these guys tell them <quote>Don't hit it
that way</quote> <{1><[1><,></[1> or <quote>Miss that one <#\>Leave that

<$C> <#\>Huh <#\>Out the great social game of you know tennis and
it uh
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>I mean it is competitive but you're s'posed to enjoy it
as well and <{><[><,></[> <#\>we don't get upset really um if we lose
out so uh 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$C> <#\>We've had our exercise for the week and uh a bit of a
laugh and <O>laughs</O> 
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$D> <#\>Had a packet of cigarettes
<O>laughter</O>
<$A?> <#\>Wonderful  <#\>Is That why you're playing <#\><?>No</?>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$D> <#\>No but soon as they come off
<O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>Having played <O>inaudible</O>
<O>laughter</O>
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$D> <#\>No he was telling me jokes about how y- you used to play
with a tinnie in one hand and a cigarette
<$C> <#\>Oh
<$D> <#\>'T's a bit hard serving apparently
<$B> <#\>That was only one social game up at Pennant Hills one
day<,,> <#\>But um
<$C> <O>laughs</O> <#\>Oh they thought you brought the beers
along <#\>Someone brought the beers along
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$D> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>We bought a case of beers <#\>We had to climb over the
f- <#\>It was quite incredible the way we got the case of beers
over the fence <#\>It was all locked off
<$C?> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Climbed over the top and got the the beers through and
all the rest of it <#\>And they're playing tennis with a with a
beer in one hand and a cigarette<,> throwing them up beer all
over the place<,> it was pretty
<$D?> <O>laughs</O>
<$B> <#\>But that was when I was very young
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> it was a long time ago
<$D> <#\>Or when you were young
<$B> <#\><?>Er</?> <#\>Don't do that any more
<$D> <#\>After that they moved to El Rancho's in between sets
<$B> <#\>That's right
<$C?> <#\>They'd race off to El Rancho's <O>inaudible</O> close
<$A> <#\><?>No</?>
<$B> <O>laughs</O>
<$C?> <#\>But they'd never make it back in time would they for
the next set
<$B> <#\>And we always thought we would
<$C?> <#\>So we'd be left standing there trying to explain to the
other team
<O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O> the shout system you know <#\>Sort of
uh you gotta you gotta <?>s- buy him somebody else a beer
back</?> <#\>before you can leave
<$D> <#\>Oh
<$C> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>What about like um poor sportsmanship
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>You know dirty tricks on the court <#\>Which team's the
worst
<$B> <#\>It's difficult to say
<$A> <#\>Does it happen much
<$B> <#\>Oh it does happen a lot <#\>but it a lot of trying to
sort of like you know you call the close ones out <#\>and you say
that they're<,> totally corrupt or something
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$?> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>I remember this team we played a couple of comps ago
<#\>you know the<,> team the- these guys and they used to flog
us <#\>We got to the final against them or something<,> that team
<#\>um it's hard to describe
<$C> <#\>Oh yeah
<$B> <#\>Like the total
<$C> <#\>The younger team
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>They were down at Pennant Hills one one
<O>inaudible</O>
<$C> <#\>Mmm
<$?> <#\>Yeah <O>inaudible</O> reckon
<$B> <#\>They They were really bad <#\>They used to really really
dodgy balls and all the rest of it and <#\>They had one girl who
she used to swear<,> swear heaps and heaps and heaps and they
actually got warned about it
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>And uh
<$C> <#\>Oh she's got a filthy mouth on her
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Oh yeah <#\>It's incredible
<$C> <#\>We got sick of hearing it 'cos her voice was really loud
and it just carried across all the courts <#\>And they'd be F
this or F that <#\>Then they'd be running round having water
fights and screaming their head off <{><[><,></[> with music in the
background
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$?> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>But they got an easy shot at the net they'd blame the
person at the net <#\>Apparently they played one team who was I
think it was the team coming last and this other team was coming
first <#\>And apparently they hit they hit this team you know<,>
twelve times or something <#\>I was counting <#\>And they played
badly as well
<$C> <#\>Oh I didn't hear about that
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Yeah <#\>so I just
<$?> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>The team who played last week that was the team that
apparently got hit twelve times
<$C> <#\>Oh yeah
<$A> <#\>Twelve times in one day
<$B> <#\>Yeah one day yeah <#\>Girls guys the whole lot
<$A> <#\>They didn't discriminate about who they hit
<$B> <#\>Oh I think they were more more keen to get the guys but
<$D?> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>But They wouldn't mind if it someone else so long as it
made a target of someone
<$D?> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>They had at one point last week one of the guys did
something <#\>He whinged about something didn't he a point
something a call
<$B> <#\>Oh that's right
<$C> <#\>And next thing you look out the window and here's the
two blokes cos it was a men's set two  Our two guys whatever the
court leaned against the fence and the other two down here
leaning against the fence <#\>They were not talking <#\>They were
not playing <#\>And we said <quote>What's going on</quote>
you know <quote>guys</quote> <#\>So finally after five minutes
they got their act together and got back on and played
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>Yeah <#\>What it had just gotten out of control
so they they just <O>inaudible</O>
<$?> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>'Cos they weren't at fault <#\>The other team weren't
willing to give in on the call <#\>And I think he was just huffy
about something <#\>I don't know what it was 
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>But uh I just decided I won't ask questions <#\>you see 
the teams are so close and they'd think
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>You know you don't want to be bitching
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm
<$C> <#\>Cos You just <O>inaudible</O>
<$D> <#\><O>inaudible</O> <#\><O>inaudible</O> Wednesday night
<O>inaudible</O> <#\>The biggest difference I found was the
social aspect <#\>Like this is only four players like two oh four
each team <#\>It's Like everybody <#\>Like you know how
<O>inaudible</O> they'd introduce themself
<$A?> <#\>Yeah
<$D> <#\>That's exactly what happens before you go on the court
<#\>people always so chatty and so fas different <O>inaudible</O>
we're always  <#\>It's always like segregated
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Oh no <#\>That's
<$D> <#\>And I found it really hard <{><[><,></[> to sort of be really
<,,> <quote>oh hi</quote> you know
<O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\><[>yeah</[></{>
