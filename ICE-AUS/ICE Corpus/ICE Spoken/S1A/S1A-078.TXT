at <@>forename1</@> because he said <quote>oh thanks <@>forename2</@> </quote> because

and do you think I had like  my um ten dollars
worth of fif twenty  cent pieces and fifty

smiled at him because he was flirting with her <#\>She
couldn't she wouldn't  have a bar of me

face like I'm just doing this to pay you out <#\>And I said oh

breaks
<$A> <#\><[>I</[> </{>
     <#\>Oh yum <#\>Well I went home on the weekend with all
these intentions of getting my essay done <#\>Do you think I
did hardly anything?
<$B> <#\>Yeah that was surprising <#\>You usually do lots of
works when you go home
<$A> <#\>I know but I just did nothing <,,> <O>inaudible seven
syllables</O>
<$B> <#\>See the trouble is I'll go home and there'll be so
much going on <{1><[1><,></[1>even without even like on Friday
and Monday when eveyone's at school <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>So
I'll just have to be good
<$A> <#\><[1>mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\>See not much happens in our house because there's
only <,> four of us <,> <#\>But see there was a lot happening
on the weekend <,> <#\>Like not happening but just going
shopping <,> <#\>Because if Mum went shopping on  um
 if Mum went shopping on  <,> Friday? <#\>Was it
Friday? <#\>Anyway my grandmother's brother my
grandmother's got three brothers  <{1><[1><,></[1> and
um one is my ah Uncle Arthur down in Wollongong called Uncle
<@>forename3</@> and the other two they're <#\><@>forename4</@> went overseas with
one of them <{2><[2>a</[2> couple of years ago and they're
really sort of I don't know weird like not weird but really
<,> oh not very nice sort of thing? <{3><[3><,></[3>
<#\>Anyway so this one that my this one Uncle
<@>forename5</@>  he lives in um <,,> <#\>Oh my goodness he lives
everywhere <#\>He buys all these different <#\>He he's  always moving around <{4><[4>and</[4> um he's
just a real sort of bragger like his daughter's in public
relations and she went the big story  was
that she'd gone on <O>inaudible three syllables</O> p r to the
king of Morocco and then as we find out she's working like I
don't know not the king of Morocco <{5><[5>anyway</[5> <#\>And
then the big story was that she's on five acres at Bowral next
to Jimmy Barnes and do you think she's on the other side of
Bowral on one acre <#\>And you know that's just the type of
person that he's like <{6><[6>and</[6> like when my great
grandmother died he just <,,> <#\>And the other one got
married on the same day <{7><[7>and so</[7> you know you what
they're like anyway <#\>So Mum's just shopping around in
Campbelltown and do you think she runs straight into them and
like <,> <#\>You know she said if she'd pushed her trolley any
further she would have knocked Uncle <@>forename5</@> right
<{8><[8>over</[8> and he just just  looked
at her and kept going just did not speak to her at <{9><[9>all
and I</[9> mean Mum was surprised <#\>I mean Who she's the last person they're the last  people she'd
expect to see in <{10><[10>Campbelltown</[10> <#\>But I mean
they they  would've realised like you can't
give them the same excuse <w>'cause</w> they would've
<{11><[11>realised</[11> being in Campbelltown that there was
a fair of a chance that they might run into
<{12><[12>Mum</[12> <#\>And so he just walked right past them
<#\>By the time Mum's realised what's going on he's like way
over the other side of the mall <,> and so that was the big
talking point over the weekend <{13><[13><,,></[13> <#\>I just
can't believe it <,,> <#\>I mean it's a really weird family
that one <O>inaudible</O> <,,> <#\>Yeah that was that was  the big talking point of the weekend 
<$B> <#\><[1>mmhmm</[1></{1>

     <#\><[6>Yeah</[6></{6>
     <#\><[7>Oh my gosh</[7></{7>
     <#\><[8>Yeah</[8></{8>

     <#\><[11>Yeah</[11></{11>
     <#\><[12>Yeah</[12></{12>
     <#\><[13>Oh my gosh</[13></{13>
     <#\>Well no wonder you didn't get any work done
<$A> <#\>Oh well<#\>No Mum did a lot of cooking and like we went we went  to that shop again <#\>Mum's Mum's  always trying all these different
cappuccino makers because she just likes to make them at home
<#\>She keeps trying all these different ones and and  none of them work <{><[>and apparently</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Are they like</[></{> the powdered ones
<{><[>or</[>
<$A> <#\><[>No</[></{> like the little machines
<{1><[1>that make the froth</[1> and um so we're over at
Macarthur Square having a cappuccino and um Mum said
<w>'cause</w> apparently there's a new one out a black and
decker frothy or something and <{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2> she's
been looking for it everywhere and um she  um <,>
 we  were sitting down having a cappuccino and she
goes <quote>ok let's go and have a look in David Jones and if
there's one there I'll buy it</quote> <#\>And so do you think
there's one there <O>inaudible laughter</O> 
<$B> <#\><[1>Oh right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mr Frothy</[2></{2> <O>laughter</O>
     <#\>It's like you with <quote>if I find a skirt I like
I'm going to buy it</quote> 
<$A> <#\>Oh well I'd better buy it but she didn't <#\>She said
<quote>no I can't i can't</quote>
<$B> <#\>Oh really?
<$A> <#\>She said <quote>if I see it next time I come I'll buy
it</quote>
<$B> <#\>We tried to convince Mum to get a cappuccino maker
but she said <quote>oh can you believe it? You'd <O>inaudible
four syllables</O> all the time</quote>
<$A> <#\>Oh that's true <#\>It'd be good to have but
<$B> <#\>Mmm it'd be unreal <#\>What did your mother buy that
wool for?
<$A> <#\>Oh she's knitting <@>forename6</@> a jumper <{><[><,></[>
<#\>Two actually <#\>She bought this really nice red and this
really nice green and <@>forename6</@> said <quote>yep I'll have a
jumper out of each of those thanks</quote>
<$B> <#\><[>Oh right</[></{>
     <#\>Cool
<$A> <#\>So and like they were on special reduced from about
five dollars a ball to one dollar <{><[>something</[> so
each of the jumpers will cost about fifty eight dollars I
think <,>
<$B> <#\><[>Awesome</[></{>
     <#\>It's not bad <#\>I mean to get a decent jumper in a
shop it's more than that
<$A> <#\>Yeah and I mean they're full on pure wool and stuff
so <,,> <#\>So what're you going to do while you're at home?
<$B> <#\>Study <O>laughter</O> <#\>I don't know <#\>I think
I'll go and see if <O>inaudible four syllables</O> <#\>I don't

Saturday night

<$B> <#\>Her name's <@>forename8</@> <,> and I've been at school with her
since primary school <,> and we used to be quite friendly even
though she annoyed me <,> but when I was is year eleven
<#\>She's the type of girl who just thinks she knows
everything <{1><[1><,></[1> and she's always telling you what
to do and stuff and um I didn't get my P's until don't know
April after I'd turned seventeen <{2><[2>so</[2> I was late

traumatised and I hated driving and all this stuff so I
must've said ah you know <quote>don't know if I'll bother even
getting them</quote> <#\>And well did she rip into me and have
the hide to say <quote>how can you not get your P's? <#\>How
can you expect your mother to drive you everywhere</quote>

the she said <quote>you can't get by without a licence
<#\>It's a necessity in today's world</quote> <#\>And I just
went <O>laughter</O> <#\>And I just snapped at her <#\>I
didn't even really snap at her <#\>I just said back to her
<quote><@>forename8</@> if whether I get my licence or not is my business
and how dare you</quote> <#\>And I just said <quote>and you
don't have the right to tell me that I should get my licence
because I could help out my mother</quote> <#\>And I just  <,>  and I said
