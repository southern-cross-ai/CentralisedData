<I><$A><#\>No<,> no I'm just um<,> kind of curious about this
ah<,> jury duty that you did
<$B> <#\>Are you
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> yeah<{><[> and I'm</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>The deeply</[></{> distressing ah experience I
have to as<{><[>sure you</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Oh was it</[> </{> <{><[>oh dear</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Not one</[></{> that I would willingly ah undergo
again
<$A> <#\>No no <#\>Is it one that you'll willingly<,> talk
about
<$B> <#\>Oh yes <#\>Happy to talk about it
<$A> <#\>Oh good <{><[>oh good</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>It was very</[> </{> interesting actually <#\>The
other day um one of them <,> rang me
<$A> <#\>Mmm  <#\>One of the other jurors
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Yes yes one who<,> actually<,,> I'm sure found the
whole thing even more distressing than me<{><[><,></[>
<$A> <#\><[>Really</[></{>
<$B> <#\>But um his his er commercial needs overcame his uh
<O>inaud 2 syll</O> his reluctance<{><[><,></[>
<$A> <#\><[>Oh I see</[></{>
<$B> <#\>He tried to involve me in his network marketing<,>
<$A> <O>laughing</O> <#\>oh no
<$B> <O>laugh</O>
<$A> <#\>Oh yuk<,> <#\>Oh dear<,> <#\>So what kind of a case
was it
<$B> <#\>It was a <,> criminal case in which a<,> a<,>
young<,> fellow was accused of<,> um being the driver
<{1><[1><,></[1> in a crime where people arrived at uh <,,> a
house in the middle of the night <{2><[2> and</[2> broke in
and<{3><[3> hit some</[3> lady over the head and stole her um
rings
<$A> <#\><[1>Mm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>mm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\>Oh dear<,> <#\>Yeah well that is a nasty kind a case
isn't it
<$B> <#\>It was very nasty <{1><[1>and</[1> nobody actually
was you know <,> oh well they they an older lady was er<,>
hurt on the forehead <{2><[2><,></[2> hit on the forehead with
<,> we don't know what <#\>It was could have been a
<{3><[3>machete</[3>
<$A> <#\><[1>mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
     <#\><[3>Err ooh</[3> </{3>
<$B> <#\>It could have been a<,,> some other instrument
<$A> <#\>Yeah a blunt instrument or a <{1><[1>sharp one</[1>
<$B> <#\><[1>Could've been</[1></{1> could've been but it
looked like a sharp instrument
<$A> <#\>Right oh yuk
<$B> <#\>It was all it was one level it was really interesting
because it was like ah one of those Agatha Christie things
<{1><[1>where you've got all</[1> these rings and you're
trying to work out which ring could belong to
whom<{2><[2><,></[2> cos there was all this dispute
and in fact the lady<,> who had these rings taken from her<,>
<{3><[3><,></[3>had about fifty of them you know she was of <,,> a a
western su suburbs lady who um<,> who seemed to be<,> inclined
to amass large amounts of sometimes cheap rings <{4><[4><,></[4>
and uh<,> you know<,> seems to have got them possibly<,> by
dubious means in any case
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh yes</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Oo-wah</[4></{4>
     <#\>Oh I see right <O>laughing</O>
<$B> <#\>She didn't have receipts or anything <{1><[1>like
that</[1> <#\>They weren't on the insurance um<,> listings
<{2><[2>and so on</[2> and<,> and so you were never quite
sure<,> because she had possibly her own <,,> story to tell
<{3><[3><,> <#\>Basically</[3> it was a case of everybody is
obviously<,> telling little fibs <{4><[4><,> and</[4> this
included our our beloved er <,> constables <{5><[5>and the
mayor</[5>
<$A> <#\><[1>Err</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Ohh</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>I see yes</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Oh no</[5></{5>
     <#\>Yeah why were they telling fibs <{><[><,></[>
<#\>Yes <#\>What would they have to cover up
<$B> <#\><[>Constabulary</[></{>
     <#\>Well <,,> the<,> it was<,> quite likely that during
the interview um<,> they'd<,,> beat this guy round the head a
bit <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Actually he was a young<,> a young fella
<{2><[2><,></[2> and um<,> I I have no doubt<,> in my mind that
they<,> probably <,,> were seeking his aid in uh<,> in
explaining who else was involved and <{3><[3>so on</[3> and
<{4><[4><,></[4> their story just sounded like um<,,> <#\>You
know they read it out and and read out bits <{5><[5><,></[5> and
<,> they're supposed to try and do it from memory but then
they're allowed to refer to their notes <{6><[6><,></[6> but um
you know it sounded all a bit too <{7><[7><,></[7> too good to be
true <{8><[8>basically</[8>  
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Really</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>uhuh</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>wow</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Mmm</[5></{5>
     <#\><[6>Right</[6></{6>
     <#\><[7>Mmm</[7></{7>
     <#\><[8>Too glib and yeah</[8></{8> yeah
<$B> <#\><quote>And then we<,> sat him down in a room and gave
him a cup of tea and asked him <{1><[1>please tell us and he
said yes</[1> I did that yes</quote> <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>It's
just a bit er<,> unlikely <{3><[3><,> <#\>So</[3> you had<,>
this lady telling stories and then the police possibly telling
stories and then him obviously <,,> er telling some stories of
his own <{4><[4><,> possibly</[4><,>  and plus his family
telling <,> stories <{5><[5><,></[5> because the they were<,> they
would have us believe that that<,> they went up and checked on
him you know at twelve o'clock at night to make sure he was
okay <{6><[6><,></[6> <#\>eighteen year old <{7><[7><,> boy
and</[7><,> popping their head into the room in which he and
his<,> supposed beloved are<,> are sleeping <#\><{8><[8>And
then</[8> there's all these ex-girlfriends and things
<$A> <#\<[1>Oh yeah so they sat him down and<,> <#\>Oh they
gave</[1></{1>
     <O>laugh</O> <#\><[2>oh boy</[2></{2> 
     <#\><[3>Yes yes</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Mmm mm mm</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Right</[5></{5>
     <#\><[6>Oh yes</[6></{6>
     <#\><[7>That's right <O>laughs</O></[7></{7>
     <#\><[8>Uhuh</[8></{8>
     <#\>Oh no <#\>Golly what a mess
<$B> <#\>Oh it was an incredible mess
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> 
<$B> <#\>But the the most interesting thing about it was<,> um
what it means to to have um<,,> <w>'cos</w> everybody needs to
be in agreement <{1><[1><,></[1> unanimous<,> position
<{2><[2>what</[2> it means for<,> for the jury to be unanimous
<{3><[3><,></[3> and whether that in fact means that everybody in
the jury must<,> be<,,> convinced <{4><[4>of</[4> something or
whether it just means that the<,> as we ended up<,> <#\>I
ended up arguing to people that we were never gonna come to
any sort of agreement <{5><[5><,></[5> where all<,> twelve of us
or whatever it was<,> thought the same  <{6><[6><,></[6> <#\>I ended up kind
of arguing that <,> that<,> all you have to do is agree that
the the jury should speak with one voice <{7><[7><,></[7> and and
um<,> that you can go with a majority decision um<,> but it
just means that <,,> it doesn't mean everyone has to think the
same <#\>You know what I'm saying
<$A> <#\><[1>mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>right</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3> 
     <#\><[4>mmm</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>mmm</[5></{5>
    <#\><[6>mmm</[6></{6>
     <#\><[7>mmm</[7></{7>
     <#\>Yeah yeah
<$B> <#\>so that that you could d-d- I could say well I do
have some doubts but <O>sigh</O> the the the mind of the jury as a
whole <{1><[1><,></[1> is is made up<,> even though I may
personally <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>It's sort of like looking at it as
a collective mind
<$A> <[1>mmhmm</[1></{1>
     <[2>Right</[2></{2> 
     <#\>Yeah yeah <#\>I'm surprised they don't have um a
booklet or something that you know<,> gives you these kinds of
um<,> you know explanations or <{1><[1><,> you know all these
kinds of options</[1>  
<$B> <#\><[1>yeah they actually</[1></{1> work it out when
you're in there and you talk to the um wardens or whatever
they are <{2><[2><,></[2> who give you a few pointers about what
is and what isn't acceptable <{3><[3><,,> but it</[3> was
really<,,> amazingly tense on the last two three days when we
were trying to make up our minds <{4><[4><,></[4> <#\>You're
you're trapped in<,> did you see Joh's Jury
<$A> <#\><[2>Uhuh</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Right uhuh</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Right</[4></{4>
     <#\>Um no I didn't actually no
<$B> <#\>It was <,> uncannily <{><[><,></[> like that 
<$A> <#\><[>Oh</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Oh no <#\>So did you <{><[>have a mole</[>
<$B> <#\><[>If you</[></{> get a chance to see it it's
<{><[>it's</[> very very realistic
<$A> <#\><[>Yes</[></{>
     <#\>Yes did you have a plant in there<,,> that was on the
guy's side like <{><[>one of his relatives</[>
<$B>  <#\><[><O>laugh</O></[></{>  No no there wasn't a
plant although there was one guy 
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>I mean ev everyone's coming from somewhere different 
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>There was one guy <,,> there were a number of people
<,,> who <,,> who we- who who w- w- were convinced of his
um<,,> you know criminal<,> nature <{1><[1><,></[1> regardless of
whether they weren't even interested in whether he'd committed
this crime <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>He's obviously a criminal
<{3><[3><,></[3> and he should go down <{4><[4><,></[4> and and their
arguments are basically<,> there's too much crime in society
and if we let the buggers get away with<,> the things even if
he might be<,> if<,> if<,> even if he might be innocent
<{5><[5><,></[5> if he didn't do this he's done something
<{6><[6>else </[6>
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmhmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Really</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Boy</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Yeah</[5></{5>
     <#\><[6>Oh that's dreadful</[6></{6>
<$B> <#\>so he should go down and so <,,> <#\>I mean I <,,> we
ended up coming up with a guilty verdict 
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>I<,> initially <,,> basically argued<,> when when
when we came to <,> you know considering our verdict I I was
arguing that we<,> that there was doubt <{><[><,></[><,>  
<$A> <#\><[>Mmhmm mmhmm</[></{>
<$B> <#\>And that if there was doubt<,> then we should let him
go <{1><[1><,></[1><,> unless we were convinced and I thought there
was room for doubt in each of the the main points
<{2><[2>of</[2> of argument<,,> <#\>People could've been lying
<$A> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
     <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>But when I could see<,> the best I could get was<,> you
know sort of er seven to five 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>Because these people were just dead set convinced 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>I I took a pragmatic approach 
<$A> <#\><{><[>Yes</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>and</[></{> started arguing in the opposite direction<,,>  
<$A> <#\><O>sigh</O> 
<$B> <#\>I was one of the um<,> I basically led the uh<,> the
swinging voters 
<$A> <#\>Uhuh uhuh
<$B> <#\>And then<,> ended up convincing everyone to to <,> what a
u- unanimous decision might mean 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>rather than hanging the the jury
<$A> <#\>Mmm mmm
<$B> <#\>It'd mean they'd have to go through the whole thing again
<$A> <#\>Yeah  <#\>Gee so you were actually um<,> you were actually
allowed to<,> bring forward a um a verdict without um without
it being a unanimous one is that right
<$B> <#\>No <{><[>our</[> see our verdict was unanimous
<$A> <#\><[>Oh</[></{> 
     <#\>Oh right
<$B> <#\>It just didn't mean that everyone thought the same
<$A> <#\>Right okay
<$B> <#\>Some people had doubt
<$A> <#\>Yep
<$B> <#\>But then you see you can have doubt about anything
<{><[>can't</[> you
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> <#\>It's true
<$B> <#\>What is reasonable <{><[>doubt</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>I know</[></{> I know  <#\>It's true <#\>The story of my life  <#\>I
have doubt about everything
<$B> <#\>Oh exactly <{><[>I mean</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>You can doubt that <,,> if I say I'm <@>Forename1</@> 
<@>Surname1</@>  you can doubt that
<$A> <#\>I can I can
<$B> <#\>But anything that anybody says can be doubted so 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>You know some people would<,> never convict anybody of
anything<,> 
<$A> <#\>Right yes
<$B> <#\>on that basis
<$A> <#\>yes
<$B> <#\>because there's no<,> there's always room for some doubt
<$A> <#\>Mmm mmm
<$B> <#\><{><[>Um</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>You have to look at the<,> the sum the weight of the
evidence
<$A> <#\>Mmhmm
<$B> <#\>And you never<,> and and basically if there wasn't any
doubt <,> it wouldn't come to court in the first place <,>
because the guy would throw up his arms and say okay you got
me
<$A> <#\>Yeah yeah
<$B> <#\>So it's only in the cases I think where there is <,,>
room for doubt that 
<$A> <#\>Mm
<$B> <#\>That you're gonna get it going to court in the first
place
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>So I think reasonable doubt and and no-one<,> inevitably
exactly the same as in Joh's Jury
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>The jury asked the the Judge to tell them what reasonable
doubt was 
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>And he couldn't tell you  <#\>Just as he couldn't tell tell
them in Joh's Jury
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>It was amazing  <#\>It was like living through this
television experience
<$A> <#\>Gee  <#\>That's pretty amazing too
<$B> <#\>And I said to them, he's not going to be able to tell you
this I know because I've seen <{><[>Joh's Jury</[> 
<$A> <#\><[><O>laughing</O>M</[></{> seen the program 
<O>both laugh</O>
<$B> <#\>And he didn't he said I can't tell you
<$A> <#\>Oh
<$B> <#\>I can't tell you what reasonable doubt is  <#\>It's up to
you to work it out
<$A> <#\>Gee
<$B> <#\>So there's not many guidelines <#\>And the other thing is
<,,>
<$A> <#\>Mm
<$B> <#\>That your hands are tied you know
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>You you've got <,> because of what's acceptable and
what's not 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>in as evidence
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>There's probably a whole lot of evidence that is relevant
to the case
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>That is excluded from admissibility
<$A> <#\>Yes yes I'll <{><[>bet</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>because</[></{> of this rule and that rule
<$A> <#\>Yep
<$B> <#\>And and it probably wo- probably would <,> you know<,>
give you a hand in making a proper judgement
<$A> <#\>Yep for sure yeah <{><[>yeah</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>What</[></{> happened was at the end of the whole thing
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>I was rung up  <#\>I went off a<,> a bit upset because you
know we handed down the verdict and that's the worst part and
the guy started crying and <{><[>calling out</[> for his mummy
<$A> <#\><[>Oh no</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>and
<$A> <#\>oh no
<$B> <#\>and it was really terrible 
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>And he's only a young guy
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>and um<,> I went off feeling pretty bad
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>anyway I was rung back and and some of the people had
talked to the police person after the trial 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>uh and he'd assured them that this guy <,,> had done it
<#\>You know they knew because of this this and this 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>None of which was admissible
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>and and and they knew you know also what he'd done before
<{><[>and</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>they told them what he'd done before all of which wasn't
admissible 
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$B> <#\>You know</I>
