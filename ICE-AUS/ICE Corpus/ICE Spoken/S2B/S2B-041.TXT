<S2B-041>  <2021>
<I><#\>Well in the lecture last week I stressed the point that human
social life, human society is patterned very largely by
culture <#\>We live our we live our lives in worlds of
socio-cultural meaning <#\>That are worlds of our own
construction, and your introduction to that is in the tutorial
readings today at ah on the Yolngu <#\>I reviewed the I reviewed
the evolution of the human capacity for culture <#\>This is our
particular biological specialisation <#\>This is our distinctive
biological specialisation and the paradox is that this
specialisation we have by virtue of our brain to create
culture gives us a very large degree of independence from our
bio from our biology <#\>That's the point I wanted to to stress
last week <#\>The core element of culture is language <#\>It is
language of course that enables us to formulate and
communicate the meanings by which we we live our social our
lives as social beings <#\>It's through language of course that
we formulate and communicate the meanings <#\>By which we live
live our social lives <#\>I s I suggested there is a continuity
between our communicative ability our linguistic ability a
continuity between this and the communicative capacity of our
closest primate relatives - the chimpanzees and the gorillas,
but what became distinctive of human communication human
thought and human communication is the capacity to formulate
what would seem to be an almost infinite range of of possible
worlds possible cultural worlds <#\>Ah so a defining feature of
human cultural behaviour a defining feature of human cultural
behaviour is ah what we might think of as its plasticity its
malleability plas plasticity as from plastic <#\>The plasticity
of human cultural behaviour <#\>The seemingly infinite
possibilities for culturally culturally fashioned or
culturally constructed ways of life<,,> <#\>But of course we are
biological creatures <#\>And as such we must survive and and
prosper by manipulating our natural environments and the
methods by which our ancestors have manipulated the
environment the methods by which they have sub subsisted in
various natural environments have profoundly influenced the
patterns of social social life the patterning of society <#\>And
of course methods of subsistence of of making a living in in
the natural environment are facts of culture <#\>We're looking
at
technologies um including tools knowledge of the environment
and of course conventions that regulate ways of cooperating in
order to secure food and distribute food <#\>So when we talk
about methods of of manipulating the environment methods of
subsistence we are talking about culture
 
<#\>Well today um I'm going to talk about the forms that social
life takes when people live by the very very simplest methods
of subsistence when they have the barest sort of minimum of of
technology and where they depend on foods that the natural
environment directly supplies to them or directly makes
available to them <#\>We call these people the hunter-gatherers
or gatherer gatherer-hunter societies or the foragers <#\>F-O-R-
A-G-E-R-S <#\>Hunter-gatherers or foragers <#\>Now of course
there
are are hardly any such people left in the world today <#\>But
the study of of these people is actually very important
because it's true that the uniqueness of the human species if
you like the human personality has been fashioned by the
hunter-gatherer experience the hunter-gatherer mode of
subsistence <#\>'Cause after all when you look at the million
years the b around about one million years or a little more
since our first human-like ancestors appeared ninety-nine
percent of that time has been lived by our ancestors as
hunting and gathering people <#\>Hunter-gatherers or foragers
<#\>Ninety-nine percent of that million years since the
appearance
of our first human-like ancestors <#\>And indeed even if we
consider just the last one hundred thousand years of or a
little bit less the the period s well we say about a hundred
thousand years ago we see the appearance of of um people
fairly close to ourselves - Homo sapiens um <#\>Nearly ten nearly
ninety percent of that time that one hundred thousand years
was lived as hunters and gatherers <#\>And in fact our ancestors
only moved away from the foraging way of subsistence in the
last ten or twelve thousand years <#\>So it's really very recent
as I think I stressed last week <#\>If we condensed our history
into one year ending today we could say that the transition
took place only in the last two or three days <#\>So therefore
it
would seem true that that if we're if if we if we want to
learn about the ways of life of way of life of our ancient
ancestors we can perhaps do no better than to have a look at
what we've learnt ah what what we know about the simplest
hunting and gathering peoples in the world today <#\>So we look
at studies that anthropologists have made of contemporary
hunting and gathering peoples 

<#\>Um now my purpose in in talking about these peoples is to
address one of the really large questions about human nature
<#\>I want to address one of the really really big questions
about
human nature about the human experience and that is the
question of inequality <#\>Inequality <#\>Social inequality
<#\>What
are the conditions of social inequality <#\>To what extent can
we
say that it belongs to our nature in the biological sense
<,> and to what extent must we understand social
inequality as a product of the social arrangements that we
create with culture that is with on the basis of of of our
beliefs our values our shared meanings <#\>So that's a very large
question I think when we're looking at the nature of the human
experience <#\>The question of social inequality its basis to
what extent it is is it natural in in the biological sense ah
to what extent is it a a construction of culture which is ah
plastic and invariable<,,> 

<#\>Well for the simplest hunting and gathering peoples
biological
needs would seem to outweigh culture in determining economic
activity and in shaping the social relationships in which
people conduct their economic activity that is their food
collection their hunting and their gathering of food <#\>These
people have no economic need and no political need to preserve
social groups other than those groups necessary for
cooperation in the collection of food the hunting or the
pursuit of food or the gathering of food <#\>For example there's
very very little in the way of property of attachment of
particular people to particular property to particular ah
material wealth <#\>You can say that by and large the institution
of property is absent from from these societies <#\>Certainly in
the sense of of of the word property as we we use it 

<#\>The foragers' lack of material possessions contrasts so
starkly with our own obsession to possess them to to own
material things that we tend to think their lives must be
quite wretchedly arduous <#\>But in fact this is far from the
truth <#\>They usually need to devote only a very small amount
of
their time to the food quest <#\>So that most of their hours
would seem to be available for recreation for socialising and
for rest <#\>So much so that we might well describe them as the
as one anthropologist has as the original the original
affluent society the original affluent society <#\>The most
leisured peoples in the world <#\>This would certainly seem to
be
true of um of the the Kung um Bushman of the Kalahari Desert
for example in their traditional state 

<#\>Most hunter-gatherers today such as the Kung in the Kalahari
Desert live in fairly marginal areas areas that have been
largely rejected by um agricultural or in or industrial
societies <#\>By contrast our ancient ancestors mostly lived in
areas that were abundant in material resources of of of of ah
plant food animals and water <#\>So if there's any bias in the
data that we have on contemporary hunter-gatherer societies
that bias probably leads us to understate the quality of life
of our ancestors rather than to overstate it <#\>Ah when we see
a
relatively affluent lifestyle relatively leisured lifestyle in
contemporary hunter-gatherers living in fairly marginal
environments often desert or semi-arid ah semi-arid
environments at least ah surely our ancient ancestors must
have been all the more affluent <#\>Now while hunting and
gathering even in these relatively harsh environments provides
adequate nutrition adequate nutrition for the living
populations this mode of subsistence does impose limits on
human fertility and and hence rate of population growth <#\>Um
for example the absence of grains the absence of of
domesticated grains as wheat or barley with which ah mothers
could make um soft ah gruel meals for for infants ah and also
the absence of domesticated animal sources of milk - goats or
or or cows - mean that breastfeeding is far more important in
hunting and gathering societies <#\>It's likely to have to be
kept continued for for an infant for several years <#\>Ah so
lactation endures several years because of the absence of
other sources of of of um the fat and protein <#\>And in this
period of prolonged breastfeeding the hunter-gatherer diet
doesn't allow ah ovulation to re-establish itself <#\>It doesn't
allow pregnancy to re-esta to to to to occur <#\>Ah the calories
that the the mother must consume in breastfeeding and also in
the tasks of gathering food while she is nursing the baby mean
that there's nothing left there's no nourishment left to re-
establish ovulation <#\>So that a feature of the hunter-gatherer
mode of subsistence would seem to be ah a restricted fertility
and rate rate of reproduction sort of a a mode in the sense of
population control <,> <#\>Well in the rest of this lecture
I
want to give a general account of the pattern of social
relationships the pattern of social organisation in the
simplest hunter-gatherer societies that we know of and there
are two societies that you see discussed by anthropologists
again and again and you'll see illustrated one of them in the
film tomorrow the bushmen so-called Bushmen of the Kalahari
Desert in Southern Africa particularly a a linguistic ah group
of them called the Kung K-U-N-G <#\>And these days the population
of that that shaded area there the Kung and their their
related groups the Bushmen something like forty thousand
people <#\>Um back in in in in in previous centuries vast
majority of the the vast bulk of Southern Africa was populated
by by the ancestors of these people <#\>The other group are the
Mbuti M-B-U-T-I in the rainforest of Zaire in Central Africa
<,> <#\>Now these peoples live in nomadic bands that comprise
no more than thirty to fifty people and each of these bands is
divided into a number of ah families or extended family
groups <#\>Ah there is an interlacing of the different bands in
a
particular region or territory a an interlacing or
interconnectedness through through marriage and family links
so that the families of different bands will will have
marriage or kinship links with one another <#\>In addition to
this basis of cooperation amongst a large number of bands
there is also the fact of shared language shared religious
belief um shared knowledge of the environment and a myth myths
mythology ah recounting a common origin <#\>But there is no
system of authority <#\>No system of authority <#\>Neither within
the individual bands nor over the population as a whole <#\>In
fact the absence of ah structures of domination by some people
over others is a very striking feature of these societies -
the Mbuti and the Kung <#\>And it's a very sharp contrast it sets
a very sharp contrast with the complex systems of social
stratification and power that ah have developed in ah human
history over the last few thousand years <#\>So the absence of
structures of domination is an important feature of of these
societies <#\>There is a sexual division of labour <#\>Women
gather
plantfoods and and small small game <#\>The Kung women for
example tortoises and and snakes and birds birds eggs as well
as roots and nuts and berries and melons and so forth</I>
