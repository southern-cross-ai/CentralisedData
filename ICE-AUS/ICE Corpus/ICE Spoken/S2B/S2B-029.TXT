<I><$A> <#\>This is the story of the last days in Antarctica of the
Mawson huskies and their uncertain future <#\>Their deportation
marks the passing of a remarkable partnership between working
dogs and expeditioners in the far south <#\>It's the end of an
era<,,> <#\>The ancestors of these dogs came to Antarctica when
the first Australian base was established<,,> <#\>Hardbottle and
the other twenty nine dogs came from Greenland and Labrador in
the early nineteen fifties <#\>From the newly established Mawson
Station they helped to explore a vast area of Antarctica<,,>
<#\>For the next forty years their descendants lived on these
same dog lines chained up through the long dark winters
<#\>Temperatures regularly drop below minus forty degrees with
winds sometimes over one hundred knots<,,> <#\>The winter before
their huskies were to leave forever knowing that it was their
last chance<,> <#\>Dave Pottage and Al Rooke pushed for one last
dog sled expedition<,,> <#\>Zipper and the other huskies have
become pawns in the negotiation of the Madrid Protocol an
international agreement under which all introduced species except
man must leave <#\>Under these new regulations their handlers had
been directed to stop them breeding<,> however a happy accident
during winter saw Coco become the mother of three pups Frosty
Copper and Misty the last to be born in Antarctica<,,> <#\>It was
thought that Bundy and the other Mawson huskies would have to be
killed<,,> <#\>There was a public outcry <#\>The Australian
government began to search for a new home where they could be
kept together as working teams<,,> <#\>Their final expedition is
an historic occasion <#\>One of the last dog sled journeys in
Antarctica <#\>It will take them over hundreds of kilometres of
treacherous sea ice to inspect penguin rookeries along the
coastline<,,> 
<$B> <X><#\>Knots in the stomach <#\>Butterflies <#\>Am I going
to be able to run that far <#\>Are the dogs going to cope <#\>Are
they ready <#\>Are the sleds prepared correctly <#\>Have we got
everything <#\>Um<,,> yeah there's a little bit of fear <#\>Oh
quite a bit of fear actually cos it's ah it's a long way from
base<,> and with no ah outside help available and that's a bit
scary<,,></X>
<$A> <#\>Zipper the lead dog looks first at Bundy his mother and
then back around to Bear the station's king dog<,,> <#\>Zipper
sees the hand signal of his dogman and turns to carry out his
orders <#\>Bear the heaviest husky of the team weighing in at
nearly fifty kilograms casts an approving eye over the pack as
the whole team tastes the freedom of finally being off the chain
again<,,> <#\>This expedition will be their last contribution as
working dogs in Antarctica<,,> <#\>On this last journey the two
teams of nine dogs and four men hope to reach the penguin rookery
at Cloah Point a round trip of six hundred kilometres<,,>
<#\>Antarctica is a huge ice covered land mass <#\>In winter the
surface of the sea around it freezes over <#\>In spring although
the sea ice has started to melt the teams can travel with caution
along the coast to visit the emperor penguin rookeries <#\>They
camp on rocky islands in case the ice should suddenly break
out<,> <#\>With the inevitable blizzards their journey could take
a month or more<,,> 
<$B> <X><#\>They just love to work and they just get into a
steady stride and um you know you can just see them just
thoroughly enjoy it <#\>All their tails are up and ah you know
they look around at you tongues hanging out and almost a smile
on their face <#\>And they just run like that for twelve hours
a day <#\>Obviously you've got to stop them every hour or so give
them a nice drink of snow and ah let them roll around in the snow
and just relax and have a lovely time and then<quote>are you ready
boys <#\>Off again</quote> and off they go and bang bang and they just
run for miles and usually it's quite easy to do forty five and
fifty kilometres a day no no problems</X>
<$C> <#\>Total freedom absolutely total freedom <#\>Not a care
in the world except running and running and running and just
seeing the most magnificent scenery on foot<,,>
<$B> <X><#\>The bonding with the dogs it happens quickly and almost
unnoticeably but after a few days you just<,> you really get to
know what the dogs are up to how they're running which
personality's going to cause trouble and yeah you just slot in
with them</X>
<$A> <#\>At first the weather is unexpectedly cold <#\>In the
wind the temperature stays below minus forty degrees the entire
day<,,> <#\>The tents are a welcome haven for the dogmen
<$B> <X><#\>Journal entry Friday the eighteenth <#\>This is the
furthest west I've been and what magnificent country <#\>Islands
and icebergs surround us as the track becomes rougher <#\>No
problems with the dogs <#\>They are running strongly</X>
<$A> <#\>The faith Al and Dave have in their sledge dogs is a
world apart from how the first British expedition viewed such
means of transport <#\>Captain Scott's expedition failed to see
the advantages of huskies as working dogs <#\>Being English they
treated them more like pets<,,>
<$X> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O>is here, asking for his dinner, and Chris
was the handsomest member of the pack</X>
<$A> <#\>He favoured the use of Manchurian ponies over huskies
in his attempt to be the first to the south pole<,,> 
<$X> <X><#\>Captain Scott always kept a watchful eye on the
transport animals and he often had a friendly word for the
ponies</X>
<$A> <#\>It was a bad mistake as the strongest pony only made it
a quarter of the total distance <#\>Scott and his four companions
were forced to begin the brutal and punishing task of manhauling
for fifteen hundred kilometres <#\>They lost the race and died
of exhaustion and hunger while trying to return <#\>On the other
hand Roald Amundsen was successful because he knew how to get the
most from his Greenland huskies
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>Today Amundsen's tactics would be considered ruthless
<#\>He started his expedition with fifty two dogs but only eleven
of them returned <#\>His strategy was to kill them for food<,,> 
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>Amundsen insisted on strict control of his husky teams
a tradition which continues with Al and Dave <#\>Without human
intervention the pack nature of the husky would lead to a clear
cut hierarchy one king dog would call the tune<,> <#\>Arnie the
tough white husky and Bear the biggest of them all are both older
dogs competing with each other for the throne
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>Bear squeals with pain which incites the other dogs to
turn on him even though he is one of the king dogs<,,>
<#\>Fighting is in the nature of the breed but the dog handlers
must stop them from getting out of hand<,,> <#\>For over three
thousand years the Inuit people of the Artic bred a hardy working
dog that has been essential to their survival <#\>The Mawson
husky bloodline comes from the dogs bred by these people in
Greenland and Labrador<,,> <#\>There is some controversy about
whether they cross bred their dogs with wolves <#\>In fact they
didn't <#\>The husky is a separate breed of dog that does have
elements of wild pack behaviour and yet will not attack
humans<,,> <#\>The Inuit dog was traditionally fed seal meat and
had to fend for itself for part of the year and so became a good
hunter a trait that invariably causes problems for the dog
handlers in the Antarctic
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>In spring the seals haul out through tide cracks to pup
<#\>They must wait on the ice 'til the pups are old enough to
swim
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>After several years of running with the Mawson dogs Al
and Dave know how to get the most from their teams
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>After fourteen days on the trail the teams finally reach
Cloah Point near the furthest penguin rookery <#\>It's been a
tradition for the Mawson huskies to make this 300 kilometre run
in spring<,> <#\>The teams are among the last 50 huskies on the
entire continent and their journey marks the end of a one hundred
year partnership in Antarctica
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>After every day's run Dave and Al check the dogs
<#\>They're still worried about Bear's ear because an infection
could prove fatal<,,> <#\>The staple diet of the dogs on the
trail is the pemmican block <#\>This traditional sled dog food
is a highly compressed mixture of meat, vegetables and vitamins
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>In this inhospitable place emergency help is at least
a week away providing they can get through on the radio
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>Al and Dave and their dogs are at the mercy of a full
antarctic blizzard <#\>Trapped by the elements they're in a
similar position to many who have come before<,,> <#\>On Ernest
Shackleton's ill-fated attempt to cross the Antarctic continent
in nineteen fourteen his ship became trapped in the ice <#\>The
men and the seventy huskies that were to have pulled them to
glory waited helplessly for the ice to break up and set them free
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>After nearly a year their ship finally broke up<,> the
dogs were crucial in dragging supplies across broken ice towards
the open sea<,> then they were finally sacrificed to provide food
for the survival of the party
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>After five nights pinned down in the tents the teams are
finally able to move again<,> now the main purpose of the
expedition can be achieved<,,> <#\>There are only thirty emperor
penguin rookeries in the world and checking on them is vital to
the preservation of this unique species <#\>Al and Dave count the
chicks and record the adults direction of movement to find out
where they're feeding <#\>Emperors who breed in winter differ
from all other penguins <#\>The egg is actually incubated by the
males <#\>Then in the spring the chicks are nurtured by both
parents until feathers replace their fluffy grey down<,,> <#\>By
mid-summer the chicks will no longer be dependent on the
adults<,,> <#\>The teams enter Mawson harbour for the last time
having covered six hundred and thirty kilometres <#\>The Cloah
expedition has taken thirty three days to complete <#\>For eight
of these they were pinned down by blizzards
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>After Zipper Arnie and their teams leave <#\>Travel to
the distant penguin rookeries will have to be done by vehicle<,>
For Al and Dave a diesel powered Hagland is a less appealing
alternative <#\>Safety is also a consideration
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>The huskies were kept at Mawson Station after they were
removed from other places because there were several accidents
like this <#\>Luckily there have been no injuries when the
vehicles have broken through the ice<,,> <#\>The Aurora Australis
speeds south on its mission to resupply the base and remove the
huskies <#\>A new home has been proposed for them in America
<#\>There were last minute efforts in Australia to try to keep
the dogs in Antarctica
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>Dog sled operators in Minnesota were thought to offer
the best home for Coco her three pups and the other huskies<,,>
<#\>There is also disagreement at the Station about whether the
Australian Government should be removing the dogs at all<,>
<#\>Some expeditioners send faxes from Antarctica to the dog
outfitters in Minnesota imploring them to change their minds
about taking the dogs
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>All avenues of appeal by those opposed to the dogs'
departure come to nothing <#\>Al and Dave are chosen to run the
dogs to meet the ship at the ice edge <#\>They will then
accompany them all the way to America
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>Just before the ship arrives to remove the dogs the
worst blizzard of the year strikes<,,> <#\>Kennels have never
been provided in Mawson because the cost of keeping them free of
snow drifts was considered to be too high <#\>Some also believed
that shelters would make the dogs too soft <#\>Under such
conditions Bundy and Arnie would rarely live longer than seven
years<,,> <#\>The day has come when the huskies must finally
go<,,> <#\>Their run to the ship over seventy kilometres across
sea ice will be very hard because of the fresh snow that fell
during the blizzard
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>History shows that explorers and scientists came to
grips with the mysteries and majesty of Antarctica through the
husky's strong back sturdy legs and stalwart spirit<,,> <#\>The
three pups are flown to the ship after being sedated<,,>
<#\>Meanwhile the teams are having a difficult time navigating
a path through the fresh snow drifts
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>After struggling nearly fifty kilometres the two dog
teams come across the Haglands that are returning from the ship
<#\>The drivers warn of broken ice that has to be crossed<,,>
<#\>It's getting very late so an alternative plan is made
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>After several weeks on the ship in close quarters
tensions build and Bundy and Coco, the two bitches, seek a
resolution <&>dogs yelping</&> <#\>Since Labo was given a kennel he's
preferred to look down from on top rather than be confined inside
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>Huskies have traditionally travelled well by ship
<#\>The journey ahead by plane and road may not be so easy
<#\>After three weeks at sea they arrive in Hobart <#\>The
huskies have to pass through Australia's strict quarantine
<#\>America however is not as free of disease <#\>When some
Huskies from the New Zealand base previously travelled to America
they picked up a serious infection and took several months to
recover
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>Some of the previous huskies that travelled to America
managed to break out of their cages in the hold of the plane
<#\>One of them was killed in a fight<&>dog noises & voices</&>
<#\>Bear and the others were sealed up for quarantine <#\>Not to
be let out until they reached Los Angeles <&>music</&> <#\>To get to
Los Angeles the dogs are loaded into the hold of a jumbo jet
<#\>A strike by ground staff left the huskies sweltering in the
hold of the plane for three hours<,,> <#\>Dave was very concerned
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>On reaching Healey the first stop is the Minnesota
Outward Bound School where seventeen dogs are left <#\>Coco's
team continues on to Paul <@>Surname</@> Wintergreen Lodge on the
other side of the lake <#\>Since leaving Mawson the twenty-two
Australian huskies have been on the road for four weeks
<#\>They've travelled twenty thousand kilometres to the other
side of the world
               <O>non-corpus speaker</O>
<$A> <#\>At both lodges here in Minnesota the dogs get to live
out of the wind for the first time</I>
