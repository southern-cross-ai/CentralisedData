<I><$A> <#\>These males are locked in a beautiful battle<,,>
<#\>There
are many competitors in the front line all fighting to attract
the attention of a female<,,> <#\>She assesses his prowess<,,>
<#\>If he's good enough she'll stay and copulate <#\>If he's
not<,>
she'll consign him to the genetic scrap heap<,> and move
on<,,> <#\>This male will only ensure his genes live on<,> if
he
succeeds in impregnating this female<,,> <#\>If he doesn't<,>
it's the end of his genetic line<,,> <#\>Only when his sperm
fertilises her egg<,,> has he won the battle of sperm
wars<,,> <#\>Parliament house<,> Canberra<,> Australia's home
of
male battles for power and influence<,,> <#\>The showiest
noisiest most persistent members will always<,> get the
attention<,,> <#\>But outside in the gardens surrounding
parliament house<,,> some males have to work a little harder at
it<,,> <#\>These are superb fairy wrens<,,> common through
south-east Australia<,,> <#\>How the beautiful blue male is
fairing in the sperm wars battle is being studied by Professor
Andrew Cockburn<,> of the Australian National University<,,>
<#\>The remarkably plain and unassuming female<,,> pairs up for
life<,> with a gorgeous male<,,> and together<,> forever<,>
they make babies<,,> <#\>Or at least that's how it looks to
us<,,> <#\>The perfect monogamous couple<,,> <#\>But Andrew is
hot
on their heels<,,> delving beneath the surface of this Mills
and Boone romance<,,> by applying a revolutionary scientific
technique<,,> <#\>The sound of myths being blown apart<,> is
deafening<,,>
<$B> <#\>For the first<,> ten years that I studied animal
behaviour<,> I did it the way everybody else did it <#\>By
wandering around in the field watching animals<,,> <#\>Then
suddenly in nineteen eighty five<,> I heard<,> about a
technique called DNA finger printing which<,> I knew would
enable me for the first time to say with complete
confidence<,,> how individuals in societies were actually
related to each other<,,>
<$A> <#\>DNA finger printing was first used on humans<,> for
forensic work<,> but was quickly adopted by zoology<,,> <#\>By
taking a small amount of blood from each bird in the garden<,>
and by comparing their DNA<,> Andrew has found some startling
results<,,>
<$B> <#\>We've had<,> the shocking results from DNA finger
printing<,> that most birds are wildly promiscuous<,,> and
that monogamy in fact is very very rare<,> and the real
additional surprise<,> is that females are even more
promiscuous than males<,,> <#\>It's taken the application of this
technique for two years<,> to totally transform the way I view
animal societies<,,> <#\>So when we look at the three chicks that
we find in<,> the average fairy wren nest<,> none will be
fathered by the female's partner<,,> but she may have mated
with three different males from outside her territory<,> so
the clutch may have three different fathers<,,> <#\>One of the
most important things to come out of our study<,> is the
realisation that females exert much more control<,> over who
fathers their children than was previously thought<,,>
<$A> <#\>This female fairy wren is deciding which males will
provide the best genes for her babies<,,> <#\>Bright<,> and
beautiful colours are not enough to ensure his fatherhood <#\>He
has another strategy<,,> 
<$B> <#\>When you look at the<,> structure of fairy wrens they're
basically gonads with wings <#\>They have enormous testes and
enormous sperm storage organs<,,> which are<,> among the
largest in the world<,,> <#\>Suddenly that makes sense<,>
because<,> if the fairy wren females are mating with lots of
males it's very important for males to produce massive amounts
of sperm so that his sperm<,> compete with the sperm from Joe
Bloggs next door<,,>
<$A> <#\>Masses of artillery<,,> <#\>A deluge of sperm to
outnumber
any rivals<,,> <#\>The more sperm he can produce<,> the more
likely he is<,> to win the race to the egg<,,> and the egg<,>
is the glittering prize<,> <#\>His passport to the future<,,>
<#\>It costs little in energy<,> for the male<,> to manufacture
large amounts of sperm<,,> <#\>Each individual sperm is a
potential winner<,,> so the more competitors he produces<,,>
the better<,,> <#\>The natural world isn't a comfortable one of
trust<,> and monogamy<,,> <#\>It's spring<,,> and it's time to
breed for the Australasian gannet<,,> <#\>A young male is
looking
for his first mate<,> <#\>Whoever he pairs with<,> it will be for
life<,,> and that could be thirty years<,,> <#\>And this is
where they will build their first nest<,,> on the rocky ledges
of a windswept island off Tasmania<,,> <#\>There's little room
and they'll have to fight for a nesting site<,,> <#\>The young
couple continually confirm their partnership<,,> <#\>Like newly
weds everywhere<,> sex is an important part of bonding<,,>
<#\>They mate literally hundreds of times<,> in what might seem
an
excessive display of affection<,,> <#\>Or is it<,,> <#\>The
male
often has to leave his partner<,> guarding the nesting site
while he flys out to sea collecting food and nesting
material<,,> <#\>He can be away for a day at a time<,> and
that's very dangerous<,> <#\>They've only just met<,> and their
bond isn't that strong yet<,,> <#\>Back home there's a lot going
on<,,> <#\>Birds are crowded together<,,> <#\>Lone males<,> lone
females<,> who's partners are away at sea<,,> <#\>Time<,>
opportunity<,> <#\>She's always on the lookout for a good set of
genes<,,> <#\>Can he be sure she hasn't mated while he's been
away<,,> <#\>After all<,> he's young<,> and inexperienced<,,>
<#\>She may prefer an older male who's survived the years and
shown he's got superior genes<,,> <#\>All he can do<,> is to
mate as many times as possible to try and ensure that his
sperm have the best chance of fertilising her egg<,,> <#\>Over
the next four months<,> he will put a lot of effort into
nurturing a single chick<,,> <#\>He must be as sure as he can
that the egg his partner lays is his<,> otherwise<,> he's
giving costly time and energy to another male's chick<,,> and
in the harsh natural world<,> that's not time well spent<,,>
<#\>Swamping<,> is the gannets' response to suspicion<,> but when
the competition is right in front of you<,,> it takes on a new
dimension<,,> <#\>As winter bites<,> the antarctic waters
freeze<,> and the whales of the southern ocean migrate
north<,,> <#\>Southern right whales come here to the south coast
of Australia <#\>The males are gathered<,> ready and waiting<,>
for the females to arrive<,,> <#\>Southern right whales form no
sexual partnerships at all<,,> <#\>Males and females mate freely
with each other<,> <#\>It's common for one female to be
surrounded by four or five males<,> waiting their turn to
mate<,,> <#\>There is no physical contact <#\>Competition is all
at
the level of sperm<,,> <#\>Each one produces gallons of sperm<,>
from enormous testes that weigh a ton<,,> <#\>It is swamping in
the extreme but it's the only tactic the males can
employ<,,> <#\>Even though they're one of the largest animals
on
earth<,> their sperm are tiny<,,> <#\>The same size as ours<,,>
<#\>This sperm is forty five times bigger<,> and much longer
living<,> <#\>It belongs to one of the smallest mammals on
earth<,,> this tiny honey possum<,,> <#\>Honey possums live
solely off the pollen and nectar of heathland plants<,,>
<#\>They're spread out over a large area leading solitary
lives<,>
and only rarely do they come across each other<,,> <#\>But he
remains constantly on the lookout <#\>He's a marsupial missile<,>
continually on standby<,,> his huge testes hold masses<,> of
long living sperm<,,> <#\>They constitute five percent of his
body weight<,> the equivalent of a man's testes weighing four
kilograms<,,> <#\>Because of their solitary lives these possums
live with two uncertainties<,>  whether they're going to meet
a fertile female<,,> and how many other males have found her
too<,,> <#\>Forced to the outskirts of the territories by
aggressive females who have the pick of the food resources for
their young<,,> the males must feed in the poorer areas<,>
waiting for a rare opportunity to mate<,> hoping to be in the
right place<,> at the right time<,,> <#\>Food<,> and sex are
intrinsically linked<,> <#\>The two basics of life have to be in
balance<,,> <#\>In the rich rainforests of Queensland<,> all
animal appetites revolve around the wet and dry seasons<,,>
<#\>In the wet<,> the trees produce abundant fruit<,,> <#\>Musky
rat
kangaroos<,> mate in time for their offspring to take
advantage of the yearly bounty<,,> <#\>At the end of the dry
season<,> the male's testicles swell in anticipation of the
mating season<,> advertising his armoury of attractions for
any interested female to inspect<,,> <#\>Producing large
quantities of sperm is not an obvious method of warfare<,>
<#\>It's covert<,> under cover<,> tactical<,,> <#\>But waiting
just offshore in the sub-antarctic islands are landing
parties<,> heading for the beaches<,> to fight<,> a two month
war of male brute force<,,> <#\>The female is not so easily
impressed<,,> <#\>She will choose her preferred beach master<,>
and join his harem<,,> but first<,> she has to give
birth<,,> <#\>She's pregnant from last year's mating and the pup
is totally unrelated to this year's beach master<,,> <#\>By
mating with a dominant male<,> she secures protection<,,> and
healthy genes<,> for her next pup<,,> <#\>The fighting has paid
off for him<,> but at a huge cost<,,> <#\>He's exhausted<,> after
weeks of combat<,> and has lost a thousand kilos in weight<,>
and there's still no time for a post-copulatory snooze<,,>
<#\>In the natural world<,> life isn't peaceful for males
<#\>It's
always uncertain <#\>They are always under pressure<,,> <#\>And
the
female tammar wallabies take that pressure to the extreme<,,>
forcing males to employ tactics other<,> than swamping<,> and
fighting<,,> <#\>Each female is only fertile for one day<,> one
of nature's amazing phenomena<,> that is determined by the
lengthening hours of daylight<,,> <#\>Thirty days after the
longest day in the year<,> all female tammars give birth<,,>
<#\>The embryo has been held in suspension in her uterus for a
year<,,> since last year's mating season<,> <#\>For reasons that
are still a mystery<,> the summer solstice triggers<,> the
embryo's final journey to the pouch<,,> <#\>Perhaps by the time
the joey leaves the pouch next spring<,> there will be a
plentiful supply of fresh grass to feed on<,,> but whatever
the reason<,> eight hours after the birth <,>she is ready to
mate again<,> with no time to lose<,,> <#\>The males move in<,>
<#\>Tensions run high<,,> <#\>They've waited all year for this
opportunity<,,> <#\>There is no real dominant male<,> and the
female has many partners<,> so the male's resort to that old
standby<,> swamping<,> but with an ingenious twist<,,> <#\>To
make it as difficult as possible for other males<,> part of
the sperm hardens at the entrance to the females vagina<,> to
form a sperm plug<,,> <#\>In effect<,> a marsupial chastity
belt<,,> <#\>The fluid sperm slowly hardens to form a barrier<,>
a blockade<,> to stop subsequent male sperm from getting
through to the egg<,,> <#\>For tammars<,> reproduction is
totally
predictable<,> dictated by the sun<,,> but other animals are
opportunists<,,> <#\>Their lives are ruled by rain<,,> <#\>No
one
can predict rainfall in central Australia <#\>It sweeps in with
no notice<,> and the desert is transformed<,,> <#\>Large areas
are suddenly flooded<,> <#\>It means disaster for some<,> but for
others<,> it's the chance they've been waiting for<,,>
<#\>Before the water evaporates under the desert heat<,,> dragon
and damsel flies mate as many times as possible<,,> <#\>These
dragon flies have already copulated <#\>He grips her head tightly
with his abdomen<,> guarding her from a sneak attack from
another male while she lays her eggs<,,> <#\>He makes sure
they're his eggs going into his patch of water<,,> <#\>Damsel
flies mate in the vegetation<,> <#\>The female<,> has had
previous matings before pairing up with this male<,,> <#\>He
grips her head with the end of his abdomen <#\>She raises her
genitals to his<,> which are in the centre of his body<,,>
<#\>The female<,> probably has sperm left inside her from earlier
encounters<,,> and he is in the process of removing it<,>
<#\>This is the ultimate strategy<,> disarmament<,,>
<#\>Attached
to the end of his penis is a sperm removing tool <#\>Each species
has a uniquely different design<,,> <#\>They are weirdly
beautiful weapons that scrape<,> pack<,> or shove foreign
sperm out of the way<,> rendering it impotent<,,> <#\>Only when
the path has been cleared will he inject his own sperm<,,>
<#\>With reproduction via sexual intercourse<,> being able to
remove foreign sperm from the race<,> is the ultimate
tactic<,,></I>
