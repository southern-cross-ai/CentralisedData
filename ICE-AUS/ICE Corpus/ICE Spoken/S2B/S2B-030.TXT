<I><$A> <#\>Hello, and welcome to the show <#\>Tonight we'll take
you on some great Getaways right around the country from Cape
York to Tasmania as well as overseas <#\>As I go to France we
find one of the great chefs of Europe and Rebecca travels to
Bangkok to sample some of the great bargains of Asia <#\>At home
David, a man not known for his fishing prowess, visits an anglers
paradise and Tina takes the bite out of meeting a snake in the
grass <#\>That's later but first here's Anna facing an exciting
challenge up north
<$B> <#\>Well we've all just been dropped into the rainforest
wilderness south of Cairns in far north Queensland, the start of
a five day white water raft <O>inaudible</O> from the North Johnson
River <#\>And when that chopper leaves there's no turning back<,>
<#\>Ahead lies fifty five kilometres of raging rapids winding
through the tropical rainforest of the Palmerston National Park
<#\>To protect this world heritage area the Government allows
only one group a week to raft down the North Johnson River
<#\>Out here we're completely on our own <#\>Though the journey
starts on an easy section of the river where we can safely
rehearse the manoeuvres needed to get through a rapid <#\>The
guard's job is to quickly turn a bunch of raw recruits into a
crash squad of rafters <#\>Not an easy task <O>yelling and water
splashing</O> <#\>It's not a pretty sight but gradually we get the
hang of it and start working together as a team <O>yelling and
screaming</O> <#\>On our raft there's Wendy and Gino from Texas <,>
Texas Queensland that is <#\>And my partner on the front paddle
is Tom a builder from Innisfail <#\>What were you expecting
out of it
<$D> <#\>Adrenaline <O>laughter</O> that's all <#\>I get a bit of a
buzz out of adrenaline
<$E> <#\>Now coming into this rapid here ah super super ultra
important <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Our fearless guide and leader is Budda the man who knows
everything about the river
<$E> <#\>Left rocks be ready for the over left, over right hold
on get down on the job forward paddle back paddle <,> let's do
it <O>music yelling screaming water splashing</O> 
<$B> <#\>According to the guides each river has its own unique
character and style <#\>They've described this one as tight and
technical <,> <#\>I'd say it's a bit more like tense and
terrifying <,>though as we get our act together it gradually
becomes more enjoyable <O>music yelling screaming</O> <#\>But little
did I know I'd soon be needing all the skill and courage I could
muster <#\>It's time to face one of the roughest rapids on the
river the Berlin Wall <O>yelling screaming</O> <O>music</O> <#\>Our job's to
hang on for dear life as we go over the falls then furiously
paddle backwards to avoid being slammed against the overhanging
rock face <#\>Watching the others go over does nothing to calm
my nerves <O>screaming</O> <#\>It's a stark choice <#\>To chicken out
and loose face with the others or to go for it and risk leaving
my face on the rocks <#\>Peer pressure wins out <,> just
<$E> <#\>Mighty seven foot vertical drop there <,> Wendy <,>
<#\>Alright alright <O>laughter</O> <#\>Don't you pull up 
<$B> <#\>By the end of the day it's a wet and weary little group
that pulls into camp for the night <#\>Though it wasn't quite
what I'd expected<,,> <O>inaudible</O> <#\>It's been a long day and after a
hearty dinner and coffee round the fire we all settle for an
early night <O>birds and bush sounds and music</O> <#\>Don't come here
expecting luxury the whole thing is pretty basic down to earth
camping and of course the whole aim of the game is to leave no
trace at all <#\>Even down to the extent of special biodegradable
toothpaste <,,> <#\>The level of the river varies with the
seasons but with an annual rainfall of over three and a half
metres, one of the highest in Australia, there's always enough
water for a bit of fun <O>laughter, splashing</O> <#\>While a friendly
rivalry develops between the crews to see who's best on the river
there's a great camaraderie developing on our raft <#\>And we try
to help one another out wherever possible <O>laughter, screaming</O>
<#\>At the end of day two <,> what do you think
<$F> <#\>Great <O>giggle</O>
<$G> <#\>Yeah <,> it's <,> unreal <#\>It's a lot better than I
thought it would be 
<$F> <#\>Yeah, it is actually
<$G> <#\>Yeah <,> a lot<,> <{><[>more than I expected</[> 
<$F> <#\><[>The class</[></{> of rapids are higher than what we've seen 
before <O>laughter</O> great <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Yeah, now what about you Tom how're you handling it
<$H> <#\>ah It's been really great <#\>You know <,> bit tired
look forward to camp at the end of the day <#\>And I got to
paddle a bit more up the front all the time because Anna won't
come come to the party
<$I> <#\>ah <#\>Now come on <O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>To give whingers like Tom a break day three of the trip
spent lazing around the camp or exploring the surrounding forest
<#\>There's a magnificent four hundred foot waterfall nearby
that's well worth a visit <#\>Then it's back to the rapids for
the last two days <#\>So how am I gonna remember this trip
<#\>Well we've seen a lot of hard work a few very scary moments
but basically it's been a lot of fun and when you've time to
really enjoy this absolutely stunning wilderness.<O>inaudible</O>
<O>music</O> <#\>Raging Thunders the company that runs these five day
rafting trips on the North Johnson River in far North Queensland
<#\>The cost is $750 per person and that includes all meals and
camping gear <#\>Trips run every fortnight between January and
October <O>music</O>
                    <O>ad break</O>
<$A> <#\>If you're on holiday in France you must visit a Chateau
<#\>A Chateau like this one <#\>This is the Chateau de Croyere
at Reims about two hours drive north of Paris <#\>Now <,> this
is no day to be out in the open <#\>What you should be doing is
in there drinking fine wines and having the gastronomic
experience <,> of a lifetime <O>music</O> <#\>The man preparing this
meal is one of the great chefs of Europe Gerard Boyer <#\>His
team is as well drilled as a crack regiment <#\>Tonight's
specialities: wild mushrooms, the first of the autumn truffles,
and fresh salmon are being cooked in one of the best restaurants
in France <,> or so says the Michelin Guide which awarded Les
Crayeres three stars <#\>And while that's cooking let's have a
look at the house <#\>Les Crayeres goes back to the eighteenth
century and stands in its own seven hectare park <#\>The
interior, as you would expect, is refined with paintings and
sculptures of the period <#\>Les Crayeres lures the rich and
famous to dine; heads of state and politicians from the nearby
common market headquarters in Brussels fly in to eat here <O>music</O>
<#\>Within strolling distance is the city of Reims with its fine
old cathedral and cobbled streets <#\>Joan of Arc saw to it that
the King of France was crowned here <#\>But if you find history
a bore there are the champagne cellars to explore <#\>Back at the
Chateau there are sixteen rooms ranging from the chintzy to the
baroque with oak panelling and a four poster bed <#\>Downstairs
preparations are taking place for the big meal <#\>Tables are
laid and the elegant dining room is ready for another full house
<#\>Les Crayeres is one of those restaurants where if you have
to ask how much it costs you can't afford it <#\>We did ask and
were told dinner for two can set you back one thousand dollars
<#\>Voila <#\>Well that's what all the fuss is about and just the
ambience of this beautiful room is enough to inspire a great
culinary triumph like that <#\>And the man who cooked that
remarkable meal is Mr Gerard Boyer
<$X> <X><#\>I am very glad that Australian visitors are coming
from so far away to come to my restaurant <#\>I will certainly
offer them the same kind of great food that they can get in
Australia but with something besides which makes the difference
<#\>The place, the French art, our atmosphere and maybe also a
sense of humour which is typically French</X>
<$A> <#\>Well you certainly need a sense of humour when you get
the bill <#\>This is an exercise in total self indulgence that's
out of the reach of most travellers but it is mouth watering just
to take a look <#\>Les Crayeres hotel and restaurant is in Reims
a hundred and thirty five kilometres east of Paris <#\>A three
course meal costs from around a hundred to five hundred dollars
a head plus drinks <#\>A double room costs from two hundred and
seventy five dollars a night up to five hundred and nineteen
dollars for a suite and can be booked through Mary Rossi Travel
in Australia <#\>Les Crayeres is closed over Christmas and New
Year <#\>Qantas flies to Paris three times a week <#\>Qantas
Jetabout packages which include three nights accommodation in
Paris cost from two thousand and ninety nine dollars from the
Eastern seaboard and Adelaide and from two thousand and nineteen
dollars from Perth and Darwin <O>music</O>

<$J> <#\>One of the most common requests we get for this segment
is from couples who dream about a romantic weekend together and
the chance for a break from the children <#\>This week we sent
Sydney couple David and Debra Chapwin for a Getaway to one of
Melbourne's newest and most luxurious hotels <O>music</O> <#\>The
Sheraton Towers Southgate opened in June last year and is part
of the new Southgate development on the banks of the Yarra
<#\>The main business district is just five minutes walk away
<#\>Yet it's right in the heart of the arts and leisure centre
of the city <#\>The Sheraton Towers has three restaurants and
bars where you can enjoy a drink or meal at almost any time of
the day or night <O>music</O> <#\>There are elegant public areas to
relax in and the Sheraton has a reputation for the sort of
service that our fantasy couple had been dreaming about <,,>
<O>untranscribed conversation between guests and receptionist</O>
<#\>The whole check-in procedure is designed to be as quick and
easy as possible and, to make sure everything else goes smoothly,
a butler is assigned to guests during their stay<,,> 
<O>untranscribed section where hotel staff describes room</O> <#\>OK, so
the Sheraton hotel has provided the romantic part of the
Chapwins' fantasy, but the real climax of their stay is to take
place on that most Melbourne of institutions, the tram <#\>Yes
folks, they're trams <#\>So that evening I arrived at the
Sheraton to take the Chapwins to the second part of their fantasy 
<,> dinner on Melbourne's restaurant tram <O>tram noise</O> <#\>Built
in nineteen twenty seven this is the oldest tram still on the
tracks in Melbourne <#\>In nineteen eighty three it was
refurbished and converted for use as a restaurant <#\>It now runs
seven days a week for dinner and can also be hired for weddings,
parties and other special events <#\>Had you heard about <,>
this tram <,> before
<$O> <#\>Yes we'd heard about it and you know we always thought
how we'd love to go on it um just never sort of got quite got
around to making the arrangements <#\>And once three little
children came along there wasn't much chance to do it
<$L> <#\>I'm very very ah happy we requested it actually
<#\>It's been a great night
<$J> <#\>Good well I hope you enjoy your meal and um I won't
bother you any longer <#\>I think my stop's coming up
<$L> <#\>See you later <O>laughter</O>
<$O> <#\>Okay, bye <O>laughter</O>.Bye
<$J> <#\>All the cooking is done in a small central galley where
they manage to turn out a variety of choices for entree and mains
<#\>For seventy five dollars a head diners get a five course meal
and there's a selection of wine and other drinks included in the
price <O>music</O> <#\>To make sure you don't end up with the food all
over your lap special stabilisers have been  fitted to the tram
and the driver's instructed to proceed at a very leisurely pace
as he makes his way through the city then along St Kilda
Esplanade and back down Toorak Road <O>music</O> <#\>And the trip
takes about three hours in all which is more than enough time to
enjoy a port and an after dinner chat unless of course you go in
the train bus <#\>The Colonial Restaurant Tram leaves from stock
twelve South Bank Boulevard in Melbourne seven days a week
<#\>There are two sittings for dinner <#\>The early dinner leaves
at five forty five and is three courses for fifty dollars <#\>The
second sitting leaves at eight thirty five and costs seventy five
dollars for five courses <,> eighty five dollars on Friday and
Saturday night <#\>Room rates at the Sheraton Towers Southgate
start at two hundred and twenty five dollars per room per night
and include breakfast, butler service and complimentary shoe
shine and clothes pressing on arrival <O>music</O></I>
