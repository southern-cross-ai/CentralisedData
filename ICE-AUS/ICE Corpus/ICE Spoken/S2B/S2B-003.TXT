<I><$A> <#\>A touch of brinkmanship from our new Premier <#\>John
Fahey
today told his Liberal and National Party colleagues<,> he'll
resign if their bitter internal row isn't sorted out <#\>The
threat follows a week of backbiting over the Liberal Party
Executive's decision<,> to run candidates against the
Nationals in two<,> New South Wales country electorates<,>
<$B> <#\>Premier Fahey is attempting something John Hewson failed
to achieve last week<,> dominance over the Liberal Party's New
South Wales Executive
<$C> <#\>And I've made it abundantly clear that ah<,,> if the
coalition agreement in New South Wales is not<,> kept in
place<,,> for the nineteen ninety five state election<,,> then
I'm not interested<,> in leading the Party
<$B> <#\>The fight began when the Liberals endorsed Bill
Heffernan<,> to run against its coalition partner in the
electorate of Riverina<,> On Friday Dr Hewson conceded<,,>
he'd been unable to stop them
<$D> <#\>It's time to get on with the job <#\>Enough is enough
<$B> <#\>While Tim Fisher tried to calm things down<,> other
Nationals fought on<,,> Wal Murray claiming the Liberals are
now run by faceless men <#\>National Party Minister Robert
Webster went further<,> calling Liberal Chairman Peter King<,>
an unguided missile
<$E> <#\>Somebody who appears to be determined<,,> to wreck the
Federal coalition<,> for dubious political gain 
<$B> <#\>Throughout the week one group has been noticeably
silent<,> the Liberal Party Executive <#\>It refused to bow to
repeated requests from Dr Hewson and Mr Fahey to abandon three
cornered contests <#\>Again today<,> a refusal to respond to the
Premier's resignation threat
<$F> <#\>John Fahey has one card up his sleeve<,,> a new
executive
to be elected in October <#\>He'll be working hard to ensure<,>
it's on his side<,> Paul Keating<,,> is watching the
spectacle with glee
<$G> <#\>If I said to my Party<,,> that I wanted a change of
policy and my Party said no<,,> <O>inaudible</O> would rate
write <quote>Prime Minister no longer in charge</quote> 
<$F> <#\>John Fahey seems determined to ensure that claim<,> is
not made about him <#\>Laurie Pattern ten<,> eyewitness news

of its heritage<,,> its majesty<,,> and also<,,> its unique<,>
imperfections <#\>It is called<,,> character
<$I> <#\>Today of all days can be pinpointed as Sydney's birthday
<#\>It's the anniversary of a passing of an Act of Parliament
proclaiming Sydney as a city<,> and also the election<,> of
the first Sydney Council<,> the first time<,> Sydneysiders<,>
were allowed to vote <#\>The official birthday follows a weekend
of celebrations including a massive fireworks display<,,> and
the heritage parade through city streets<,> watched by more

still the talk of Barcelona tonight <#\>It appears we have a good
chance of winning them<,,> and with five days to go until the
opening of this year's games<,> the Aussie team is confident
of a strong showing<,> <#\>Even Barcelona's heat<,> and smog<,,>
can't dent the enthusiasm<,,>
<$L> <#\>There are projects still unfinished in Barcelona<,>

games eight years from now<,> <#\>The professionalism<,> and
slickness of Sydney's presentation<,,> clearly<,> outpointing
its rivals
<$M> <#\>This candidature<,> has got the benefit of all of the
experience of Brisbane and Melbourne before it<,,> and the
dedication of the national whim will to bring the games back
<#\>I think it's an excellent bid and I think it's in there with
a
great chance to win
<$L> <#\>Although a decision on who host the games in the year
two
thousand<,> will not be made until September nineteen ninety
three<,> Sydney is now the front runner<,,> and officials are
quietly pointing out<,> that Sydney in September<,> is more
comfortable than Barcelona in July <#\>The Australian team came
here prepared for sweltering conditions<,> even bringing
fans<,> for their rooms but so far<,> they have not been
needed<,> <#\>Some of our swimming team have had a virus<,> but
all are now said to've recovered <#\>It's swimmers who have the
greatest pressure on them<,> especially gold medal hope Kieran
Perkins
<$N> <#\>And I have<,> you know kept the media<,> away from him
because<,,> you know he has enough pressure on him already
I<,> I don't want any more<,> <#\>Ah<,,> you know he's<,> got a
job to do and I don't want him distracted
<$O> <#\>Well talking about that job<,> just how is he at this
stage of his preparation
<$N> <#\>Going great
<$L> <#\>And even those who are usually confident<,,> seem<,>
extra keen for the games to start

ah<,> jubilation for many<,> New South Wales farmers after
heavy rain fell across widespread areas<,> of drought affected
ah<,> country areas this weekend <#\>Nearly seventy percent of
the state is drought stricken<,> and good follow up rains will
be needed to<,> break the drought
<$R> <#\>In the state's north<,> there haven't been any sizeable
falls of rain since last December <#\>The wheat and barley crops
have been held back<,> and graziers<,> forced to handfeed
stock<,> but up to sixty millimetres fell during the
weekend<,> the best falls to the west of Moree<,> with more
good showers through the central west<,> and Riverina
<$S> <#\>The drought's not over <#\>I can't emphasise that too
much
<#\>I think ah<,,> we've it's a start<,> and ah<,> it's probably
a
good way for a drought to break
<$R> <#\>But there has been enough rainfall<,> to give hope to
farmers
<$T> <#\>The farmers are<,> feeling much better this morning and
hopefully if we get some follow up rains<,> we could be on the
way<,> to a major seasonal improvement
<$R> <#\>Further west<,> the crisis remains acute<,> many farmers
there<,> ready to walk off the land<,> but while some lucky
farmers were hearing a welcome sound of rain on the old tin
roof<,,> others were in Sydney hearing bad news<,> at the
annual farmers conference
<$U> <#\>Commodity prices are at an all time low<,> and nearly
seventy percent of the state<,> is in drought<,> <#\>For many
