<I><$A> <#\>Antarctica <#\>The least visited most isolated place on
earth<,> <#\>More people bought Ringo Starr's last solo album
than live here<,,> <#\>Fourteen million square kilometres<,> one
and a half times the size of Australia<,> of wind blasted
ice<,> into which only a fool would stumble unprepared<,,> <#\>I
was just such a fool<,,> <#\>You see<,> I'm trapped <#\>Trapped
in
an endless sea of ice <#\>The same ice that once crushed
Shackleton's ship Endurance<,> as though it were no more than a
Japanese car<,> <#\>No one can reach us <#\>There is no rescue<,>
<#\>We have no option but to wait<,> and hope<,> that the ice<,>
always moving<,> however slowly<,,> releases us<,> <#\>It may
take weeks<,,> or we may go the way of Shackleton <#\>Clinging
forlornly to the few belongings salvaged from our splintered
ship<,> marooned in the middle of a frozen ocean<,> hopping
from one ice flow to the next<,> listening fearfully to the
killer whales beneath us who at any moment<,> could burst
through the ice<,,> and swallow us whole<,> <#\>My god<,,>
<#\>How
did I get here<,> <#\>This is not my beautiful home<,,>
<#\>Behind
me<,> four thousand kilometres north<,> lies comfort and
warmth and everything I love<,> and ahead<,> South<,> ever
south<,> lies<,,> Antarctica<,,> <#\>Will I ever get there
<#\>What
on earth possessed me to try<,,> <#\>It all began just one week
ago in a distant mystic city<,> they call Hobart<,,> <#\>It was
here that I boarded the German vessel Icebird<,,> chartered by
the Australian government to resupply its Antarctic stations
<#\>As I hoisted the family flag<,> my old school motto came
ringing back to me<,,> <#\><quote>Worse things happen at sea</quote> <,,>
<#\>Now
at last<,> I'd find out what they meant<,,> <#\>Down on the
wharf the air was thick with emotion<,> as family and friends
farewelled loved ones<,> many of whom wouldn't be returning
for more than a year<,> <#\>It was a powerful moment<,,> <#\>As
we
readied for departure I watched people sobbing
uncontrollably<,> and felt a lump in my throat<,,>
<#\>Touching<,,> that my absence should affect people so<,,>
<#\>I
didn't have the heart to till them I'd be back in five
weeks<,,> <#\>As the ship finally pulled away from the wharf<,>
I felt a great sense of relief<,,> <#\>We were underway at
last<,> and not before time<,,> <#\>That Dixie band had really
been giving me the shits<,,> <O>throwing up noises in
background</O><,> <#\>Oh dear <#\>Sea sickness so soon<,> <#\>I
decided
to find my cabin and<,> take the weight off my guts<,,>
<#\>Clearly this wasn't going to be a pleasure cruise
<#\>Determined<,> to be a happy camper I snuggled down<,> for my
first night at sea<,,>
               <O>comedy sketch</O><,,>
<#\>Antarctica by ship<,> is one of the world's great
journeys<,,>
<#\>We're heading to Casey<,> one of three Australian Antarctic
stations<,> <#\>To get there we must negotiate some of the
stormiest oceans in the world<,> deadly icebergs<,> and
several hundred kilometres of pack ice <#\>With luck<,> it will
take just seven days<,,> <#\>On day two<,> our luck ran out<,>
<#\>We hit the legendary roaring forties<,> and the ugly seas
they're famous for<,,> <#\>Well we've<,> encountered a bit of<,>
bad weather<,,> here on the<,> first<,> few<,> days<,>
out<,,> <#\>But<,> fortunately<,> most people<,> are taking
it<,> in their stride<,,> and<,> we're hopeful of<,,>
something a bit calmer<,,> <#\>Unless you've experienced a ship
rolling in high seas<,> it's hard to explain the difficulties
it presents<,> <#\>Even simple tasks become dangerous<,,>
<#\>And I
was one of the lucky ones <#\>At least nobody was calling me<,>
<quote>sickbag the sailor</quote> <,,>
     <#\>Excuse me sir <#\>I understand you've been ah<,> fairly
sick
since we ah<,> hit the ocean
<$B> <#\>Oh well just slightly <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Just slightly <{><[><,></[> <#\>Well what exactly<,> does this
sea
sickness feel like<,>
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>Um<,> basically<,> you feel a<,> queasiness in your
stomach<,> and then that builds up and you start<,> coming up
to a<,,> like it's going to come up<,>
<$C> <#\>You get sort of yellow inside your head<,> and then it
creeps down to your stomach and everything you've eaten
appears to be attached to a rubber band<,,> and back it
comes<,>
<$B> <#\>Just before it comes up a sensation of panic and you<,>
reach for your sickbag
<$A> <#\>Which you always carry with you <{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Which well<,,></[></{> since I sprayed a pile of vomit all
over the floor of um<,> the toilet back there I carry the bag
with me<,> ready on the draw<,> and then basically<,,> in
there and um<,> it ends up feeling very warm<,> in your
hands<,> which is also a bit disconcerting
<#\>Seasickness is incurable<,> and the only way to deal with it
is to try and put the nausea out of your mind<,> by thinking
of something wholesome<,> such as<,> a cup of fat with a hair
in it<,> <#\>Either that or get some fresh air<,> something
everybody did when we spotted our first iceberg<,> just three
days out of Hobart<,,>
     <#\>Call that an iceberg <#\>I've got bigger things in my
martini <#\>Huh<,,>
      <#\>It's said that the two best events on a polar voyage
are
the first and last sight of ice<,,> <#\>Our first iceberg had
occurred unusually far north<,> which accounted for its lack
of size<,,> but as we new age guys know<,> size isn't
everything<,,> <#\>Even small icebergs can be dangerous
<#\>Luckily<,> the ship was well prepared<,,> 
     <#\>This is the bow<,> the pointy end of the ship and<,> as
you might expect<,> it is specially strengthened to cut
through the ice<,> <#\>Allow me to demonstrate<,,>      
<#\>Unfortunately the excitement of the first iceberg was
shortlived <#\>No others were immediately to be seen and soon<,>
the tedium of life at sea began to sink in <#\>Fortunately<,> we
were all assigned chores to keep ourselves busy<,> <#\>Despite
my
status as ship celebrity<,> I welcomed the opportunity<,,> 
     <#\>This is bloody disgraceful <#\>At the ABC we've got news
readers to do this kind of thing<,,> 
     <#\>At nights<,> we'd gather round the bar<,> and sing old
songs of the sea<,,> <#\>Having crossed sixty degrees south<,>
we were now formally inside Antarctic waters <#\>This was both
a
wonderful<,> and a terrible thing<,,> <#\>Why terrible<,>
<#\>Because traditionally at this time<,> King Neptune comes
aboard the ship<,> and welcomes new comers with a primitive
initiation ritual<,> not recognised by the Geneva
convention<,,> and at sea<,> there's nowhere to hide<,,> 
                    <O>comedy sketch</O><,,> 
<#\>My school was right<,,> <#\>Worse things<,> do happen at
sea<,,> <#\>We're about six hours away from the pack ice<,>
which may or may not allow us to get into Casey <#\>The bridge
is
closed due to the<,> bad weather conditions <#\>The captain
doesn't want anyone up there <#\>The air is freezing <#\>The
water
is more than freezing<,> in fact it's littered with tiny
icebergs which keep thumping into the ship <#\>Basically<,> it's
as if we're sailing to the very end of the world<,> <#\>Pretty
exciting really<,,> <#\>Mind you<,,> so is sex<,> and it's a
hell of a lot warmer<,,> <#\>We were now well amongst the ice
<#\>The time had come to find out what Antarctica had in store
for
those about to spend a year here<,> <#\>I spoke to Joan
Russell<,> who was heading down for her second winter<,> and
to Angie Rose<,> on her way south for the first time<,,>
     <#\>Angie has her expectations<,> but what's she really
gonna
find
<$D> <#\>Er<,> many things that she will see in a year at Casey
that<,> you<,> can't imagine<,,> the<,> beauty of it<,>
<#\>And<,> the<,> social stuff<,> is beyond the imagining too
because it's a situation that not many of us have ever been in
before
<$A> <#\>By the way<,> if you're wondering what that ah<,,>
banging noise is<,> while we're talking here that's because
we're <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Sorry if you can't hear it at home
but<,> that's nature for you <#\>What a bugger<,,> <#\>You're
really
truly here now <#\>This sure looks like  Antarctica  to me
<$D> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>In fact<,> seeing this<,> er today is<,>
is<,>
really brought it home to me <#\>The<,> the trip up until now we
were still being<,,> <quote>oh well yes <#\>We're<,> we're going
somewhere</quote> <#\>But<,> but now we've arrived <#\>And it's<,> yeah
it's fantastic
<$A> <#\>I get the impression that I'm coming into quite a closed
culture<,,> <#\>Is that<,> true<,,>
<$D> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Why<,> <#\>Why<,> why is it like that
<$D> <#\>I guess nobody wants to assault the myth <#\><{1><[1><,>That's</[1> 
on the most trivial level <#\>Of<,> of us all having been heroic
and ah<,> we've been there <#\>We've seen that<,> and survived
and we're on our way home <#\>Um<,,> perhaps nobody wants to
touch on the sore spots either<,,> and the hollowness<,,> <#\>You
know<,> the longing<,> <#\>The<,> that's the element of isolation
and being away from home that isn't talked about <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>The
hole in your heart
<$A> <#\><[1>Which is</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2> 
     <#\>Is sex<,,> an<,> a big issue in Antarctica
<$D> <#\>Your sexuality<,> <#\>Is<,> one of the<,> layers that
you
hang up<,> and and<,> put aside in order<,> you know<,> in
exchange for first prize <#\>I mean look at it out there<,>
<#\>You
know<,> that's one of the things that you<,> set aside
<$A> <#\>I guess<,> the more pertinent issue is<,> companionship
<$D> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>It's companionship and the<,> I<,,> I did<,>
I
personally experienced a<,,> a sickening longing<,,> for
physical contact<,,> <#\>You know for hugging and<,> and laughing
and touching <{><[><,,></[> not necessarily sexual at all
<$A> <#\><[>Right</[></{> 
     <#\>Do you think that's common<,,>
<$D> <#\>I imagine it's almost universal <#\>It's just not talked
about<,,>
<$A> <#\>We're deep inside the ship <#\>Right down<,> inside the
bow
which<,> as you may remember is the pointy part of the ship
<#\>Now normally<,> a boring and unremarkable place to be
except<,> when the ship happens to be breaking ice<,> in which
case the sound<,> is quite extraordinary<,,> <#\>The crash of
the ice against the bow was constant<,> as was the daylight
<#\>This being Antarctica's summer<,> we were now literally in
the
land of the midnight sun<,> and our sleep patterns were going
crazy<,> <#\>The only way I could get some rest<,> was to fool
my
body into thinking it was night<,,> <#\>Fortunately<,> though my
head is a brunette<,> my body is a blonde<,,> <#\>Sailing ever
southwards into the heart of lightness<,> some ugly truths
began to emerge<,,> <#\>As we head into the Antarctic<,> we've
been made well aware that many possible dangers await us and
we've been told<,> that at all times we must have this<,> the
<O>inaudible</O> Antarctic Field Manual in our hands <#\>It has
all sort of survival tips should we<,> fall into a crevasse<,>
should our helicopter crash into the ocean<,> <#\>Little things
like that <#\>But perhaps the most controversial part of this
manual<,> is page one hundred and thirty <#\>Emergency sources
of
food<,> and I quote <quote>penguins<,> may be killed by stunning
them with a blow to the head and then breaking<,> and cutting
the neck <#\>Cut the penguin down the front to remove the breast
meat <#\>Penguin stew is palatable provided the external fat is
removed<,> before cooking<,> and penguin liver<,> is
excellent</quote> <#\>Mmm mmm<,,> <#\>For us<,> penguins were only the
start
                    <O>sketch</O>
<#\>As we farewelled the Golden Orcas<,> we experienced an
unfamiliar sensation<,> <#\>Complete stillness<,,> <#\>Only
eighty
kilometres from Casey<,> the Icebird had ground to a halt<,>
<#\>We were trapped <#\>Clearly there were two options <#\>Sit
tight<,>
or do something stupid<,> <#\>The choice was obvious<,,>
<#\>Well<,> out of bad things good things come<,> <#\>As you can
see
we're stuck fast in the ice <#\>We could in fact be here for
weeks<,> <#\>A real bummer<,> but the good thing is<,> it's a
great opportunity<,> to practice my golf<,,> <#\>The Royal
Antarctic is one of the world's<,> great golf courses<,> <#\>The
clubhouse<,> a beauty <#\>I like to have a drink there after a
round<,> and the course itself<,> definitely of international
standard <#\>This first hole for instance<,> about four hundred
and twenty yards <#\>Perhaps the only real hazards are<,> the
water traps <#\>Fall in those and you're dead <#\>And of
course<,>
the occasional tree<,,> <#\>And of course the other problem<,,>
Weddell seals<,> <#\>Sorry<,,> <#\>By the time I returned to the
Icebird<,> a decision had been made to transport key personnel
to Casey by helicopter<,> and hope that the ship could break
through the ice later<,,> <#\>Excitedly<,> I donned my survival
gear<,,> <#\>Well<,> should I unfortunately go hurtling into the
sea ice I am<,> fortunately magnificently dressed for<,>
killer whales to come hunting for me</I>
