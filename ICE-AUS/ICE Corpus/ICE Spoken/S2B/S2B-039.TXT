<S2B-039>  <2003>
<I><$A> <#\>G'day I'm Don Burke and welcome to Burke's Backyard
coming to you tonight from the Royal Easter Show in Sydney and
at this very moment I'm in the clutches of the Robosaurus 
<#\>This is a giant creature that's come out from America <#\>It
goes up over forty feet in the air, weighs something like
thirty tonnes and it can just crush cars in its hand and chomp
them up in its teeth <#\>A terrifying creature <#\>It even blows
fire into the air <#\>Now we'll show you more about that shortly
but what else is on tonight's show <#\>Well some great stuff <#\>
<#\>You'll meet the world champion axeman David Foster who'll be
chopping here at the Show <#\>You'll meet Gladys who cooks the
best cakes and scones has won here for many many years and of
course she can give you the recipes on how to grow cook all
these things in your own home <#\>Also we're going to be road
testing the Great Dane so Fiona Fieron will show you all those
shortly <#\>We'll be looking at sweet peas as well <#\>But now
for
Robosaurus <#\>Incredible creature worth over six million
dollars and was designed by one of America's leading aerospace
engineers <#\>And just have a look at the flames that come out
of the nose of this creature<,,> <#\>He'll be here for the next
ten days seven thirty every night<,,> <#\>As I said before
Robosaurus is carnivorous that is he eats cars and this is
the first time he's actually eaten Australian cars like
Holdens and Falcons <#\>He's here for the ten days and then he's
gone for ever <#\>This is your only chance to see him <#\>The
cars
hardly provide even roughage in his diet <#\>He chomps through
them as if they were made out of tissue paper<,,> and then
sets them on fire as he breaths on them through his nostrils 
<#\>Then when he's finished with them he drops them
unceremoniously to the ground<,,> <#\>If you've never grown a
flowering annual plant in your life you should consider at
least one this one <#\>This particular plant is the sweet pea 
<#\>Stunning things <#\>They grow through winter when nothing
much
in the garden grows come in a great range of colours and of
course they produce a most wonderful perfume <#\>And if all that
doesn't convince you consider this <#\>They're ideal cut flowers
to bring inside the house<,,> and sweet peas must be amongst
the easiest of all garden plants to grow <#\>Firstly dig the
soil over then just go along and do a light dressing of lime
along your soil because all of the pea family including edible
peas by the way actually like a little bit of lime in the
soil <#\>Now by the way you wouldn't do this every year if you
grow them <#\>One year in every five is more than enough to put
your lime on <#\>Then a light scattering of a complete plant
food like Grow Plus or something is a good one <#\>Its a<,,>
just a little bit along like this <#\>You don't have to put huge
amounts in as long as you know your soil is reasonably fertile
a light scattering <#\>Now we've gotta dig that over once more
just to get it all in and we're ready to plant <#\>Now you'll
notice this soil is what we call dark damp <#\>If you have a
look at this it is dark soil <#\>Now that being the case you put
the seeds into that and you don't water them in <#\>You just
press them in <#\>Now that's the sort of packet you get 'em in
<#\>This is the variety we're using Colourdade <#\>It's a very
very
highly perfumed variety and it's got a great range of colours 
<#\>And the incredible thing about these plants is that they're
designed to grow the height of a paling fence <#\>In other words
sort of one and a half to two metres tall <#\>All you do is you
space them around about well two to three inches apart <#\>In
other words about fifty to seventy millimetres apart and you
push them down into the ground about twenty five millimetres
or if you like one inch <#\>Then you wait ten to fourteen days
for the germination to occur and the little green bits to
start poking their heads up<,,>  <#\>Sweet peas are also
sensational as pot plants <#\>Now here I'm putting a frame into
some potting mixture <#\>You might note we've added a little bit
of lime to the potting mix because remember as I said sweet
peas love their lime <#\>Now its don't forget by the way always
make sure there's the standards mark on your potting mix
because there's a lotta rubbishy potting mixes out there<,>
and just fill this up <#\>Now what we're gonna use in this is a
dwarf variety of sweet pea and that's the good news that<,>
there are many many many varieties of sweet peas in a huge
range of colours and lots of them are dwarf which means you
can use them in pots or for<,,> various other purposes <#\>So
all right <#\>Now this one<,,> is bijoux <#\>This is it here
<#\>It
only grows around about eighteen inches forty five centimetres
tall which means it's perfect for a pot like this <#\>And it's
the same story after that <#\>We simply<,> zip the seeds in at
a
spacing of around about<,> three inches all the way around 
<#\>Would you hold that for me <#\>You don't want it no<,,>
<#\>Now if
you'd prefer you can also grow sweet peas in a hanging basket 
<#\>There are some wonderful hanging basket varieties
<#\>Probably
none better than this little one <#\>Now isn't that pretty 
<#\>That's cupid <#\>Now it says new but in fact it's new but
very
old <#\>It was rediscovered in New Zealand <#\>This particular
variety was put out this is a Horton's seed catalogue from
round about nineteen hundred and here it is when it was
originally released <#\>It was bred in about eighteen ninety
eight <#\>Cupid uh there it is beauty cupid <#\>I would think
that's the one we're getting and by the way at the time they
were<,,> sixpence <O>laughs</O> for five plants <#\>But there you
are <#\>This particular variety will look sensational in that
hanging basket <#\>Now what we will do over the weeks ahead is
we'll follow up on the basket the pot and also on the fence
there to see how they go but please note now is the time to
put in your sweet peas wherever you live in Australia and of
course don't forget that if you're growing them in a pot put
in some Osmacote or Nutracote or something as well <#\>When we
return tonight's road test the Great Dane 

               <O>ad break</O>

<$A> <#\>There really are some extraordinary sights at the Royal
Easter Show this year <#\>This little black bull is very small
indeed and the one behind him is white and huge <#\>It's a
Chianina bull<,,> <#\>It would be the largest released <#\>The
tallest bull<,> at the Royal Easter Show and this little chap
has to be the smallest <#\>In fact he's equal to the world's
smallest bull that's every been produced <#\>He's basically
fully grown at two foot ten inches tall <#\>Very very tiny
<#\>And
in fact at this height he's only about two thirds the height
of a fully grown great Dane and they're the subject of
tonight's road test with Fiona Fearon<,,>

<$A> <#\>Well congratulations Rob and Fiona from all of us at
Burke's backyard <#\>Now it won't be long before the two of you
will be coming out to the Royal Easter Show with the kids to
uh feed the lambs in the Wespac farmyard nursery <#\>It's
tremendous fun<,,> <#\>Of course you feed the lambs milk and
somebody who knows all about milk is Rosemary Stanton
<$D> <#\>Well I'm dressed for the part but it's a long while
since
I've done this so we'll have to see how I go<,,> <#\>Well the
skill hasn't completely left me I've got about enough milk
here so far for a cup of tea <#\>You know humans are unique
among mammals in that they continue to drink milk after
they're weaned <#\>If you give your dog or cat very much milk
it'll get diarrhoea and some people are a bit like that too 
<#\>They lose the enzyme that they need to digest the sugar in 
milk and if they drink more than just oops a small amount of
milk<,,> they end up with tummy pains and diarrhoea <#\>Some
people also have a milk allergy <#\>Kids sometimes get it but
they usually grow out of it by the time they're about three or
four <#\>But you know milk allergy is not nearly as common as
most people think <#\>Only about ten percent of the kids whose
parents think they have a milk allergy actually have one<,,>
<#\>Most of us haven't got a cow in the back yard so we have to
go
to the shop to buy milk and we've got a great variety to
choose from <#\>For children under five you should get regular
milk because they need its vitamin a and its fat but after
that the fat becomes much less important so you can choose one
of the low fat varieties <#\>There are several <#\>Probably just
choose the one that you like the taste of the best<,,> <#\>Some
people hate using skim milk in their tea and coffee cause it
sort of looks blue <#\>Well if you're only going to use skim
milk in your tea and coffee don't bother because you're not
going to get very much fat that way anyway <#\>But if you're
going to drink milk or put it on your cereal then it makes
sense to go for one of the low fat varieties <#\>These days you
can also get concentrated milks<,> which are very rich in
calcium <#\>They're terrific for women because women need loads
of calcium to build good strong bones <#\>But if it all seems a
bit too complicated and you don't know which one to choose at
least you can know whichever milk you choose you're going to
be getting a good source of calcium 
<$A> <#\>Well good luck with the judging Bubbles and of course
we'll let you know on next week's program how she got on <#\>Now
have you ever wondered when you're walking through the areas
of the show the cattle who produce a lot of this stuff here
how do they deal with it <#\>Well this is a special mixture of
sand and sawdust <#\>There's over one thousand five hundred
cubic metres of it trucked in and it's trucked out at the end
recycled and turned into a landscaping product so nothing is
wasted <#\>But<,> Margaret Bates has another use for this stuff

               <O>segment omitted</O>

<$A> <#\>These superb orchids are another one of the magnificent
displays at the Royal Easter Show <#\>Now coming up after the
break we'll announce the winner of the free flowers every week
for a year competition and also we'll teach you about the
latest trends in cottage gardens

               <O>ad break</O>

<$A> <#\>When you come to the Easter Show you're likely to
confront gigantic animals like this Brahman bull here <#\>Now
it's very tempting to reach out and touch them but you
shouldn't do that <#\>There is an etiquette to how you should
behave and the reason is they have huge muscles that drive
these very powerful legs and they can and will kick you
particularly if they're a bit nervous <#\>Ah there's a particular
warning here for mums with babies in strollers <#\>Don't wheel
them up at the back of a beast because the animal may get
scared kick out and could easily damage your child <#\>Now if you
wanna touch the animals they'll be a handler nearby or an
owner or somebody <#\>Talk to them <#\>Don't touch the animals
also
around the head <#\>A lot of the cattle they don't really like
that but do try and establish eye contact <#\>That establishes
some sort of relationship with them</I>
