<S2B-047> <2005>
<I><$A> <#\>I've gotta start by saying that I really know
bugger all about the media ah <O>laughter</O> and so please
bear in mind that any ah any comments that
I do make come with the va the waver that
I'm ah at best a benign ah a benign 
pretender and at worst a ah a complete
charlatan <O>laughter</O> <#\>I ah I sort
of came by what I do ah now find myself doing by absolute
chance<,> ah and if the same total absence of quality control
that ah that allowed me to get to do what
I do<,> is to be applied to all sections of the media ah then
it's no wonder that just about every aspect of it ah are in
such dire straits <#\>Ah I came to it um<,> by doing a
children's television mini-series ah ah and I bumped into a
chap called Greg Pickhaver who plays HG Nelson <#\>The show we
were doing was called Five times dizzy<,> and Greg and I
played sort of minor harmless avuncular peripheral characters
<#\>Ah I was Professor Dim and ah he was Mr Wilson and ah we
had no christian names and ah as is always the case with ah
minor peripheral harmless avuncular figures you find yourself
bored beyond belief ah <O>clears throat</O> hanging around
waiting to be the background action<,> trying to be as
ensemble as possible by not drawing too much focus away from
the foreground action <#\>Now we spent three months off and on
doing this<,> ah essentially re-acting <#\>Ah anyway at that
time Greg was being HG on Triple Jay for about five minutes
every morning where he delivered a a 
ferocious monologue which was sports related and ah having
spent many a bored hour in the caravan with Greg rabbiting on
about things ah we sort of found we had quite a bit in common
<#\>We had theatre<,> ah an academic background in theatre<,>
some disillusionment with theatre and ah a severely ironic
attitude toward sport and the media treatment of sport and at
the same time Greg being an Adelaide and Melbourne person he
had very little knowledge about the rugby league <#\>So ah I
introduced him to the mystery and mythology of rugby league<,>
its history the rules<,> ah the legends and its drive to
embrace show business as quickly as was possible
<O>laughter</O> um and so he asked me to join him on Triple
Jay and so for about twelve months there were then two
reasonably ferocious monologues on the Triple Jay breakfast
program <#\>Ah then after calling the nineteen eighty six
grand final which ah gained some reasonable media feedback ah
Greg had the idea for a full program on the and and the powers that be ah said yes on the proviso
that it be a full shift in duration i-e four hours and that
the budget be one hundred dollars per week <O>laughter</O> and
um this ah this seemed more than
acceptable <O>laughter</O> <#\>Ah so we ah we started off and the total absence of quality
control to which I ah referred earlier came into its own
<#\>That is they seemed to tolerate watch which was for quite
a time a very very ordinary show <#\>Ah so we learnt on the
job<,> <#\>Now ah<,> I think the original cast was about five
people then gradually it just dwindled to to Roy and HG <O>laughter</O> <#\>Um<,> I went
with the name Roy Slavern although I did toy with the idea of
ah the name Ken Sheena <#\>I just wanted ah some sort of rural
rusty<,> strong raw-boned name but ah Roy Slavern it became
Roy being king and slave spelt with an e suggesting slave to
sport <#\>So<,> This Sporting Life which was ah essentially
satirical allowed us to say what we like<,> and ah I think in
the early years there were only two clear cut cases of
absolute slander <O>laughter</O> ah one being when I suggested
Ian Sinclair was a drug dealer <O>laughter</O> and <,,> and the ah the other was
an extensive and savage diatribe directed at Alan Jones
<O>laughter</O> ah where in a very thinly veiled<,> simile I
likened him to a smouldering piece of excrement in a heavily
fortified closet <O>laughter</O> <#\>So<,> ah management while
being broadly sympathetic <O>laughter</O> ah suggested that I
get to know the law in these matters and ah<,> this I subse subsequently tried to do ah with my
fingers crossed that nobody<,> had been listening to those
particular broadcasts and nobody had <O>laughter</O> <#\>Ah
mind you with This the South Coast News and I'm Paul Murphy I
did try to push the limits to what might have been possible 
um <#\>I think on one occasion I don't know why I selected
Peter Ross but ah Peter Ross presented himself to hospital
with his penis stuck in a milk bottle and a carrot wedged in
his rectum <O>laughter</O> <#\>Ah again there was no ah legal
redress <O>laughter</O> <#\>In nineteen eighty seven the
manager of two B-L<,> that is Peter Warne <#\>He approached me
about filling in for a few months ah on the afternoons <#\>Now
being a job jobbing actor I had no real
work on<,> and ah agreed to do it <#\>It was a lifestyle
program with a lot of music<,> and I had problems with it
because I hated the music and I wasn't interested in
ah in lifestyles <O>laughter</O> <#\>Ah so ah
there were arguments and the parting of the ways was never
really far from the surface<,> but I made a conscious decision
to try to bring the program around quite<,> selfishly actually
to what I was interested in but knew nothing about<,> ah and I
had ah a producer in Rec Rebecca Peters
who's here with us tonight who had similar interests ie space
the environment politics economics ah science and the law<,,>
<#\>And ah<,> I found that the universities were a great
untapped source for ah for metropolitan
radio or A-B-C metropolitan radio <#\>Ah so then I set out to
demystify the subject areas for both myself and for listeners
and the program tried to get to the bottom of a number of
issues namely<,> um how big is the universe<,> <#\>How did it
begin <#\>How might it end <#\>A big chew or big crunch
<#\>The jury's out <#\>What is it made of ah <#\>What is dark
matter ah <#\>What is ah <,> why is the ah
Hubble<,> ah telescope a dud <#\>What is the hubble constant
<#\>What is light ah <#\>What happens to the dinosaurs or what
did happen to them ah <#\>Has ten thousand years of male
hege male hegemony ah been a complete failure ah
<#\>How to things evolve <#\>Thank you very much for the
lights ah <#\>Why do lawyers get paid so much ah
<O>laughter</O> <#\>Why is there so much for them to do
<#\>What is the public to make<,> of the payment to Jan Murray
for the scalded wrist for example <O>laughter</O> <#\>Why are
we still a constitutional monarchy <#\>What are we to make of
General Treesetrino<,> <#\>Does acupuncture work<,> <#\>Why
the need for atonalism<,> ah <#\>What sort of deal was made by
the Whitlam Government in Indonesia over Timor and why<,> ah
<#\>Why does anybody listen to Ted Drane<,> Bruce Ruxton and
Senator Bishop and more importantly why does the media make
use of them so often and I think the simple answer is probably
laziness <O>laughter</O> <#\>Ah presenters like people who ah
can fill in time<,> ah with having to ask the minimal number
of questions <w>'cos</w> that's actual work<,,> <#\>Ah shows
can ah can easily become shifts and prenters presenters very easily shift workers
um because radio and television are ferocious in the way they
chew up ideas<,> unfortunately <#\>Now I've been presenting
the program for six years on and off and there's a real
problem for any show that becomes ideologically driven <#\>It
eventually becomes unlistenable<,> or you end up simply
preaching to the converted <#\>I remember clearly coming to
this conclusion when in one two hour program on a Wednesday in
nineteen ninety-one the subjects dealt with had included rape
of women in war<,> AIDS in Malaysia<,> the inflexibility of
the regime in Burma and the inevitable death of the Murray
Darling basin <O>laughter</O> <#\>Now all
individually individually <,> more than
worthwhile topics but the mix was wrong <O>laughter</O> and
listenership to the show to be frank was in crisis
<O>laughter</O> ah so steps had to be taken to leaden the diet
um<,> <#\>Now<,> I became ah both fatigued as well and ah
there was beginning to be for me substantial emotional toll
being taken not only fatigue<,> but I became convinced that
there was really little sense of hope in solutions being found
for anything<,> <#\>And perhaps more importantly they I became concerned that I would become as
desensitised to issues<,> as many as my colleagues had
become<,> ah <#\>So I had to quite consciously again construct
a performance mask<,> ah to enable the show to have the sort
of accessibility that would enable those issues deemed
important<,> to get a wider group of people <#\>Now the
difficult balancing act here is not to turn issues into
entertainment as commercial radio does <#\>Ah Alan Jones and
John Laws to garner audience reaction find a spotting of soft
targets<,> galvanises a large audience <#\>One simply takes a
statement like ah there are too many dole bludgers<,> ah AIDS
is a disease brought about to punish the gay community<,> or
that single mothers have created their circumstance so as to
take advantage of social service benefits <#\>Now this becomes
real red rags to the loonier talkback enthusiasts <#\>I've
heard Stan Zemanek accept listener views that homosexuals
should not be allowed to travel on buses <O>laughter</O>
<#\>I've heard Arch Tambacker state categorically that if a
restaurant chef has AIDS<,> that it can be easily passed onto
the customers<,> <#\>I've heard the nation's most popular
breakfast announcer target for derision<,> Aboriginal single
mothers<,> surely the most marginalised people in the nation
<#\>But this is justified because it's popular<,> and it gets
the listeners and the sponsors in and they love it <#\>Now to
broaden my base<,> I've introduced two<,> sadly talkback
segments building and gardening <O>laughter</O> <#\>Well
because well well mm yes<,,> <#\>For a start I hate
talkback<,,> <#\>I cringe I do when A-B-C presenters daily say
we might throw the lines open and get your thoughts
<O>laughter</O> <#\>To me talkback is at best an excuse for a
better idea<,> and in gardening and building at least I felt
that the benign nature of the subjects could allow for the
passing of soft environmental advice<,> and I think in both
instances this has been the case <#\>My oh why I don't
lose sl I don't lose sleep over it might I say
<#\>As I speak the winds of change however are blowing through
the A-B-C<,> with pressure coming to apply<,> to the
metropolitan stations the same techniques used by the
commercial stations <#\>I-e<,> extensive audience research and
sampling to find out what issues are concerning people<,> and
target those areas as stories i story
ideas <#\>Now this<,> is ah simply to get the numbers
up<,,> <#\>Now what worries me is that<,> who then ever sets
the agenda<,> <#\>Eventually things start feeding on
themselves and the programming throw becomes narrower and
narrower <#\>Note the battle between Real Life and A Current
Affair <#\>Inevitably any pretence of current affairs
disappears and it becomes solely entertainment <#\>Both
programs have become the equivalent of Neighbours<,>
<#\>Mindless and vacuous <#\>If the programming laws<,> that
ah govern the commercial radio and television mediums was to
carry into literature<,> there would be no room ever again for
a Chekov or a Mamet or a Joyce<,> or logically Tom Keneally
or a David Malouf<,> unless they adjusted their styles to suit
Picture or People magazines <#\>Of this there is little doubt
<#\>And Alan Bleasdale or Dennis Potter would never be given
an opportunity <#\>So for change Social Change
Media <,> and those interested in redressing the
actions of ah of a ag avarice or<,> ignorance or both<,,> while the
sensibilities of those in the know<,> including those in this
room have never been higher<,> the opportunities to broaden<,>
that throw are facing a ceiling not made of glass but made of
steel crafted by the bean counters<,,></I>
