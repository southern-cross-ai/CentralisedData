<I><#\>That's the salum sump <#\>Ah the salum sump is a tube that I suggest people use if you're going to need to aspirate it because its got that airway which ah allows the air to go in as the aspirator the theory is that you're less likely to damage the stomach mucosa and you're more likely to get an accurate ah reading <#\>And of course the thing is the tube's got to be in the bottom of the stomach <#\>Um with that airway it's<,> closed for feeding <#\>At any other time it's open for aspiration or for drainage or for if it's on suction <#\>So it's when it's feeding it's closed<,> <#\>It's quite a good tube it's very cheap two dollars ninety nine and ah they do say you should change them weekly but I've never found any reference to that and ah I think er if it's still in after thr going on three weeks you need to change it <#\>At that stage a decision should be made about whether the patient's going to a fine board tube or a gastrostomy anyhow<,,> <#\>Please ask any questions as I go if you want to <#\>That's a little riles tube and certainly the c four c which is the <O>inaudible</O> ward here like to use this tube <#\>I reckon if you can put that tube in you can put any tube in I think it's the most difficult tube to insert <#\>Nice and cheap two dollars ninety nine and is appropriate for a patient who may be um restless and the tube may be dislodged from time to time <#\>It's quite a good little tube<,> <#\>That's the flexi flow french gauge eight tube <#\>I think it's quite a good tube um I would like to actually look at what is available on the market in the next ah couple of months but that's the one we're using here at the moment <#\>As I said before any fine board tube at Westmead requires a chest X-ray to confirm the position of it <#\>It has the advantage it's nice and long so if you're going to feed the patient the <O>inaudible</O> that tube will reach down OK <#\>It needs to be flushed fourth hourly with water otherwise it will be blocked and of course before and after medications <#\>I've got a slide showing an interesting ah occurrence with that later on <#\>The ah opening on that tube I like because if that tube blocks ah you can't unblock it the water will squirt back at you <#\>I don't think nosogastric tubes should be unblocked <#\>I think they should be you should prevent them blocking by flushing them fourth hourly particularly these fine ones but um if you try to unblock a tube you'll probably find you've just burst it above the blockage <O>inaudible question from audience</O> <#\>Yes, they're twenty-two dollars fifty <O>inaudible question from audience</O> <#\>Providing it's within the first you know week or week and a half yeah <O>inaudible question from audience</O> <#\>Well they say on the package this tube ah should be changed after three months but I have had patients with them that have gone eight months and they've<,>been OK so I have a theory if it's working leave it alone <O>inaudible question from audience</O> <#\>Yes you can aspirate with these <#\>I've aspirated a litre and a half from those <#\>That came from the first tubes that came in that wer that collapsed very easily <#\>But with these tubes you can aspirate but I wouldn't use them for routinely aspirating because they're not going to be as rat as accurate as a salum sump but you can yes <#\>I had a man who I was called up to put a tube in and when I got up there I got out of the lift and I could hear this person breathing and I thought 'God he's about to die surely' and when I got there it was the patient that I was going to put a nosogastric tube in to feed <#\>So anyhow I sort of hesitated a bit but I it was a few years ago and I thought 'Oh well I better do it' and I put the tube down and when I aspirated I kept getting more and more in fact, I think, a litre and a half of fluid so I changed over to a salum sump and drained him and by the time I'd emptied his stomach I rang the resident and suggested he put the patient on suction and IV rather than ah feed him and you know his ah breathing had settled down and his colour was much better etcetera etcetera so yes you can aspirate from them <#\>But it's not I wouldn't recommend it putting it in for that specific reason<,,> <#\>That's the pons ponski gastrostomy tube with an added adaptor on the end ha ha <#\>Um<,> these tubes are quite good there are some complications with them which I'll talk about<,> now <#\>Let's talk about them now <#\>No I'll talk about them later 'cause I've got something else similar <#\>Ah one of the disadvantages of this tube is you can see through it and so people ring me up and say<quote> the tube looks dirty Joan how can I clean it</quote> <#\>Whereas the white ones they can't see through they never worry about <#\>But I can understand that <#\>So that's the g that's the per one of the percutaneous gastrostomy tubes <#\>Th they do look better they do don't they but they still can't go to dinner <#\>Still problems <#\>Oh that's the um kangaroo pump and the gravity bag there <#\>I think I've got a close up of those later <#\>These are just the complications tubes blocked avoid blocking pulled out the most common cause of a tube being blocked out when I did the survey back in nineteen eighty eight was ah an irritable head injured patient<,> dislodged <#\>Kinked tubes are not kinky tubes are not uncommon ha ha <#\>Ah if you if you want to know if a tube's kinked when you go to push something into it it sort of bounces<,> and ah if you suspect the tube is kinked if you pull it back a little way and try and push fluid through at the same time sometimes you can unkink them<,,> <#\>Problems with feed insufficient in the ward mechanical problems or ah the tube the feed may have curdled changed daily <#\>I've got changed daily because ah they do say change the bags daily but quite frankly my experience is those bags can be used as long as they're functioning <#\>Certainly in a nursing home I recommend that as long as a tu the tubes the bags are working use them as patients at home the same <#\>At Westmead hospital some wards change them daily and some don't <#\>I know you can run them for two days without washing and it won't curdle but it certainly will on the third day that's been my experience in an air conditioned hospital <#\>Um and if you have the facilities to wash them do <#\>Ah the thinking with these bags should be the same as for a cheap plastic mug <#\>You buy a cheap plastic mug maybe it's going to last one day maybe it's going to last a month and if it's still working you can use it <#\>Alright <O>inaudible question from audience</O> <#\>Yes, yes I know of a place where they've got thirteen um comatose patients all on entrail feeding and they change the bags every day and I have rung up and spoken to the staff about this <#\>I've spoken to the section control people here who are quite happy about it and said <quote> Look you don't have to spend<,> ah a hundred and forty dollars a day on bags <#\>You can change them once every two weeks just wash them out</quote> <#\>But they're not happy with that so I can't do much about it but you don't you as long as they're working use them <#\>Patient's not going to get diarrhoea from that bag any more than they would if they used the cutlery and crockery that came around on the tray <O>inaudible question from audience</O> <#\>Ah what I recommend I don't I have not said to Westmead Hospital you can wash the bags because I haven't had time to survey it <#\>But my what I tell my home patients is that you can syringe them through with cold water then with warm soapy water <#\>Some people like to put in ah some half strength Milton and leave it sit in the tube for about a couple of hours and then they wash that out <#\>Um<,,> with um<,,> nursing homes I suggest the same thing and ah they certainly do work OK and there are some wards here that don't change them but they don't actually tell me <#\>All of that we've spoken about haven't we<,,> <#\>Regurgitation <#\>Malabsorption problems are very rare<,,> <#\>You might have them in those acute stages of course <#\>Nausea feed running too fast <#\>They're all common sense aren't they <#\>Everybody happy with that<,,> <#\>You've got to stop the feed if the patient vomits <#\>Often the patient vomits because the bags run through <#\>It's unusual to have a patient suddenly vomiting <#\>But really if the patient vomits you may need to consider putting a salem sump down to um<,,> to er<,> check the contents when you start again <#\>As I say there's a protocol for that in the ah ah those notes <#\>They're the sort of things you might think of when the<,> when the feed's starting again<,> <#\>I suggest that feeds start at thirty mils an hour full strength and increased by thirty mils every two hours until you get to where you're going which is somewhere between ninety and a hundred and twenty that's if you're giving continuous feeds <#\>Don't give half strength feeds <#\>It's just a way to waste of er fluids if you've got an acute patient <#\>Oh let's all go out for a picnic<,> sounds nice <#\>Now this is an interesting tube <#\>This was in a patient who had a tracheo-oesophageal fistula <#\>Gave us lots of problems I can tell you this guy <#\>But anyhow he had this sort of tube in and you can put a two mil syringe on that and get a lot of pressure on it which you can see they did and they burst it right opposite his tracheo-oesophageal fistula<,,> <#\>And it feels as if the tube is actually unblocked <#\>That tube was never going to unblock and most tubes that ah oh look I've got a thingo <#\>Never had one of these before <#\>God I can hear myself running ha ha<,,> <#\>These are bad if you're shaking <#\>I discovered that when I was giving a um a you know papers at the conferences but that tube was never going to unblock as you can see there and most tubes will be blocked about there<,> and you're not going to push that through all you're going to do is oh there it is <#\>Keep losing it <#\>Anyhow must tubes are going to ah ah burst <#\>Can anybody see where it's gone <O>laughter</O> <#\>Three or four inches from the end and you're going to be feeding in the lower esophagus which isn't the best thing to do <#\>Got it <#\>Well anyhow <O>laughter</O> it's fun to have these toys isn't it <#\>And there's a close up on the hole<,,> <#\>And this is the other one I was talking about with that <O>inaudible</O> tube <#\>Now that tube was in a patient for eight mon eight weeks and he never had much to say about it and one morning he woke up and he he said it was uncomfortable didn't feel right and the nurse ah the nursing ad manager had a chest X-ray taken and you can see that that tungsten end was ah missing half of it and when the chest X-ray was looked at it <#\>Oh I hope it works this time<,,> <#\>There the resident walked in and I said to him <quote> Hey what do you think Bob <#\>Can we feed the patient</quote></I>
