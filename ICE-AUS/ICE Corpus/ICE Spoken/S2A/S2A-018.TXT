1277 CORPUS WORDS</&>
<I><$A> <#\>Roy uh <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>He's a very quiet bloke <#\>Takes his racing very very
seriously
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Uh <?>when there's an</?> apprentice at the age of three
and has been uh racing daily ever since
<$A> <#\>And as we see the uh placings now uh <?>signal</?>
Vintage Crop horse number six <#\>Uh well a tremendous run to
overtake in the uh from the clocktower on Tiaco Nick who set
all did all the hard slogging work but's paid a fortune for the
placing <#\>And Mercator Roy uh at paying thirty dollars for the
place and u- <#\>Gee that'll stiffen the quinella and the
trifecta
<$B> <#\>Yes it will
<$A> <#\>I'd love to see the third horse stiffen the quinella
just incidentally
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>But uh <#\>Gee uh
<$B> <#\>And Gay Waterhouse Gay must be very very satisfied with
that Ray that ride uh by Tiaco Nick <#\>Uh I mean as we we did
say was going to take over the lead very very early did so but
it almost had enough petrol to get there almost <#\>I mean
obviously the horse now has prob'ly had a heart attack and is
being shot as we speak <#\>But uh certainly got the best out of
that horse <#\>I've never seen it I've I've never seen a horse
like that with very limited ability very small heart uh you know
not suited to the conditions behave so well <#\>I I don't know
what they did to that horse but full marks Gay <#\>I do- I don't
know what you did <#\>I don't know how you made that horse do
that but tremendous to see
<$A> <#\>And so the placings in the Melbourne Cup for nineteen
ninety-three first Vintage Crop second Tiaco Nick and third
Mercator <#\>And news coming in Diamond Basis Roy last
<$B> <#\>Diamond Basis was last was it
<$A> <#\><?>Isn't</?> that disappointing
<$B> <#\>Di- <#\>Who was on Diamond Basis
<$A> <#\>Well the uh inclement boy uh B Clements
<$B> <#\>Uh that's what we thought <#\>And Harry <#\>Any word on
where Harry <?>lost</?> it
<$A> <#\>Harry <#\>W- <?>I'd like to think</?> second last
<$B> <#\>Second last
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>With both the horse
<$B> <#\>With the horse being carried by Harry over the line
<$A> <#\>And Harry with uh what would you call it feet glowing
from the friction he <O>inaudible</O> from <?>the</?> pushing his
feet <O>inaudible</O> the brakes tryna get Diamond Basis past him
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Red hot
<$B> <#\>From the brake <O>laughs</O>
<$A> <#\>Well Roy obviously a very happy winner there and trainer
there of Vintage Crop and it's tremendous see the the cup being
able to be taken out buy international horses
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>And uh obviously a very lively finish you know
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>And it
<$B> <#\>Well I I mean it think it's a good thing <#\>Remember
when that Australian horse I've forgotten which one it was uh won
the Japan Cup <#\>I mean I I thought that was a goo- uh a
tremendous thing <#\>It put the Japan Cup on the international
map <#\>And I think having a a an Irish horse essentially come
out here and take all our money away I think that's gotta be
another good thing for putting it on the international map
<$A> <#\>And of course the crowd's going wild as I see Roy and
the ambulance pulling up just out of shot there <#\>And uh what
a tremendous win it is for uh this uh marvellous uh
<O>inaudible</O> out of overplay can <O>inaudible</O>chestnut
gelding <#\>And uh it was tremendous to see horse number five get
up there with an international favourite the crowd going wild
<#\>Obviously Melbourne people like your international jockeys
a lot better than they like your uh
<$B> <#\>They do
<$B> <#\>Was it an international jockey or was it a local jockey
<$A> <#\>No <#\>International jockey <#\>Came out here especially
to ride the <?>bucket</?>
<$B> <#\>O- Oh I thought the international jockey came out to
ride on Taps
<$A> <#\>He did <#\>Drum Taps <#\>Yes <#\>He did <#\>He
<O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>But there were two international jockeys come out
<$A> <#\>Two a- <O>inaudible</O> and <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Two international jockeys and two international horses
<$A> <#\>That's right <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>He was the Italian jockey on the taps
<$A> <#\>That's right <#\>On the taps
<$B> <#\>He didn't know the conditions <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>No <#\><?>Had Had</?> hopeless <#\>Yeah <#\>Well
obviously <#\>Yeah <#\>And the other boy knew the conditions
<$B> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>Obviously Italy and uh England <#\>There's a world of
difference between Italy and England
<$B> <#\>Oh <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>You know <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>Well one's Mediterranean and one not
<$A> <#\>And uh obviously <?>cert-</?> the old horse from England
suited by the conditions here today <#\>Absolutely perfect
conditions for uh Vintage Crop to bag the uh nineteen ninety-
three Melbourne Cup <#\>And so Roy uh you know your final
thoughts uh
<$B> <#\>Seven years old that horse <#\>Did you realise it was
seven years old only one year younger than uh
<$A> <#\>The Phantom
<$B> <#\>Than the Phantom which did <?>nothing</?>
<$A> <#\>Mmm <#\>Well I I would say it's got another Cup left in
it
<$B> <#\>I'd say <?>with</?> this rate it would have another four
or five cups <?>left</?>in it
<$A> <#\><?>And do</?> you know I'd p- I'd put it to you that
Black Knight could've won today
<$B> <#\>I think Black Knight could've carr- could've won it
<#\>I'd like to see these old horses come back and just keep
racing till they die on the track
<$A> <#\><O>laughs</O> <O>inaudible</O>
<$B> <#\>That would certainly get international interest
especially in Asia
<$A> <#\>And Roy uh you know before we uh wrap up the coverage
of the nineteen ninety-three Melbourne Cup you know a final
thought uh obviously a tremendous time for racing and uh for the
T A B generally
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>As we watch on replay now Vintage Crop's run <#\>This
is a tremendous run given that the first few horses were doing
nothin' goin' nowhere he's picked them up in the <?>shutters</?>
of the post really
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Look at <{><[><?>this this is a</?>M</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>That's right</[></{> <#\>And you can see Harry White pulling
back there
<$A> <#\>Ah yeah I can see
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Right on the rails
<$B> <#\>And Harry's got the smoke coming off 'is uh off his feet
<$A> <#\>Well he's running the horse right into the rail to try
and slow it up <#\>It's going too quick <#\>God they'll have to
repaint that rail <#\>And this is tremendous burst of speed
<#\>It reminded me a lot of Kiwi's win
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>Reminded me of Black Knight
<$A> <#\>Oh course it reminds you of Black Knight <#\>And Old
Roly <#\>God 'es a dead spit for Old Roly
<$B> <#\>And And uh touch of Tulloch
<$A> <#\>A touch of Tulloch <#\>And now of course on the inside
uh Tiaco Nick just getting there in front of Mercator Roy
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>Thanks very much once again for <{><[>coming down to Melbourne</[> and covering the Cup
<$B> <#\><[>Oh it's marvellous H G</[></{> <#\><?>It's</?>
<$B> <#\>Yes uh y- it <#\>Yes <#\>Thank you very much <#\>It's
always good to do it <O>laughs</O> <#\>And you can only feel a
little bit sympathetic for the connections of <?>Drum</?> Taps
<#\>I mean how stupid must they feel bringing their horse out
here twelve thousand miles just to do nothin'
<$A> <#\>So there it is ladies and gentlemen <#\>The nineteen
ninety-three Melbourne Cup <#\>The results well who could've
thought any otherwise really <#\>Vintage Crop first <#\>A
magnificent run from the international horse Tiaco Nick
<#\>Gay Waterhouse thinks that uh Roy finishing second is as good
as a win <#\>I find that very difficult to believe Gay <#\>And
third Mercator <#\>And uh by God they'll still be work
calculating the trifecta on the nineteen ninety-three Melbourne
Cup in a fortnight's time <#\>I'd say it was in the three billion
park <#\>So if you've got it congratulations <#\>Numbers six five
and ten <#\>And that takes us away from Flemington for nineteen
ninety-three <#\>Remembering This Sporting Life returns with a
studio uh production on Saturday between at the usual time
<#\>And of course we leave you with the simple reminder that
triple J is sport <#\>Bye now
<$Z> <X><#\>So there it is ladies and gentlemen this year's
Melbourne Cup <#\>As the nation picks up the <?>tool</?> once
again This Sporting Life signs off from Flemington realising that
winners are grinners and losers there's always next year <#\>See
ya later horse buffs</X></I>
