<S2A-014> <2001>
<I><$A> <#\>The annual parade through the crowded streets of
Sydney has started as you can see with that cavalcade of cabs
carrying those veterans who could no longer make it on their own
<#\>Some are blind <#\>Some are limbless <#\>Others whose service
to their country has incapacitated them <#\>Today we salute them
all and pay tribute to the taxi drivers who donate their time and
cars to ensure that these veterans can play their part on this
one day of the year <#\>It's an ideal morning in Sydney this
morning <#\>It's pleasantly warm <#\>There's a heavy overcast of
cloud uh keeping the temperature down to an acceptable level
remembering that many of the diggers <?>know</?> what the average
age of a World War Two digger now is seventy-five years <#\>So
the conditions are ideal for those who are taking part in the
march <#\>And already the streets of Sydney are crowded and
notable among the crowd are the young people who are
enthusiastically waving their flags as the procession goes by
<#\>Now before I go any further let me introduce you to our ANZAC
unit <#\>First of all to speak on behalf of the Navy Commodore
Paul Berger L V O <#\>Good morning Paul
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\>Good morning Bill
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> Paul what's an L V O
<$B> <#\>Oh Lieutenant of Victorian Order <#\>Uh sorry Bruce uh
<O>laughs</O> it should be uh <#\>Yeah <#\>Lieutenant of
Victorian Order <#\>Uh I uh helped with the Royal Tour in
nineteen seventy-seven
<$A> <#\>Right <#\>Pleased to have you with us <#\>And Bill
Fogarty <#\>Vietnam veteran twenty-five years and uh military
service <#\>But now Bill is known throughout Australia as a
Senior Curator at the War Memorial in Canberra <#\>Lovely to have
you Bill
<$C> <#\>Good morning Bruce <#\>Thankyou <#\>And good morning
viewers
<$A> <#\>And to speak for the Air Force Squadron Leader Ernie
Stanton <#\>Uh Ernie after a distinguished uh career in the Air
Force is now the State Secretary of the R double A F Association
<#\>Hello Ernie
<$D> <#\>Good morning Bruce
<$A> <#\>And Colonel John Moore <#\>John uh is uh a also a very
familiar sight and voice in broadcasts <#\>He was a former
broadcaster <#\>Uh his great military knowledge was acquired
during his period as Assistant Director of uh Defence as the
Public Relations Officer <#\>Hi John
<$E> <#\>Hello Bruce <#\>Good to be with you again
<$A> <#\>And we have a roving reporter out among the marchers
<#\>Deidre Brennan <#\>We'll be making contact with Deidre
throughout the morning's march <#\>Well whadda we see so far Bill
<$C> <#\>Well we're seeing those lovely taxis which everyone is
uh got up early this morning polished away made them absolute
picture so that the uh service men and women that are riding here
in the parade today are seen as one of the famous people who
fought for Australia
<$A> <#\>Paul we may just uh reflect on what today is about
<#\>The kinds of commemorations that are represented today
<#\>Seventy-eighth anniversary of the landing of ANZAC for
example
<$B> <#\>Yes um uh I think that's where uh Australians uh started
to understand themselves uh a little bit more at that time Bruce
<$A> <#\>Also commemorating the seventy-fifth anniversary of the
end of World War One the Great War <#\>And it's worth remembering
as we watch this cavalcade of cabs go by that more than eight
thousand Australians died in that Gallipoli Campaign in nineteen
fifteen <#\>Eight thousand <#\>The campaign that gave birth to
the ANZAC legend <#\>Australians fought in many battles on the
western front from nineteen sixteen to eighteen in France and in
Belgium <#\>And of the three hundred and twenty-four thousand
soldiers who sailed from Australia three hundred and twenty-four
thousand forty-six thousand died on the western front <#\>And
today I understand that worldwide of the Allied Forces who served
in World War One there are only two thousand left and of that two
thousand nine hundred are Australians <#\>Of those dead about
eighteen thousand have known no grave <#\>Those wounded one
hundred and fifty-two thousand one hundred and seventy-one many
of them wounded more than once <#\>Good morning to you <#\>What
a great day it is for him
<$C?> <#\>Still plenty of spirit there Bruce
<$A> <#\>Sure <#\>Let us remember that in Flanders the survivors
of enormous slaughters worked slowly and reluctantly out of
battle when ordered to withdraw <#\>The Light Horse in the Sinai
Desert fought against superior numbers and saved the Suez Canal
<#\>In nineteen eighteen the ANZAC Corps broke the Hindenburg
Line <#\>And they established a tradition of fighting quality
highly disciplined in action emulated by their sons in the Second
World War at Tobruk at El Alamein and <?>Tunisia</?> in Greece
in
Italy the near islands of the south-west Pacific <#\>In New
Guinea they were the main force that defeated one hundred
thousand Japanese <#\>Anzacs fought under the United Nations flag
in Korea <#\>And when terrorists threatened Malaya and Borneo
they helped to garrison the countries and restore order <#\>A
third generation have carried on the ANZAC tradition in Vietnam
<#\>Today as we witness these long ranks of veterans passing
through the streets of Sydney we pause for a moment and remember
those who did not return <#\>This is what Anzac Day is all about
<&>TEN-SECOND PAUSE</&>
<$E> <#\>Just seeing the uh cabs here on the street reminded me
of a cartoon which appeared in The Bulletin immediately after
World War One the Versailles Conference <#\>The U S president had
made a demand uh that he represented a country of twenty million
people <#\>And the cartoon showed a little digger uh our prime
minister at the time Billy Hughes gestulating and standing on the table and saying
<quote><#\>I represent a country of fifty thousand dead</quote> 
<$A?> <#\><?>Yeah</?>
<$E> <#\>That's what it's all about
<$A?> <#\><?>Yeah</?>
<$A> <#\>Ernie you know it's worth reflecting uh as we watch this
procession through the streets the turmoil and the bloodshed that
is highlighting our daily news at the moment <#\>Think of Somalia
<#\>Think of the Russians today the disintegration of the great
U S S R <#\>Uh think of Mozambique Cambodia Bosnia-Hercegovena
<#\>All feared as a bloodshed <#\>And we've been spared from such
catastrophes because of the people in those cabs because of the
people who are marching today for our political stability our
democratic government our freedoms and a lifestyle that can be
uh envied by anyone in any of those countries mentioned <#\>And
we've gotta say thankyou thankyou to those people
? <O>inaudible</O>
<$D> <#\>Can't become complacent <#\>These uh <O>inaudible</O>
served the world <#\>We're not isolated very far from them
<#\>And And we must always remember that we must have a strong
presence
<$E> <#\>In fact the late Admiral Sir David Martin two years ago
on Anzac Day put it very well <quote><#\>These people gave their
lives because they thought their families and their way of life
was worth that sacrifice</quote> 
<$B> <#\>There are a lot of wonderful old men uh we see there uh
keen to be part of the tradition that uh takes a lot to make them
miss one of the Sydney Anzac Day marches
<$A> <#\>And the other thing to think about gentlemen is and and
you have all been through it that when they went away they were
only kids weren't they just young naive young people with uh you
know the optimism of the future ahead of them
<$C> <#\>And they always say that the young people fight old
man's wars
<$E> <#\>Now there's a sight to behold five hundred national
Australian flags <#\>Very reminiscent Bruce of the lead of the
uh dedication of the Vietnam Memorial last year in Canberra that
five hundred flags here being carried by representatives of youth
groups throughout Australia on behalf of veterans <#\>This is a
new venture by the uh sub-branch or the R S L of New South Wales
<#\>Um and Colonel Tom Crawford down there in front of the flags
<#\>Support from the community for this project's been
overwhelming <#\>Each of these flags donated uh fifty-five
dollars each and the full supplement of five hundred flags has
in fact been reached <#\>These flags available in future on every
Anzac Day <#\>They will lead march in in here in Sydney <#\>And
of course uh will be used on other occasions as required
<$A> <#\>Who are the flag bearers John
<$E> <#\>There a range of people <#\>They uh represent youth
organisations throughout uh uh New South Wales and they are in
fact carrying them on behalf of veteran <#\>Each sub-group in New
Sou- uh sub-branch in New South Wales nominates a bearer to bear
a flag
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible</O> being led by the Scots College Pipe
Band
<$E> <#\>And there's none other better <#\>Scots College Pipe
Band a hundred strong <#\>They break down into four different
bands of twenty-five each <#\>This is their number two band I'd
say looking at the jackets <#\>Um but uh a first-class
combination
<$E?> <#\><O>inaudible</O> Australia at the uh Edinburgh Festival
on many occasions
<$C> <#\>Pleasing to see that some of the uh flag carriers there
wearing the medals on their right-hand side obviously
representing some relative who uh is unable to march today
<$A> <#\>Something inspirational isn't there about a pipe band
<#\>Uh makes uh makes you wanna march
<$E> <#\>Even number of the pipers from the Scots College are
wearing um decorations obviously of fathers or relatives
<$D> <#\>It was certainly marvellous to see those flags going
past and I hope those powers that be that think they might change
our flag can see 'em
<$A> <#\>Well said Ernie <#\>Might be a an appropriate moment
just to send a call to all those of you who uh can't be here
today for one reason or another <#\>You may be in hospital or at
home or in one of the war veterans' homes <#\>That's why we're
on the air televising this march <#\>We're taking it out to you
and we want you to know we're thinking of you and uh to know that
you have joined us through television not forgetting the nursing
sisters at the war veterans' homes <#\>Good morning to you all
<#\>We hope that it's uh a day of memory and in a way a day of
rejoicing for all of you
<$E> <#\>Flags still passing members of the school cadet forces
the Air Training Corps the Air League all representing uh youth
groups throughout New South Wales
<$A> <#\>Now on comes the mounted police escorts always a great
scene to see at the head of a march or parade <#\>Led by Sergeant
Don <@>Surname</@> <#\>It's fitting that the mounted police are
so prominent on Anzac Day because they did have a military
beginning <#\>Going back to the very earliest days of the colonies colonies<#\>Uh <?>why</?> in eighteen
twenty-five when Governor Brisbane recruited men from the
infantry re- regiments serving in the colony and formed the New
South Wales Mounted Police <#\>They're even exemplified in the
Waltzing Matilda <quote><#\>Down came the troopers one two
three</quote> <#\>These were they
<$E> <#\>We tend to forget too that they're the oldest mounted
police force in the world older than the Canadian mounties
<$D?> <#\>They also have a uh representation because uh it was
the uh the police force that gave a hundred and sixty horses to
the New South Wales Lancers to take to South Africa to the Boer
War which began in eighteen ninety-nine and continued till the
signing of the peace in nineteen hundred and two <#\>And there
were sixteen thousand S- Australians engaged in that war <#\>And
most of those were mounted troops
<$E> <#\>Now the cors- the horses were rather unique <#\>The
classic Australian breed the Waler <#\>Attempts now to
reintroduce them but they they'll never be quite the same <#\>And
of those horses only one came back
<$A> <#\>Whadda we seeing here now Bill the Australian Light
Horse
<$C> <#\>Well it's the Light Horse Association and uh known as
the Northern River Lancers <#\>Their history goes back to
eighteen eighty-six when the Upper Clarence Mounted Rifles were
formed which in turn became the New South Wales Lancers <#\>Then
the Fifteenth Light Horse which was mechanised during World War
Two when they became the Fifteenth Motor Regiment <#\>And they're
represented today by Re-enactments Association with their
uniforms as they were last century</I>
