<&>Legal Presentation</&>
<I><$A> <#\>Now of course you've heard the evidence this
morning of Mr um McPherson about that and curiously enough he
um has told you that he recognised the car as belonging to Mr
Halleday so clearly enough he too knew that the car was stolen
<,,> <#\>And the last particular lie that I will refer to
although you will undoubtably have detected many more <#\>I
put some to Mr McPherson today about ah things Mr Gill said
and Mr McPherson didn't agree with any of them but the last
one I'll refer to for the moment is that um they almost
certainly lied to Miss Brennan as well about whether they had
taken the car to Queensland because you'll recall the evidence
of Miss Brennan that she twice on her oath and I don't suggest
that she was making it up because they'd be no reason for her
to make this up twice told ah the judge that was dealing with
Mr Gill that um they had taken the car to Queensland <,> and
you'll recall the evidence given by Mr Gill and Mr McPherson
that that didn't happen <#\>Now what I would suggest is that
Mrs ah Miss ah Detective Brennan
would not have made that up <#\>There was no reason for her to
make that up and again it was just a total fabrication made by
Mr ah Gill as to where he'd taken the car and why did why he'd taken it there and again I would submit
that it led Miss Brennan unwittingly into misleading another
court <,,> <#\>The most significant thing in Miss Brennan's
evidence you might think <,,> is a proposition that she
advanced in answer to a question that I put that I would whole
heartedly agree with and that is this <#\>I put to her
<quote>you see your case as you conceded before against Mr
Halleday depends very much on Mr Gill</quote> <#\>Answer
<quote>yes it does</quote> <#\><quote>It depended on Mr Gill
being candid and truthful</quote> <#\>Answer <quote>that's
right</quote> <#\>And the fact of the matter is the case does
depend on your acceptance of Mr Gill as being candid and
truthful <,> <#\>Irrespective of what you find about any other
witness in this case the case doesn't get to first base unless
you're satisfied that Mr Gill is candid and truthful <#\>Miss
Brennan would accept that <,> <#\>I would certainly urge that
view on you <#\>In my submission to you you couldn't possibly
be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt or anything even
approaching reasonable doubt <,> that Mr Gill was an honest
reliable or accurate witness truthful or candid or any of the
other adjectives that would lead you into the view that ah you
could satisfactorily convict this man on that sort of evidence
<#\>To put not too fine a point on it it's the sort of
evidence you wouldn't swing a cat on <,> <#\>Now <,> alright
<,> given that that's the state of the evidence from the Crown
where does that leave Mr um Halleday <,,> <#\>It would be my
submission to you that Mr Halleday through his legal advisers
had moved heaven and earth <,> not just to create a reasonable
doubt <#\>You should have that just on the strength of the
Crown case alone <#\>He's actually moved heaven and earth
without any obligation to do so to convince you that not only
is there a reasonable doubt but he's probably innocent but
regrettably I can never ask you that question and neither can
<,> His Honour's ah associate when you come in with your
verdict <#\>Nobody's gonna ask you is Mr Halleday innocent
<#\>The only question you're going to be asked in respect of
each of the three charges is <quote>do you find him guilty or
not guilty</quote> <#\>This is one of those cases where
candidly it'd be nice to be able to ask whether you find him
innocent but you're not going to be asked that <#\>That is not
a question you've gotta answer for yourselves <#\>The only
question you're going to be asked is <quote>is he
guilty</quote> <,> <#\><quote>Are you satisfied he's guilty
beyond reasonable doubt</quote> and of course <,> once you
give your verdict it's final <#\>You can't sort of go home
after you've given your verdict and say <quote>gee maybe I
should've found that he was not guilty after all <#\>Maybe on
reflection I've thought about it</quote> <#\>Your verdict is
final one way or the other <,> and what I suggest to you is
that you don't look you don't have to look 
at all the evidence he's called <#\>You don't even need to get
that far <#\>That's more or less just a safety valve if you
like to try and <,> make sure that all the available evidence
is there in front of you because unlike the Crown the defence
had moved heaven and earth to investigate this case properly
<#\>Now ther's been a bit of <,> criticism of the defence as
to why we didn't tell the Crown and I'm not going to ah repeat
what I said about that earlier but the one thing you've
gotta be even if you thought there was any merit
in that keep in mind the timing of it all <,> <#\>You see
you've heard evidence about a preliminary hearing <#\>You know
that was in August of last year and you've gotta have some
understanding as to how these things occur <#\>What happens is
that after a person is charged they're given papers they're given the Crown's papers with the various
statements in them and you then have a preliminary hearing
where the defence have a chance to ask <,> the Crown witnesses
questions that they want to <,> to find out more about the
Crown case and that examination was carried out by my
instructing solicitor <#\>He examined Mr Gill and a number of
other people and found out various things about the Crown case
and it was only after that was done that it was even possible
to start carrying out the sorts of investigations that needed
to be carried out <,,> <#\>And had the police done what my
instructing solicitor did and that was go and speak to the
people at Mulkay Mazda to see whether there was any truth in
what Mr Gill said about drinking at the ca the
Coach and Horses Hotel they might've uncovered the
existence of a relationship between Mr Gill and Mr McPherson
that they had not been told about <#\>Now the learned
prosecutor says and to some extent correctly enough
<quote>they can't investigate it if they don't know about
it</quote> and to a very large extent the blame for that is must be seated home at Mr Gill <#\>I don't
run away from the fact that the primary blame for the police
being misled is Mr Gill <#\>He did not tell them the truth <,>
but to some extent <,,> the police could've gone behind Mr
Gill's evidence and just gone out and checked <#\>Spoken to
some people at the hotel maybe or gone to speak to the other
people at Mulkay Mazda <#\>Gone out to have a look at the
circumstances out there to see whether or not there was any
truth in the likelihood <,> of the story that Mr Gill was
advancing about going to the hotel and drinking at that
particular hotel because if they had done that they would've
started to see the first cracks in the story that Mr Gill was
advancing <,> <#\>What has Mr Halleday done given that he
doesn't have to prove a thing <#\>He doesn't have to prove
anything <,> <#\>He has proved his financial soundness <#\>He
has proved that the insurance policy is not what Mr Gill told
the police <#\>He has proved I suggest that the the drinking at the hotel at the Coach
and Horses just virtually <,> never took place at that
hotel <#\>Almost certainly the only drinking that took place
and there wasn't much of it you might think took place at The
Keg <,> <#\>He has proved that the jackets were not likely to
have been worn in the way in which Mr Gill said <#\>He has
established that the nights that ah Mr Gill thought that the
key hand ah was handed over to him that
he was almost certainly not there because he had been to the
doctor with his early afternoon off and you've got that little
Medicare slip and you'll see the date of the treatment on that
Medicare slip and you'll see a few other dates too of medical
treatment on that thing and you might want to tie those dates
in with the dates on the um ah the 
gymnasium cards to see whether or not ah there was any
particular ah um <,> period of time that Mr ah McPher ah Mr ah Halleday didn't attend the gym linking it
in to those um various medical treatments including you might
think the one that he didn't ah the one
that ah he's told you about on the ah on
the ah Thursday <,> <#\>He's got the gymnasium records
here <#\>He has done everything that a defendant can
reasonably be expected to do including bringing people from
the Northern Territory down to Victoria to try and prove a
relationship that'd hitherto been denied by the people
involved <,,> <#\>You've got the evidence now <#\>You'll
have the you've got those certificates from the
Northern Territory that Mr McPherson was there and applied for
a driver's licence in the Northern Territory and now at the
eleventh hour we've found out the reason why namely that he
was about to lose his licence here in Victoria for reasons
that weren't expanded upon <#\>And finally you've got all
these no not finally you've got all these workmen from
Mulkay's who've been called <#\>Everyone of the salesmen has
now given evidence on the on the various
points <#\>You've got evidence <,> of of course Mr ah ah
Halleday's good character and His Honour will tell you how you
can deal with evidence of good character <#\>It actually works
in two ways and I don't like my friend I
don't want to go into the law very much but evidence of good
character is evidence that you can use in two ways <#\>First
of all to show that he's an honest person and should be
believed or more likely to be believable and
secondly that he's the sort of person who you might think is
um less likely to commit a crime of dishonesty of this kind
and His Honour will tell you specifically how to use evidence
of good character <,,> <#\>What else has he done <#\>He's also
um given sworn evidence himself and as I said to you when I
opened the case on behalf of the defence that was something he
did not have to do <#\>He could have remained silent <,> and
said nothing at all <,> <#\>He could've simply allowed the
case to proceed on the basis that Gill's a liar he hasn't told
you the truth about McPherson leave it at that and just keep
quiet about anything else <,> <#\>He could've given the same
answers and questions that I put to him without risk of being
cross-examined <#\>That's called giving unsworn evidence and
you might've heard about that course <#\>It's certainly open
to accused people and if he'd given unsworn evidence he
couldn't've been tested by the prosecutor <#\>He couldn't've
been asked questions by the judge or by yourselves <,> and
exposed himself to any risks or dangers <#\>He's given his
evidence and he's give it truthfully and how do on
what basis can I satisfy you that he's given his
evidence truthfully <,> <#\>Well let me put this to you if you
reject everything else I've said the one thing that would make
you believe must make you believe that he's truthful is that
he gave one answer which on the face of it didn't do him any
good <#\>I candidly admit didn't do him any good and if he was
an ingenious liar if he was the sort of person minded to
suppress the truth if he was the sort of person who didn't want
anything embarrassing to come out he wouldn't have told you the
truth about it but the <O>inaudible</O> told you the truth
that in the month or so prior to this happening he tried to
sell his car</I>
