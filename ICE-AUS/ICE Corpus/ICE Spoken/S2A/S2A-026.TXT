<&>MONOLOGUE - UNSCRIPTED</&>
<&>SPEECH</&>
<&>ROBERT JENKINS</&>

<I><#\>The topic that I'm gonna talk about now is one that I'm gonna
talk about on Saturday, is is about a a realm of language, a
type of language that's always fascinated me <#\>It's always
fascinated me because I've been interested in the power
<O>inaudible 1 word</O> that it has, this certain kind of language,
this the the power that it has to evoke a wide range of
emotions <#\>From laughter and hilarity on one end to rage and
death threats at the other <#\>Ummm, and the power it has to
affect people <#\>It's always er amazed me so I did a study on
it, and I actually did my thesis, my thesis <O>inaudible 1
word</O>, my Masters thesis on this kind of language, so that
what I'm gonna talk to you about for a few minutes is
swearing <#\>And attitudes to swearing in modern society, in our
society <#\>And during the course of this talk I'll actually be
using <O>interjections from audience</O> swear words <#\>I'm not going
to say <quote>Mm</quote> and <quote>the F word</quote> and <quote>that word</quote> <#\>I'm actually
going to be using the words so um, while I don't really want
to apologise to you for doing that, 'cause I don't think
that's um the sensible thing to do, I'm um gonna tell you that
I will be using the words to describe what I want to talk
about
<#\>Anyway, just as a background, a social kind of a background,
last year ah, there was a Commonwealth Heads of Government
meeting <O>inaudible 1 word</O>, um CHOGM, and ah there was a
newspaper article ah about an outburst that Mr Hawke ah made
at that meeting <#\>Um, he was getting annoyed at er some of the
dillying and the dallying that was going on, you know, over
drafts of er er the draft declarations of the Commonwealth's
future, and ah, erm, when a journalist, <O>inaudible 1 word</O>
Clark, asked him ah what Australia could do to improve human
rights, you know he'd already been annoyed about, you know,
people dillying and dallying so he really got angry this time
and exploded and said <quote>What the fuck are we supposed to do
<#\>Line them up against the fucking wall and fucking well shoot
them</quote> <#\>In the newspaper this was wasn't spelt out in full what
he said but that's exactly what he said <#\>Um, he was later
described by British journalists as a <quote>foul-mouthed little
man</quote> <#\>Um, however, the the er the reporter who interviewed
him, Peta? Clark, at a later date, said to the reporters who
wrote the article about everything that he at no time made any
overt sexist remarks and he was obviously just making an off-
the-cuff statement <#\>He was obviously just a little hot under
the collar <#\>Yet, he was accused of being a foul-mouthed little
man, being accused of sexism <#\>Um, so this small illustration
shows that people in a position of power, when they make
public statements, are pounced upon <#\>Their statements are
pounced upon and misinterpreted especially in regard to this
instance <#\>Umm, that such incidences can serve as a pretext
for making other inferences, ah true or false, in this case he
he was accused of sexism because the reporter happened to be a
woman, and you know, how dare he swear in front of a woman
<#\>Umm, it shows the phenomenon of public shock but private
swearing <#\>Now, you know, most people who, you know, castigate,
you know naughty and poo-poo the swearing, the use of swear
words in public, themselves, in private, are usually, you
know, frequent users <#\>So um, and it also shows this phenomenon
of censorship <#\>Now in the newspaper article that quoted what
Mr Hawke said, um that actual word was er written <quote>f dash dash
dash</quote> <#\>So there is still a strong, strong kind of a taboo on
actually representing this kind of a language in a spoken or a
written form <#\>Umm, so that's a a social background <#\>Um,
leading on into the legal aspects of ah <O>interjections by
audience</O> <#\>Um, the offensive provi the offensive languages the
offensive language provisions of the Summary Offences Act
states that <quote>It is offensive for any person to use offensive
language in, near, or within hearing distance of a public
place or school</quote> <#\>You can get fined six hundred dollars,
jailed for three months, or both, if you swear in public <#\>Umm,
that was the law brought in by the Greiner Government in
nineteen eighty-eight, which is under event, under review now
<#\>Ah because this law is being abused, mostly by the police
<#\>Umm, and it's being abused because ah there is that Summary
Offences Act, that languages falls in it does not at all
definitely state what constitutes offen offensive language 
<#\>What the language is and when it's offensive and why it's
offensive <#\>So the the law is too broad and circumstantial <#\>So
it's open to wide interpretation and it has been ah <,> ah
interpreted widely <#\>There's a one of many many cases quoted in
another newspaper article was of a young abor, most people,
most of the offenders that do get arrested are Aboriginal <#\>Now
ah a an Aboriginal boy was fined ah and jailed, temporarily,
for calling his own dog <quote>a dog's arse</quote> within hearing distance
of a policeman <#\>This this fine was later removed on appeal <#\>So
it just just goes to show you how powerful it is <#\>Um, so
there, that's a bit of a social and a legal background <#\>So
what exactly is this this this kind of language that inflames
our emotions so much <#\>Um, I'll just tell you a little bit
about the actual linguistic side of it, a bit of a description
of actually how it functions in the language system <#\>Umm, it's
often described as <,> rude language, <,> dirty
language, <,> naughty language, bad language <#\>Now one of
the things that um social scientists, or indeed any scientist
scientists do in part of their profession is to distance
themselves from the effective emotional connotations of
anything <#\>And that includes this and um, I think you can see
logically <,> how can language how can anything be dirty,
how can it be bad, how can it be rude <#\>It's only the extra
dimensions that people bring to it that cause them to label it
rude, bad, dirty, naughty <#\>So dirty in fact that you used to
get your mouth washed out with soap <#\>Um I don't know if anyone
here has ever had that pleasant experience, um <O>interjection</O>
had it suggested to you I'm sure at at least <#\>So what is it
exactly <#\>Well taboo language and and swearing is part of a
wider wider phenomenon I guess you can call taboo language, or
language that is tabooed, that is in some way restricted in
terms of its use, in terms of the users, and in terms of the
situation <#\>Like with a cultural context it was, this kind of
language varies from culture to culture, language to language,
and situational context, ie, each situation in which this
language occurs <#\>Um, <O>interjection</O> <#\>Right OK <#\>Now swear words
ah denote, literally, um <,> well the domains from which
they're drawn <#\>Ah, denote religion, <,> sex, <,>
excretion, <,> ah race, ethnicity and nationality, ah
gender and people of different abilities <#\>So they're a few of
the domains, a few of the areas um which you know we can use
swear words for, to describe <#\>They're mostly where they come
from <#\>For example in religion, and it, and words exist in all
these categories that are used literally <#\>For example,
religion: <quote>Christ</quote> <#\>OK you talk about um Jesus Christ <#\>But
when it's used figuratively and in an expressive way it
constitutes what's called blasphemy <#\>This is a kind of
swearing, you say, you hit your hand on the table and say <quote>Oh
Christ!</quote> <#\>It's an expression of emotion <#\>And it's taboo <#\>It's
it's not looked upon favourably by a lot of people because,
well I'll get to that later <#\>Sex <#\>Um, the most common wide
ranging, widely used four letter word in the English language
is <quote>fuck</quote> <#\>And <O>laugh</O> and that's its literal, its literal
meaning is er as a a swear a swear word <O>inaudible 1 word</O> for
sexual intercourse <#\>But it has a figurative expressive meaning
too <#\>Another example is if you stub you toe <#\><quote>Fuck</quote> <#\>Something
like that <#\>If you forget something, if you want to express
disappointment or disgust, so its secondary meanings which
can't get, which you which has its most uses are to express
some kind of emotion <#\>Usually negative <#\>Ah race and ethnicity
<#\>We we know all the ah common words that we ah use to describe
people of different colour, racial backgrounds <#\>I don't need
to actually go ahead and enumerate them for you <#\>Differently
abled people, mentally and physically <#\><quote>Spastic</quote> um <quote>psycho</quote> ,
<quote>looney</quote> <#\>These are all words which you can't use as freely as
other words because they have some kind of ah extra dimension,
extra connotation to them and you can't just say these words
to anybody, at any place, any time <#\>That's why they're taboo
in some way or another <#\>Gender <#\>There are words for ah
swearing, tabooed, unfriendly, abusive words for men and
women, usually women, mostly women, but for men also <#\>Whether
they be male, ah homosexual, um <,> what their appearance
is <,> <#\>So I'd like to ask you just to to think in your
own minds for a second why, why are you <,> angered,
offended, ashamed or or or otherwise react to language like
this in yourselves <#\>I <,> theorise, I hypothesise that it
comes from, for example <,> sex and excretion, our
extremely repressed attitudes towards these areas, western
people <#\>Sex is especially is surrounded by by shell after
shell after shell of fear, shame, embarrassment ah and so on
and so forth, you know <#\>What did your parents used to tell
you <#\>If you were a boy, if you masturbated <#\>That you'd go
blind, you know <#\>That's one small example <O>interjections</O>
<#\>That's for sex <#\>Why is why is religion why why is blasphemy a
tabooed area of language <#\>I think it's because of a fear of
the power of the deities, the actual gods themselves
<O>interjection</O> <#\>It's a protection yeah um <#\>Why why are taboo
terms existing for people of race, different abilities and
genders <#\>Again I think it's fear of things different, things
that we don't understand <#\>A solution <,,> <#\>Something
which is necessary because people get put in jail, people get
kicked, people have sometimes, I'm sure, been killed, injured
and killed, because of this kind of language <#\>Using it or
receiving it <#\>So I put it to you that as intelligent human
beings, every one of you, born that way, that you have a
choice <#\>You can choose to decide not to let this kind of
language affect you <#\>You know, for example, if somebody if
somebody swears at you, stop for a second, don't let it become
a stimulus response action <#\>You bastard, <O>pow</O> <#\>Stop <#\>Let it
let that stimulus response action bypass and go through your
you thinking faculty, your rational faculty <#\>Stop and think to
yourselves, well why is this person swearing at me <#\>What's the
background <#\>You know, um see what's really happening in that
situation and you can choose to decide <#\>For example, um
<,> if someone says to you <,>, I put it to you that
if someone, for example, who you're in a relationship with, be
it a family member or a close friend or something, comes to
you, gets annoyed, gets angry, swears at you, I put it to you
that that person is not for example saying <quote>I hate you you
fucking bastard</quote> <#\>I put it to you that that person does not
hate you but loves you <#\>I also put it to you that that person
is hurt and confused and is seeking your assistance, and a way
of showing that is to swear at you <#\>So next time someone
swears at you, stop and think</I>
