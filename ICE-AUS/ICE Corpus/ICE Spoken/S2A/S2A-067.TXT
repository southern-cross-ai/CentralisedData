<I><$A>  <#\>Commissioner I should emphasise<,> as you are
aware<,> that<,> the public hearings<,,> which are commencing
today<,> are but part of<,> an ongoing investigation<,> into the
inquiry the terms of reference<,> which you have outlined<,,>
<#\>And it is an investigation<,> <#\>The Commission<,,>has
interviewed people<,> it has examined documents<,> and it has
conducted<,> some private hearings <#\>The public hearings which
are being held are but part of that investigative process<,,> and
it would be quite wrong to assume either because there is an
investigation<,> or because public hearings<,> are being held<,>
that the Commission and those assisting you Mr Commissioner<,,>
have reached any conclusions on the matters which are the subject
of investigation <#\>The inquiry<,> broadly speaking arises out
of<,> the reclassification<,> of a Chief Executive Officer
position<,> <#\>A position which is provided for under the public
sector management act. An Act which came into force in nineteen
eighty eight<,> for the purpose of providing for and governing<,>
the employment of senior<,> officers in state government
departments <#\>This inquiry<,> concerns the position  and I
emphasise the position and not the person the position of
Director General of the Department of Community Services <#\>It
is referred to in the Public Sector Management Act<,> as a
department head position a chief executive officer p ah position
<,,> <#\>The public employment office<,> is charged with the
administration of the Act<,,> but it's important to bear in mind
that the employment conditions of employment and dismissal of
positions such as <,> that of the Director General<,> of the
Department of Community Services<,,> must be sanctioned or must
be approved by the Governor-General thus recommendations<,>
concerning those positions <,,> and occupants of those positions
are made by the Cabinet Office<,> to the Governor-General
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>To the Governor <#\>Thank you Mr <@>surnameB</@> The
salary of Chief Executive Officers<,> depends in part upon the
grade which is allocated<,> to the particular position<,>
<#\>Different<,> departments have allocated to them different
grades for their department heads<,,> <#\>Until quite recently<,>
the Chief Executive Officer position of the Director General of
the Department of Community Services was what was known as a
grade seven<,> <#\>The grading<,> is something which is evaluated
by a method developed by management consultants <@>Company Name
1</@> <,> <#\>Those management consultants have trained
officers<,> who are in the Public Employment Office<,> in the
skills of evaluation in accordance with that process and those
officers have become accredited evaluators <#\>Part of the
function of the Public Employment Office<,> is to review the
grading of positions from time to time <#\>For instance<,,> if<,>
the functions or responsibilities of a particular department
change<,> either through taking on additional responsibilities<,>
or through part of that department's responsibilities being
transferred to another department <#\>That may well provide a
valid occasion for re-evaluating<,> the grade which attaches to
the department head's position<,> <#\>The evaluation of the
grading of the position<,> has nothing to do whatsoever with the
qualities the efficiency or performance of the occupant of the
position <#\>It focuses solely upon an examination of the
responsibilities and duties attaching to the position <#\>The<,,>
prior to March of this year there was a change to the<,>
responsibilities attaching to the Director General Department<,>
of Community Services position <#\>One of the matters which w
will be looked at and had been looked at during the course of
this enquiry is precisely what that change was<,> <#\>In March
of this year an evaluation was carried out by the Public
Employment Office of the position of Director General of the
Department<,> of Community Services<,> and a recommendation and
decision was made to change the grade of that position from a
grade seven to a grade six<,> Very shortly thereafter a further
recommendation and decision was made<,> to at least stay that
recommendation and decision<,> <#\>It would seem from the
investigation thus far carried out<,> that there was a
perception<,> in the Public Employment Office that if a position
was downgraded<,,> a consequence which should follow is that the
incumbent of the position in this case Mr <@>Surname1</@> be placed what
was what is known as the unattached list and the position is then
readvertised as a position six<,> <#\>This inquiry has and will
investigate whether or not<,> there was any corrupt conduct in
particular any partiality on the part of those who participated
in the recommendation and decisions concerning the downgrading
of the position<,> of Director General of Department of Community
Services and the subsequent stay of that decision<,,>
<#\>Commissioner I I open by saying that it would be wrong to
assume that because of the existence of this inquiry and because
these public hearings are being conducted that any conclusion has
been reached on the propriety of the recommendations and
decisions <#\>That of course is the very question which is being
investigated <#\>I should add it would also be quite wrong to
assume that because a person is called to give evidence before
this inquiry or because a person is named in evidence<,> that his
or her reputation is in question <#\>It would be unfair to the
person concerned to publish reports which carry such an
implication <#\>A report will be written by you Mr Commissioner
at the conclusion of the investigation and that report will be
based upon all of the information which has been gathered during
the investigation and you Mr Commissioner will reach<,> a
balanced decision<,> on the matters being investigated and that
balanced decision will be based upon the whole of the
information<,> a decision which can't be properly or fairly
reached until all of the decis all of the information which can
be gathered is at hand <#\>Yes thank you Commissioner</I>


<S2A-067b> <1081>
<I><$A> <#\>In making that last concession Mr Commissioner ah
I do not wish to cut across submissions that are made by the
representatives of those parties but for the purpose of what ah
I am submitting to you um I take the position ah in effect
against my client um<,> as if those matters are established
against those persons er and I do that because it's not my role
to take potshots in effect at other persons before the
Commission. Er and finally um in paragraph six um Mr <@>Surname1</@> did
not recognise that the board of <@>Companyname1</@> lacked authority to
terminate the employment of um Mr <@>Surname2</@> um <#\>The true legal
position was that the most the board could do was make a
recommendation to the minister because it was only the minister
who had power to do that <#\>Um from that defect it followed that
Mr <@>Surname2</@> should not've been paid out and it also follows that
Mr <@>Surname2</@> was still the General Manager and um ah although it
may be a technicality and it may well be that Mr <@>Surname2</@> could
just as easily before his termination have terminated the
employment of Mr <@>Surname3</@> ah within the terms of the Act ah it
ah did not lie in the power of the board to terminate Mr ah
<#\>Oh I withdraw that. Um it did not lie in the power ah of Mr
<@>Surname1</@> to terminate Mr <@>Surname3</@> on the board's direction
because ah Mr <@>Surname2</@> was still the General Manager <#\>Um all
of those mistakes appear to've been common to the board members
and to Mr <@>Surname2</@> and Mr <@>Surname3</@> and to Mr <@>Surname4</@> and there
is nothing to indicate that um Mr <@>Surname1</@> had any further ah
circumstance  happen to him that should've brought that
particular error to his attention ah other than the general fact
ah of his position and what he should or should not have been
aware of in terms of the structure of <@>Companyname1</@> <,> <#\>Can I
proceed from there in the order of the written submissions er Mr
Commissioner to deal with the events of the fourteenth of June
ah when Mr <@>Surname1</@> was the Corporate Services Manager. Ah
the<,,> basis on which um as I understand it his conduct there
is criticised is as being partial conduct on the part of a ah
public official<,> <#\>And ah the basis on which it is said to
come within section nine subsection one of the ICAC Act ah is um
paragraph er <#\>There's an error in the in my submissions It
should be paragraph C
<$B> <#\>Sorry where are you?
<$A> <#\>Um page four Mr Commissioner um Item seven B
<$B> <#\>yes
<$A> <#\>There's a reference to paragraph A <{><[>it should</[> be
a reference to C
<$B> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
<$A> <#\>Um<,> could I pause there because there are some
matters of general application which are dealt with in the
supplementary written submissions in terms of subsections eight
um one and section nine subsection one of the ICAC Act. Um first
as regards partiality um could I refer you Mr Commissioner to
what was said in  um Mr <@>Surname5</@> 's case um at um twenty eight New
South Wales Law Reports page one hundred and sixty one<,> <#\>In
the judgement of Mr Justice <@>Surname6</@> um he was the only one of
the judges who dealt ah at length with section eight subsection
one and there is a paragraph in the middle of the pa page that
starts um  <quote>in that context I come to consider the meaning of the
word the meaning of partial in section eight</quote> <,,>
<$B> <#\>For some reason we're familiar with that passage is
it
<$A> <#\>Yes ah what I wish to emphasise there sir is that
partiality deals with the situation where there is an improper
preference between two or more persons dealing or potentially
dealing with a public official or a public authority and an
improper preference is given to one of them ah over the others
and for an improper reason <#\>There are five elements that His
Honour refers to er but it is the um that particular point to
which I wish to direct the Commission's attention <#\>What has
been complained of um has against Mr <@>Surname2</@> and Mr <@>Surname3</@> and
against the other persons um who were involved in procuring and
making the decision to terminate their employment without cause
is more by way of breach of public trust or by way of dishonesty
than by way of partiality<,> <#\>Ah and since having turned to
the supplementary submissions Mr Commissioner ah could I say
something about the mental element ah in subsection eight one
paragraph A ah which relates to conduct adversely affecting the
honest or impartial exercise of official functions er as compared
with the mental element required for paragraph B which relates
to the dishonest or partial exercise of official functions itself
<#\>The mental element that's required for the actual exerci th
to to establish actual dishonest or partial exercise of official
functions er is an awareness that the exercise of a power is done
for an improper purpose whether that is er constituted by the
person engaging in the conduct um himself recognising as improper
by reference to his own standards and understanding the purpose
is improper or by recognising that ah whatever he may think the
purpose is one which is ah objectively improper or regarded by
the community as being improper ah <#\>That's a matter which was
also considered in Mr <@>Surname5</@> 's case Mr Commissioner er and um
I know you've been referred before to what Mr Justice <@>Surname6</@> 
said at pages one hundred and sixty one and one hundred and sixty
two ah of his judgement on that topic <#\>The Chief Justice also
um dealt with it in not quite as squarely but dealt with the
question of honesty ah at page a hundred and thirty four G ah
where he said <quote>the conduct of Mr <@>Surname 5</@> that was being
referred to in the finding quoted above was exactly the same
conduct as was ultimately determined by the Commissioner to've
been corrupt <#\>The conclusion that a person whilst acting in
a way which he believes is in all respects lawful and which is
not found to be unlawful and in a way that would not be seen by
a jury as contrary to known and recognised standards of honesty
and integrity ah is nevertheless corrupt acting corruptly appears
surprising</quote> <#\>Um and I would submit that that surprising con
that surprising conclusion is is not one which um the Act compels
and is not one which is ah correct in terms of the Act</I>
