<I><#\>Ah, we were in full stream, ah, concerned with these
associations between invertebrate animals and algae of various
of various taxons <#\>Ah, and we have seen, ah, that with these
associations there is passage of photosynthate from the ah
photosynthetic activity of the algae through to the to the
host so there's a nutitional nutritional component to this to
this association and we also saw in the case of the ah hard
corals, the scleractinian corals, that algae were also
intimately associated in the skeletogenesis by ah organising
the um metabolic pathways of um um bicarbonate into insoluble
carbonate for the deposition of the skeleton <#\>Ah I'd like to
continue that story with ostensibly the same dinoflagellate
ah alga symbiodinium microadreaticum which I mentioned
before as being present in corals, although that bit might've
been cut of from the top of your graphic in the reproduction
of it it's symbiodinium microadreaticum which is the ah the
dinoflage flagellate algae <#\>It probably isn't as we mentioned
before the taxonomy of these algaes are very difficult ah and
with molecular techniques we are now indicating that indeed
there is a great deal of host specificity in these
associations so ah in the different species of corals even
there are different species of algae they're not all
symbiodinium microadreaticum and in this case which is the
giant clam it pro it certainly isn't but that taxonomy needs
to be done and in the fullness of time presumably will be <#\>But
here is a massive invertebrate animal the giant clam of
tropical seas which also utilises the same at least
dinoflagellates if not the same species <#\>And the importance
of
this particular example is that the host has made dramatic
alterations of its body form to accommodate the algae so that
the algae in fact will be presented in a mass of tissue that
will be exposed to sunlight because as you can imagine being
clams they are bivalves and therefore much of the body is
contained within the shell and therefore out of the range of
receiving any sort of sunlight <#\>So from some cockle-like
ancestor which we've got up the top of this graphic number
fifteen isn't it fifteen ah the whole axes of the of the
hinge has been rotated right around so that now the opening to
the shell is exposed uppermost <#\>Normally bivalves burrow down
with the opening of the shell going forwards in this case it
has been revolved right around so that the opening of the
shell is now uppermost and they sit there attached permanently
in amongst the coral exposing the fleshy lips of their mantle
edge <#\>And indeed the extension of those mantle lips has become
massive so that they spill out as often this very dramatically
beautiful colour patterns are on those lips so the whole
cyclonal musculature has been extensively enlarged <#\>Now the the
cyclonal musculature was originally that part of the mantle
edge that was used for the inhalant and exhalant current
organisation bringing water across the gills of the bivalve
for their own food collection devices <#\>So here we have this
massive alteration so now on the bottom diagram we can see the
cyclonal musculature taking up a much more extensive area than
it did before and its in this tissue as you can see in the
sections below where the algae are maintained and they're not
maintained inside ti ah cells they're not ah intra-cellular in
this case they are in the blood sinuses <#\>OK so they're not
intra-cellular as they are in corals and other and other
invertebrates <#\>Now just a couple of quite bizarre little
associations between these same dinoflagellates in the next
diagram sixteen <#\>Ah carnivorous nudibranch molluscs,
carnivorous shell-less molluscs eat corals and other
cnidarians that contain the dinfa dinoflagellates in their
tissues and they actually digest the tissue of their prey but
maintain the dinoflagellates in their own tissues for their
own photosynthetic use <#\>So somehow they've organised to digest
preferentially the ah the ah the food but not the
dinoflagellates that are contained within that tissue <#\>They
send those out to the tips of their bodies where
photosynthesis can now still be maintained <#\>They have to keep
eating however cnidarians to constantly replenish those
dinoflagellates in their tissues <#\>They can't maintain them as
the coral did that they were eating they have to keep on
adding them as they as they um succumb and die <#\>An extension
of
this sort of of symbiotic activity can be seen in another
group of shell-less molluscs the sacoglossans which are
rather slug-like <#\>In this case they are herbivorous <#\>This
is the
next diagram <#\>They are herbivorous feeding on algae for
example
codium ah and in codium the ah cell walls have broken down
so you have what we call a syncytium no cell walls between
the cells so just masses of nuclei plus chloroplasts of course
being an alga <#\>And these herbivorous sacoglossans have organised
their radula to actually suck out the cytoplasm of the of the
of the ah algae <#\>In doing so they suck up the chloroplasts but
yet again they don't digest those chloroplasts they retain the
chloroplasts in their own tissues for their own ah
photosynthesis so they're not they haven't got algae in their
tissues they've got the photosynthetic bit of the algae the
chloroplast <#\>Again those chloroplasts can't be maintained
because they are outside the the algae now they haven't got
the same metabolic relationship that they had when they were
inside the algae <#\>They now have to be replenished by
subsequent
feeding on that algae in their herbivorous way of life but
they can maintain them for quite a long time and the advantage
of this of course would mean that they don't have to continue
to be herbivorous for so much of their time they can use the
chloroplasts to supplement the algal tissue that they are
consuming for some time after their their meal <#\>Ah what
advantage this might have to the ah to the algae is is rather
dubious of course <#\>Ah we're not talking about mutualism so
much
now except that of course they don't have to eat as much algae
as they would normally do because they have maintained the
chloroplasts and I s'pose that may be some marginal
significance in a mutualistic sort of way to the algae that
they are feeding on <#\>They just don't munch so much of it OK
well that that's the end of our story <#\>We could go on for ever
talking about algae in invertebrates it's a huge area um and
and quite bizarre and well worth study there's still lots to
be learnt about these associations between algae and their
various invertebrate hosts <#\>The next area that I want to talk
about that is of utmost importance in mutualism ah is the
digestion of cellulose <#\>It's considered that the vast majority
of invertebrates and indeed vertebrates as well don't have
their own cellulase that is the enzymes the enzyme or enzymes
capable of breaking down the macro-molecule cellulose which is
the major component of course as you know of plants <#\>In fact
it
may be the most ubiquitous ah macro-molecule in the biological
world because it is a component of all plants <#\>Ah now if they
don't have their own cellulase their own enzymes they have to
rely on micro-organisms of various sorts in their guts to
perform that function for them <#\>And herbivorous animals
whether
they by invertebrate or vertebrate have developed devices in
the form of various pockets of their of their gut where this
activity will take place and of course the most well known one
of course is the rumen inside the one of the the chambers of
the stomach of the ruminant mammals <#\>Ah I want to however talk 
about the role of micro-organisms in the digestion of
cellulose in termites and of course termites rely solely on
cellulose for their diet <#\>Ah I want to use termites because
we
can look at them in the laboratory I don't want to bring in a
great big sheep's gut or something or other and extract the
micro-organisms from it <#\>We can have a tiny little termite and
do the and do the same thing It's far more aesthetic ah in the
laboratory situation <#\>So I want to have a few words to say
about it because we'll be seeing it for the internal students
um in practical sessions this week <#\>Ah termites ah belong to
the order Isopteran of the insects they're rather a primitive
group of insects <#\>Ah there's huge numbers of species of them
<#\>Ah
they are colonial as you know and they exist as different
casts performing different functions for the colony as a whole
<#\>They have reproductive forms they have um ah which are which
are sexually reproductive ah and they also have sterile forms
which consist of either workers or soldiers and the soldiers
as you would know are responsible for the protection of the
colony from intruders <#\>It's the workers however who are the
sole gatherers of the food and the sole digesters of the food
and therefore any products of digestion need to be passed on
to the reproductives and to the soldiers and to the developing
nymphs <#\>OK so the its the workers who will have any sort of
digestive ah role for the colony as a whole <#\>Now there are
three groups of organisms that have associations with the
workers of termites for the function of digesting cellulose
for them <#\>There are bacteria in the gut of various sorts
<#\>There
are proteose and there are fungi  <#\>Ah in the case of fungi ah
it's not so much in the gut as having fungal gardens within
their nests which they supply with ah foraged um material put
the fungi on it allow the digestion to take place and then eat
eat the lot so that's outside the body of the workers whereas
the bacteria and the proteose are contained within special
structures inside the gut of the worker termites <#\>Now very
briefly then what is cellulose so we can talk about its
digestion <#\>It's a very complex oh well it's it's a very simple
macro-molecule but it's made quite complicated in the
formation of the fibres that form this structural macro-
molecule <#\>Ah glucose is made up of chains  ah ah sorry ce
cellulose is made up of chains of glucose joined together in
the one four position ah and these glucose chains are held
together by hydrogen bonds to form a rather like a plank of
wood called a mi-cell <#\>So flattened layers of these chains
held together by da by hydrogen bonds and groups of these ah
micro-fibrils ah ah sorry of these mi-cells then link
together to form a micro-fibril <#\>And that is the structural
unit of cellulose <#\>The micro micro-fibrils are then held
together by various other molecules including pectin from
which we get the setting of jam ah and pectin molecules bridge
these ah micro-fibrils by hemi-cellulose molecules so there's
a whole meshwork of gluing molecules that glue these struts
together so it's a bit like um fibreglass I suppose <#\>You have
fibres glued together with a matrix in between and the matrix
in between consists of pectin and hemi-cellulose joining them
together <#\>So you can imagine with all this um matrix of ah
joining molecules joining these rather tough fibres together
the whole thing is very difficult very difficult to get at and
to digest <#\>But digest it is and in the terms of the
organisation of the alimentary canal of termites in the next
diagram we'll dissect these out ah on Tuesday and Wednesday and
see the various parts <#\>It's a typical insect gut consisting
of
an oesophagus coming from the mouth then an expanded part of
the crop which stores the food then there's a gizzard which
grinds it up other than what was ground up by the mastication
of their mandibles and then we have an intestine and then
Malpighian tubules joining here and they are the excretory
the excretory ducts there the kidney-like arrangement of an
insect</I>
