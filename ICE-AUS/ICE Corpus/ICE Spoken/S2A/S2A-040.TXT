<I><$A> <#\>These days most students will probably think<quote>so what
<#\>We
pay<,> we pay fees <#\>We're all use to it now</quote> <#\>Well things
haven't always been that way <#\>In<,,> in nineteen eighty six<,>
education was free <#\>In nineteen eighty seven<,,> the Labor
Government introduced Heac the higher education<,>
administration<,> um<,> contribution<,,> at a rate of two
hundred and fifty dollars<,> <#\>In nineteen eighty eight it was
raised to two hundred and sixty three dollars <#\>In nineteen
eighty nine<,> the Labor Government<,,> introduced the Higher
Education Contribution Scheme at a rate of two thousand
dollars<,> <#\>Last year HECS raised beyond twelve percent<,> to
two thousand three hundred dollars<,,> <#\>When HECS was
introduced by by the Government<,,> it was introduced with a
promise<,> that HECS would never<,> be increased beyond the
rate of inflation<,,> <#\>The current the current proposal<,,>
for um the nineteen ninety three budget<,> is<,> to increase
HECS from two thousand three dollars to three thousand
dollars<,> which is more than a dozen times higher<,> than the
current rate of inflation<,> <#\>This would effectively<,> inc
increase HECS<,> to a rate of approximately thirty percent of
course costs <#\>This this<,,> rate is<,> is well beyond<,> the
fees of<,> of the Liberal Government the and the Menzies
regime of of<,,> of the years prior to the Whitlam<,>
Government reforms of education<,,> and it's also<,,> higher
than the current education fees<,> for universities in The
Netherlands<,> Spain<,> Canada<,> the UK and public
institutions of Japan<,> and the US <#\>The the Labor
Government's mooted commitment<,> to the clever country<,>
would appear to be little more than a fading<,,> than fading
rhetoric<,,> <#\>Further to this<,> other proposals before<,>
before um<,> before us for the ninety three budget<,> are to
limit the number of years<,> that a student is allowed to
complete a degree <#\>That is<,,> currently students who take
longer<,> to complete their de their degrees<,> pay the same
rate of HECS as other students <#\>The proposal before us<,> is
to set a maximum number of<,> of years allowed to complete a
degree<,> such as three years<,> for a BA<,> and a BSc<,>
and<,> a Bachelor of Economics<,> and five year maximum for a
combined law<,> law BA<,> law BSc <#\>Beyond this set maximum
number of years<,> students will be forced to pay a much
greater portion<,> of course costs through increased HECS
rates<,,> and possibly up front fees<,,> <#\>Such a change would
work to<,> to<,> directly against<,> people who fail
courses<,> or people who<,,> change<,> the course of their
degree<,,> throughout the term of their study<,,> <#\>Such a
proposal would also work to great de directly against<,>
students from disadvantaged backgrounds<,> including women<,>
and people from non-English speaking backgrounds<,,> <#\>Now for
a Government which relies heavily upon the votes of women<,>
and people from non-English speaking backgrounds<,,> and
relied heavily upon such votes in the last Federal
election<,,> and during which<,,> the Government claimed a
commitment to women and people from non-English speaking
backgrounds<,> such changes would would be hypocrisy<,> at
its<,> at at its most ironic<,,> <#\>For more than a decade
now<,> students have supported an ALP Government<,> by
default<,> knowing how<,> completely fucked a Liberal
Government would be<,,> um<,,> but I ask you how much longer
can we support a Government<,> which claims support<,,> for
students claims support from women<,> from wim for women<,>
claims support for people from non-English speaking
backgrounds but continues to fuck us over<,> eternally<,> in
every single fi Federal budget<,,> <#\>I ask I urge you to to
vote in favour of this motion and to send<,> a message loud
and clear to the bureaucrats in Canberra<,> that next time it
will not be the administration building the students of
Macquarie occupy <#\>It will be Parliament House<,> and the fat
caucus rooms of the ALP <#\>Thank you</I>



<S2A-040b> <605>
<I><$A> <#\>Howdy <#\>There's two things I want to talk about and
um<,,>
they're basically<,> the first is that um<,> one of the
proposals that's being put forward for the HECS thing<,,> is
um that<,> the repayment<,> wants to be<,> sped up<,> which is
you know<,> an idea<,> worth<,,> thinking about<,> not <#\>And
um
what that means is um<,> at present<,> the way we pay it
back<,> is based on average earnings<,,> and um this year that
means when you start earning twenty eight grand<,> you start
paying it back<,> but um<,> in order to get that back
quickly<,,> the Government wants to propose that<,> you earn
less than that<,> to when you start paying it back <#\>And a<,>
polite way of of doing that<,> is by making it<,> um dependent
on median<,> earnings as a median income threshold<,> which
um<,,> makes that um<,> a very narrow<,> sort of<,> approach
<#\>There's um<,,> we've gotta remember that<,> if like um  Ian
was saying it was only<,> four years ago that we didn't pay it
that it was free<,> and that it's not<,> you know we can
remember this <#\>It's not<,> something that's<,,> too far away
<#\>It's not something that's somewhere else<,> <#\>It's
something
that's happening really quickly that<,> this the repayments
are<,,> you know this very it's a very greedy rapid<,> um<,,>
change <#\>We've got um<,,> there's another proposal within the
budget that's<,,> that the the<,> the ri instead of<,> having
a flat increase in HECS<,> that there'll be differential HECS
so that<,> people from different studies<,> will be paying
different rates of HECS<,> which um<,> and there's two ideas
to that <#\>And the first is that<,> if you were doing a course
that costs the university a lot to run<,> if you were doing
medicine or<,> um<,,> I dunno expensive courses<,,> um
<O>laughs</O> you you you'll have to pay more HECS than at<,>
cheap courses<,> and um<,> that's<,> their determination of
cheap <#\>That's not<,> a value based on<,> worth <#\>It's a
value
based on<,,> you know how much it costs the university<,> to
run that course which may not be um<,> necessarily<,,> um the
way that you feel how much value you get out of your course
Or there's a second idea<,> to the differential HECS<,>
scheme<,> which is that<,,> somebody<,> works out<,> your
perceived income and ah<,> that's a bit bodgey<,> but um it
means<,,> some one works out<quote>oh you're doing medicine <#\>You're
gonna earn heaps of cash <#\>You can pay heaps of HECS you lucky
person</quote> but um<,,> it's very market orientated <#\>It's<,> it's
it's reliance on things that<,,> it's a prediction<,> of what
you're gonna earn for the rest of your life from what you're
doing at university<,> which is<,,> it's something which I'm
definitely not very confident in <#\>I mean I dunno<,> where I'm
gonna end up so<,,> and it may not have nothing to do with
what I'm studying<,,> and it's<,> all these things are<,,> we
get hold of this information mostly<,> from leaked documents
from the Government <#\>This is not<,> it's not presented to us
in a very open manner <#\>It's um<,> it's very<,,> it's not a
good relationship to have<,> with this information<,> so
it's<,> it's I mean it's unclear how much um<,,> even<,>
the<,> when<,,> the medium<,> threshold earnings<,> when we
start repaying at a faster rate<,> we don't know at what rate
that'll be <#\>I mean<,> it's a dangerous thing <#\>So um<,> be
aware you know <#\>Like it's a scary thing <#\>We're gonna be
paying more <#\>We're gonna be paying it faster<,> and we're
gonna be paying it in a more unfair way so you know<,> think
about it</I>



 
<S2A-040c> <652>
<I><$A> <#\>Thanks very much Simon <#\>Well<,,> just recently on
March
thirteen we had the um<,> Federal election and of course we
had the outstanding victory of the<,> the Federal Labor
Government <#\>Um there's no doubt that the victory of the Labor
Government was due to the efforts of<,> community groups right
across Australia and that<,> most importantly included
community groups<,> on this campus namely student
organisations such as<,> the Macquarie University Student
Council <#\>The Trade Union Movement and the<,> the Student
Movement mobilised like it never has before<,> at a grass
roots level<,> right across every university campus in
Australia<,> to get the message through that<,> there was no
doubt that<,,> between Tweedledee and Tweedledum<,> Tweedledee
was far better than Tweedledummer and<,> there's no prize for
guessing that Tweedledummer is the Hewson Government<,> <#\>The
proposal for up front fees<,> the proposal<,> for them to<,,>
introduce compulsory loans for student assistance instead of
the current Austudy scheme was<,> a far<,> worse prospect
than what the Labor Government had to offer<,> <#\>But now it's
time<,> now it's time for<,> the Student Movement to ask the
Federal Government to return that favour in kind because<,>
there's no doubt that it was due to support<,> the support
from groups such as the Student Movement<,> that the Labor
Government was able to achieve its victory<,> <#\>And um<,> and
part of<,> part of that is if you like<,> them bringing home
the bacon to us as as Paul Keating once said in a budget I
think where they actually<,> introduced the Higher Education
Contribution Scheme and<,> <#\>And what we really need<,> from
the
Federal Government is not the<,> maintenance of rhetoric on
their part<,> not for them to say that<quote>well<,> we are the
better of two evils</quote> <#\>We need for them to<,> to face up to the
rhetoric that they're espousing at the moment about<,>
Australia's great future and Australia's garat great role in
the Asia-Pacific region<,,> <#\>Because if you look around the
Asia-Pacific region you'll see that most of those other
nations<,> are genuine about their commitment to higher
education <#\>They're genuine about it in proving<,> the number
of<,> of students that go through tertiary education <#\>They're
genuine<,> about academic standards <#\>They're genuine about the
funding<,> the recurrent and capital funding that they provide
towards their universities and if Australia is fair dinkum and
if the  Federal Labor Government is fair dinkum<,> about
Australia being a player within the Asia-Pacific region<,>
then we've gotta match that rhetoric<,> with a commitment<,>
to better funding<,> for universities <#\>At the moment<,> we've
got dramatic increases in the number of classes um<,> class
sizes a dramatic<,> increase in the number of students that
are attending tertiary institutions right across Australia<,>
but we haven't seen at all the significant increase<,> in the
funding that is going towards those institutions <#\>We have at
the moment<,> a Higher Education Contribution Scheme which all
students are obliged to pay<,> and that equates to about
twenty percent of the cost<,> of the university degree
<#\>Now<,,> that has been that<,> that twenty percent that
students are paying<,,> that we're paying<,> all of us here
here who are listening so attentatively to me at the moment
are paying<,,> um<,> has been the only significant increase
that we have seen <#\>The only significant increase that we've
seen in tertiary education has come from our pocket<,> has
come from our pocket not from the Labor pocket not from the
Government's pocket and there's no doubt<,> about the message
that this meeting should be sending through<,> to the
bureaucrats<,> in the university administrations<,> and to the
bureaucrats down in Canberra<,> that we should be<,> seeing
more money coming out of the Government's pocket <#\>We should
be
seeing them<,> return the favour to us that we gave to them in
the Federal election and see<,> that any increase in the
number of students<,> is adequately funded<,> by<,> by grants
from the Federal Government</I>



<S2A-040d> <147>
<I><$A> <#\>Um before I start I'd just like to thank Aaron for his
party political statement there<,> so I think we should
just<,> thank him.<,,> <#\>Um<,> anyway before I yeah I'll start
now <#\>Um<,> basically as Simon outlined University Council is
the supreme decision making body<,> at Macquarie University
<#\>It also should be the body within the university that
expresses the interests of the students to the Government.<,>
<#\>Actually this poses a problem considering since<,> we have
only one univers<,> one student member on University Council
out of the nineteen members <#\>I mean what<,> what ah democracy
is on<,> what kind of democracy is on this ah governing body
<#\>I'd just like to know <#\>Anyway<,> for too long<,> University
Council's neglected to show an interest in these students and
this is evident<,> in the outrageous seventy nine percent pay
increase<,> the VC and her cronies received last year</I>
