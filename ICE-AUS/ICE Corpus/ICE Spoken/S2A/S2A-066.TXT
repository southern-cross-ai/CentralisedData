<S2A-066a> <601>
<I><$A> <#\>Thank you <#\>If Your Worship has a look at the
evidence and Your Worship ah I submit has an easy job in this
particular matter <#\>Your Worship looks at the prosecution
case the defendant is guilty of assault <#\>If Your Worship
looks at the defendant's version he's just as guilty <#\>I ask
Your Worship not to accept the version of the defendant and I
ask Your Worship to accept the version of the prosecution
<#\>Your Worship ah if there was a headbutt then why hasn't the
defendant complained of any injuries <#\>Why haven't police
noticed the injuries Your Worship and ah he gives evidence of
this particular headbutt <#\>Your Worship has seen the face of
the alleged victim <#\>Your Worship can see in these
proceedings and Your Worship ah<,> it's basically obvious that
ah no doubt that this man was punched by the defendant but
we've gotta know why Your Worship <#\>Now if Your Worship has
a look at Constable Charmaine Horton's statement of the certain questions about the defendant<,>
Your Worship <#\>I ask Your Worship to have a look at ah the
defendant's version he gave to the police on that particular
day as opposed to the version he's given today in court Your
Worship and I submit that there are varying and glaring
differences in his version <#\>I'll leave it ah for Your
Worship and I don't wish to pinpoint every<,> meticulous ah
diversion the defendant has given in his evidence<,> but Your
Worship ah has the statement before you <#\>Your Worship I
submit that um<,> that there was only one and one only
incident occurring on this particular ah day and that incident
ah<,> came in between the altercation of Darren and ah Michael
Robinson <#\>I submit Your Worship <,> that that ah<,> for
some particular reason there has been an exchange of words
between both parties and I submit Your Worship at no stage did
Darren ever<,> headbutt Michael which ah caused Michael to
strike him in the manner that's described to the court<,>
<#\>I submit Your Worship that ah and I ask Your Worship to
accept the prosecution evidence as to what occurred and how it
occurred <#\>Looking at the defendant's version Your Worship
and even on his own version and I ask Your Worship not to
accept his version but even on his own version Your Worship
retaliation<,> <#\>There is a huge difference<,> between
retaliation and self defence Your Worship and ah
 and I particularly asked the defendant as to his
meaning of the word retaliation because he is the one that
used it to police<,> <#\>He is the one that offered to police
his retaliation concerning the ah the 
victim <#\>He says he retaliated Your Worship and ah<,> Your
Worship retaliation is not self defence <#\>Retaliation is in
fact not even a defence that that can be
offered to the defendant at any stage and in fact one of his
witnesses uses the word retaliation as well<,> and Your
Worship ah<,> the defendant is guilty on either version<,>
that Your Worship has before you but I ask Your Worship to
prefer the version of the prosecution <#\>Even the fact that
the defendant's witnesses ah<,> give a version which is
partly consistent with the prosecution in that there's one
incident <#\>One incident and one incident only Your Worship
and ah I draw your attention towards that and I ask Your
Worship to find that the defendant ah did cause the injuries
as set out in the photographs to the ah
 the victim and the defendant is ah<,>
 is guilty of the assault occasioned <#\>Thank you
for hearing me</I>

<S2A-066b> <827>
<I><$A> <#\>Your Worship briefly in relation to the matter
<#\>Firstly in relation to the the use of
the word retaliation <#\>Your Worship we have a young man
nineteen years of age who's never been in trouble before who who doesn't know the niceties of the law
Your Worship indeed as the as the court
does and indeed as ah my friend and I do <#\>Your Worship he's
used the word retaliate but Your Worship by the same token
that could also be my respectful submission in the context it
was given it could be used as self defence as well <#\>Your
Worship that's a fine technical line to be drawn and I ask
given the circumstances given the fact that ah he did make
that statement immediately to the police I ask you to take
that into consideration in the context in which it's given
<#\>Your Worship ah my friend's pointed out that there are ah
various differences in relation to the defence case and indeed
there are <#\>The position is that both witnesses<,> only
state that they saw ah one hit and one hit alone <#\>That's
quite obviously different from the version the defendant's
given which in my respectful submission will show that ah<,>
in relation to statements there's been no collusion between
the defendant's witnesses in relation to the evidence they've
given <#\>They've<,> and indeed that would
be consistent with what would be seen in a night club <#\>It's
a busy night club <#\>The situation is it was crowded and
indeed the prosecution<,> witnesses agree in relation to that
that it was a crowded night club <#\>Quite obviously in
relation to a a scuffle a fight in the
night club it would be<,> highly likely that not all witnesses
would see exactly the same thing and indeed Your Worship would
be very<,> doubtful if all the witnesses had an identical view
of what took place in a crowded night club at approximately
ten thirty at night <#\>Your Worship ah in relation to the<,>
evidence of the prosecution witnesses my friend made some ah
comments concerning the evidence of the defence witnesses well
quite clearly the evidence that Miss Coss has given today has
been greatly increased on from from what
she gave to the police<,> on the twelfth of March on on the evening <#\>Indeed my friend te tendered her statement and I'd ask Your Worship to
look at the statement look at the evidence that she's given
today and compare that evidence with that given of her
boyfriend today who made a statement to the police on the
ninth of June nineteen ninety three <#\>Some three odd months
after the after the event and when you compare the evidence
given by Miss Coss today <#\>it stands on almost all fours
with the evidence of the the ah of her
boyfriend Mr Flynn notwithstanding that on the evening
of the event she described a a totally
different event <#\>Your Worship um<,> I'm not ah
 Your Worship has all the evidence before you
<#\>I'm not gonna stand here and ah<,,> go on in relation to
the matter <#\>The position is Your Worship quite clearly the
defendant's alleging that ah it was self defence after having
been<,> struck<,> ah a blow <#\>You have the evidence before
you that he states that at the time when he was struck he<,>
retaliated which is the word that he used to the police but
Your Worship I'd ask you to<,> take that in the context that
it was self defence as in it happened within a split second
after being assaulted <#\>He then<,> reacted to stop that
assault upon himself <#\>Your Worship there's a difference
there between the two defence witnesses <#\>They say that's
all they saw <#\>Mr Robinson then says that ah there was a a second occasion when the defendant oh
sorry the alleged victim came towards him again
and that occasion he admits that he he 
struck him again because he was apprehensive of what had
happened previously and then he saw him coming before him
<#\>Your Worship's fully aware of the decision
<O>inaudible</O> <#\>I'm not going to ah point out all <#\>I'm
certain Your Worship has a much better understanding of that
case than I do and Your Worship would be fully aware of the<,> the principles laid down in that case
<#\>Your Worship in the circumstances I'd respectfully submit
that you could not be satisfied<,> to the very high standard
of proof that is beyond reasonable doubt that the event
occurred in the manner in which it has been said and on that
basis Your Worship there is<,> two totally different versions
<#\>One from the three witnesses from or the three
defence witnesses and indeed the three prosecution
witnesses <#\>They don't stand together Your Worship <#\>I'd
ask you in the circumstances to dismiss the information on the
basis that Your Worship couldn't be satisfied to that very
high standard of proof that the assault took place<,> in the
manner in which has been described by the prosecution
witnesses <#\>Thank you Your Worship</I>

<S2A-066c> <580>
<I><$A> <#\>Thank you Mr Stewart <#\>I understand the charge
of the offence is assault occasioning actual bodily harm<,>
<#\>There's little dispute on the evidence before me
<#\><O>inaudible</O> by reason of the<,> evidence given by the
alleged victim in these proceedings Darren Flynn<,> and the<,>
pictorial representation contained in exhibit<,,> three of
these proceedings of the injuries<,,> to the person of Mr
Flynn constitute as a matter of law actual bodily harm
<#\>What is an issue at these pren in these
proceedings is whether the manner in which they were
so occasioned constitutes an assault<,> within the meaning of
the law<,> <#\>The evidence of the prosecution is that on the
evening<,,> of the twelfth of March Nineteen ninety three the
defendant and Mr Flynn were in a local night club<,> at Whale
Beach known as Moby Dick's <#\>It is the evidence of the
victim in these proceedings and indeed his girlfriend Miss
Coss<,> just prior to a band for which they had attended the
premises so to hear commencing their repertoire<,> they placed
themselves in a position at the back of the dance floor in
order to better observe the stage at the
premises <#\>They say at that time collectively that they were
standing side by side<,> and at one stage the defendant<,>
pushed past Mr Flynn causing some comment<,> from one to the
other and from there<,> the<,> entering into or the course
of<,> conversation between the defendant and Mr Flynn of a
less than salacious nature<,> <#\>It is the evidence of Mr
Flynn and of Miss Coss that the defendant pushed Mr Flynn and
that he then thereafter stepped back<,>
<O>inaudible</O> after Mr Flynn apparently lost balance<,>
<#\>Flynn says that his brother and a person by the name of
Steven Lane neither of witnesses who've been called to give
evidence in these proceedings<,> unfortunately then restrained
the defendant and moved him some three to four metres away to
another portion of the dance floor <#\>It is the evidence
of him of Mr Flynn and Miss Coss
thereafter and the evidence of Mr<,> Kelly also that a number
of persons became embroiled in the altercation or the attempts
to restrain the defendant by Sean Flynn and Steven Lane and
that a scuffle occurred elsewhere on the dancefloor <#\>It is
the evidence of Miss Coss<,> and Mr Flynn that at that point
in time the defendant was physically removed from their
immediate presence <#\>Miss Coss says that during the course
of this scuffle one of the persons who apparently or was regarded by her as being a member of the
opposing tribe<,,> moved in their direction and in the course
of so doing Mr Flynn moved in front of her in order to<,>
negate the prospect of that person coming into contact with
her <#\>She says at that time she observed the defendant to be
across the other side of the dancefloor and held by<,> a
member of Mr Flynn's tribe<,> and that he managed to extricate
himself from the grip of that person walked across the
dancefloor and whilst she was standing behind Mr Flynn she saw
his head jerk back in a manner consistent with the application
of some degree of physical force<,> <O>inaudible</O> by the
defendant and indeed she saw thereafter that Mr Flynn was
bleeding profusely from the lip region and that he exited the
premises almost immediately<,> <#\>He saw also the defendant
was taken into custody by what I presume to be security staff
of the premises and he too was escorted from the premises<,,></I>
