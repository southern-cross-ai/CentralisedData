<subtext><speaker speakerid='A'><text>Thank you and good evening
<pause></pause> 
</text> 
<text>I was going to
<pause></pause> 
speak off the cuff until about half past four this afternoon when I thought I'd better jolly well put something on paper
</text> 
<text>It might be a little more orderly
<pause></pause> 
</text> 
<text>Thank you for the invitation to come tonight as it's very much a pleasure for me to meet and speak with some of you so far
<pause></pause> 
</text> 
<text>Well some of the questions
<pause></pause> 
which were put to me in the invitation were or one of them to begin with was what led me to do it
<untranscribed>laughter
</untranscribed> 
</text> 
<text>And I s'pose it's it's er
<pause></pause> 
an accumulation of lots of things but
<pause></pause> 
I did
<medpause></medpause> 
er recall that in childhood I loved to be yarning
</text> 
<text>I grew up in a in an extended family in commun in a community of
<pause></pause> 
lots of family and friends where
<pause></pause> 
it was very much their
<pause></pause> 
way to
<pause></pause> 
sit a long time after
<pause></pause> 
after the meals or
<pause></pause> 
in between times or over cups of tea wherever
<pause></pause> 
picnics in the bush and just yarn about anything and everything which
<pause></pause> 
didn't often seem of much consequence but it must've impressed me very much and certainly I remember it
<pause></pause> 
as a very enjoyable thing
<pause></pause> 
amongst family and friends
<medpause></medpause> 
</text> 
<text>Also
<pause></pause> 
I recall that I didn't keep diaries and I did scribble to myself from time to time to record
<pause></pause> 
especially wonderful
<pause></pause> 
or awful moments and events
<pause></pause> 
or to clarify my thoughts
<pause></pause> 
in resolving difficult and very private matters
<pause></pause> 
which I felt I couldn't discuss with anyone at all
<pause></pause> 
</text> 
<text>So
<medpause></medpause> 
I liked the written word and I liked the the spoken word
</text> 
<text>I enjoyed both very much
</text> 
<text>There's nothing like a good speech
<pause></pause> 
or a good sermon
<pause></pause> 
or hearing the woodcutters or farmers in the bush yarning on
<pause></pause> 
or later sitting on
<medpause></medpause> 
in sitting in
<pause></pause> 
on endless student arguments about the meaning of life
<pause></pause> 
with Bob during his student years
</text> 
<text>I'm was very much an observer in all that but I
<pause></pause> 
soaked it up enjoying it very much
<pause></pause> 
</text> 
<text>Also
<untranscribed>sigh
</untranscribed> 
I felt that my life had been
<pause></pause> 
a curious mixture of ordinary
<pause></pause> 
and extraordinary things
<pause></pause> 
so perhaps it would be of interest to others
<pause></pause> 
at the same time being something that they could identify with themselves and this a thing that I've noticed very much indeed since the book was published
</text> 
<text>Ah there was
<pause></pause> 
a flood of mail in the earlier weeks and months and still there's a trickle
</text> 
<text>There's a continuity of
<pause></pause> 
of comment and quite a bit of it is
<pause></pause> 
is along the lines of
<pause></pause> 
identification of having experienced similar difficulties or joys and pleasures and relishing
<pause></pause> 
the sharing of them
</text> 
<text>So the information one might say was there
<pause></pause> 
in me and the in the in the enjoyment of sharing other peoples lives and the other side of that coin
<pause></pause> 
is being willing
<pause></pause> 
to share my own
<medpause></medpause> 
</text> 
<text>Ah when we were in Canberra
<pause></pause> 
I'd had requests from students wanting to do a profile or writers to write my story from interviews
<pause></pause> 
others who wanted to write it themselves
<medpause></medpause> 
but I was loathe to let it go
<medpause></medpause> 
and this carried over over to the time when it went onto audio tape
</text> 
<text>I wanted it to be my own voice but I
<untranscribed>laughs
</untranscribed> 
hope that doesn't sound
<pause></pause> 
egotistical but it was rather for authenticity and directness
</text> 
<text>It was me and I wanted it
<pause></pause> 
to be a direct communication
<pause></pause> 
both on paper
<pause></pause> 
and aur er to the ear um
<pause></pause> 
to whomever I was communicating with
<pause></pause> 
</text> 
<text>From the very beginning of all this I was enjoying myself enormously
<pause></pause> 
</text> 
<text>Everything about the doing of this book from its inception through the writing and editing
<pause></pause> 
the promotion and the selling
<pause></pause> 
and the follow up
<pause></pause> 
of which this evening is a part
<medpause></medpause> 
has been an undiluted pleasure for me
</text> 
<text>I've had to pinch myself sometimes to see if it was really happening
<pause></pause> 
to me
<pause></pause> 
and around me
</text> 
<text>I've made new friends
<pause></pause> 
and added a dimension to some longstanding friendships through this book
</text> 
<text>And by doing something I didn't know I could do
<pause></pause> 
I have gained confidence at a time in my life
<pause></pause> 
when that is of especial value
<medpause></medpause> 
</text> 
<text>In
</text> 
<quote>My Own Life
</quote> 
<pause></pause> 
I described how I talked with Ruth Park earlier
<pause></pause> 
about amongst other things the reasons for writing autobiography
<text>She was embarking on the same project as
<pause></pause> 
I'm sure you're
<pause></pause> 
aware
<medpause></medpause> 
now
</text> 
<text>I do believe that if one's honest
<pause></pause> 
it can bring insights of explanations in one's life and one's relationships
<pause></pause> 
which would perhaps
<pause></pause> 
have otherwise been missed
<medpause></medpause> 
</text> 
<text>That it was unusual for an ex-Prime Minister's wife to do this kind of book
<pause></pause> 
was no impediment
</text> 
<text>In fact that made it easier because some of the issues discussed I would not have broached had they not already been
<editorial>knocks microphone Some inaudible
</editorial> 
knowledge
</text> 
<text>Sorry about that
<untranscribed>laughter
</untranscribed> 
<medpause></medpause> 
</text> 
<text>If they'd not already been public knowledge through Bob's decades in public life and his preparedness to have let people know him
</text> 
<text>Um there had after all have been three biographies
<pause></pause> 
and endless written and electronic media
<pause></pause> 
reports and writings on him
<pause></pause> 
warts and all
