<I><$A> <#\>Unit trusts are<,> quite simply investment products that
are<,> available to individual investors<,> um<,,> where<,>
just average people pool their money together<,> get it
professionally managed<,> and hopefully get a return out of
it<,> <#\>Hopefully <O>inaudible</O> certain time<,> but I'll
talk about<,> the risks involved <O>inaudible</O> <#\>But<,>
before I start I'd like to give you a bit of background<,>
about<,,> um<,> why unit trusts<,> are an important<,> um
product for Australia as a nation<,> <#\>As you're aware 
Australia's slowly coming out of a recession <#\>Everyone's
saying things are starting to pick up<,,> but<,> there has
been some concerns about<,> ah whether the growth at the
current <O>inaudible</O> will be sustained<,,> because people
are<,,> are concerned about what basis is<,> the growth<,>
built on<,,> and<,> you've all heard or at least you heard in
the main budget the um<,> government's<,,> projections<,> for
investment<,> in business which a number of people have
said<,> <O>inaudible</O> fairly unrealistic<,,> um<,> so<,>
the government is looking towards investment and to be able to
invest you must have money and<,,> the way you get money is
with your savings<,> <#\>Um<,> this is investment is likely to
<O>inaudible</O> as a whole<,> but it is not the only
element<,,> um <#\>There's a thing called domestic or household 
savings<,> which is just as important to the nation as<,>
business investment<,,> and<,> Australia has a particularly
bad problem with its domestic savings rates <O>inaudible</O>
<#\>I'll have to read you some raw figures<,> <#\>Just to give you an
idea<,> <#\>In the December nineteen ninety quarter<,> the average
household savings<,> and that's savings by you and me in bank
accounts and things like that<,,> represents seven point eight
percent of our<,> disposable income as a as an average across
the nation<,> <#\>For the same period in nineteen ninety three<,>
the percentage had fallen to two point nine percent<,,> so
that means that<,> in December of ninety three people were
only saving less than three percent of their total income<,,>
<#\>Now when you compare those savings rates to some of our<,,>
international<,> competitors<,,> we are very very low <#\>In fact
we're one of probably the lowest countries in the developed
world in terms of domestic savings <#\>Um<,,> there are some more
terrifying things that come out when you look at it at a
national level<,,> <#\>And<,,> the<,> total Australian savings
rate at the moment is about sixteen percent of our total
income and that covers not only household savings but business
and government savings <#\>Um<,> there is a clear message that
Australia<,> as a nation needs to increase its level of
savings<,,> um<,,> and it is only through these savings that
we can develop the money that'll allow us to invest back into
our companies<,> <#\>That will give us the sustained growth that
we need<,> to keep us<,,> going through this<,> slight growth
period that we're going to ensure we don't pop back down into
a recession <#\>Now<,,> the government has attempted to address
the<,> if you like household or individual savings problems
through the um<,> compulsory superannuation we've had<,> in in
the last year or two <#\>You might've heard <O>inaudible</O> I'm
sure is well aware<,,> of um<,> what that's about<,> and at
least<,> the requirement covers<,> a fairly large proportion
of the Australian population<,> but<,,> the purpose of the
talk today is not actually to talk about superannuation<,>
but<,> just to say that<,> the government's attempt to address
the problem of household savings through compulsory
superannuation is deficient <#\>Um<,,> current contribution
levels are between three and four percent of a person's salary
<O>inaudible</O> are going to rise over the next few years<,>
will not provide people with an adequate income to retire on
<#\>Um<,,> one of the unfortunate side effects of bringing in
compulsory superannuation is that large proportions of the
population now think that their retirement's covered um and
they don't believe they have any need to<,> save themselves
any further to improve their retirement lifestyle<,,> and<,>
as we know<,> there's always that <O>inaudible</O> the aged
pension <O>inaudible</O> if our compulsory superannuation
doesn't turn out to be appropriate<,> <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Now
the government<,,> has clearly said<,> that aged pensions will
not be <O>inaudible</O> in the future<,> <#\>Um<,,> and<,> I
don't know about you but I<,> don't want to be a pensioner<,>
solely dependent on the aged pension 'cos I see the people
who're on that today<,> and I don't think that it'll
<O>inaudible</O> lifestyle<,,> and<,> we can expect the level
of funding that's presently received reduce um over time<,>
<#\>The other problem of course is that compulsory
superannuation<,> doesn't cover everyone in Australia <#\>Um<,>
three large areas that aren't covered are self-employed
people<,> unemployed people<,,> and women<,> outside of the
workforce<,> who're are basically caring for children <#\>Now
none of those people are covered by <O>inaudible</O> in their
retirement<,> if<,> they don't<,> take the initiative
themselves and start saving <#\>Um<,,> there has begin there
there are the beginnings of a realisation in the Australian
population that there is need to save<,> for your
retirement<,> and you can start to see that in some of the
um<,> television shows that've come out<,> like the Money
show<,,> and<,> people are focusing on investment and what it
means and how they can improve their lifestyle <#\>Ten years ago
a show like that wouldn't<,,> have been practicable and today
is a top rater<,> <#\>Um<,,> household savings however<,,> are
used one of the things at retirement <#\>Retirement's a very
important thing in everyone's life and I mean just saving for
the car<,> saving for the house<,> saving for<,> the
children's education <#\>A lot of people have<,> valid<,,> uses
of savings and<,> all of that savings actually helps<,> the
Australian economy <#\>It is all part of this thing called
domestic or household savings<,,> so<,> it it it sort of helps
you personally but it also helps the government to help the
country<,> in in a<,> a macro sense<,,> but<,> I just wanted
to give you that sort of macro outline before I start talking
about what<,> these products<,> are actually meant to do at an
individual level so you see that<,,> that there are some<,>
really significant issues behind<,> everyone increasing their
level of savings<,> <#\>Now<,,> unit trusts<,> are a very
attractive investment option <#\>Um<,,> they're also starting to
collect from business<,> um which is a better term for them
too 'cos I think the<,> the word unit trust sort of<,> don't
quite know what it is <#\>Um<,> it simply is<,,> a trust<,> which
is a legal entity<,> where people subscribe money<,> which is
pooled together and given to professional trust managers<,>
who then invest that money for them um<,,> <#\>Australians are
not particularly good investors<,,> and here I'm talking about
the average Australian<,> particularly when they're dealing
with their own personal<,> savings and investments do not in
fact <O>inaudible</O> <#\>Um<,,> and also<,,> our options are
really very limited<,> <#\>In until<,> recently where we're
starting to see um<,,> share plans of things like Woolworths
and GIO<,,> it was very difficult for the average investor to
buy shares on the actual stock exchange <#\>You had to find a
stock broker and you had to have enough money to buy a parcel
and you had to through that nightmare of matching up with
other people to find enough money<,> to buy a parcel of
shares<,> and<,,> it was all too hard <#\>I mean<,> most people
just said<,,><quote>not for me</quote> <#\>And that's just the Australian
stock market which is<,,> an extraordinarily small market on
the international scale <#\>I mean the Australian stock market is
about two percent<,> of world trading<,,> so<,> to really take
advantage of the investment options that're available<,> we
also need to look<,,> offshore and and outside of Australia<,>
and just think how you<,> today<,> would go about buying some
shares from the US stock market<,,> <#\>Do you really think<,>
that you could<,> manage that<,,> with the current scene <#\>Just
finding a stock broker in the States<,> to <O>inaudible</O>
<#\>Right <#\>So<,,> basically<,> those sorts of options have
traditionally <O>inaudible</O><,> um<,,> and the beauty of
the unit trust is that it does<,> all of that hard stuff for
you<,,> <#\>It<,,> gives you access<,> to types of investments
which you as an individual can't do <#\>The reason it can do that
is because pooling all the money together<,> and I mean we
have unit trust products that have over a billion dollars in
them<,> and when you've got some one who's investing a million
dollars<,> people listen to you <#\>Alright <#\>So a lot different
from when you've got your two thousand dollars and you're
trying to get some<,> the investment made <#\>There is power in
size and <O>inaudible</O><,,> <#\>For the average unit trust you
need about two thousand dollars to invest in it<,,> so<,> they
really are designed<,> to help<,> the average investor<,>
access these markets<,,> and<,> if I was really asked what is
the most important benefit<,> of the unit trust it would be
this question of access<,,> because think of what's available
otherwise you really are limit limited to bank products<,>
basically to bank products which are<,,> savings accounts<,>
fixed term deposits<,,> you know <#\>There's the AGC<,>
debenture type products available<,> <#\>But they are all fixed
interest<,,> based and they are all reasonably low
returning<,> products<,,> <#\>So<,> when you see into these<,>
very very subtle markets<,> you can gain through unit trust
<#\>The other<,,> big<,> advantage you get from the unit trust<,,>
is diversification <#\>Um<,,> diversification<,,> the way I'm
talking about it is quite simple <#\>It's<,> something that one
of our competitors have actually used to their advantages
<#\>Basically don't put all your eggs in one basket<,,> and<,> I
think most people would understand that that's a<,> fairly
fundamental<,,> rule <O>inaudible</O> rule of judgement<,>
that<,,> if you can spread things a around a number of<,,>
different<,> whatever it is<,,> you've got a better average
chance of increasing what you want out of it <#\>Now unit
trusts<,> are <O>inaudible</O> diversification on two
different levels <#\>The first level is the maximum diversifying
of the types of investment options they can go into<,,> <#\>It
says you can have money in a fixed term deposit<,,> and you
can also have money in the Australian share market and you can
also have money<,> in a diversified<,> international type
thing<,> <#\>So<,,> at the product level<,> you will have more
choice <#\>Now<,> there is a place<,> in a sound financial
plan<,> for<,,> the bank products <#\>So don't<,> don't think
that I'm saying to you today that<,,> bank products are
boring <#\>Everyone<,> needs to have some of these accounts
<#\>Fixed term deposits<,> have an important role to play<,,> but
if you want to<,> earn<,> more<,,> there are other options you
need to look at <#\>Um<,,> a good example is<,> take some one who
had<,,> twenty thousand dollars who then<,> put that all in a
fixed term deposit and left it there for ten years<,,> and
take another person who had twenty thousand dollars<,,> who
put ten thousand into a fixed term deposit and ten thousand
dollars into um<,> diversified unit trust <O>inaudible</O> <#\>I
could almost guarantee<,,> that the person who spread their
money will have a better overall return<,> than the person who
put their money totally in a fixed term<,,> without<,> having
lost any capital and<,,> <#\>I don't know about you but<,> you
know when it gets down to the bottom line with my money I'm
planning to try and get the best return for my money for
me<,,> um<,> so<,> <#\>I like when you get to the bottom line
that<,> spreading<,,> gives me a better<,> overall return
<#\>Now<,,> the other<,,> type of diversification which is<,,> a
little bit more difficult to understand is that<,> there is an
enormous range  of interest <O>inaudible</O> and you can
actually diversify<,> the markets into which you invest<,,>
<#\>You can<,> buy a unit trust that does the diversification for
you<,,> where it already has a portfolio that's got a mixture
of shares<,,> and bonds and property<,> both Australian and
offshore in it<,,> or you can say<quote>no <#\>I just wanna go in a
share fund</quote> either an Australian share fund<,> or you can go
into a<,> international share fund <#\>So even within<,> the
actual unit trust product<,,> you can diversify into different
markets<,> and that principle of not having all your eggs in
one basket works because<,,> there is risks with unit trust
products and we're gonna talk about that</I>
