<I><$A> <#\>The idea is to take simple<,> inexpensive objects
and materials<,> and show them in a different light<,,>
<#\>Let's start with the technical part first <#\>That's
making a frame <#\>Now what you're gonna need for this is a
saw hammer<,> some nails a pencil a measuring tape<,> and a
square <#\>As far as materials go<,> a piece of fibre board
and a couple of old fence palings<,,> <#\>Once you've
decided on the size of your frame<,> mark out the lengths of
the four sides<,,> <#\>All right<,> so they're the outer
dimensions of the frame <#\>Two at six hundred<,> <#\>Two at
seven hundred <#\>Now<,> at the ends of all of these four
pieces we're gonna have to mark forty five degree angles so
that the frame will come together with a reasonably neat
fit<,,> <#\>Once that's all drawn out<,> you can get to
work<,,> <#\>When the sides've been sawn<,,> cut the backing
board fifty millimetres shorter all round<,,> <#\>When it
comes to filling our three dimensional picture it really helps
to have a theme<,> <#\>For instance if you're doing something
for the <w>kids'</w> room<,> you might like to use these dinky
cars <#\>I'm going to be using these kitchen and cooking
implements<,> and I'll paint the background black because<,>
one against the other I think'll be very effective<,,> <#\>It
doesn't need to be anything special <#\>I'm just using some
water based house paint that I had lying around<,,> <#\>While
that's drying<,> arrange the sides of the frame to get the
best look<,> then hammer on the backing board to hold the
whole thing in place<,,> <#\>Okay<,,> now<,> when it comes
to<,> arranging the objects don't rush into it <#\>Just sort
of fiddle around for a while until you're happy with the
effect<,,> <#\>There you are <#\>Well once you've settled
on your design<,> you can use some craft glue<,> to stick the
pieces down<,,> <#\>There it is <#\>An easy and enjoyable
way to spend a couple of hours <#\>There's so many ideas you
could dream up<,> and just think<,> you could have the
neighbours clamouring for a piece of your artistic
action<,,> <#\>How much did this masterpiece cost? <#\>Well
the utensils were seventeen forty<,> the glue six fifty<,>
nails one ninety five<,> and the fibre backing board was four
thirty<,> and we managed to pick up the fence palings for
nothing<,> so for a little over thirty dollars<,> we created
this unusual original</I>

<I><$A> <#\>Now this bathroom has a fairly common story to
tell <#\>A poor design has led to all sorts of problems<,>
<#\>A shower with no ventilation and little natural light is
the perfect environment for growing mould <#\>A vanity
unit<,> that's too small for a family to use<,> means there's
a queue for the sink<,> and a bath positioned so that it takes
up one third of the room means there's not much space for
anything else<,> <#\>Because of all those problems this
bathroom's about to be renovated<,> and as well as being
redesigned it's going to look completely different <#\>The
muted marble tones<,> are about to make way for a rich timber
look<,,> 
<$B> <#\><O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>While a renovation like this means that everything
has to start from scratch<,> it's not that long before the new
look begins to take shape<,> and it's time for the timber
cabinets to take centre stage<,,> <#\>All the timber pieces
have been made to measure<,> because the idea is to get a snug
fit<,> so there's no hard to get at places where bathroom gunk
can build up<,,> <#\>Instead of having a gap between the new
linen press and vanity<,> here the two will look like one
unit<,> and make the most of what limited space there is
<#\>The interiors are made of melamine<,> to keep costs
down<,> and make cleaning easy but everything else<,> is
timber<,,> <#\>The timber is all Kauri Pine<,> with a
cabernet stain which creates the rich look<,,> <#\>The bath
surround comes with a detachable panel<,> to make access to
the plumbing easier<,> <#\>A moulded splashback makes a lot
of sense <#\>This upright piece is actually curved making it
easier to keep clean<,> and with this design the tiles go down
behind the cabinet instead of stopping at the benchtop where
they normally would <#\>So<,> there are no right angles where
water can gather<,,> <#\>With tap wear that complements the
old world look of the design<,> the contrast between old and
new<,> is dramatic<,,> <#\>Obviously in a wet area the
surface finish on timber like this is very important
<#\>This's had three coats of Wattyl estapol<,> which is water
proof<,> but still allows for any expansion or contraction in
the wood<,> and it's tough enough to resist hot coffee cups<,>
or even spilt nail polish remover<,,> <#\>Looking at the
costs<,> the timber cabinets were three thousand five hundred
dollars<,> with the tiles<,> tap wear<,> all the other
fittings and the labour involved<,> the total for this
renovation<,> was twelve thousand seven hundred dollars</I>

<I><$A> <#\>This<,> is Palm Beach<,> Sydney's most northern
beachside suburb<,> and a gathering place for the super
wealthy <#\>Even a modest beach house would fetch close to a
million dollars<,> which is incredible when you consider that
many of them are only weekenders<,>  <#\>This<,>
waterfront<,> weekender<,> more like an exotic resort<,> is
prime Palm Beach <#\>Fortunately it's owned by a large family
so it gets well used <#\>Everything about this house is
relaxed and informal<,> so it blends beautifully with its
summery surrounds<,,>  <#\>It was designed<,> by architect
Walter Barder who won an award for cleverly blending the house
with its environment <#\>What he's created<,> is a space
that's half inside<,> and half outside<,,> <#\>All the
living areas are located here on the ground floor<,> with the
kitchen and dining room enclosed under a glass roof<,> and
above that is a huge steel pergola which runs the entire
length of the house <#\>Wisteria has been planted which will
eventually grow over the pergola<,> forming a natural canopy
during the summer<,> when its growth is thickest<,,> <#\>In
the meantime summer is endured by the unfurling of these
sails<,> and of course the massive doors and windows which
open onto a large palm garden<,> providing plenty of natural
ventilation<,,> <#\>The house is long and<,> narrow<,>  but
whereas most houses of this shape like terraces tend to have
focal points at each end<,> this house has been designed with
points of interest everywhere you look<,,> <#\>Walking from
one end to the other is like walking down a colonnade or
street<,> with the rooms as separate entrances <#\>The palm
garden to one side gives it a jungle like feel
<#\>Upstairs<,> this is taken a step further <#\>A raised
garden and bridge<,> divide the master bedroom from the other
rooms<,,> <#\>The house is big and robust enough to sleep
about twenty comfortably<,> <#\>An eight sleeper bunk room
helps with the kids<,> and four of the five large bedrooms
have en suite bathrooms<,,> <#\>These are all identical<,>
quite compact with simple fixtures but these cheap white
ceramic tiles have been broken up mosaic style to add a bit of
fun <#\>Time consuming yes<,> but very effective<,,>
<#\>This is the family's favourite part of the house <#\>You
can just picture the meals enjoyed here <#\>The barbecue
fired up<,> the boats on the water<,> the national park
opposite<,> and it's hard to believe on a day like today but
if the weather turns foul<,> a flick of the switch<,> and down
comes the awning <#\>In fact the owners say their only regret
about this house<,> is that they ever have to leave it</I>

<I><$A> <#\>As I said at the beginning of the show a saw horse
is a handy thing to have around <#\>Perfect size?<,>
<#\>About nine hundred millimetres long<,> about six hundred
high<,> so you can get your knee over the top when you're
working on it <#\>Now<,> it's not too difficult to build<,>
but the trick is<,> to angle the legs both forward<,> and
out<,> for stability<,>  <#\>To save confusion mark the top
piece so you know which way is up <#\>Measure a hundred and
thirty millimetres from the end and place one of the legs on
an angle and mark its position <#\>Now the exact angle of the
legs is not crucial<,> but they all must be the same<,> so use
a bevel to find the angle <#\>Transfer it to the equivalent
position at the other end<,> and mark it<,,> <#\>Then it's
just a matter of transferring those marks across the wood<,>
and using the bevel again<,> for the other two legs<,,>
<#\>If you've used the bevel correctly the marks should have
your legs pointing in that direction<,> <#\>If they look a
little like that<,> they're wrong so make sure you double
check that <#\>Now it's time to work out<,> the other
angle<,,> <#\>Place a leg on the front face of the timber and
mark its position<,> <#\>Measure the distance from the edge
of the top of the mark and transfer it down to the leg
position <#\>This will give us a cutting line for the top of
the wood <#\>Then mark the others the same<,> <#\>Turn the
wood over<,> <#\>Measure the distance to the other mark and
do the same thing to the other four leg positions <#\>This
will end up being the lower cutting mark<,,> <#\>Just
something to remember<,> because the legs are at two different
angles<,> it's not gonna be a right angle cut on the top so<,>
if I place the leg in the position it's gonna go<,> and with a
ruler<,> I just lean it up against that edge<,,> and mark it
<#\>That's gonna be my cutting line <#\>A bevel is used again
to transfer that angle to the other leg positions <#\>Don't
forget the bottom as well<,,> <#\>Once all your marks are
done<,> it's time to saw out the leg holes<,,> <#\>Once
you've finished chiselling the top piece<,> it's time to
attach the legs <#\>Now<,> several ways you can do it <#\>If
you're in a hurry<,> you can just nail it<,> but I reckon a
better job is if you glue and screw it<,,> <#\>Place a small
amount of wood glue in the cavity and screw each leg into
place <#\>You may find you have to tap the legs into position
with a hammer<,> and remember<,> it's better to have a nice
tight fit<,,> <#\>The last thing to do before I trim the
legs to length<,> is to glue and screw<,,> the ply onto the
end and that'll tie the whole thing together and give it it's
strength<,> but because of the angles<,,> little bit of a gap
there so I'm gonna plane that edge<,> so it fits nice and
snug<,> up underneath <#\>Once again use glue as well as
screwing it<,> for maximum strength<,,> <#\>When it comes to
cutting the legs to length number one make sure it's a flat
even surface<,> and with a block of wood<,> we're gonna
scribe<,> each of the legs<,> all the way round that way they
should all be the same length<,,> <#\>Make sure you mark all
the legs before you start cutting them down to size<,>
otherwise it won't be sitting flat<,> as you scribe around
it<,,> <#\>Then you just trim the top of the legs<,> flush
with the top of the saw horse<,,> <#\>A good idea to finish
it off<,> is if you screw a piece or ply down on top<,>
because it doesn't matter if you cut into that <#\>It means
it can be replaced<,> and that way your sawhorse'll last a
lot longer<,> <#\>And the best thing about this job is the
cost <#\>All up it was under twenty dollars</I>

<I><$A> <#\>Margaret River<,> is known for its fine wine and
powerful waves<,> but this tranquil area in WA's south west is
fast becoming recognised for yet another quality<,> <#\>It
was here<,> at the Cape Mentell winery<,> that this region's
love affair with rammed earth building began <#\>It all
started with a humble machinery shed<,> and as the winery grew
so did community interest <#\>Now<,> this method of
construction accounts for almost a quarter of the buildings in
the area<,,></I>
