<S2A-050> <2028>
<I> <$A><O>laughs</O> <#\>Well thank you for your welcome and ac-
in fact for the opportunity to come and back and speak again here
<#\>Um I I have uh done it on one occasion in the past so I
regard it as a compliment to be invited back <#\>And uh I am uh
engaged in ongoing research into the state of the language into
Australian English <#\>And I'm lucky enough to have a job where
I I can not only teach in that area but engage in research into
it all the time <#\>And what I'm really researching is the kind
of thing that you would all notice uh just from day to day
<O>inaudible</O> happening little tiny changes little tiny uh
adjustments going on in the language <#\>If you listen to the
radio uh watch television if you read newspapers and magazines
um you're conscious of things going on <#\>Um you notice perhaps
that um a former prime minister starts to use the word summit not
to mean the crest of a mountain but to mean a high-powered
conference
<$Z> <X><#\>Can you all hear down there</X>
<$Z> <X><#\>Yep</X>
<$Z> <X><#\>If not <O>inaudible</O></X>
<$Z> <X><#\>Do you want to</X>
<$A?> <#\>Yeah
<$Z> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O></X>
<$A> <#\>No fair enough <#\>Uh it it's nice to be able to talk
to my audience
<$Z> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O></X>
<$A> <#\>Anyway
<$Z> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O></X>
<O>laughter</O>
<$Z> <X><#\>Oh I've started something haven't we <#\>You playing
draughts</X>
<$A> <O>laughs</O>
<$Z> <O>laughs</O>
<$Z> <X><#\>But no <O>laughs</O> <#\>No <#\>You know move closer
if you want to because it's no good if Pam talking and you're not
hearing so</X>
<$A?> <#\>Yeah
<$Z> <X><#\>That's right <#\>Yes <O>laughs</O></X>
<$A> <#\>Yes <#\>But um certainly there are these little changes
been going on in the way people use words <#\>They begin to make
them mean new things like summit not being just the crest of a
mountain but being also a high-powered conference <#\>Um you
notice perhaps that and this is going back at uh an election or
two um that one party is trying to launch a new word uh
incentivation
<O>cough?</O>
<#\>You remember incentivation the word that the Liberal Party
um tried to set up as a way of indicating what would draw the
party and the nation together <#\>And so suddenly you're
confronted with a word you haven't ever seen before <#\>And
people trying to do things with it <#\>Um if you keep your eyes
open for advertisements you might notice that people seem to be
spelling barbecue Q U E some of the time although you may have
thought it was normally spelt C U E or or vice versa <#\>But
there there's a little bit of variation going on there <#\>And
if as is probably true your spelling from long training long ago
is better than that of some younger journalists you may notice
them misspelling a word like gaol as goal and <O>laughs</O> G A
O L which is a monster of a word <#\>It's coming out as G O A L
<#\>And in fact when you when you check the Oxford Dictionary
record of these and the Oxford Dictionary's really very very good
record of the history of the word from the eleventh century on
<#\>You find that people have had trouble spelling this word for
nine centuries <#\>And there are in fact records of it being
spelt as goal uh way way back <#\>So it's no wonder that young
writers today still have trouble with it <#\>And it is a very
perverse spelling <#\>And uh many I think would feel that the J
A I spell was spelling was infinitely better <#\>And most of our
newspapers in fact adopt that
<$Z> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O> American spelling</X>
<$A> <#\>Well i- it's thought of because the Americans have never
had the other one <#\>But you find actually when you look into
it that in Britain the dictionary spelling is J A I L but Her
Majesty's penal system uses G A O L <#\>And so if you watch
Porridge or any of those British comedies that are set in in gaol
over the door is always Her Majesty's Gaol spelt G A O L <#\>And
within the system it's spelt that way <#\>But the other spelling
is also alive in Britain <#\>Anyway so there are these as it were
dualities some people spelling it one way and some the other
<#\>And you find yourself wondering which should I be using
<#\>You know will I be American if I use one or you know
declaring my British affiliation if I do the other <#\>Uh or a
word like maybe jackaroo <#\>And maybe you spell it A R double
O and then you read someone spelling it E R O O and you wonder
<#\>Mmm not sure about that <#\>Uh which way should it be <#\>Uh
is one better than the other <#\>Is one more common than the
other <#\>So <O>sighs</O> we take these questions very seriously
<#\>And we have a couple of methods um a couple of research
methods as we might say for trying to find out how common these
things are that we too want to know if it's just a one-off a a
mistake or a a person's private way of doing things or whether
it's very widespread through the community <#\>And we have
basically two techniques w we're using at the moment <#\>One is
a way uh what we might call surveys and we send out a
questionnaire to Australians far and wide in all states um
actually through this magazine of which I'm going to leave copies
with you called Australian Style <#\>And each issue of this has
a questionnaire in it and it invites readers to send back um
their views on these sorts of points of language <#\>Uh that way
we reach a lot of Australians who are um as I say in all states
<#\>They're all ages <#\>They range from about ten up to ninety
I think <#\>Maybe we have some over ninety but I don't
<O>inaudible</O> I can't exactly pinpoint where <#\>Um we have
people who are um working uh I mean who are in paid employment
and people who are not <#\>And so we get a a big uh range in
terms of employment profession education so that we are not just
as it were tapping an elite kind of usage <#\>We're trying to tap
usage very widely <O>cough?</O> <#\>And we ask people in these
questionnaires um how would they spell jackaroo <#\>How do they
spell gaol <#\>How would they spell barbecue and uh do they have
any rationale <#\>Do they have a reason for doing it that way
<#\>And so we we tap not only their practice but also what they
think is the reason for doing it <#\>So
<$Z> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O> that one word barbecue
<O>inaudible</O> the abbreviated abbreviation for it give you the
correct spelling</X>
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$A> <#\>I think it encourages the Q spelling <#\>Um and the
correct spelling is really a matter of debate then <#\>Um if you
take it back to its origins it's it's a word from the um
Caribbean where it was spelt with a C <#\>So if you want to tie
the spelling back to the origins of the word you would spell it
with a C <#\>If you want to give people an easy way in yo- you
know and to connect it with the way it sounds the Q is the
straightforward one <#\>Our survey of of that very word showed
that more people preferred the C than the Q but that younger
people were preferring the Q <#\>And And that was the very
interesting thing that um through these surveys we can separate
out what <O>inaudible</O> are the spellings of middle and older-
age people from the young <#\>And so we can see if there's some
new trend coming in um and in this case it did seem to emerge
that younger people look for um ways of clarifying spelling like
like going to the abbreviation <#\>And they clearly go for the
Q <#\>But um the established older spelling is with a C <#\>So
we we we found some interesting things um out through our survey
about that one
<$Z> <X><#\>You're going to change the system quite a lot in the
next three or four years then aren't you because of the new
educational policy of going back to the three basics reading
writing and arithmetic which the education department announced
this week so</X>
<$A> <#\>That's right <#\>They're keen on that
<$Z> <X><#\>Yes <#\>They've finally woken up</X>
<$Z> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O> notice in the uh Telegraph today
?</X>
<$A> <#\>I I this this very day
<$Z> <X><#\>Yeah</X>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>Uh I
<$Z> <X><#\>Would you prefer questions now or <O>inaudible</O>
later on</X>
<$A> <#\>Well um I don't mind a few more but maybe if I give you
some more data and and uh you know I'd welcome your questions in
due course
<$Z> <X><#\>Just note your questions down and ask Pam later on
?</X>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>Anyway uh I guess what I want to say through
some of this is that I'm researching these things not to prove
that one is right and the other is wrong um or indeed to feed
that back into the education system <#\>I In many ways I prefer
the education system and the teaching of English to recognise
that these things aren't fixed and that there is movement and
that more than one might be right <#\>It's just that there are
differences and people want to make sense of their spelling <#\>I
think that's why um people would rather spell barbecue with a Q
because it seems to make sense and they don't know about the
Spanish word from which it came <#\>And they prefer to spell gaol
J A I L not because they wish to be American but because it's a
more regular spelling <#\>It rhy- It works with tail and pail and
hail and all sorts of other words that are quite sensibly spelt
A I L <#\>Whereas there's this there's this one sore thumb of a
word uh that has a spelling all its own <#\>And a a a a again the
young people were very strong on J A I L  for that sort of reason
<#\>They're looking for rational ways of doing it um and using
the rules they know to guide the next stage <#\>But um some uh
that I think is also why w we got a stronger vote for jack-a-roo
<#\>Uh there there are two spellings there if you like
<#\>There's jack- A R O O and jack- E R O O <#\>And I d- I don't
know which would be your preferred one <#\>I I looked up the
history of it and as far as one can tell it was it used to be A
R O O until about the second world war <#\>And at that stage
there was a kind of burst of words created with -eroo I think
probably helped by an American fashion of the time <#\>And they
created colloquial words of all sorts like kisseroo and bumeroo
and flufferoo
<$Z> <X><#\>Jillaroo</X>
<$A> <#\>Jillaroo is is is the next thing to jackaroo <#\>Um but
I think this this American um trend probably was brought down
here by servicemen crossing the Sp- Pacific and that that -eroo
spelling then seemed to take over from our older -aroo spelling
um in kangaroo which is the one that's really the native
Australian one <#\>Um and so for a while um after the second
world war the E R O O spelling seems to come up <O>inaudible</O>
as the strong one and some of our dictionaries um The Australian
National Dictionary and the earlier editions of the Macquarie
Dictionary will suggest that um jackaroo and not jillaroo I think
but jackaroo certainly is is E R O O <#\>But if you ask people
um when we survey people we found they were all for -aroo and
very typically they thought of it as a combination of something
and kangaroo <#\>Um that that's the other intriguing thing about
that word where it came from <#\>And
<$Z> <X><#\>Well as I say I mean I ne- I think jackaroo came from
the original <O>inaudible</O> blacks employed on the station
properties were known often known as jacky and J A C K a a jack-
a-roo is simply <O>inaudible</O></X>
<$A> <#\>Mmm
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>So you combine that jack- with -aroo
<$Z> <X><#\>Yeah <#\>Um and I</X>
<$Z> <X><#\>Jillaroo only <O>inaudible</O> females became
involved in everything</X>
<$A> <#\>After that yes <#\>And certainly that that was the the
I think the preferred explanation until people began to explore
aboriginal languages <#\>And they thought maybe there's an
aboriginal term behind all this <#\>But they couldn't really find
the right one <#\>And then there was a thought that it might have
been borrowed um from a an equivalent American term which is
buckaroo <#\>Buckaroo is is the equivalent um uh what do you call
them sort of farm worker um in American um pastoral ranches
<$Z> <X><#\><O>inaudible</O></X>
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>So So they thought possibly it was the
modification of the American one but the dates weren't quite
right for that <#\>And And from drawing a blank on the American
and the aboriginal and various Anglo-Saxon <O>inaudible</O> like
deciding it me-it was jacky rue R U E <O>inaudible</O> they
borrowed that French word in and created something <#\>They've
come back to the theory that it is just jack- and -aroo <#\>And
it really is a native Australian formation out of those two bits
<#\>And uh that I think is why most people um in our survey when
asked why they spelt it A R double O sort of explained it in
relation to kangaroo</I>
