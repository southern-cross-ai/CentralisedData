        Operational and staffing matters are the responsibility of the Australia Post board. The government is confident that the management and board of Australia Post will continue to manage the company in the best interests of all Australians. It is a company that is responding to significant and worsening structural challenges. Australia Post, as I alluded to, expects to make a total company loss—for the first time since corporatisation—as early as next financial year. Australia Post's management are absolutely committed to ensuring that the long-term sustainability of the company and their decisions reflect this commitment.

         Senator Fifield's answer fails to address the question.
         <br/>
         Like Pontius Pilate he washes his hands. His failure to deal with "Operational and staffing matters" is probably because he spends too much time examining the minds of Australia Post Management. How does he know what they "are absolutely committed to ensuring that the long term sustainability" of Australia Post  yet he does not know who they are going to sack?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I bet the long term sustainability of Australia Post would be better serviced by starting the sacking at Ministerial level and working downwards.

         Well according to Australia posts website.
         <br/>
         Aust Post administrative officers receive $12-$13 per hour.
         <br/>
         Mail Sorters $16- $17 per hour.
         <br/>
         Van drivers $21 - $22 per hour
         <br/>
         Regional Managers - $101 - $110 per annum
         <br/>
         General Managers  - $312 - $338 per annum
         <br/>
         Ahmed Fahour - $4.8 Million.
         <br/>
         One doesn't have to be an Einstein to see the problem.
         <br/>
         But I'm Sure that Ahmed will cut services and reduce the number of workers so that his job and salary is secured.
         <br/>
         Perhaps Andrew is right start with the minister and then move to Ahmed and maybe a few others ?
         <br/>
         Remember he is earning 10 times what other similar post heads are around the world.
