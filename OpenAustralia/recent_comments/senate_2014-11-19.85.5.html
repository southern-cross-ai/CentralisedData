        Question time is very important to crossbenchers and I appeal to my crossbench colleagues: do not let them get away with this, because where is it going to lead? It would not matter which side it was—we know the major parties run the show and here we are, we get one question a fortnight and we might lose that. I was not even aware that question time could be suspended. The opposition was aware that I wanted to ask my one question for the fortnight about bracket creep and families paying too much tax. Is that too much to ask, to get our one question? We have been discussing this for quite some time—how many questions do we get and what are we going to ask? Is one a fortnight too much to ask? This is pretty poor form. Again, I appeal to my crossbench colleagues to vote against this motion. Please, let me have my question—my one question for the fortnight.

         Bob Day says Question time is very important to crossbenchers.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Does this mean his concern for Question time exceeds his concerns for Family Superannuation?

         I have on occasions previously voted FF but chances are much slimmer now. I regard FF as nothing more than a front for the Economic rationalist elements of Liberal Party.
