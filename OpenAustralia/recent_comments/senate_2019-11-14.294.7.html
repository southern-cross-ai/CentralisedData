        They did build one dam, Senator Rennick, but they didn't build it properly. They stuffed it up! They stuffed up building the Paradise Dam, and they won't tell the people of the Wide Bay Burnett why they have emptied 105,000 megalitres out at sea. They have flushed it down the Burnett River, but will not tell the local community what the issue is with the dam. That is a disgrace. It is the country's largest infrastructure fail. If this dam were anywhere else, if it were in Sydney or Melbourne, it would be on the front pages of Fairfax newspapers and it would be leading the ABC news. But, because it's in Queensland, of course, people don't really care about it. I know I sound a little bit chippy about that, but this is the largest infrastructure fail in the history of Federation and no-one is talking about it. Yes, I support the new Bradfield Scheme and I support dams. We need more dams, fewer Labor Party politicians and fewer dodgy deals between the Greens and Labor. I said I would stick to five minutes and I have.

         Dams are a natural monopoly. A free market can therefore not work. Government has a responsibility to build dams so that anyone on reticulated water has water without restrictions.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Both ALP and LNP have been failures in building Dams.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Paradise Dam clearly needs to be replaced .
         <br/>
         It would appear that dam is no longer capable of holding the amount of water we were told it was designed to hold.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         There is suspicion that Wivenhoe/ Somerset system has problems.  These problems have been known to exist since 1974 Brisbane Flood when water had to be released to prevent catastrophe. Similarly in 2011 Catastrophe was averted by good dam management.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Dam design should ensure that the dam can hold the amount of water needed foe water supply and flood mitigation.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Why has NO GOVERNMENT addressed this? 45 Years should have been sufficient time.
