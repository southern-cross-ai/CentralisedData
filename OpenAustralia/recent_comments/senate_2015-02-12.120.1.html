        In relation to the specifics of the question, I will take that part on notice. I am not aware of any such requests, but I will take that part on notice. But, in general, let me make this very, very important point: we as a government will join with all the other democratic and peace-loving countries of the world to try to eradicate evil which is, unfortunately, creating a presence in Syria and Iraq. We have seen not only the evil of that movement played out there but also adherents to it locally. We have seen it around the world as well. We have a duty not only to ourselves but to the world community to ensure that this evil does not get a foothold, and therefore I am—as is the government, as are all my colleagues—committed to ensuring that that which needs to be done is done to eradicate that evil.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result, we are happy to join with other countries such as Iraq, noting that Iraq has a very senior government representative here in discussion with our very own Minister for Foreign Affairs today. I understand that official will in fact be meeting with the Prime Minister after question time.
       </p>
       <p>
        So we are concerned to eradicate this evil and work with others. As to specific requests from the United States, I will take that on notice.

         I wonder how it is that this brash over-bearing and blustering Senator Eric Abetz does not already know that America is currently the Worlds most frequent creator of military offensives? America itself has not been intruded upon by any other country, other than the bombing of Pearl Harbour, Hawaii, back in the 1940's by the Japanese.
         <br/>
         Forget the later ensuing Cold War, that was a cultivated situation between both America and Russia, with no ever resultant military action nor invasion. (I note the factual reference to this reality by Senator Christine Milne, in that she is aware of America's ever frequent CIA instigated military aggressions in any and every part of this World.)
         <br/>
         The manner of Senator Abetz in his not acknowledging this fact, by ignoring the advices of Senator Milne during his response to her questions, which is not in itself an infrequent event.
         <br/>
         It worries the people of Australia that government representatives such as this Senator Eric Abetz, do not recognise that the American Military leaders themselves began both the offensive invasions first in Iraq followed by the second military offensive being launched in Afghanistan.
         <br/>
         Why is it so that this Senator will not quote the facts, yet here in the Senate he alludes to these 2 countries as though they each were the aggressors in the first instance.
         <br/>
         I have to say that this Senators\'s response contained a seriously misleading statement and and had then gone on with an unwarranted rallying of Australia's Military Forces be posted overseas simply to serve the interests of America.
         <br/>
         Also of serious concern is that this Senator is following the reports in the mass media rather than obliging himself to seek out the truth and actual cause of each of these referred to American Military engagements.
         <br/>
         This being fact, should see this Senator Abetz ejected from the Senate immediately, then to follow shortly thereafter his expulsion from any further position in the Australian government.
         <br/>
         Unfortunately for the Australian people Senator Eric Abetz appears to favour the propagandas and whatever other nonsense that is the published product of the Murdoch newspapers, than to sensibly engage with Australia's Military Defence Intelligence Services.
