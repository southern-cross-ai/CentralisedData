        It is quite clear from that question that not only is the opposition, frankly, not interested in discussing serious issues about the future economic development of this country; but they have already determined that position of opposition. This measure that the government is introducing in terms of our tax reform is about increasing job opportunities. It is about increasing the opportunities for new investment in the mining sectors. In the context of the changes we are making right across the system, it is about making sure Australian business is more competitive. It is about building on our strengths and it is about ensuring that we have the investment opportunities in the future. It is absolutely consistent with what is happening around the globe. It is absolutely consistent with the changes that are occurring. The modelling has shown that under this new arrangement mining investment will rise by 4.5 per cent, jobs by seven per cent and mining production by 5.5 per cent in the long run. What we have is an opposition that are going to take an obstructionist position no matter what is said.

         Kim Carr talks about modeling, what modeling the modeling of increased cost on projects that will now not go ahead. You should not bite the hand that feeds the recession was not avoided by labors policy but the future projects now threatened by a labor tax. How can we trust your supposed sound modeling when you cant install insulation.I very much doubt the people of Australia would thank you for the stimulus package knowing that in the future you would destroy there supers.  Labor if your strength is adding tax's, failing to install insulation and going with the global trend then god help us all, oh that's right you wont be around after the election because you !#@$ !@#!#.
