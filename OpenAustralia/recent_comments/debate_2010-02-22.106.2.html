        In the inquiry currently being conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, which I chair, it is quite clear to me that some common-sense changes are needed to how our immigration process treats disability. In a huge immigration program like Australia has there are always ways of tweaking and improving the system, as the government has recently done with its changes to the skilled migration program.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now turn to some remarks made in the online publication, the
        <i>
         National Times
        </i>
        , by Mr William Bourke, who announced he is going to launch a new single-issue political party to campaign for cuts to immigration. I welcome that because it will enable the Australian people to voice their opinion about this issue. I confidently predict that Mr Bourke’s party will sink without trace as most single-issue parties do. His arguments in the
        <i>
         National Times
        </i>
        seem to mark him as a left-wing anti-immigration lobby, as opposed to the right-wing anti-immigration lobby represented by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson" rel="nofollow">
         Pauline Hanson
        </a>
        . In an aside, it is somewhat ironic that this arch critic of immigration imagines that she can just emigrate to the United Kingdom. I am not sure why she thinks that or what value she will contribute there. Returning to Mr Bourke’s article, he says, striking a populist note, that immigration benefits only ‘property developers and media moguls’. This is of course nonsense. Immigration benefits the whole community. It stimulates economic growth and employment. It brings in much-needed skills. It enriches our culture and makes our cities more attractive to tourism. In economic terms, immigration is one of Australia’s greatest assets. It may be said that we used to ride on the sheep’s back; today we ride on the migrant’s back. I will return to that issue in a minute.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further in the article Mr Bourke strikes a green note, blaming population growth for ‘dead river systems, near permanent water shortages and increasing pollution’. Once again, this is nonsense. Australia is not short of water. Our current water problems are the result of generations of waste and neglect of our water resources, aggravated by the current drought. The solution is to stop wasting water, particularly in irrigation but also in our cities. The state and federal governments are currently undertaking plans to do that. Does Mr Bourke not know that Melbourne’s water consumption has been cut by 25 per cent over the past 15 years? It is now at the same level it was in 1982, despite urban growth of nearly a million people in that time. Mr Bourke also blames immigration for the loss of farmland, for traffic gridlock and urban congestion, and for the loss of open spaces for our children. All our social ills are apparently caused by population growth fuelled by immigration. I wonder if Mr Bourke has ever been outside Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has a population density of three people per square kilometre. Even Victoria, our most densely populated state, has only 62 people per square kilometre.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Netherlands" rel="nofollow">
         The Netherlands
        </a>
        —one of the most important countries in Europe—has 400. I am not advocating that we aim for a Dutch population density; I am saying that Australia is a thinly populated country even by the standards of the developed world let alone by the standards of our region. Our social and environmental problems have not been caused by excessive immigration. They have been caused by wasteful use of our water and other resources, lack of urban planning, short-sighted decision making, excessive reliance on the motor car and neglect of investment, particularly in urban infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        I conclude by saying that one of the things that I find most astonishing about the anti-immigration lobby is their failure to address the issues of the economic benefit of the government’s current skilled migration program. Figures that are uncontested and are in the budget papers show that in 2008-09 the current composition of principally skilled migration delivered a benefit to the tax base of $800 million in the first year, and in the 20th year that immigration delivered $1,800 million net benefit to the tax base after the cost of the Humanitarian Program and family reunion. If you looked at that one year of immigration, there is $20 billion of net benefit to the Australian people.
       </p>
       <p>
        How do these people imagine that we are going to pay for the ageing population of Australia as the baby boomers move into retirement without skilled immigrants coming to this country? They have no plan. They have no vision. It is important to address the issues of urban infrastructure, saving water and better public transport. These are all legitimate issues. To say that the current skilled migration program is not contributing to Australia’s benefit is very short term; it does not look at the whole picture and certainly does not address the uncontested issues of the economic benefit of the program, as it is currently constituted to Australia.

        "I confidently predict that Mr Bourkes party will sink without trace as most single-issue parties do."
        <br/>
        Danby, perhaps if you keep telling yourself this and click your heels together 3 times you will make it so.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "This is of course nonsense. Immigration benefits the whole community."
        <br/>
        Well as an inseperable part of the coporatocracy, and a vested interest along side your big business political donors, of course you would say this wouldn't you. How could anyone expect any other position from you.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But it seems that 70% of ordinary Australians do not feel that they are getting any of these elusive benefits that population growth is supposed to be bringing us.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "It stimulates economic growth and employment. It brings in much-needed skills."
        <br/>
        It also stimulates increased demand for infrastructure and services that all governments are reluctant to provide and creates additional skills shortages that requires even more immigration.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In short it is nothing more than a giant government sanctioned Ponzi scheme where wealth generation is largely dependant on bringing more entrants into the scheme.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "It enriches our culture and makes our cities more attractive to tourism." If taken to far it also fosters division and ethnic tension. You only have to look to Britain, France and Germany to see this.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "In economic terms, immigration is one of Australias greatest assets. It may be said that we used to ride on the sheeps back; today we ride on the migrants back."
        <br/>
        What about riding on the back of Australian technology and know how instead. Perhaps you should be puting more money into scientific research and creating lasting and high value technology based jobs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Australia is not short of water."
        <br/>
        Spoken like a true scientific and ecological illiterate. The fact that we are building desalination plants means that we have exceeded the capacity of our ecosystems to generate surface water.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "The state and federal governments are currently undertaking plans to do that. Does Mr Bourke not know that Melbournes water consumption has been cut by 25 per cent over the past 15 years? "
        <br/>
        Like water itself, water savings are finite. Once everyone is using the absolute minimum of water, e.g. showering once a week instead of once a day or not at all, then what do you propose we do you bloody stupid old fool.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "I wonder if Mr Bourke has ever been outside Australia."
        <br/>
        Danby, I wonder if you have been outside your tiny little Canberra universe. Or outside the coastal urban centres for more than just a whistle stop tour.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Australia has a population density of three people per square kilometre. Even Victoria, our most densely populated state, has only 62 people per square kilometre. The Netherlandsone of the most important countries in Europehas 400. "
        <br/>
        A tiny 6% of Australia is arable this tiny amount of arable land has low soil fertility by world standards. The rest of Australia is desert or near desert that cannot sustain large populations. And the coastal urban population has already virtually drained the Murray Darling basin dry.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Figures that are uncontested and are in the budget papers show that in 2008-09 the current composition of principally skilled migration delivered a benefit to the tax base of $800 million in the first year, and in the 20th year that immigration delivered $1,800 million net benefit to the tax base after the cost of the Humanitarian Program and family reunion."
        <br/>
        How much is it costing and will it cost Australia increased infrastructure and services to maintain the living standards of a significantly increased population?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "How do these people imagine that we are going to pay for the ageing population of Australia as the baby boomers move into retirement without skilled immigrants coming to this country? "
        <br/>
        Elderly Australians contribute significantly to the economy through volunteer labour, particularly free child care services for their working children and caring for other elderly Australians. And, apart from medical services, they consume significantly less than younger Australians.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "They have no plan. They have no vision."
        <br/>
        Niether do you Danby. All you lot have come up with is a Ponzi scheme to fund our aging population.
