        I would like to draw the House’s attention to the situation regarding rural and regional students with learning disabilities, literacy in particular, who are currently able to go to Dalwood Assessment Centre and Palm Avenue School Residential Program in Sydney, which are designed to help children from rural and regional areas with literacy and behavioural issues. These two facilities currently work together. The assessment centre is to assess the needs of the child and the residential school is to provide long-term on-campus support. This site is located at Seaforth, on the northern beaches of Sydney. The centre opened in 1972 and has been providing services to primary aged children in remote and rural areas since then. It is the only facility to cater for rural and remote children with a literacy problem, which is obviously impacting upon their learning and behavioural situations. It is a two-part program and provides assessment and residential support; one being Dalwood the other being Palm Avenue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dalwood is to be closed down and Palm Avenue is to be moved to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmead_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Westmead Hospital
        </a>
        . There has been no indication of what assessment services are going to be made available prior to children going into the residential program. The residential program is currently an eight-week intensive course where students are provided with direct and comprehensive support to assist with their literacy and, as a result of course, their behavioural issues. There is also an outreach program which currently caters for over 100 children around the state. It works in conjunction with the child’s school and, where necessary, with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Flying Doctor Service
        </a>
        for those students who are very remote.
       </p>
       <p>
        While Dalwood and the Palm Avenue School are regarded as the last options, they take children who are referred from schools, health professionals and, in some cases, the parents themselves. Reportedly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Premier
        </a>
        said the site was underutilised, which is why the school has to be moved. It being on prime real estate in Sydney, I do not think we have to wonder why the Premier is looking to sell it. There has been no consultation, nor has there been any real information on the downgrading, the axing or the relocation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like this government, the Minister for Education, Ms Gillard, and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs,

        Hi,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I am one of the people lobbying to keep Dalwood Assessment and Palm Ave School open. If the government felt the site was being underutilized and it had so many children waiting on the waiting list why did they not give more funding to the service to decrease the waiting list and to make more use of the site. Instead the government very quietly tried to close down Dalwood and Palm Ave school without consultation with the people that matter, the parents. If anyone would like to sign the petition to keep Dalwood open for 12 months until a suitable model is developed please go to the following link:
        <a href="http://www.topqualitytoys.com.au/index.php?pr=Save_Dalwood_Ass_Cntre">
         http://www.topqualitytoys.com.au/index.php?pr=Save_Dalwood_A...
        </a>
        We strongly disagree with the Palm Ave school being moved to the grounds of Red Bank Psychiatric Unit. Our children have learning difficulties, they are not mentally ill and should not be put under a mentally ill banner.
