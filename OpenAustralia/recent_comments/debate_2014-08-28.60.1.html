        I recognise the member's interest in Qantas and the services that it provides to his electorate and many parts of Australia. We all know that Qantas has gone through very difficult economic circumstances in recent times and, particularly, its international business is suffering from very heavy levels of competition. The accounts announced by Qantas today reflect some of that background. While the loss was perhaps a little less than the market expected, the changes to the accounting arrangements—and in particular bringing to account the lost value in the 747 aircraft fleet—has led to a spectacular headline loss figure. As I understand it, the 747s were bought at a time when the dollar was at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        56c or US57c. They are actually on Qantas's books at the present time at a value higher than the price you could buy a new aircraft for. Clearly they had to deal with those sorts of issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reality is there is some encouragement for Qantas shareholders in the report. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        has foreshadowed that they expect the airline to return to profit in the first half of next year and that is encouraging; that is, I think, better than the market would have expected. They are continuing with their processes of reform but they believe the airline has turned the corner. I am encouraged by that news. Qantas is a very substantial Australian business and, indeed, a part of our national history, and I welcome their assessment that their worst days are behind them and they will be able to move to profitability fairly soon. My understanding is that a part of the cost cutting that Qantas has undertaken includes the CEO himself taking a pay freeze, and I think that sets an example that many other CEOs in these situations might well like to consider.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final thing I would like to mention is the acknowledgement by Qantas in their report about how valuable it has been that this parliament has got rid of the carbon tax. The abolition of the carbon tax will save Qantas over $100 million a year, and that will help to return them to profitability so much the faster.

        Just whose fault is it that the $ Australian is as high a value as it is?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Truss is a direct descendent of John McEwen. McEwen would have sold dollars till the value dropped to the point that Australian exporters could compete with foreign imports.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        With the same logic that Truss uses Rossi boots may have been able to compete with Indonesian Boot manufacturers.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Truss deserves the boot for betraying Australian Workers in his desire to pander to the Liberal Mafia who work not for Australia but for multinational companies. Andrew Jackson

        Alan Joyce used his 10 percent stake in Qantas to award himself a pay rise of $2 million in 2011. Its pathetic that Warren Truss should be complementing a man who earns 5 million a year for taking a pay freeze.
        <br/>
        I cannot understand why they are allowed to down value their assets in line with the ratio to the US Dollar.  If they can do that then perhaps small and medium companies that purchased their earth moving equipment and other heavy machinery during a low Australian dollar should also have the avenue to do so. Even small companies with their vehicles bobcats and smaller equipment should also have that option.  Asset values are what they are and only realized on disposal or sale.  The 2.8 Billion dollar loss comprises of a 685 million trading loss and a paper right down of 2.6 Billion. Surely losses of this magnitude would have the company seriously considering Mr Joyce's position let alone maintaining this unrealistic salary.  Where is the productivity value that Mr Joyce so often mentions in this way of thinking.
