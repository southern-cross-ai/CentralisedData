        I must say to the senator that we in Western Australia were extremely disappointed when we saw the state of Tasmania closed down and turned into a national park.

         I begin by asking the readers of this comment to be patient and open-minded while reading the entire of my vitally important message contained within this absolutely necessary posted comment.
         <br/>
         Seems to me that David Johnston (WA Liberal party) is being led by Senator Eric Abetz.
         <br/>
         Senator Abetz knows only too well that the statement made by David Johnston was a load of rubbish, yet he continued in that same vein relative to Tasmania's stretched out economy.
         <br/>
         During any stage of say the past 10 years of Labor government leadership in Tasmania Senator Abetz had every opportunity to act for the people of Tasmania, it worries me that instead, Senator Abetz preferred to expend all his energies in the Senate being hypercritical of the former Labor government, yet he would not lift a finger to offer up for debate even one single new economic initiative, nor an alternative to that which does the greatest harms to Tasmania.
         <br/>
         That great harm is the push to continue the non- relenting (arguably non-profitable) logging of this State's ever diminishing Native Forests.
         <br/>
         The State government business enterprise of Forestry Tasmania is already up to $300,000,000-00 in debt as of this present time.
         <br/>
         The people of Tasmania know all too well that one of this State's major obstacle to economic salvation is this very Senator.
         <br/>
         Senator Eric Abetz who has scant record of supporting any at all State Labor initiative for fear it may paint him as a less extreme radical right-wing opponent who speaks against every conceivable alternative that may create a benefit for this Tasmanian State and or its 500,000 people.
         <br/>
         Were it in the hands of the Tasmanian people they as one great collective would be enthusiastic in their aid to help this Senator to pack his belongings and forever leave this State of Tasmania.
         <br/>
         His record to date stands as pro Tasmania- 0 out of a possible 10, while Senator Eric Abetz personally achieved substantial personal wealth through and by his elevated appointment as a Liberal Party Senator which has himself marked as- 10 out of 10.
         <br/>
         This is that same Senator that embarked on a futile but still expensive exercise to have vast regions of Tasmania's High Conservation Value Forests delisted from their World Heritage classification, with the view that this would free-up more forests to suit the State's wood-chippers and the internationally known corrupt overseas-owned Ta Ann timber operations.
         <br/>
         Unfortunately Tasmania will always be the lesser when this Senator seeks to initiate as many harms as he is able to propose through and by his droning's, during each of the active sessions in the Senate House.
         <br/>
         Please be assured that I speak on behalf of the great majority of Tasmania's 500,000 people, this State could far better prosper if this problem Senator could be exiled from Tasmania.
         <br/>
         I do apologise in my having to give this serious matter its well overdue delivery.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         William Boeder.
