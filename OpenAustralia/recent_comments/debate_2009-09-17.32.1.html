        We have an extraordinary situation here. The coalition values Australian citizenship as a privilege and an honour to be conferred on men, women and children who can demonstrate a commitment to this country through embracing our values, our ideals and our beliefs and speak functional English so that they can fully participate in our parliamentary democracy, our economy and our communities. I am proud when I go to the citizenship ceremonies and see men, women and children of all nationalities who have come to Australia. They are from all races and from a range of backgrounds. They may be rich or poor, skilled or not skilled. There is a whole range of people standing there and proudly proclaiming that they agree with the values and ideals of our country and the responsibilities of citizenship. These people have served a four-year residency in Australia and have come to know and love this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are concerned that this government is choosing to discount the value of the citizenship certificate, or being a citizen in this country, by simply looking at whether or not the applicant is a medal prospect. There is no way that this business can be disguised. The amendment bill that this government is putting before us may have had its words watered down a little so that it now refers to ‘a special activity’, but the only people who will be able to present to the minister for a discounted residency in order to gain citizenship are those nominated by either
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennis_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Tennis Australia
        </a>
        or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Olympic_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Olympic Committee
        </a>
        . This is about people who may be able to win medals for Australia internationally. Shame! This is a devaluing of Australian citizenship. Australians love their sport and we are proud when one of our sportspeople stands on the podium and wins a medal for our country. But it is not a matter of a medal at all costs—and this is what this legislation seeks to impose.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just today we have been told in the media that the Australian Olympic Committee is arranging to have Ms Borodulina, the speed skater this legislation is all about, sworn in as an Australian citizen at the embassy in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        . So Ms Borodulina, who is to be fast-tracked into citizenship, will not even be in Australia to gain her citizenship when this bill becomes law.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Tuesday" rel="nofollow">
         Next Tuesday
        </a>
        she will become an Australian citizen for no other reason, it would seem, than that she is a medal prospect if she becomes a member of the Australian Winter Olympics team. Shame! We do not believe Australians are that crass. We believe they honour and value Australian citizenship. So we have proposed a substantive amendment to the bill, which says no to this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Citizenship should be treated very seriously. We agree that there may be some exceptional circumstances where it may be in the public interest for a man or woman who can contribute to Australia in an extraordinary way to become an Australian citizen even when they may not have served the full four-year residency requirement. In our amendment we have proposed that the minister should have the discretion to grant citizenship in these circumstances but the discretion would not be able to be delegated and it would be fully transparent in that, if ever such a decision is taken, the name of the person would be put before the parliament and published on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Immigration and Citizenship
        </a>
        website. The decision would therefore be transparent and the government would be responsible and accountable.
       </p>
       <p>
        I find it extraordinary that the Parliamentary Secretary for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        and Settlement Services would suggest that the minister of the day would so lack integrity that they would agree to someone who has never been in Australia, and who is of no interest to Australia, becoming an Australian citizen. I find it extraordinary that he would be so doubtful that his minister would have the integrity to exercise such a discretion. So we say quite bluntly and clearly that we cannot agree to an amendment which simply reflects the urgings of the Australian Olympic Committee and Tennis Australia. We believe we are a bigger nation than that in heart and spirit. We believe that the variety of people who step forward to become Australians is a strength—the diversity of race, background and skills. It is about the diversity they contribute to Australia—it might be as a professional or as a skilled tradesperson or as someone who is raising a family. It is not about elitism.

        Dear Respected Senators,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I have a query where I find new citizenship amendments bit unfair to some people. I have been law abiding Resident since moved to Australia in 2003 and acquired skilled Permanent Residence in March 2007.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Technically speaking
        <br/>
        If someone got Permanent residence few months before july 2007 like I got in March 2007, He gets PR visa label of 5 years and as per the citizenship rules referenced to him on the PR letter, He was obliged to follow those citizenship pathways at that time.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Later He gets to know that yes he still have the same pathways applicable but just for 3 years instead of 5 years from now onwards. It was a contradiction to what was said before and written before to him. (As they have to apply for citizenship before july 2010 to be eligible under previous rules)
        <br/>
        What if you are forced to pay your mortgage in 10 years instead of 20???
        <br/>
        when you had well worked plan for 20 years.
        <br/>
        Does that make any sense???
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I would face significant hardship if I'm ineligible to apply for citizenship.
        <br/>
        My profession demands travelling and I was on a trainee exchange programme to acquire new skills in Biotech industry which is classified as one of the presitigious direction of work all around the world. I would face significant issues like won't be eligible to apply for government jobs and Travelling restrictions.
        <br/>
        I cant imagine me waiting for another 4 years considering I lived in Australia for around seven years and was overseas for only 1.5 years mostly for acquiring/importing new skills from Europe. I'm very Well assimilated with Australian culture and has been mostly in europe on Trainee programs in the Industry.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Now I would have to start from scratch when I would be arriving back in Jan 2010, As I lived overseas more than a year.
        <br/>
        Any comments would be appreciated.
        <br/>
        Thanking you in anticipation,
        <br/>
