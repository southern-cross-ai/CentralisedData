        I'm so pleased Senator Cameron raised 'the inability of the divided, unstable and illegitimate Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government to govern for all Australians' because it allows us to take a trip down memory lane and relive the divided, unstable and illegitimate Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government Australians had to endure. Remember former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd? His own right-wing powerbrokers said they'd had enough of what they called Kevin Rudd's chaotic prime ministership. Those words came from none other than Bill Shorten. Then they wheeled in Julia Gillard, who was Australia's first female Prime Minister, and their factional divide ruined her too.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor stuffed up the mining tax and installed a Speaker in the House of Representatives who didn't mind giving blokes a touch-up when he got on the sauce. Labor signed a poisonous coalition deal with the Greens in 2010 to ensure they could get their legislation through the Senate. Although Julia Gillard promised there would be no carbon tax, the deal she did with the Greens meant every single household and business got slapped with the tax, which nearly sent pensioners to the wall. So much for her saying, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' Labor propped up Craig Thomson, who had a filthy past involving hookers and boozy nights at the expense of the Health Services Union.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor launched the atrocious $50 billion NBN, which has been a dog's breakfast under both Labor and this government. Labor had 50,000 illegal boat people claim refugee status, costing this country billions upon billions of dollars, until this government put a stop to the boats. Labor took our economy from a $57 billion surplus to debt of $300 billion. The coalition is no better. The coalition is spending $50 billion—maybe higher, up to $200 billion—on subs. Immigration levels are the highest of the OECD countries and others at 1.7 per cent. Foreign ownership and assets gone—that's Australians. Both of you have destroyed our nation, identity, economic stability and credibility. The people will decide at the next election: get rid of them both.

         The senator says that "Although Julia Gillard promised there would be no carbon tax, the deal she did with the Greens meant every single household and business got slapped with the tax, which nearly sent pensioners to the wall."

         Are they the same pensioners who were compensated for the cost of the carbon tax (which only applied to usage and not to service charges)?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Curious how the senator is unconcerned over the larger tax known as the GST on the whole electricity bill  which is still a much greater burden on pensioners.
