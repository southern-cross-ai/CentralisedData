        Being from Queensland, Deputy Speaker Vasta, you would be well aware that we have a G20 summit in Brisbane later this year. As part of that we also have a Y20 summit. Five youth delegates will be representing Australia at the youth summit. Recently, I invited one of the five delegates, Jonathan Pavetto, to Page to talk to some of the student youth leaders in my electorate. Jonathan was happy enough to come along and we had a great turnout. We had over 80 student leaders from Page come to listen to Jonathan and, more importantly, for Jonathan to listen to them. We had representatives from as far north in my electorate as Woodenbong and as far south as South Grafton, which are hundreds of kilometres apart, and from as far east as Ballina and out west past Kyogle. There were students from Casino and Lismore as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jonathan commented, to me and to the many students who turned up, on the students' engagement. They gave some great suggestions—their vision and their dreams of what they want the world to be as they mature into young adults. They were very engaged. Jonathan thanked them. He is going to take their views and their opinions of the world—what they want to see happen—to the Y20 summit. To the student leaders and teachers who came, I thank them for the time they took and for the great contribution they made that day. Also, I thank Jonathan from coming along to hear the views of the youth of Page.

        I am most interested in what issues the young people of Page raised.  Did they express concern about the environment?  Were they concerned that they would receive no benefit for six months if they were unemployed and that they would not be able to go to the doctor if they needed to because they wouldn't be able to pay the $7 co-payment?  Did they mention how they could afford the expenses necessary to fulfill their looking for employment requirements, or were they expecting their parents to support them?  Did they express concern that, if they went to Uni, they would end up with a debt equal to a small mortgage?
