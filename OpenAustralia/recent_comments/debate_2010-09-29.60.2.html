        I was rather surprised and distressed to see an advertisement on Channel 9 today (11/10/2010) for internet gambling.  To my personal knowledge more peoples are adversely affected by gambling than alcoholand drugs combined.  My query is where is the regulation for such advertising and if not available, why not?
