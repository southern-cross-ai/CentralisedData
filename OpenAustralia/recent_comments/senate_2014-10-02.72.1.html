        Thank you, Mr President. I can understand the Labor Party's sensitivity. Yesterday, six of Australia's peak business organisations united in one voice, calling on the Senate to pass the government's one-stop-shop environmental reforms as soon as possible. They are the Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association, the Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia, the National Farmers' Federation, the Property Council of Australia, and the Urban Development Institute of Australia. According to this very wide and diverse coalition:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        â€¦ one of the biggest drags on Australia's competitiveness is lengthy and costly delays in securing project approvals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Research tells us that implementing the one-stop shop for environmental approvals would provide economic benefits to Australian business in the order of $426 million each and every year. If the Senate blocks passage of this vital reform it is risking $160,000 million in cumulative real GDP revenue, as well as up to 70,000 new Australian jobs. According to BAEconomics, in Senator MacDonald's home state and that of Senator Lazarus, 'a one year saving in the time frame for approvals would deliver over 13,000 additional jobs.' In my home state and that of Senator Lambie, it would deliver an extra 1,100 additional jobs. The Productivity Commission has assured us that this is a crucial reform that will make approval processes more efficient without compromising the quality of environmental outcomes. I say especially to the Labor Party that sacrificing principle and precedent for perceived short-term expediency is not good policy.

         One could suggest that Abetz is pandering to the corporate gorgons that generally run with this Abetz pack as a means to further sate their lusts for higher profit margins. Tossing the guessed at numbers in the air without any substantiation of the why how when and where of such mythical numbers, is a standard Abetz tactic irrespective of his pledge to uphold the truth on all occasions as an Australian Senator. The costs to the Australian taxpayers to host the Abetz team and their far right advisers, far outweigh any benefits hoped for by supporting such philistine Abetzian camp followers. One must never forget the harms this Senator has wrought upon the needs of the aging Australians in Tasmania.
