       That this House:

      <p class="italic">
       (1) notes the devastating impact of tobacco products on the lives of Australians, with smoking causing numerous life threatening diseases including cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, stomach cancer, pancreatic cancer, liver cancer, cervical cancer, leukaemia and oral cancers, and that the majority of smokers regret the decision to ever start;

       (2) acknowledges that there is significant evidence to suggest that creative design, branding and promotion of tobacco through its packaging:

      <p class="italic">
       (a) reduces the impact of graphic health warnings;
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       (b) increases the attractiveness and appeal of tobacco products for adolescents; and

       (c) misleads consumers to believe that some tobacco products are less harmful than others;

       (3) recognises that this Government is already implementing a suite of reforms aimed at reducing smoking and its harmful effects; and

       (4) supports the significant measures proposed by this Government including the measure to mandate plain packaging of tobacco products from 1 July 2012.

        I think our government are falling behind the times further and further in a rut. This new proposed legislation of plain packaging is not only absurd , but also ludicrous to everyday tobacco consumers and retailers. By introducing plain packaging, will only simplify the counterfeiting of cigarettes by the black market,which will have higher detrimental repercussions on smokers'health.These would be more than inferior and higher risk to a smoker's health. Also the AMA and all other anti-smoking lobbyists, are to stop the lies and conspiracies which burdens and vilifies smokers. (Eg The QUIT campaign showing unreal footages of a smokers' lung with a liquid tar content as shown on tv.NOT TRUE)Also facts and figures made about smokers'deaths are not true facts , considering the causes of death was not direct from smoking ,but from other causes which are not mentioned ,done on bias and not reality of the true causes of death. This discriminates smokers and their rights literally and economically. Most smokers know if they were to over consume cigarettes, they're more likely to pass on quicker , but that goes with any other element which we consume. Water=Drown.A non smoking cleaner is more exposed to toxins than a pack a day smoker.What about consumables like toothpaste, which we allow our kids to consume. Hmmmnnn some conspiracies going down in Canberra. Okay you want to protect "the children" however they will need to make choices of their own one day, which they will more than probably take higher health risks than smoking.By having cigarettes priced the way they are here, gives everyone a false notion that they are an expensive product, for which they are not.Having cigarettes at the prices they are, will force some poor smokers' resort to dangerous methods to maintain their habit, forces some smokers to smoke 100%the cigarette, to make up for costs, and will smoke smoked tobacco(generally rolled up butts) ,which present more dangers to the smokers health which you all are trying to supposing  to save. Is this is to favour non smokers? Evidently I do not think so. Shame on the government and shame to their non smoking counterparts. D id you know smoking has its therapeutic benefits? Half of the longest lived human beings (100 years and above) were too, regular smokers.Therefore the non sense theories made by governments, are just another scare tactic and another cash cow they want to impose on us smokers.
