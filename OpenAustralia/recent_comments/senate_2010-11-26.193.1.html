        On behalf of the Australian Greens I also extend seasonâ€™s greetings to all our fellow senators, all the officers and all the staff of this great building, who give service to this nation, and to all the people of Australia. I hope that it is a wonderful summer. I wish everybody a great deal of happiness.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also think of those around the world who are not having the happiness that we have and who will face daunting circumstances in the coming times. It is a time to think about how we human beings interact with each other and how we can best gift each other in sharing the great plenitude of this fantastic nation, one of the four oldest continuous democracies on the face of the planet. As we move into this season thinking about goodwill to all people who on earth do dwell I wish all of you, both here and those listening, a marvellous summer, good tidings, a great time with friends, families and loved ones and a bountiful 2011.

         I am glad you will have a great Christmas Bob Brown. You and the Independents have let the majority of Australians down with this NBN. Another expense. Tell them the truth about it. We don't want it, isn't anyone listening?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Think of the Aussie battlers who like myself are struggling, and don't have money.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Don't your or any Politicians think about things before you want to vote on them? I don't think so. Listen to the people.The Labor Government doesn't rule, the Greens do, and many friends and family of mine totally agree.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Talk to the ordinary Aussie battler. Listen to them, before you vote on things. Taxpayers pay for your salaries.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         You have a great Christmas, and I will think of you whilst my children and I have sandwiches on Christmas...

         They will never get it right, because they are payed by the rich.  There is only one real way, for change and that is for you to govern your government departments without them, it is called the individual two third majority vote self government, within it own constitution, we the tax payer will get it right.
