        I thank those senators that have partaken in this debate for their contribution. Let us remember what this bill is about. It is, in fact, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill. It is seeking to implement the policy that we, as a coalition, announced well in advance of the last election; in fact, 12 months in advance. It was out there for all to see. I thought we had won the election but, no, the Labor Party and the Greens are going to keep using and abusing their majority in this place to frustrate the will of the Australian people. If I recall Senator Wong correctly this morning in the media, she said that she and the Labor Party were elected to oppose. They were elected to oppose the government. I think that says it all. It indicates the mindset; it is their negativity; it is their resentment of the Australian people voting for a change of management on 7 September last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is this registered organisations commission bill all about? It is very simply this: under corporate law, if a company director rips off his or her shareholders, they potentially face a period of imprisonment of five years, or a fine of, I think, $320,000. Now, if you go to a union official or, indeed, an employer organisation official that rips off his or her members, do you know what the penalty is? It is $10,000. Those opposite in all their ranting and raving and contributions in this debate were not able to indicate in any way, shape or form what the material or moral difference is between a company director ripping off shareholders or a union official ripping off members. What is the difference, morally or materially? Absolutely nothing.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we are seeking to do in this legislation is to make the penalty regime for ripping off shareholders the same as for ripping off members. Why did we think that that was necessary? Because of the former Labor member for Dobell, Craig Thomson, because of the former National President of the Australian Labor Party, Michael Williamson, because of Mr Blewitt and Mr Bruce Wilson of the Australian Workers Union scandal of some 20 years ago, we believe there was the need for a regime that put in place penalties that would ensure, or hope to ensure, that if you do the crime you would actually do the time and pay a penalty.

        My goodness, we have the former union official from the other side. They are all the same from over there. They are here courtesy of the unions, by the unions and, regrettably, for the unions. Keep in mind that the Australian workforce has determined for themselves, now that the coalition has given workers the opportunity to decide whether or not to join a union, and 83 per cent have decided not to belong to trade unions. I just ask the simple question: I wonder why? Indeed, there have been some decent trade union officials who have come to me and said, 'Whatever you do, don't quote my name or where I'm from but, Eric, you are doing a great thing for the trade union movement in this country with this legislation. Because you know what, all I want to be is a shop steward. I want to be a person that looks after the interests of the workers. I have no desire to become a Labor senator, therefore I don't need slush funds, therefore I don't need to have slush funds to boost membership.'

         Once again we see Senator Eric Abetz attempting to beguile the house Senators into believing that he and his Liberal cohorts are the saviours of honour and integrity. I am amazed by the pompous probity lacking attitude exhibited by this Senator, (who he would have people believe he serves the people of Tasmania, let me tell you as a Tasmanian citizen that he does not) especially in the matter of our Tasmanian World Heritage Forests.
         <br/>
         For it is this Senator that sought to delist our World Heritage Status so that the forces of unyielding destruction can send most of this Ancient Gondwana-land Forested Icon's logging plunder first to the wood-chippers, then ultimately sold-off to whatever Asian market. Nothing at all could warrant such a reprehensible undertaking so stacked up against the greater good of Tasmania and its people.
         <br/>
         There is a goodly amount of the venomous serpent to be found in the history of this Liberal Party labyrinthine laggard, especially in his trashing of all that is to do with caring for our environments and wildernesses in Tasmania.
         <br/>
         Perhaps one day this same Senator will come clean about his support given to the clear-felling of whatever high conservation value forests here in Tasmania were destined for the chop back in his time as the Federal government minister for forests, only to have this former iconic forest bashed and burnt then converted to a rather useless form of eucalyptus mono-species plantation. (that was then intended for the MIS selling Crocodiles to offer to thee unwary superfunds as though this would en-rich the superannuation individual account holdings of the hard-toiling people's superannuation nest-egg.)
         <br/>
         The outcome of it all actually cost this State its many billions of dollars, soon to be followed by the sudden retreat of this Senator into the World of darkness, far and away from the limelight he had previously frolicked about thereunder.
         <br/>
         One must think of one's future before attending to whatever the latest spruik/spiel by this Senator generally, that relates to the money-holdings of others.
