        I would like to read a letter from a constituent, Corina Abrahams, to the Prime Minister.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dear Prime Minister,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm writing this letter asking that you please help stop the desecration of our beautiful unique
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beeliar_Wetlands" rel="nofollow">
         Beeliar Wetlands
        </a>
        and cultural heritage from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Roe Highway
        </a>
        extension, which the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian Government
        </a>
        is determined to build against the wishes of the Noongar community. Please Mr Turnbull, I ask you kindly to intervene.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm a local Noongar Woman, a custodian of the Whadjuk Noongar people and direct descendant of the Beeliar Noongar tribe. I'm unsure if you have been educated with what the beauty of this land holds and the cultural significance it maintains, not only to me, but my Elders and my Ancestors. It weakens my heart to know that you as Prime Minister of Our Country have provided the West Australian Liberal Government the financial capability that is needed to ensure this project goes ahead.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Beeliar Wetlands plays a significant role in the creation of our Dreaming and Mythological stories, in particular the story of Our Wargle otherwise known as Our Rainbow Serpent. It plays an important spiritual role in maintaining the health of these local waterways.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's historical importance as a major meeting place is attested to by numerous archaeological deposits in the area, one of which includes chert, indicating a very lengthy site of occupation indeed given that chert sources on the Perth coastal plains were submerged 6000 years ago. Registered sites that were previously listed and documented according to the Aboriginal Heritage Act have now all of a sudden been de-listed, and taken off the heritage sites registry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe if you took a short time to read the historical information, which is readily available, you would start to question the process and the manipulation, the disrespect and lack of cultural regard for the custodians and direct descendants of the Beeliar Whadjuk Noongars, including the actions our West Australian Government took in ensuring this project gets the necessary Federal funding and approvals for Roe 8.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I can ONLY hope and pray that you take into consideration the destruction this project will entail, after reading the reports provided by public record and your department; that you ensure that you don't lose your integrity, values and morals as an Australian, and 'rethink the link', and protect this area from Roe8 for our people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The loss of our endangered native wildlife inhabitants and the natural beauty of our local bushland and cultural significance to the Beelier Wetlands Lake Coolbellup (known today as

        ) will be unreplaceable and no amount of money can change that.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Therefore I ask you to please consider all aspects of other feasible options that have also been suggested and researched which have encompassed all significant factors that I have just expressed and addressed. Please consider my letter, '

Our cultural values and connection to country are very important from an Aboriginal perspective just as important as Churches, historical places, war memorials and any place that holds great significance are to Non Indigenous people, from a Non Indigenous perspective. Please our children's future is in your hands, Mr Turnbull.

        We see another liberal state government, an offshoot of the federal government trampling over what is a natural Australian place with significance to the first nation people. A place with enormous significance to wildlife. Because what this government is doing to wildlife is terrorism. Destroying them, their homes and the food supply of any who might survive.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There is no excuse for the government to suggest that they are attempting to produce something by doing this. The terrorist is always trying to produce a result, but there is always a better way to do this. The problem is the people in government and those they engage to do things their way are not clever enough to achieve a result any way without resorting to violence. Tearing up what is magnificent.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Our wildlife live in terror of all manner of dangers every day, the predator was bad enough, but the human terrorist is worse. There is no doubt that in this instance as in every instance there is a better way to achieve the result. required. A less destructive way. The liberal government places a price on everything and doesn't value what Australia cannot rebuild; the natural places of wonder.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It's also the fault of the people. They only start to worry when it comes to their backyard, because when it doesn't directly affect them, they do nothing.
