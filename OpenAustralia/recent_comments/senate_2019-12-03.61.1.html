        Our veterans are clearly struggling to cope with PTSD and other afflictions that they have developed as a result of their service, but DVA seems hell-bent on making their lives more miserable than ever. Is the minister aware that the department is currently fighting the claims of 94-year-old World War II veteran, and holder of a Military Cross, John Hutcheson. Why is the DVA going after vulnerable war veterans at 94 years of age?

         I have a lot of respect for you in your fight for veterans and for the people of Tasmania, but today I can only feel and express my great disappointment in your action this day. Many Australians will struggle with your vote over the medevac bill.
         <br/>
         If you believe this government will abide by whatever deal you think you have struck - and my guess in an investigation into Chinese influence - then I think you are likely to be greatly disappointed.
         <br/>
         You have contributed to a weakening of our system of democracy by using a secret deal to buy your vote.
