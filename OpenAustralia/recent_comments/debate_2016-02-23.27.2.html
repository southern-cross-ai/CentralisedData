        I rise on behalf of Canning to oppose the controversial Safe Schools program and to call on the government to remove funding for it. Bullying is a terrible thing. Like those opposite, the coalition government condemns all bullying whether it be for sexuality, gender, race, religious belief or disability. Many young people are profoundly damaged by bullying in their childhood and teenage years, and many people carry the scars of bullying into adulthood, well beyond the school yard. But the Safe Schools program is more about advancing ideology than equipping children with techniques to deal with bullying. The highly sexual content of the Safe Schools program has generated much controversy. You only need common sense to work out why parents are outraged by the program, which is aimed at 11-year-old children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government has imposed this program on the state and territory education systems. It is ideological big government reaching into the lives of ordinary Australians. The program advances an exclusive ideology that does not allow for competing views on sexuality and gender. The program decries bullying yet pushes its own form of bullying by pressuring young children to conform to a particular view of sexuality. Finally, it usurps the role of Australian parents, who are best placed to teach their own children about sexuality and how to navigate the broad challenges of the schoolyard and life. I call on the government to condemn and defund the Safe Schools program.

        It is inevitable now that schools will be polarised into "gay schools" and "non-gay schools" as the "gay schools" shout homophobia at anyone who does not want to be a homosexual (it will be a witch-hunt on all the time to "catch-out" the heterosexual and spew abuse at them just like Bill Shorten did to Cory Bernardi - no one wants to be on the run from the homo hit squad all day long) and the "non-gay schools" who are sick in the gut of having rampant hedonistic humanism/atheism shoved down our throats and so they want to live in peace by teaching their children the 3Rs and decency. The creators of the "Safe School" program obviously didn't think through how their initiative will cause polarised "gay schools" and "non-gay schools" that will now eventuate - that is the path that we are now heading down. For schools/universities to support such a destructive program like "unSafe Schools", it drags down their reputations and has me, for one, warning people not to send their children to such institutions - parents will vote with their feet (and their wallets) by not sending children to skewed schools/universities that are only into political activism and not into educating people.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        What a disgraceful joke!
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Mr Shorten prompted and provoked a response from Senator Bernardi - Mr Shorten said "That would be the chap" first thereby prompting and provoking a response from Senator Bernardi. Many media articles fail to mention this but rather pretend that Mr Shorten was bullied for no reason and he used the Safe Schools program to deal with the "bully Bernardi". No one should prompt or provoke hostility whether in the parliament or the play ground. If people think that what Mr Shorten did is acceptable and that the Safe Schools program encourages LGBTIQ (did I miss a letter?) children to similarly go around prompting and provoking hostility in schools and then crying "victim" when they get criticized, then the Safe Schools project is indeed as dangerous as Senator Bernardi says. The more that we are finding out about this "unSafe Schools" program, the more dangerous it becomes. Mis-reporting by people is causing a growing resentment and disgust against same sex marriage and if the media thinks that the Australian public are too stupid to see through skewed reporting, they are wrong. The same sex marriage lobby group keeps doing this sort of thing over-and-over again and it shows how devious and dishonest they are. The media should not be adopting the same devious and dishonest tactics in their reporting.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The "unSafe Schools" program tells kids that gender is fluid and sexuality is not definable. It tells kids that Gender is how you feel. The program encourages kids to classify themselves while simultaneously denigrating such classification. It is a view of human sexuality and gender which is entirely constructed and removed from reality. It teaches kids that their personal feelings are paramount and that they should expect EVERYONE to affirm them. It makes kids who actually are LGBTIQ hypersensitive and on the lookout for anything that might remotely be classified as bullying. The entire foundation of the programme is constructed on conjecture and dodgy use of statistics.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There is no homophobia.....just a different opinion. People who disagree with same sex relationships simply disagree, nothing more. Calling it homophobia is a cop out for not having a legitimate reason to have a same sex relationship and so to silence your critics, you use emotive name calling. The whole name calling stunt has worn out and people are not put off by being called homophobia, hate speecher or bigot because name calling is an acknowledgement that you have lost the argument. If equality is what the same sex marriage advocates want, then equality for all types of marriage would be allowed. To limit their marriage re-definition to only include "two consenting adults" is being unequal to the people wanting other forms of marriage - so it is quite a big lie to claim that SSM is "marriage equality". If you want to save money on a "wasteful" plebiscite, then simply leave the Marriage Act as it is - no cost involved then!.....but the same sex lobby pushing for a change are creating the cost.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Also, the same sex lobby have used the Anti-discrimination Act to try and silence the Roman Catholic Church in Tasmania.....so already this bully tactic has been used. The Australian Christian Lobby are addressing this existing misuse of the Anti-discrimination Act and simply saying that such bully tactics should not be used by anyone (either the "yes" side or the "no" side) to silence people and stop free speech. The way that the media has made out the ACL are wanting favouritism or somehow circumventing the Anti-discrimination Act is further evidence of how devious and deceitful the SSM advocates are. The obvious outcome is that it will backfire and more and more people will be chased over to the "no' side - that's what happens when you lie too much for too long.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There is no hatred, bigotry or discrimination to uphold the millennia-old understanding that marriage is solely between a man and a woman. At worst, it is just a difference of opinion, and at best, it is upholding history for a reason - opposite sex marriages are the only way that civilizations can thrive and be prosperous (you can have children to start with and then to structure ethics, honesty and decency). The family unit is vital to how society functions and when it is distorted or changed, so does society. Already, heterosexual children are told not to use the terms "boy, girl, him, her, mummy, daddy, etc" because these terms are gender specific and oppose the same-sex/transgender identification - so heterosexual people (from a very young age onwards) are impacted in thousands of ways by the same sex marriage re-definition. Plus all heterosexual marriages change from being recognised as "married to a member of the opposite sex for life" to "someone I am temporarily having sex with" which, for me, would be insulting if I was in anyway assumed to be married just for sex or to another man. So every time I say the words "I'm married", my marriage is being damaged by the re-definition of marriage. My feelings are as valid as any homosexual's feeling and should be equally considered seriously in the whole same sex marriage debate. Failure to do so shows that the same sex marriage issue is not about love and equality, but solely a political stunt to legalize rampant hedonism and a blatant attack on Christianity. If you want honesty, then there it is.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Rome Empire that had rampant hedonism and debauchery in the 1st-3rd centuries were not Christian (they killed Christians for sport in the "circuses" where lions would eat Christians) and the Emperor Constantine turned to Christianity as a way out of the horrors going on in the Roman society. So there is a perfect example of how we must also avoid the same horrors of rampant hedonism and debauchery by following the Christian teachings. In other words, we can be "saved from ourselves". The ACL and Senator Cory Bernardi are highlighting the unfair and dishonest name-calling and dirty political tactics used by the same sex lobby group to silence their critics and shove their agenda down our throats. This will be highlighted a thousand times as the same sex lobby group continue with their dishonest bully tactics and prove the ACL to be true over-and-over-and-over again.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I am loving to homosexuals (the people), but I hate actions that are deceptive, hurtful to people and unnatural (including homosexuality). There is a difference.....plus I am talking about the "same sex lobby group" and not individual homosexuals. I have met many homosexuals who don't want same sex marriage laws because they don't want the association with marriage - it is the same sex lobby group that spews out lies and name calling.....and the "unSafe Schools" propaganda. If you think it is Leviticus that I am following, then try reading Romans 1:16-32. No one can disagree with the passage because it is being fulfilled before our very eyes (for example: "Professing themselves to be wise, they became fools", "vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened", "uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts", "God gave them up unto vile affections"....and verses 28-31 describes most of our politicians perfectly).   Amen!
