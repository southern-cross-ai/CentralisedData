        Mr Howard. Harry knew Australians would fight to preserve what he and the other old warriors of the trade union movement had fought so hard to secure.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a testament to Harryâ€™s contribution to the history of South Australia that his funeral service, which was held in the same church that he had been married in nearly 50 years before, was attended by a diverse range of people, including other veterans of World War II, lawyers, politicians and past and current members of the South Australian and Australian industrial commissions, including those who came from the employer side of the industrial system. There were businesspeople and members of his parish there as well. Harry was described by the many who spoke about him at his funeral as a mentor, a visionary and a tough but pragmatic negotiator who earned the respect of the union members and business and government identities with whom he worked. His funeral card noted that his was a life lived with courage, compassion and integrity. It is fitting that the Senate note the life and legacy of Harry Krantz.

         I was faffing around on the Safari search engine instead of going to bed and reading. I put my grandfather's  full name (William Charles Hartley Harry) in and there are a few entries linking him to his discharge from the army at the end of WW1. I then put in the Federated Clerks Union where he worked until he was 60, three months before I was born.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         There was nothing in there about him that I could find. The FCU is no longer but I came across the name Harry David Krantz whom I remember was a friend of his. My mother spoke of Harry Krantz very highly and I remember him coming to our house when Grandpa died and sitting so gently with Nanna, offering her his condolences.

         This is a lovely tribute to him in the Senate. Thank you Anne. He died the same year my mum died. He was three years older than her. Anyway, it makes lovely reading. There is also a comment by Eric Abetz towards the end which is to be expected. Congratulations Anne on not rising to the bait.
