       <p>
        I am standing in for Senator Rachel Siewert, so I will be seeking leave to move the amendments standing in her name. The first amendment that we will be moving to this bill, as we foreshadowed in our second reading contributions, relates to the fact that, if you want sustainable development in the north, you do not build massive new coalmines and you do not build whopping great dams that will probably never fill up as the climate continues to change.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we spoke about earlier in the day, we are supportive of sustainable infrastructure in the north that respects the natural values of the area, that works with local communities and respects their wishes for their land. In fact there are many clean energy opportunities, many communications opportunities and many conservation economy opportunity for the north that we would happily back and would love to see receive taxpayer support. However, when it comes to a dirty energy slush fund, as this one seems to be, then it is an entirely inappropriate usage of taxpayer funds to be giving out low-interest loans potentially to the likes of Adani to help build their mine, their railway or their port. So that is just not on, as I outlined in quite a lot of detail in my earlier contribution in the second reading stage of this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our amendment amends the definition of the economic infrastructure covered by the bill to exclude fossil fuel projects and also nuclear projects or any associated infrastructure that would facilitate those fossil fuel or nuclear projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I say, if you are seeking taxpayer support, then in this age of climate emergency we do not need free taxpayers' dollars going to prop up unsustainable coalmines that cannot get private funding, because the coal price has tanked and people realise climate is a thing. You need instead to be seeking support for clean energy alternatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        With no further ado, I, and also on behalf of Senator Siewert, move amendment (1) on sheet 7907 for the Australian Greens:

         Gobsmacking idiocy from the Greens to be looking to exclude nuclear projects literally in the same breath as invoking climate emergency, which their restricted prescriptions are singularly failing to address.
