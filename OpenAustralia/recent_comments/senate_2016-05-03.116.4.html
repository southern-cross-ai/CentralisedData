        The motion by the Greens fails to mention and Turnbull coalition government established the $1 billion Clean Energy Innovation Fund. This will be jointly managed by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The fund will support emerging technologies to make the leap from demonstration to commercial development. By offering innovative equity and debt products, the fund will attract better quality projects. This is another example of the Turnbull coalition government providing innovation and new economic opportunities, enhancing our productivity while also protecting the environment and reducing emissions. In contrast, the Greens are only interest in empty rhetoric with no consideration for what will actually drive investment in new energy.

         Senator Ryan is correct the Greens are only interested in empty rhetoric but he is wrong that "they give no consideration for what actually drives ... investment". In fact the Greens spend a lot of t5ime considering investment and then do all in their power to ensure that investment does not occur. They actually want NO INVESTMENT other than in the growth of inner city parasitism.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         They spend more time on SSM than they do on greenery, and they show their support for trees by ensuring that the blocks of flats where most of them live have no trees. However they demand that others keep their trees.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Lets have  a new tax based on land that levies a increasing rate not on tree clearing but tree existence. Pre cleared inner city battery cages for Yuppies would pay the highest rate and country areas wher trees block the vision to the street the lowest rate.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Larissa  Waters has a office costing the taxpayer $414, 000 to fit out which has artificial turf on the roof. The building was once a government owned bank serving  at least some purpose  but now it serves as evidence that Greens are not interested in greenery only in inner city yuppie life.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Senator Waters represents all of Queensland and could easily have set up her office in the Centre of the state at Emerald or Charters Towers. Amazingly she set up the office in the cetre of Brisbane's Yuppy precinct.
