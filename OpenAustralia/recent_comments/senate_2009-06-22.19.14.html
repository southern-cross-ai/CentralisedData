        The report to which I was referring concludes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If ambitious mitigation goals are to be achieved, then emissions reductions programmes and carbon pricing should be implemented as quickly as possible, and within stable policy frameworks.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is what we are trying to do. We are being stymied by those opposite. The key to tackling climate change is to create these price signals, with long-term expectation and long-term certainty. Again: those opposite stand in the way of that. Most importantly, this report confirms that ‘inaction is inexcusable’ and that we already have the tools needed to tackle climate change. The chair of the team who wrote the report, Professor Katherine Richardson, said at the launch:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Society has all the tools necessary to respond to climate change. The major ingredient missing is political will.
       </p>
       <p>
        The professor really could be talking about those opposite, because what is missing in this debate is political will on that side to act on climate change.

         What is needed is a total shift in community attitudes at all levels.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         If community members instigated sustainability efforts on the home front, such as urban food gardening, recycling, hanging clothes on the line, turning off power points, composting, grey water systems, shorter showers etc., were less worried about 'stuff' they want (not need), then maybe we might stand a chance.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         However, government needs to be BRAVE by putting in place legislation that may be unpopular. For example, not decreasing the size of urban blocks but limiting the size of houses on blocks. Our blocks have been getting smaller, houses have been getting bigger, back yards smaller (our kids have been getting fatter too).
         <br/>
         <br/>
         If you have not seen this film, then please watch it. Each person I have shown this to has been impacted by it. It shows the process of 'stuff' we use. It is called THE STORY OF STUFF
         <br/>

         <br/>
         This film has been watched/downloaded by over 7 million people. It is brutal, makes sense &amp; certainly gets you thinking.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         We have 20 years to start turning back the effects of climate change and global warming.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         At a recent climate change launch at a university in Melbourne, we were shown the Story of Stuff (above) and the following movie:
         <br/>
         WAKE UP, FREAK OUT - then GET A GRIP
         <br/>
         <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/1709110" rel="nofollow">
          http://www.vimeo.com/1709110
         </a>
         <br/>
         <br/>
         For people who lack the education (disbelievers) regarding climate change, both these movies put a lot of the facts in perspective. You cannot argue with the content. It is backed up by evidence. ALL politicians should be made to put aside 1/2 hours of their time to watch these. Maybe then they will not fight the change that needs to happen.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I look forward to seeing the courage being displayed that I hope the Labour Party has regarding this issue.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Thank you.
