        As I have just said in answer to the Leader of the Opposition's previous question, I met with the head of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toyota_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Toyota Australia
        </a>
        in December last year personally to reassure him that, as far as this government was concerned, we wanted Toyota to continue manufacturing in Australia. We wanted to assure Toyota that assistance would be available on much the same basis in the future that it had been made available in the past. I understand that the opposition wishes to sheet this home entirely to the government even though this plainly is something that has been taking place over quite some years now. I know that mere statistics are not of much consolation to people who are facing the closure of their business. But it is a fact that since 2007 motor production in this country has declined by a third. It is a fact that since 2007 motor employment has declined by a quarter. We all deeply regret the devastating announcement that Toyota made yesterday. We all deeply lament this. But our challenge as a government, our challenge as a parliament, is not to preserve every single business indefinitely. Our challenge is to create the conditions under which people, if necessary, can transition from good jobs to even better jobs. And I say to members opposite, whose sincerity I do not doubt: is it going to be easier to get a good job with a carbon tax or without a carbon tax? Is it going to be easier to get a good job with a mining tax or without a mining tax? Is it going to be easier to get a good job with businesses at times being strangled by green tape or without that? Is it going to be easier to get a good job with the Australian Building and Construction Commission restored or without it? So these are the questions before this parliament, and I think that the honest workers of this country know who their real friends are.

        <br/>
        On the Motor Industry...
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We have a proven capability and capacity to build automobiles ...or anything else for that matter...
        <br/>
        Letting go of this ability is not in the national interest..to let go of all that capacity, the expertise, all those jobs and economy is just dumb...
        <br/>
        If under the current paradigm the auto makers say they are not competitive with the current products which are being duplicated worldwide.... and need to go... then so be it...let them take their bat and ball and go home..
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We,on the other hand are willing to go our own way... with automotive products which better serve our unique/diverse Australian environment... and needs.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Remember we have the capacity
        <br/>
        <br/>
        SUVs are fine for getting the shopping and taking the kids to school but leave a lot to be desired if you have serious work to do...and most Australians on the land have that...
        <br/>
        I would like to see a new Automotive product which better serves us in the 21stC...in fact a World market awaits...
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Put THE HOLDEN.. (not the GM version)..back on track..and watch the other auto makers follow.....
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Broad Brush
        <br/>
        <br/>
        1. Announce the Intention..IMMEDIATELY
        <br/>
        <br/>
        2. Establish design parameters commission design and specifications..create model
        <br/>
        <br/>
        3. Invite Industry/public consultation and Identify all existing 'off the shelf' components/services to be incorporated.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        4. Provide comprehensive virtual computer generated images of the product for the market to review complete with full specification schematics
        <br/>
        <br/>
        5. Set delivery and price
        <br/>
        <br/>
        6. Orders can then be placed..one per person (to avoid exploitation)..deposit required which attracts interest until delivery..finance available government backed..and how about tax deductible status...do I hear someone howling foul...Hey.it's our product..it's good...we can market it how we want...
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The Idea, is to maintain capacity/jobs and economy....whatever it takes...no one likes to held to ransom ...we have a country to get on track..
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We not only want the auto industry back... we also want the auto market back..(important)..
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So lets get serious...the name...and the winner is...
        <br/>
        <br/>
        .....The HOLDEN Eco Cruiser...
        <br/>
        ....(first model....The Phoenix).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Looks great...is and drives impeccably..and does what you want.....in other words.. it will be the only auto on the market that doesn't lose value when you drive away from the showroom.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        World market.....???
        <br/>
        It's not hard when you have a better mouse trap..
