        I thank Senator Polley for this opportunity to discuss job creation. In Australia, we accept that the government should provide the infrastructure and then get out of the way and let the employers create jobs. The less red tape, green tape and blue tape are nobbling free enterprise, the more real breadwinner jobs will be created.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor Party has brought us Queensland's notorious reef regulations, which are in the process of strangling the life out of agriculture across thousands of kilometres of Queensland coastline. The loss of jobs in agriculture and agricultural communities along our coastline is a disaster that Labor's green tape has caused. Australia's Water Act, though, was the product of an unholy alliance between the Nationals, Liberals and Labor. It has driven family farmers off their land and decimated rural communities. Green tape is killing agriculture and killing jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        United Nations blue tape is having the same effect on industry. This insane idea that power generation should not produce carbon dioxide, a harmless trace gas that does not cause climate change, has destroyed heavy industry and manufacturing in Australia. China is now producing what Australia would not. Labor, the Greens and the Liberal-National parties have all championed this transfer of jobs from Australia to China. China and India are now building 500 new coal-fired power stations to keep up with the demand for Chinese and Indian steel and manufactured goods.
       </p>
       <p>
        Renewable energy, or, as I call it, 'unreliable energy', does not create jobs. For every one new job in so-called renewables 2.2 jobs are lost in the productive economy. Yet Labor, the Greens, the Liberals and the Nationals are out there every day touting a renewable led economic boom. The only boom here is in the cost to taxpayers. Every new wind turbine costs Australian taxpayers $536,000 in subsidies every year. That's $13 billion a year in subsidies, and that costs every household $1,300 a year. Blue tape is not about environmentalism; it is about wealth redistribution. Large foreign companies win and small Australian businesses lose. One Nation will withdraw from international agreements that harm Australia's interests and we will bring these jobs home. Senator Polley blames the Morrison government for poor job creation. I blame Labor, the Nationals, the Liberals and the Greens.

         The senator claims that "This insane idea that power generation should not produce carbon dioxide, a harmless trace gas that does not cause climate change, has destroyed heavy industry and manufacturing in Australia. China is now producing what Australia would not. Labor, the Greens and the Liberal-National parties have all championed this transfer of jobs from Australia to China."

         <br/>
         Firstly, CO2 is dangerous in enclosed spaces just ask submariners and astronauts. Secondly, all plant matter is generated from atmospheric CO2 which can hardly be described as a trace gas. Industry and burning of fossil fuels adds millions of tonnes of CO2 to the natural atmospheric carbon cycle. Thirdly, CO2 is a greenhouse gas which increases temperatures much like water vapour and does affect the climate. You wonder just what is taught in some engineering courses.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         It is simply not true that heavy industry and manufacturing in Australia have been destroyed by concerns over climate change. The transfer of jobs from Australia to China is driven by the recognition that Chinese materials and labour are cheaper. It is curious that economic reality seems to escape the senator's attention.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The covid pandemic highlighted the faulty global economic model we have all been labouring under with too much reliance on unreliable global trading partners.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Let's hope it will not be business as usual.
