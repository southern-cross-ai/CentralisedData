        Madam Acting Deputy President, a point of order: I know it is always very difficult for a Green to say they got it wrong but the standing orders do require an unequivocal withdrawal and I seek such an unequivocal withdrawal.

         It is no surprise that the Senator has made this vaccuous comment to Senator Milne, this comment invariably implies that an air of untouchable superiority is ever blindly held by this Liberal Senator.
         <br/>
         For such as he to have participated in, or had full knowledge thereof, of the despicable action of consenting to allow the Exclusive Brethren to act for the Liberal Party, is as detailed below.
         <br/>
         To distribute such pamphlets that contained either false indecent and or even malicious intended derogatory material, on behalf of his Liberal Party government, against The Greens Party, during the most recent Federal elections, in the knowledge that it was but a slovenly cowardly act.
         <br/>
         There appears to be, as indicated earlier in this days Senate discussions, little to separate both the School of Scientology and the Exclusive Brethren from each of their questionable conducts and behaviors in their  both acting against our society generally.
         <br/>
         Such attitude as displayed by Senator Abetz, does not accord or seem to deliver the integrity and open-ness that we are led to expect from such as our Australian elected Senators.
