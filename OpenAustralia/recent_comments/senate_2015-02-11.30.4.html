        We have Inspector Clouseau, over here, coming to a conclusion that she has proof. Well, if she has the proof, let it come forward. But, as I understand it, there is no such proof. There is only supposition. But as I had opportunity yesterday to sadly reflect, the fact that the Australian Labor Party comes in here and starts question time with these issues indicates their lack of policy, indicates their lack of ideas and indicates their lack of direction for this nation.

         Why is it so that Senator Eric Abetz speaks in such a contemptible manner towards Senators that are not members of the Liberal National coalition?
         <br/>
         I have spent a number of years noting the bitterness in the voice of Senator Abetz when he is called upon to explain his negative opinions, yet he continues to rabbit on about how the Labor party in Australia are the cause of all the evils in government in this country.
         <br/>
         Perhaps he could explain his dastardly actions to make a representation to the grantees that issue such significant National Heritage rulings, yet this Senator was seeking to have a large area of Tasmania's Heritage Listed Forests opened up for the benefit of the unscrupulous and known corrupt owner of the Ta Ann wood veneer plants, so that they can further participate in the deforestation of Tasmania, then sit back and watch some 80% odd of this ancient flora go directly to the wood-chip mills in Tasmania.
         <br/>
         Following a response to that subject matter, (if this Senator is brave enough to admit his major involvement in this sorry matter) then he might explain his deep involvement in the MIS fiasco that has cost the State of Tasmania its many millions in losses to a large sector directly and indirectly to be inflicted upon the people of Tasmania?
         <br/>
         I am yet to read or hear of anything at all of beneficial substance that this Senator has provided to Tasmania or even something of benefit to the people of this State.
         <br/>
         It is quite clear that the role of Liberal party Senator Eric Abetz when he speaks in the Senate, is to play the part of an attack dog upon those who represent the opposition parties when there is no sane reason for this loud and demanding Senator to engage in such reprehensible low-belly hostile Senate warfare.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The fact that Tony Abbott allows this Senator to influence his day to day decisions and the drawing up of Liberal policies, clearly displays how anti-the-people-of-Australia has reared its ugly head up to influence today's Liberal party 'poorly thought out presented policies and decisions.'
         <br/>
         Jailing refugee children is just another example of today's Abetz influenced disgraceful government actions.
