        and whether you believe in using the opportunities that this parliament has given us to make a change for the future for this country—a change that will be better for prosperity, better for jobs, better for a clean energy future, better for climate change and will be a change that is delivered fairly—or whether you decide that your politics is about destruction and you want Australia to miss the change in the global economy to a clean energy future. No new jobs and staying stuck in the past—that is what the Leader of the Opposition is advocating.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to the Leader of the Opposition that now is the time for him to put aside the brutal politics he has played with climate change—his weathervane politics of believing climate change is real one moment and not real the next and believing carbon should be priced one moment and not priced the next. Now is the time for the Leader of the Opposition to actually try to do something right for this country. Now is the time for the Leader of the Opposition to put away his slogans, put away his spin and put away his propensity for political destruction and actually work with the rest of the parliament to do the right thing by this country. It is time he looked inside himself and tried to see whether there are any convictions in there about the nation’s future—because I cannot identify one from his behaviour.

        First PM Gillard, majority of the Australian Population does not believe in climate change and does not want a carbon tax forced upon them. Majority of Australian people are sick and tired of Politicians projecting what the Australian people want and need.  There is no need to for a Carbon Tax as there is no Climate Change.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        PM Gillard, as an Australian Citizen, I would like this to go to a referendum for the Australian population to decide.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I do recall PM Gillard you were against Mr Kevin Rudd for trying to bring in the ETS.  Carbon Tax...ETS?? whats the difference.......REFERENDUM

        Well, I suggest you go to the following website and see it for yourself.

        On the other hand, I don't believe carbon tax can really do anything. People who are rich are always willing to pay more money for the electricity and people who are poor are certainly doing everything they can to reduce power usage.

        Marlene, where is the data you have reviewed to reach your conclusion that '... there is no Climate Change ...'?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Should we believe you? Or, should we critically review  the overwhelming body of evidence based data provided by climate scientists and reputable scientific bodies worldwide which clearly points to man made climate change? Please direct me to where I can obtain the data upon which you have based your statement.
        <br/>
        Meantime, you might like to avail yourself of the huge body of material, in basic, intermediate and advanced detail, which deals with what the skeptics say, and the science community's evidence based responses to what the skeptics say at:

        Since you asked nicely, here are some datasets.
        <br/>
        "Climate scientists", politicians, and the "concerned public" make all sorts of scary stories up about the climate, knowing full well that most people buy this "appeal to authority" fallacy.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It might be worth looking at the DATA collected by said "Climate scientists".
        <br/>
        <br/>
        That would be the people at NESDIS/NOAA that collect ACTUAL data,
        <br/>
        not 'corrected' in various super-secret methods.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        And looked at by statisticians like myself.  Here we go.  Following the links may be interesting.

        What do you make of that trend-line?  Scary hey?
        <br/>
        Well worth wasting a trillion dollars over.

        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <a href="http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/temp-and-precip/time-series/index.php?parameter=tmp&amp;month=12&amp;year=2008&amp;filter=12&amp;state=110&amp;div=00">

        </a>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Interesting that the long term mean shows NO warming, but the
        <br/>
        'corrected' polynomal
        <br/>
        fit over the data DO show global warming.  Albeit a trivial amount
        <br/>
        (0.9F per century).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Here is another interesting plot of ACTUAL data (without scary red
        <br/>
        paint).
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "This page explains the origin of a graph comparing the number of
        <br/>
        weather stations around the world with the simple mean of the
        <br/>
        temperature data."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <a href="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/nvst.html" rel="nofollow">
         http://www.uoguelph.ca/~rmckitri/research/nvst.html
        </a>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "The temperature average in the above graph is unprocessed. Graphs of
        <br/>
        the 'Global Temperature' from places like GISS and CRU reflect
        <br/>
        attempts to correct for, among other things, the loss of stations
        <br/>
        within grid cells, so they don't show the same jump at 1990.
        <br/>
        The graph mainly serves to illustrate one of the challenges for people
        <br/>
        who are trying to use land-based station data to construct a
        <br/>
        continuous index of the global average temperature over the 1990
        <br/>
        boundary. Gridded data reflect processing to (hopefully) remove the
        <br/>
        influence of problems such as the loss of station counts within grids.
        <br/>
        The point of the graph above is that a change in the raw mean occurred
        <br/>
        coincidental with the big loss of stations in the early 1990s. This
        <br/>
        creates a problem of confounding. After the early 1990s the gridded
        <br/>
        series started behaving differently, i.e. going upwards so that the
        <br/>
        1990s becomes the warmest decade, etc. Maybe the anomaly series are
        <br/>
        fully corrected for the problem of station closure and the shift in
        <br/>
        the 1990s was climatic. Or maybe the anomaly series are not fully
        <br/>
        corrected for the problem of station closure, implying not all the
        <br/>
        shift in the 1990s data was climatic. To accept the claims that the
        <br/>
        post-1990 anomaly index is continuous with the pre-1990 data, and only
        <br/>
        reflects a climatic change, requires the assumption, as a maintained
        <br/>
        hypothesis, that any effects of the sudden sample change around 1990
        <br/>
        have been removed. It has puzzled me why this assumption is not more
        <br/>
        rigorously tested by people whose research depends on the optimistic
        <br/>
        interpretation of the gridded data.
        <br/>
        The loss in stations was not uniform around the world. Most stations
        <br/>
        were lost in the former Soviet Union, China, Africa and South America.
        <br/>
        To see this visually, go to the University of Delaware global
        <br/>
        temperature archive. Click Available Climate Data; log in; under
        <br/>
        Global Climate Data select Time Series 1950 to 1999; then select
        <br/>

        Astute readers will notice that the Brisbane Central Roof has a slight

        increase since 1883

        Not much to worry about given the population of Brisbane was nearly a

        Now we pop over to our good friends at CSIRO and
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Fact Sheet
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Climate change is the greatest ecological, economic and social
        <br/>
        challenge of our time.Our climate is changing
        <br/>
        In the past century, the global average surface temperature has risen
        <br/>
        by 0.74 ºC. The observed increase in average temperatures is
        <br/>
        widespread around the globe, with rising trends recorded on all
        <br/>
        continents and in the oceans."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Contrary to observed data.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "The Earth is warming
        <br/>
        Globally, observed CO2 emissions, temperature and sea levels are
        <br/>
        rising faster than expected.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The warming has been fastest over land, and greatest in the higher
        <br/>
        latitudes of the northern hemisphere.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Global ocean temperature rose by 0.10 ºC between 1961 and 2003, to a
        <br/>
        depth of 700 metres.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In Australia, there has been a 0.9 ºC warming since 1950.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        We have already observed changes to our climate that are more rapid
        <br/>
        than anything the earth has experienced for at least 1800 years."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        A bit of SCARY political crapology using made-up figure.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I see this next bit sorta 'slipped in'  ex post facto as it were:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Heavy rainfall events have increased in frequency over most areas."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        But then:
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "Since 1950, eastern and south-western Australia have become
        <br/>
        significantly drier."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Of course.  Makes perfect sense.  Sorta.

        Thanks Mr Addinall, that was the first cogent argument against climate change that I have heard, and it has given me much to consider.  Also, I would like to take time to thank you to Prime Minister for your service.  For me there is though  one obvious point that no-one seems to be really asking.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Why IS there a debate on this issue.  Period.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Mean temperatures, CO2 levels, and other climate associated data sets are not debatable.  There is no debate.  And yet seemingly there is.  The source of this debate must not have it's origin in those data sets (as far as I am aware, weather balloons, and thermometers, are fairly bi-partisan, and, rather reliable in their findings), scientists, analysts, statisticians, data collectors, and their staff, do their utmost to fulfil those same ideals(and in the vast majority of cases achieve them), so the origin of this debate must be of another nature.  I ask again, Why is there a debate?
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There is no grey in this.  There are no climate change scientists that I am aware of that say: "The data is inconclusive."
        <br/>
        <br/>
        This is not a murky issue, this is black and white.
        <br/>
        Establishing trends in terms of the mathematics, and, using those trends to ascertain the reality of climate change is something that I am capable of(should I have access to the raw data), and I'm a high school leaver.  There should be no debate.
        <br/>
        This all, to my mind, points at something that can only be seen as manipulation, and on a vast scale.  This corruption of facts, leading to a debate of this size and scale, is, almost overwhelming to consider.  More disturbing still is the amount of effort required to undertake such a thing.  Mr Addinall quotes trillions of dollars; however regardless of the amount, regardless of the truth of climate change, the nature, and requirements, of an undertaking to convince me, "sell me", the reverse, bespeak of secret budgets, plans and motives.  Far, far more concerning.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Either there is climate change, and all is being done to convince the public that it does not in fact exist for "it's own safety", or...
        <br/>
        Most disturbing about the climate change issue are those three dots, and all the places they could lead.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So Prime Minister, my question, should I be given the chance to ask one is very simple:
        <br/>
        Why is there a debate about the climate change issue?

        I would also add here, that, after researching these points, Mr Addinal, and further, researching several other sources of information... I would have to agree that the carbon tax is going to make no real impact on climate change.  I have discovered that in fact the carbon tax is a little like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire.... whilst a tanker is on the other side on the house pumping gallons of petrol at it.

        <br/>
        That is probably the best reference I found, however, the varying data sets available on this issue are myriad, and with only a little time with a search engine, the reality of climate change may seem very different for you.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The fact is... SOMEONE is screwing with the data... and not being very forthcoming about why.
