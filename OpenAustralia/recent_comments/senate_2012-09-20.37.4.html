        I thank the Senate. This motion must have been written with the word tartuffery in mind. It is hypocritical piety. You read:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)   condemns anyone who vilifies any cultural or religious group;
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us think about the Australian Greens behaviour. For example, on 3 April 2004, the Australian Greens leader called for a public register of all Exclusive Brethren workplaces. What is that, if that is not vilification of a particular religious group—which, chances are, none of us in this place would actually agree with? Or what about the vicious BDS campaign that the Greens have supported over the years?

         I would like to state that Senator Abetz is well known for his support toward radical minority quasi-religious groups such as the Exclusive Brethren, then that of Scientology, and with this sort of mind-set could well be a supporter of the current anti-christian movement of Muslims that are agitating against the Australian people, (in this country in which they seek to dwell,) in the Capital Cities across this Country that has generously granted these agitators asylum from their former oppressive homelands.
         <br/>
         Unfortunately some religious groups have developed a horrifying fanatacal element within their preachings, I refer here to the Muslim suicidal bombers in both Iraq and Afghanistan, they being of the very same religious group currently demanding to introduce their own Sharia laws into Australia.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I would hope that Senator Abetz would refrain from supporting the future attempts by the Muslim hierarchy here in Australia to seek the introduction of Sharia Law, solely for the purposes of the Muslim religious groups, in the same manner he avidly supported both of the above-mentioned suspiciously regarded religious money-raking groups?
