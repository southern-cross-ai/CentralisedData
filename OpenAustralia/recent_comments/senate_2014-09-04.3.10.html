        No. Just so there is no misapprehension in relation to this, as I understand it, the coalition has not seen all the documents as yet. Therefore, this is not a blanket denial; it is just subject to inspection of the documents, and then we will make our position known. I understand that I reflect the ALP's view on this. On behalf of all senators, I send our best wishes to Senator Madigan on the very difficult decision he has come to.

         Yesterday I was critical of Senator Abetz pathetic reply to a Green's political party Question. Today I congratulate him on his compassionate response. John Madigan has had a difficult decision to make and his willingness to put principle over party only shows why he was a member of DLP. Vince Gair may have let principle take second place to self interest in the final days of his political career but in the 15000 odd days principle took priority. In his maiden speech Senator Madigan stated that "Fifty-one members of parliament, including 14 ministers and a state Premier, stood fast for the Labor principles they swore to uphold" and gave up political power on principle. This now stands at 52 John Madigan can be added to the list.
         <br/>
         Good on you John.

         Why is it there are no regulators or authorities that can haul in the likes of Self elected champion of the Senate House platform the disagreeably smug Senator Eric Abetz?
         <br/>
         One only has to watch the events in the Senate for just a few minutes when all of a sudden this deprecating Senator rises to speak, it does not occur nearly enough that he speaks out in favour of the people, yet he lavishes his smarmy praises upon the present highly unpopular Tony Abbott and his Liberal party cohorts..
