        This evening I rise briefly to pay tribute to former frontbenchers in the Abbott government who have retired or are retiring. Obviously, we heard today valedictory speeches from the members for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Wide Bay
        </a>
        and Goldstein. As I have previously said a few words about them in this place, I hope they will forgive me if I focus on others. Starting with former Senator Michael Ronaldson. The Centenary of Anzac celebrations last year were a flawless tribute to the original Anzacs and also a great tribute to his skill as an administrator and as a minister. The Sir John Monash Centre at Villers-Bretonneux, which we expect to open on Anzac Day in 2018, will be an enduring legacy from his time as a minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member from Groom,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_McFarlane" rel="nofollow">
         Ian McFarlane
        </a>
        , was the resources minister who scrapped the mining tax. This was the job-destroying, investment-killing tax which did not raise any revenue. It was a magnificent achievement by the member for Groom in his time as minister reborn, as it were. I hope this sector will acknowledge and demonstrate their gratitude to him in his years of retirement from this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Dunkley, Mr Bruce Billson, was not just the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
         Small Business
        </a>
        ; he was the evangelist for small business. After last year's budget, I think he was the messiah for small business. He authored the small business tax cut and the small business $20,000 instant asset write-off which were at the heart of last year's budget, and, expanded, were at the heart of this year's budget too.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then, of course, there is the member for Paterson,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Baldwin" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Baldwin
        </a>
        . He was one of our parliament's greatest advocates for tourism, a fierce partisan for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Region" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Region
        </a>
        and, as parliamentary secretary, a deft judge of the right balance between our economy and our environment. I want to particularly thank him as the member for Warringah for his excellent work with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour_Federation_Trust" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Harbour Federation Trust
        </a>
        and for the deft way in which he handled a difficult decision about a nursing home on trust land. He dealt with that very well in his valedictory earlier today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot finish these remarks without honouring my friend Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Heffernan" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Heffernan
        </a>
        . Bill Heffernan has been almost unique in this parliament: someone who was never ambitious for himself. He is the only member of this parliament I have ever met who never sought promotion. That has made him, over a very long period of time, the one person you could always trust on everything. I recall quite some years ago, as a relatively new member of parliament, that a well-known millionaire invited me for a pre-Christmas drink. As I was leaving he gave me an envelope and said, 'That's your Christmas present.' When I opened it up it contained $5,000 in cash. I can tell you, the Abbott family in those days could have used that money, but it did not feel right. I rang Bill Heffernan for his advice and he said: 'Once bought, always bought. Give it back and say to that person, "Please write out a cheque for the campaign."'
       </p>
       <p>
        I have not always agreed with Bill Heffernan, but I have always admired him as the most honest and selfless member of parliament that I have ever met. He certainly deserves a long, happy and honoured retirement from this place, as indeed do all of the members who have served this parliament so well for so long and are now leaving us.
