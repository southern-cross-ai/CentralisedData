        I thank the member for Deakin for his question. He, like so many members on this side, is very pleased about the fact that our economy, as the Prime Minister was saying, is transitioning positively. This is a good thing. Yesterday's national accounts with real
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        growth through the year of three per cent is something we on this side of the House are very pleased to see and we are very pleased to see that continuing increased household consumer confidence. New dwelling investment, particularly in the apartment sector, which is often driven by investors, and services in agricultural exports is improving. But today we have further data which shows that the AiG Performance of Services Index recorded in February the strongest rise in 14 months. The VFACTS new vehicle sales data for February was up 14.3 per cent—6.7 per cent over the past year. Importantly, business buyers for vehicles were up 15.6 per cent over the year. Our economy is successfully transitioning and how we manage that transition is the key challenge facing the country going forward. That is an important responsibility for the government. It is one we continue to manage well.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there are threats to it. Those threats sit opposite in the proposals that are put forward. The negative gearing proposal that they have put forward, as I just referred to in a previous answer—there is independent modelling, which I should stress is by an organisation which was quoted by the member for Fraser when he wanted to talk about property prices in Canberra; it has been quoted by the former union of the Leader of the Opposition, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
         AWU
        </a>
        ; and it has been quoted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
         ACTU
        </a>
        as well. They have delivered a report which shows that rents will be up; GDP will be hit by $19 billion; there will be 175,000 fewer jobs; house prices will fall; 70,000 householders will be put into housing stress and that $1 billion a year in revenue will be lost to the states.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is bad if you own a home. It is bad if you want to invest in a home. It is bad if you rent a home. It is also bad if you want to build a home. And that is not the full story, as I said, because the increase of 50 per cent in capital gains tax is not included in those numbers. It shows that those opposite have rushed out there without doing their homework on an important area of economic policy. That is why they cannot be trusted to manage the successful transition that is occurring in this economy.

        The Minister says "The VFACTS new vehicle sales data for February was up 14.3 per cent - 6.7 per cent over the past year. Importantly, business buyers for vehicles were up 15.6 per cent over the year. Our economy is successfully transitioning and how we manage that transition is the key challenge facing the country going forward. That is an important responsibility for the government.

        It is difficult enough to check assertions at the best of times.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The ABS publication "9314.0 - Sales of New Motor Vehicles, Australia, January 2016" lists three possible figures for January, 2016 - trend estimate (97,973), seasonally adjusted (98,055) and original (84,373). February figures won't be released until 15 March 2016. The Minister couldn't wait for the official figures for February.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Instead he used the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries' report dated 3 March 2016 to use VFACTS figures, that "Australians bought 96,443 new passenger cars, SUVs and commercial vehicles in February 2016, just over 6,000 (or 6.7 per cent more) than in February 2015. The strong start to the year has seen new car sales increase 4.8 per cent year-to-date.  Remarkably quick off the mark.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        The report further states that "Business buyers continued to show confidence through February, with sales to business buyers up 15.6 per cent compared to February 2015." Hard to check.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Now, (96443-84373)/84373 does represent a 14.4% increase from January to February 2016. But does this mean that the economy is transition well and is it a true reflection of how well the Coalition is managing the economy? January was still coming out of the slowdown due to the holidays. Back in 2015 Jan/Feb we saw a 10.1% increase with a drop later in April. There appear to be other factors at play.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        So, the Minister is getting ahead of himself in his assertion without official figures.
