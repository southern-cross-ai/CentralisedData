        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         West Timor
        </a>
        , while another 400 Australian commandos from 2nd/2nd Independent Company occupied Dili in neutral Portugese controlled
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">

        to secure the allied flank against the likely Japanese advance through South-East Asia. However, the allied troops did not expect the massive Japanese onslaught that followed.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the night of 19 February 1942, the same day as the first Darwin bombing, the Japanese landed several thousand troops at both Kupang and Dili. On 23 February, under heavy attack, Sparrow Force personnel based in West Timor surrendered, while the commandos based in Dili and a number of troops from West Timor who had escaped capture retreated to the jungles of East Timor. It was there that a relative handful of Australian troops held the advancing Japanese forces at bay for almost a year. They waged a guerrilla campaign that tied up tens of thousands of Japanese troops that would otherwise have joined the

        front. While the commandos were well armed and well trained, they only had food rations to last for a few weeks and had no radio contact with Australia for more than three months. But in what was to be a selfless display of courage and sacrifice the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
         East Timorese
        </a>
        people came to the assistance of the Australian troops. The Creados, as they were known, supplied the Australians with food, carried their equipment and ammunition, provided shelter from Japanese forces and even took up arms in the many skirmishes that ensued over the 12 months of fighting.
       </p>
       <p>
        By coming to the aid of the Australian troops, the East Timorese Creados exposed themselves and their villages to the daily risk of retaliation from the Japanese. In the face of torture, death and the destruction of their way of life, you could have forgiven the East Timorese for choosing to stand by and leave the Australians to look after themselves, but thankfully they did not. Paddy Keneally of the 2nd/2nd Independent Company, who passed away in March this year, summed up the enormous debt of gratitude owed to the East Timorese by the Australian troops. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We went to Timor and brought nothing but misery on those poor people. That is all they ever got out of helping us—misery. And there I was, alive because of them! In 1942 we were just a handful of men, short of everything and fighting an all-conquering enemy. We were the only unit from the Philippines, Malaya and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands_East_Indies" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        which didn’t surrender and survived, and only because of their help.
       </p>
       <p>
        After re-establishing radio contact and being reinforced by the 2nd/4th Independent Company, the Australian troops were eventually evacuated in February 1943, sadly leaving their Creado mates behind knowing the dismal fate they faced. The Japanese continued to occupy East Timor until the surrender in August 1945, and it is estimated that between 40,000 and 70,000 East Timorese died during this time.

        </a>
        to the East Timorese people for giving their lives in helping the Australian troops in 1942. This is a herculean effort, and I would like to acknowledge the members of the Mary MacKillop East Timor Mission committee, who are present in the gallery tonight—Sister Susan Connelly, Janet Borg, Annabelle Rego and Christine Tapsell-Timbs—for having spent the last six months compiling these signatures. It is a testament to your commitment to fighting for due recognition for the people of East Timor, and I congratulate you.

       <p>
        It is not without precedent for one country to show its gratitude to the citizens of another for their assistance in times of war. As a child I vividly recall my Maltese born grandfather proudly reflecting upon the fact that Malta had been awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         George Cross

         Second World War
        </a>
        . I believe Australia should recognise and acknowledge the courage and sacrifice of the East Timorese people for the assistance and protection given to our troops during the Second World War. Without their efforts, many more Australians would have died, and for that Australia owes them a great debt of gratitude. To all those courageous Creados who put their lives on the line for our troops, I thank you, as I believe all Australians would, and I honour your memory tonight.

       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as follows—

        Hi All,
        <br/>
        The petition seeking an AO for Timor-Leste is an important and well-deserved initiative - and Sister Connolly and her helpers are to be congratulated. However, the petition itself is quite brief (understandably), and the preceding speech in the House incorrectly implies that all the Timorese who assisted the Australian forces were known as "creados". Of course, Timorese - and Portuguese, assistance was far broader and more substantive. Tribal groups and clans were trained and armed by both the Independent Companies and SRD/Z Special Force - sometimes in groups of over 300, and an estimated 750 rifles were distributed. Further, SRD recruited Timorese, trained them in Australia (including parachute training) and - dressed in Australian uniforms, carrying Australian weapons, and under Australian command, many returned to Timor to fight the Japanese. Few survived. We should also remember the Portuguese - mainly "deportados" who fought beside the Australian troops (some later receiving Australian Army pay) who, on evacuation to Australia, were unjustly interned. These included Sr. Francisco Horta - the father of the present-day President of Timor-Leste, Jose Ramos-Horta.
