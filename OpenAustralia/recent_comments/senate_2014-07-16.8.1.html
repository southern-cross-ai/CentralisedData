        It is a bit like groundhog day, because I feel like I have answered all of these questions before. Whatever cuddly name the Labor Party or the Greens want to give to a tax, whether it is a fixed price or a flexible price, a tax is a tax is a tax. The coalition went to the last election promising that we would scrap the carbon tax. We are determined to deliver on that commitment, because that is the right thing to do by families, pensioners and the economy as a whole.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to the net cost to the budget of ending the carbon tax with effect from 1 July 2014, it is $7.6 billion over the forward estimates period on an underlying cash balance. That is a benefit that flows straight to families, pensioners and businesses. It will help grow a more prosperous economy moving forward, it will help attract investment and it will help create jobs, because it will help make Australian businesses more competitive internationally.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to all of the other questions, we traversed them in some detail last week and I will refer Senators Singh and Milne to the
        <i>

        record of the debate last week.

         Abolishing the carbon tax returns the money to fossil fuel burning businesses, particularly coal and gas electricity generators. Instead the government wants to get more money from the health tax, reductions to social welfare, and the tertiary education tax. By definition, a budget 'emergency, true or not, must take in more money, and pay out less. If the government doesn't take it from mining and carbon emissions, it has to come from elsewhere. Net benefit to Australian families and small business is unlikely. Electricity price consists mostly of corporate rent seeking over investment in grid transmission.
