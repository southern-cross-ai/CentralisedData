         Day by day, week by week on and on it goes, Senator Eric Abetz uses his assumed position of someone who knows what is in the best interests of Australia.
         <br/>
         (Notwithstanding his callous indifference to the State of Tasmania and its people with hard times knocking on their door.)
         <br/>
         I have for many a number of years kept a watchful eye on this constantly erring Senator, erring in that he speaks of Australia as though he has sincere concern for Australia's people and Australia's status and position in this challenging World of ours.
         <br/>
         However, let me say that in all the time I have observed this deceit motivated person, yes that's correct Senator Eric Abetz, has not given nor created (in my knowledge) any specific beneficial policy or ever sought to engage in a policy that would see him honouring his role as a Senator serving the Australian people.
         <br/>
         Instead he rises in the Senate, looks over his show-time spectacles as the Headmaster does when castigating an errant student, then begins to deliver huge volumes of oratory that contains nil of any benefit or consideration for the working people of Australia.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         One could surmise this Senator is from another country, maybe that of corporatized America, for he shows no interest nor concern to how the people of Australia are bearing under the lopsided austerity measures introduced by his Liberal Party huckstering colleagues, nor does he give a hoot to the extremes of added hardships, (and his decidedly non-liberal action as is the meaning of this word) the he and his sniggering Liberal colleagues dump upon the working persons of Australia.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         How can it be that this nation of Australia supports such an anti-Australian attitude as held by this arrogant Senator, and sees fit to retain his place in a government of Australia in which he does no service worth a dicky bird that might help and support the greater population of this once far more wonderful country.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Australia so immediately diminishes in its standing when the Liberal government somehow, bluster and lie to the people to finally accomplish a scam-like majority vote that allows them to slither into the driver's chair as this nation's leadership government.
         <br/>
         The Liberal party with is host of summoned ICAC attendee's that were fingered by the ICAC as guilty of greed-man-ship and fattening ones own pocket, now stand and look down upon the honest lot of opposing ministers that have kept Australia going and respected as a genuine country in where to engage in honest business rather than conspired colluding and baksheesh snarking's as are the typical tools of business when the Liberals are in town.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I writhe in disgust when this anti-Australian Senator rises to deliver further of his unctuous pompous drivels upon the respectable accomplishing opposition ministers seated opposite but wary waiting, for a further barrage of anti-the-Australian-people bombast and gloated mumblings that will not help a soul.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Why is their no ruling when anti-Australian words are allowed to slither from the forked tongue of this disingenuous former opportunistic Asylum-Seeker migrant whom desperately departed from his war torn land that was bombed to bits for its anti-human dogma's and arrogant invasive actions to steal anothers lands.
         <br/>
         Australian politics is a cowering under the evils cast over all and every vision of our proud Australian Country 'by such a dreadful abacus-bead manipulator of party numbers that is wholly in contempt to popularity but continue to allow him to scowl and snatch his daily bread.
