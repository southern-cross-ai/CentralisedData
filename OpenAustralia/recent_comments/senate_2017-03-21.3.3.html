        This Part sets out a number of restrictions on the conduct of restricted wagering services in relation to sports betting.

        These restrictions include bans on offering micro-betting, credit or inducements, as well as requirements for the restricted wagering service to check that individuals are not included on the National Self-exclusion Register before creating new accounts.

         <p class="comment">
          To the honorable committee members I express my concerns over the IGA act and its flawed prohibition governance.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          I suffer from ADHD, BP1 and mental comorbidity and suffered considerable financial losses. Despite these losses and my personal perseverance, the word "gambling" per se, I believe that the consensus is derived from all forms of gambling as such and "penalties" for access to these foreign websites to gamble are illicit.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Detrimentally so the occurrence is the discriminatory judgement of mental disposition or illness associated with "gambling" in general context where it has been condemned to make false judgement or accusation based on "actual losses" that are legally gambled and governed. Which draws me to the following concerns, how can a unregulated illegal gambling website be available period to Australian people not to mention the mentally dis-positioned or induced/depressed or vulnerable. The burdensome is humongous not to mention life threatening.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Factual evidence based conclusions and the reality is that more than 2,200 offshore illegal gambling websites that traffic the ISP's online with ease targeting Australians and posing as authenticated Australian websites is still concurrent and ACMA is not using its powers to investigate or navigate and ban accordingly. As I mentioned above, there are factors that the committee must view as a matter of importance;
          <br/>
          <br/>
          FACT: There are approx 18 licenses in Australia that currently offer casino land or online base gaming. Example. Sports Bet, Star City Casino. "Hence Regulated" Therefore having been self taught within the field of computers I know that a system software prototype for something on this scale would probably cost no more than $50,000.00 to develop and implement, whereby all banks and credit card providers including governing commonwealth authorities could easily track and maintain continuity, safe, gambling online for all Australians, and who knows they may like it that much so, that pokie machines could use the same template software to enforce patron card limits.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          ISSUE: The issue is that apart from being unregulated, these ponzi casino websites promoting themselves as legitimate Australian certified casinos are gaining access fraudulently to gamblers computer desktops, accessing HD Camera software fraudulently where it can pry on the gamblers privacy. Disarm configuration internally on your computer and leave a little lovely bug in there so when you log off it is able to start phishing your entire home computer without your knowledge. Further to this major problem is the processing of payments and how they can duplicate them without you even knowing unless you really check your statements properly. I was targeted $350,000.00 of duplicated payments by VISA and MASTERCARD with two prominent banks. They since rejected my claim because whilst I was in recovery and rehabilitation looking after my health I should have raised these earlier. And there poorly new structured advocacy departments did not conduct the epayment's code compliance investigation and pending AUSTRAC reports will conclude my assumption on failure of advising AUSTRAC with CTR reports for payments in contravention of the AML act being in excess of $10,000.00 per day. Non taxed.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          How can a major bank approve a raised concern in August 2015 for duplicated payments then disapprove duplicated payments this year without conducing a review into there fraud department that I know full well have something to do with keeping this a secret or under sighted to avoid exposure because it is so complicated that it would send someone crazy before they decide to investigate. Does the committee want validation? Sure, happy to show the committee anytime..
          <br/>
          <br/>
          BANKS: I am aware of the banking privacy act and I note my contentions here are not to insult or point blame any institutional company. This is not my reasoning, however I know full well it is due to a small group that maybe taking advantage of the fact that $11.7 Billion industry is potentially profitable when you consider one month I was charged $6,760 in banking fees. I kind of wonder is this a banking secret? to the detriment of the Australian people? or is it aligned with a small group within every bank and thus the banks don't mind because its $$$.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          QUESTION: How can banks be scene to be aiding and abetting in a criminal transaction? It holds merchant contracts with these companies and is fully aware of the law. Explanation please? Because I answered my fixation on the issue of licensing and governance online. It is so easy to treat I would be inclined myself to run and develop the system if the government agreed in hiring me.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          QUESTION: How can the amendment by the ABA consider an increase in jail term for people gambling in illegal casinos and to withdraw any contraventions on the banking institutions? (Sorry I have to revert to making this sound simple for readers. Todd goes along with William on a hunting trip, however decides not to hunt but assist as he believes he may have a trigger happy sensation at shooting the rifle and cause all sorts of issues out in the field. Todd is aware of this and hands him the gun anyway despite Williams issue, ignorant and uncountable possibly due to a medication or mental disposition, William shoots another person in the leg accidentally) I hope that was a reasonable short story for readers to digest what I just said. Basically the BANK is Todd in this case. Its simple and obvious.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          My time spent in rehabilitation in LA, the state of California has similar restraints. However the banks have conformed to the prohibition because of court raised hearings and successful applicants such as Providian National Bank V. Haines. In 1998, Supreme Court of California, Providian Bank sued Cynthia Haines, who had lost more than $70,000.00 gambling online with her credit cards. Haines responded to the lawsuit by countersuing the bank. She argued that the bank had engaged in unfair business practise practises and, in addition, had aided and abetted a crime gambling online was and is illegal in Haines home state of California 1998.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Lastly, I believe there needs to be a banking model if they are going to make substantial amounts of money of the back of innocent Australians that may have been titled a "gambler" but was essentially not, it is imperative that something is done. Innocent Australian lives are being taken away by suicide and its hitting figures that surpass that of the death toll in Australia on our national roads. Who is to say that the families of the victims who committed the suicide act did it because of gambling based issues? Of course  they are not going to say such a thing. So therefore, the figures here could be alarming both for our country and both for the amount of money leaving the Australian shores that is un-taxed and could go to people that need it the most. like our Mental health sector and the lack of legal aid or assistance. I hope my discussion above on the IGA and issues have shed some light!
