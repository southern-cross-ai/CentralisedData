        The Australian people rightly expect the Senate to deal with the urgent legislation before us. The ALP-Greens tactic of stalling, spoiling and outright sabotaging the government's legislative agenda is an abuse, the likes of which this chamber has not previously witnessed. The legislation the government seeks to have passed on behalf of the Australian people is legislation for which the Australian people voted: repeal of the job-destroying and household-budget-blowing carbon tax, a carbon tax that is killing the manufacturing sector of this country and blowing a $550 hole in household budgets. We also seek the repeal of the mining tax, which is stifling investment and jobs growth. With today's announcement that unemployment is at 5.8 per cent, the need to implement the coalition plan to reboot the economy and clean up Labor's mess is more urgent than ever. Vital legislation for which we have a mandate, like for the ABCC and the Registered Organisations Commission, is being deferred to committees that do not even deal with legislation by the ALP-Greens alliance, to dates well into next year, such is their sabotage.

         It has become most unfortunate for all Australia that the Tasmanian residing Liberal Senator Eric Abetz has been set loose to again engage in his demonizing of the Federal Labor government ministers and the many sensible policies and legislation as were set into place during the time of Labor as our reigning Federal government.
         <br/>
         Having listened to this 'corporates before the people' Senator, it has become sinisterly obvious that he is the major force in seeking to delist Tasmania's iconic World Heritage Forests.
         <br/>
         I also wish to heighten the fact that most all of this Senator Eric Abetz over-zealous rhetoric to open up these World renowned Forests to wood-chipping and the like, is yet another example of this Senator's own inspired attack upon Tasmania even though it be his favoured State in which he has chosen for he and his family therein to dwell.
         <br/>
         There is an enormously worrying concern in the fact that this dogmatic shameless Senator Eric Abetz cares not for the natural wonders and beauties that have created a thriving tourism industry which along the way has become vital to Tasmania's economy.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Given that this Senator is possessed with his ability to enthral and mesmerise audiences in a determined thunder-clapping priest like manner, it is utterly disappointing for all in Tasmania that he champions the destruction of that which has created the enormous tourism industry, irrespective to its resultant economically beneficent contributions to the necessary government revenues that go on to support he and his family in his chosen State of Tasmania.
         <br/>
         All Australia must be hoping for the day when this anti-the-people Senator is removed from his unwarranted attacking rank as a Tasmanian Senator, in that he has created so much negatively inordinate confusion and duress among and upon each of his far  more sensible and respected colleagues in Australia's Senate.
         <br/>
         So by way of my presented views in this comment toward the ways and means of this podium-pounding sinister Senator Eric Abetz, the people of Tasmania, (if not the whole of Australia) may seek to hasten the departure of this mesmerising despotic individual who continues his covert masquerading mischiefs as a presumed responsible representative of the Tasmanian people.
