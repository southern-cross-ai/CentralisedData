        In relation to honouring election promises, I feel in very great company with the Hon. Will Hodgman, who is in the gallery. He is also from Tasmania and he stood by his election promise of not doing any deal with the Greens, unlike those opposite. So I am delighted to take the supplementary question from the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate—

         It was only to be a matter of time before this Senator emerged back into sunlight, whereby prior to the recent change of government via the last Federal election Senator Abetz had been in hiding from the Australia people due to his full on involvement in the failed Australian but particularly that of the Tasmania, State economy-shattering MIS forest plantation fiasco.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         One would have thought this Senator would have chosen to represent the people of Tasmania if not all of Australia, but no, Senator Eric Abetz preferred to champion all those shysters that were to engage in this Billion dollar 'bankrupting free-for-all' instead of giving any beneficial consideration to the people that had the misfortune to be on the losing end of this roguish cut-throat scheme of seriously degrading the State of Tasmania's economy.
         <br/>
         I find that Senator Abetz has now beguiled his way back to a status of influence among those promise- exploding colleagues of Tony Abbott's Federal Liberal  government.
         <br/>
         It is quite obvious to all that he has chosen to repeat his Howard-era infamies by supporting the abandonment of most all of the electioneering promises given by Abbott and his ménage of light-minded gad about ministers.
         <br/>
         Yet this Senator has still not learned the error of his ways, instead he is showing how he has remained faithful to the failed policies of the former 'booted out of office' John Winston Howard government by engaging in the ongoing references that do little more than masquerade as open abuse delivered upon the Greens Party ministers.
         <br/>
         When in fact the Greens would like to see all Australians able to dwell in a more honest and safer environment where truth and trust remain paramount.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I find that the volumes of dishonesty engaged in by  Abetz, (along with that same of his fellow ministers in the Liberal Party) have dismissed all that is considered best for Australia's people by returning to the role of champions toward all the Monopolies, Duopolies, and big business corporate predators with an eye on seeing them continue to export Australian jobs into those Asiatic work-house as a means of ramping up their greed intensities, to seek even more of their increasingly unwarranted undeserved higher levels of profit.
