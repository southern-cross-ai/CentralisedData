        I move opposition amendment (1) circulated in the name of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, on sheet 7713:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Schedule 2, item 11, page 29 (after line 30), after subitem (3), insert:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3A) Sections 26 and 27 of the
        <i>
         Public Service Act 1999
        </i>
        apply in relation to the person as if:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the person were an APS employee in an Agency (within the meanings of that Act); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) CSC were the Agency referred to in paragraph (a); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the chief executive officer (however described) of CSC were the Agency Head of the Agency referred to in paragraph (a).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3B) For the purpose of filling a vacancy that exists in an Agency (within the meaning of the

        ):

        (b) CSC is taken to be the Agency referred to in paragraph (a).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3C) Subitems (3A) and (3B) have effect in relation to the person:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) for the relevant period; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) while the person remains employed by CSC (whether or not the person has been identified by CSC as excess or potentially excess); and
       </p>

        (c) as if the person continued to have the classification and category of APS employment that the person had immediately before commencement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3D) If a person moves to an Agency under section 26 or 27 of the
        <i>
         Public Service Act 1999
        </i>
        (as those sections apply under subitem (3A)), the person is taken to be engaged under section 22 of that Act by the Agency Head of that Agency, on behalf of the Commonwealth, as an APS employee in that Agency (within the meanings of the
        <i>
         Public Service Act 1999
        </i>
        ).

        (as in force at commencement) is modified or revoked so as to remove the restriction on notification of vacancies as being open only to persons who are APS employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I mentioned in my speech on the second reading of this bill, concerns have been raised that, because the merger means that ComSuper will cease to exist and its staff will be compulsorily transferred out of the Australian Public Service, APS, to the CSC, this forced change could affect their careers and make it more difficult to move to an APS agency. In the event that the new CSC downsizes, staff are also concerned about losing their redundancy rights that would allow them to be redeployed in the APS if their positions are cut. Labor's amendment will address these concerns by providing transferred ComSuper employees with broadly equivalent mobility rights to those they would have had if they had remained employed in the APS. Labor's amendment enables transferred ComSuper employees to move from the CSC to APS agencies as if they were still an APS employee. These measures in Labor's amendment will ensure that ComSuper employees who transfer to CSC will be able to transfer at any level or win promotion to APS roles at other agencies. Labor's amendment ensures ComSuper employees who transfer to CSC are not disadvantaged in terms of seeking and applying for a future role within the APS. Labor's amendment will apply for a period of three years. Our amendment is a simple and sensible change that addresses the concerns of ComSuper staff. I would like to thank the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann, for working constructively with the opposition on addressing our concerns.

         This was a very sudden change and was not alerted to CSS members until I read it in the Brisbane Times today. CSC will be running CSS not Comsuper. There was very poor communication re this change between members and CSS.
