        The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) The Australian Rescue Vehicle REMORA is currently in storage in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Under a contract with James Fisher Defence, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR" rel="nofollow">
         LR
        </a>
        5 rescue vehicle remains available in place of REMORA, which was formerly operated under a separate contract.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) REMORA was fully operational up until December 2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) REMORA remains in a refurbished state; however, would need to be recertified to recommence operations. Additionally, the Launch and Recovery System used to deploy and retrieve REMORA from the deck of a mother ship needs significant modification to meet contemporary certification standards, which are different from those that applied when the system was originally built. The time required and cost of reconstituting REMORA and its Launch and Recovery System, as well as developing the associated operating and maintenance capability, are being assessed as part of a cost-benefit analysis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) When last operational, REMORA was maintained at 12 hours notice to mobilise. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR5" rel="nofollow">
         LR5
        </a>
        submarine rescue suite is kept at the same notice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) REMORA was designed and originally certified to operate to a maximum depth of 525 metres. Following refurbishment and an extended period in storage, certification has lapsed and REMORA will need to be recertified under a formal test and trials program to demonstrate this capability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) REMORA is designed to carry six rescued submariners. The LR5 can carry a maximum of fifteen.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) The Department of Defence owns the REMORA rescue vehicle and the associated Launch and Recovery System.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) The average yearly cost (based on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FY" rel="nofollow">
         FY
        </a>
        05/06 and FY06/07 figures) of maintaining and operating REMORA was $2.7 million (inclusive of maintenance, real estate, personnel and running).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) The current contract for the provision of submarine escape and rescue services with James Fisher Defence expires in May 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8) (a) There are no other companies in Australia with access to a rescue vehicle and associated equipment that can provide a similar service to that of James Fisher Defence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) While overseas companies might provide a similar service to that of James Fisher Defence, they are generally linked to the navies of countries in which they are based. Of note, James Fisher Defence operates the submarine rescue system of the

        Dear Steven, Minister for Defence
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I am surprised by your response to question 8 above.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        There are most certainly companies in Australia that can provide an equivalent and higher level of service, products and technical capability than your current supplier.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Inclusive of all storage, preventative maintenance, preservation and operational readiness.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        More importantly local companies that understand the remoteness of our region and the extreme challenges that come with that. These companies are also familiar with the Dept of Defence requirements due to previous experience in Submarines.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        I would invite you to visit us in Western Australia and we can provide further details on the above.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        It would be in the countries best interest to support an grow local capabilities and from a due diligence perspective to ensure that you are receiving the best technical and commercial solution.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Kind Regards,
        <br/>
        <br/>
        Brett Silich
        <br/>
        CEO.
