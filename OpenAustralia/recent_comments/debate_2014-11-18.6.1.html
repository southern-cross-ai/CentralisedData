       This morning, the Prime Minister and I honoured our soldiers who, 100 years ago, made the supreme sacrifice together in the battle of Gallipoli. The man who designed this beautiful capital of Canberra,

       came along! But, above all, we are united by the ideals of democracy.
      </p>
      <p>
       Today, as I stand in this temple of democracy, I consider nations such as ours to be blessed, because democracy offers the best opportunity for the human spirit to flourish, because we have the freedom to choose, the right to speak and the power to remove—and for us, in politics, no option but to leave with grace.
      </p>
      <p>
       Generations of people's representatives have made Australia one of the great nations of the world today. From the vast stretch of territory to the abundance of her resources, nature has been generous to you. But it is the people of Australia who have made Australia what it is today: a beacon of democracy and the rule of law; a nation that willingly leads the search for a lost aircraft; one of the most prosperous nations in the world, among the best on the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index" rel="nofollow">
        Human Development Index
       </a>
       ; a nation with some of the best cities in the world, some of the most productive farms and mines, some of its best universities and research centres, and an advanced technology base; and a nation with great sporting skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       Australia evokes images not just of immense beauty but also of a great quality of life. Today, its cities are alive with the richness of this world's diversity. And it is home to 450,000 Indians, who are as proud to be part of Australia as they are of their Indian heritage.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honourable members, there was a time when, for many of us, Australia was a distant land on the southern edge of the world. Today, the world sees Australia to be at the heart of the Asia-Pacific and Indian Ocean region. This dynamic region holds the key to this world's future, and Australia is at its crossroads. And, as Australia has become more engaged with this part of the world, we welcome its growing role in driving this region's prosperity and shaping its security, because we, in India, seek the same future for this world. We also see Australia as a vital partner in India's quest for progress and prosperity. There are few countries in this world where we see so much synergy as we do in Australia—India, a nation of more than a billion seeking development; Australia, a developed country of a few million people and vast resources.
      </p>
      <p>
       Since the turn of this century, India has been the second fastest growing economy in the world. Millions have lifted themselves out of poverty into a new life of possibilities. Today, we have a government with a clear majority after 30 years. From the remotest village to the biggest cities, there is a new high tide of hope in India; a new energy. It is the energy of our youth. The 800 million people below the age of 35 are eager for change and willing to work for it because they now believe it is possible, that they can make it happen. It is this force of transformation that we will unleash.
      </p>
      <p>
       In the six months that we have been in office we have moved forward—thinking with ambition and acting with speed, seeking growth not just for growth but to transform the quality of life of every Indian. I see Australia as a major partner in every area of our national priority—in providing skills and education to our youth; a roof over every head and electricity in every household; the most affordable health care for the most difficult diseases; the next generation of infrastructure that does not take a toll on our environment; energy that does not cause our glaciers to melt—clean coal and gas, renewable energy and fuel for nuclear power—cities that are smart, sustainable and liveable; villages that offer opportunities; agriculture that yields more and farms that are better connected to markets; and practices and technologies that save water.
      </p>
      <p>
       We have a new mission for turning 'Made in India' into a global name—just as 'Computer in India' is. But we want to find new pathways to prosperity, not simply travel down the roads of the previous century. Much of India's future cities and infrastructure is yet to be built and so we have a unique opportunity to make our choices now. And in every sector—agriculture, food processing, mining, infrastructure, finance, technology and energy—from providing funds and resources through to technology and expertise, working as partners and investors Australia has immense opportunities to participate in India's progress. In turn, India will be the answer to your search for new economic opportunities and your desire to diversify your global economic engagement, your source for world-class skills at home or for a manufacturing location abroad. India's development, demography and demand provide a unique long-term opportunity for Australia—and all within the familiar framework of democracy. There is no other example of this nature in the world. Indian investors too are coming here in growing numbers and commitments.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honourable members, this is an age that is rich in promise but also filled with challenges. We can only pursue our dreams if we have the confidence that our cities are safe, our nations are secure, our region is stable and our world is peaceful. This vast region has many unsettled questions and new challenges. Historical differences persist, despite growing interdependence. The oceans are our lifelines. But we worry about access and security in our part of the world more than ever before. Our region has seen huge progress on the foundation of peace and stability, but we cannot take this for granted. Preserving it will be the most important task in the region. India and Australia can play their part in it by expanding our security cooperation and deepening our international partnerships in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       But we do not have to rely on borrowed architecture of the past. Nor do we have the luxury to choose who we work with and who we do not, but what we do need is to work together and with others to create an environment and culture that promote the currency of coexistence and cooperation in which all nations, small and big, abide by international law and norms, even when they have bitter disputes. We should collaborate more on maintaining maritime security. We should work together on the seas and collaborate in international forums. We should work for a universal respect for international law and global norms.
      </p>
      <p>
       We must also support the process of economic integration across the region and an open global trading system that remains integrated. We must guard against regional trade initiatives becoming instruments of political competition. However, economic integration by itself will not be a strong basis for peace and stability without strong regional institutions. India and Australia are members of several institutions that are critical for the region and the world. We should connect more closely in the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_Summit" rel="nofollow">
        East Asia Summit

       , G20 and the
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean_Rim_Association" rel="nofollow">
        Indian Ocean Rim Association
       </a>
       .
      </p>
      <p>
       Honourable members, in our interconnected world, our shared challenges extend beyond our region. Terrorism has become a major threat for us all. In India we have seen its face closely for three decades and we see it with the clarity that comes with it. Terrorism is changing in character and expanding in its reach. The internet has made recruitment and the call to violence self-generated. It also feeds off money laundering, drug trafficking and arms smuggling. We have to deepen our bilateral security cooperation, but we need a comprehensive global strategy for a global problem. It will require closer security cooperation but, even more, a policy of no distinction between terrorist groups or discrimination between nations—a resolve to isolate those who harbour terrorists, willingness to empower states that will fight them, a social movement against extremism in countries where it is most prevalent, and every effort to delink religion and terrorism.
      </p>
      <p>
       As I look to the future, we will also need to ensure that outer space and cyberspace remain instruments of connectivity and prosperity, not new frontiers of conflict. Responding to the region's disasters, combating proliferation and acting against piracy, we will work together on a full range of security challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
       Honourable members, since my government entered office no region has seen more intense engagement on India's part than the Asia-Pacific region, because we understand how deeply our future is linked to this region. India and Australia can play cricket hard with each other—and I suspect we will next month!—but we see Australia as one of our foremost partners in the region.
      </p>
      <p>
       I was pleased to host Prime Minister Tony Abbott as my first state guest in September. It has taken a
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_India" rel="nofollow">
        Prime Minister of India

       28 years to come to Australia. It should never have been so, and this will change. Australia will not be at the periphery of our vision but at the centre of our thought.
      </p>
      <p>
       So we stand together at a moment of enormous opportunity and great responsibility. I see a great future of partnership between India and Australia and a shared commitment to realise it. Prime Minister Abbott started us on this new journey in September. I have come here to set our two countries more firmly on that course—with your help, and with the help of the great people of India and Australia. I wish you the best for hosting a great and successful
