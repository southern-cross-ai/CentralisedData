        I can inform Senator Back that the Green-Labor opposition are stopping investment and jobs in Western Australia by recklessly refusing to scrap Labor's anti-Western Australian taxes. Labor's lead Senate candidate, Joe Bullock, sought to deceive Western Australians by claiming that Labor are scrapping the carbon tax. If Labor are scrapping the carbon tax, why are they voting to stop its repeal in this place? What we have is Labor betraying the people of Western Australia when they introduced the carbon tax in the first place, then deceiving the people of Australia when they claimed that they had repealed it, and now Labor are adding insult to injury by refusing to pass the wishes of the people of Australia, and especially the people of Western Australia, who want these job-destroying taxes removed so that their economy can grow and so that those who are on the unemployment list can gain jobs.

         I am reminded each time that Senator Eric Abetz snatches at the opportunity to grandstand himself above all opposition Senators, I am also reminded that this same Senator believes that he is the only Senator in the house that with certainty he can predict our futures here in Australia.
         <br/>
         I am also reminded that Senator Eric Abetz attempts to dominate each item upon that day's agenda, furthermore that he spends an inordinate amount of time denigrating the opposition members, this pointless denigration which accounts for up to 50% of the available time to set for questions and discussion on Senate matters.
         <br/>
         The overlording manner of this Senator quite readily confirms that at least 50% of his rhetoric on any subject matter is subsequently destroying the time so allocated for the house of the Senate to deal with matters of higher importance.
         <br/>
         This same Senator has chosen to go against the view of the bulk of Australian people in his pursuing the de-listing of Tasmanian's iconic World Heritage listed forests.
         <br/>
         All being so this Senator has become little more than a time-wasting droning nuisance.
         <br/>
         An early retirement for Senator Eric Abetz is keenly sought for by all in the house of the Australian Senate.
