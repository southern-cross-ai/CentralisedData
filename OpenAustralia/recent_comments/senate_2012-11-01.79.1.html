        I was present at those estimates and I do not think the answer was quite as simple as has been put in that question. We made very clear that obviously in the context of the NDIS there were ongoing discussions underway currently with the states and that final decisions on funding, including the source of funding, was something that obviously needed to await the finalisation of those discussions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would make the point also that, if you want to make political mischief with this issue, I think that is disappointing. Mr Hockey is on the recordâ€”

         Fears of delays on disability insurance by: Imre Salusinszky
         <br/>
         <br/>
         A draft of the NDIS legislation has been released to the states ahead of talks today between Ms Macklin and her state and territory counterparts. It, too, has aroused anger in NSW, as it does not contain any details of funding.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         The states claim the Gillard government is backing away from the Productivity Commission's recommendation for the scheme, which is set to cost about $15 billion a year, to be fully funded by the commonwealth.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         So I ask, how can the government say they are in consultation with the states on funding the scheme when they won't even discuss it? Looks like further smoke and mirrors to me.
