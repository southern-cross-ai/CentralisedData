        I thank Senator Xenophon for his question and his continued interest in South Australia’s hospitals. Minister Roxon and this government understand the importance of local private hospitals to regional communities and the role they play in keeping sick and aged patients in their local areas. However, on behalf of the minister, the level of subsidy the South Australian government pays to community private hospitals such as the Keith and District Hospital is clearly a matter for the state government of South Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that the letter received by Mr DeBarro was from Ms Alison McCausland, business manager of the Acute Care Division of the Department of Health and Ageing, who was writing on the minister’s behalf. The departmental response and the section Senator Xenophon refers to explain the government’s National Health and Hospital Network reforms and how they will relate to funding for public hospitals. The Commonwealth continues to support private hospitals through its funding contribution of private health insurance, Medicare, PBS, DVA, aged care and some capital works projects. The Keith hospital received aged-care funding in 2009-10. The Keith hospital received over $770,000 in 2009. We also provided the Keith hospital with $500,000 to build the new Hill Wing. I understand that the South Australian government are conducting meetings with the Keith hospital to help them restructure and reprioritise their services. I would also encourage them to work with the department of health to maximise the existing Commonwealth funding streams. I understand Senator Xenophon has also met with Minister Butler and the office of Minister Roxon.

         The Member refers to the Keith and District Hospital as a private hospital - a description which is commonly taken to mean an organization which operates on a profit making basis.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         This is not the case with the Keith Hospital as it is a not-for-profit community hospital which was established by local contribution and effort many years ago.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I trust that in this instance the Member simply was being a little lax with his wording and that in future he will be precise and use the correct description.
