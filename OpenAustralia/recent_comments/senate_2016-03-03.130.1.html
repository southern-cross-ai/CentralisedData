        This is an issue that does arise from time to time with countries with which Australia has an extradition agreement but that also have a death penalty provision. It is a matter I have dealt with in relation to countries other than China. The answer to your question is that the Attorney-General acts on advice. That advice comes, in particular, not only from my department but also from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We apply the death penalty exclusion very, very scrupulously. If there is any risk at all, any possibility at all, that the observance of an extradition request could potentially result in the execution of the person, the subject of the request will be refused.

         Senator Brandi's seems to think it OK to extradite someone to  a totalitarian dictatorship as evil as Adolf Hitler's Germany was.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         NO one should be extradited to Red China. WE should pass special legislation to try accused criminals in Australia.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         A nation with a legal system as judicially corrupt as Red China's should be dealt with as if it were  any other Warlord or fascist dictatorship.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Unfortunately Liberals and many of independent crossbenchers have had their values white anted by income from Red China. Senator  Madigan is one of the few that have not fallen into this trap.

         Yes it is very sad that this government has failed to head the warnings of our forefathers.  Our largest Dairy and our most strategic Military Port now in the hands of the fascist/Communist regime.

         When will it stop. China has not participated in the liberals Neo-Liberalist belief in Globalism. They have not floated their dollar or sold their assets but will take advantage of the fools in the west that have.
