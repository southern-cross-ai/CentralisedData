        I think the answer to the sorts of questions posed by Senator Fielding is, effectively, no. It is the case that we have some vacancies, as I understand it, for permanent medical officers, but this has not limited support to current operations or our international commitments. As the senator would appreciate, the priority of the ADF would be—and it would have been a priority of the previous government also—to ensure that those persons are fully supported. I understand there are currently more than 4,000 healthcare providers in Defence. The advice from Defence is that those numbers are sufficient to support the various operations, contingencies and activities, and there are currently 150 new medical personnel under training supported by the ADF. Obviously, like any other employer, Defence has to compete for highly skilled people, and there are currently some vacancies for permanent medical officers.

         Defence's response is misleading and minimises the national security emergency it has created. I refer the reader to the ADF's recent pay claim, dated the 16 August 2010:
         <br/>
         "The ADF submitted that despite the introduction of the Medical Officers Specialist Career Structure (SOCS), the ADF Medical Officer workforce was experiencing acute shortfalls, with an associated negative impact on ADF capability. Significantly, remunerative bonus arrangements struck pursuant to s58B of the Defence Act have failed to substantially stabilise the workforce."
         <br/>
         This is because pay is only a small part of the issue, as I have been raising within the ADF for years.
         <br/>
         The report continues to diverge from the reassurances offered by Defence:
         <br/>
         "The ADF submitted that all three Services have reported shortages in the number of Medical Officers and difficulty in retention past Return of Service Obligation (ROSO). The consistent theme from all parties was that the three Services have significant shortages that create extreme difficulty in their ability to fill positions to meet operational commitments."
         <br/>
         and
         <br/>
         "Captain Elizabeth Rushbrook, RAN, the Director of Navy Health, gave evidence on the critical shortage of MO [Medical Officers] in all three Services which are having an adverse effect on operational capability."
         <br/>
         - DEFENCE FORCE REMUNERATION TRIBUNAL 16 August 2010
         <br/>
         I joined the army in 1980, and I know how bunkered and blinkered their mentality can be. But these problems should not be minimised or dismissed. The safety and medical care of Australian Defence Force personnel is not something to with which to play politics. Defence has an obligation to be more honest with the Australian Parliament and the Australian public.
         <br/>
         It is most unsettling to see the Government misled like this.
