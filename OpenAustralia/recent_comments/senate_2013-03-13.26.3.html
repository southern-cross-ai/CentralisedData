        My question is to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy, and I refer to his proposed draconian media laws outlined yesterday. Has it ever occurred to the minister that the bad media that his government sometimes receives may not be due to unfair media coverage but rather due to the fact that the government is neither competent nor trustworthy? Does the minister really believe that a government that says one thing before an election and does another thing afterwards, that increases the cost of living, that cannot control its spending, that racks up record debt, that wrecks border security and that every day reveals its festering internal hatreds and bitterness deserves to receive good press? Is this not just one last desperate throw of the dice by a government that knows its only hope of survival is to intimidate and stifle the media?

         I note that Senator Abetz and his Liberal Party colleagues currently make enormous use of the lax media controls as they stand at the present, to add to the distortive references contained in their media attacks against the Labor Party Prime Minister and her  Leadership ministers.
         <br/>
         Senator Abetz already has a disgraceful history of deceptive engagements such as the Godwin Grech affair, the undermining of the popular Liberal Party leader, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, which regrettably produced the false promise admitting Tony Abbott as the new Liberal Party Leader.
         <br/>
         Then there was the Abetz promoted MIS agricultural and forestry failures throughout Australia, clearly recalling that this involved investment losses amounting to Billions of dollars.
         <br/>
         I am yet to learn how much of the Australia people's superannuation funds were destroyed during the time of this abjectedly failed MIS disaster.
         <br/>
         I personally have not seen, heard, nor noticed any references or open retractions, nor acknowledgement's thereto by this Senator Abetz, to each of these reprehensible Abetz engagements that must rate as the most severe dis-services ever to be instigagated and thrust upon the people of Australia.
         <br/>
         I further raise the issue of this Senators personal Tasmania real-estate dealings in his recent past, in wondering if these financially beneficial personal pecuniary interests have finally been listed in the appropriate official register?
