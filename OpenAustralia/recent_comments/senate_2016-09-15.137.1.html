        As I said, on this side of the chamber we understand that you need to put in place the right policy framework so that the economy grows and business is able to prosper and create more jobs. It is fundamentally different to those opposite. All they have for the Australian people is a plan for higher debt—they openly admitted that prior to the election—higher taxes and more regulation. If you look at the period in which the current Leader of the Opposition was the workplace relations minister, the number of unemployed people increased by around 72,000. In trend terms, from November 2007 to the end of Labor's time in office 128,800 manufacturing jobs, around one in eight, disappeared completely. In terms of policies that stifled growth, there was the carbon tax; and what about the mining tax? On this side of the chamber we understand that you need the right policy framework.

         The mining tax didn't stifle growth as it collected little. Concerning the carbon tax, how did it stifle growth when it amounted to about 1/8 of the Coalition's GST take in a year?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         If the Coalition's GST, which is an 8 times bigger impost on the economy than the carbon tax, has had no effect then how was the carbon tax such a burden on growth?
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Wait I know, consumers/households pay the GST while business gets a tax concession for it. On the other hand everyone had to pay the carbon tax.
