        The 457 program, as Australians know, is vitally important to our economy. The ability to fill vital skilled positions often facilitates a business's existence or even its growth. A business that has to close because it cannot access the labour it needs employs no-one. That is bad news for the employer and it is bad news for the employees who no longer have a job. The independent review of the 457 program found no evidence of widespread fraud, as alleged by the former Labor government and, in particular, former minister for immigration, Mr Brendan O'Connor. In relation to the statistics, under Labor the figures grew from 68,400 primary visa holders in 2010 to approximately 110,280 in September 2013. And most of those holders were in positions that were not in short supply.

         Clearly Michaella Cash &amp;  whoever was on this reporting C'tee are NOT IN TOUCH with what I actually the  REALITIES of what is HAPPENING In the 457 Visa/Business World
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Simply ask Australians who are and who have been employed in the Computer World/  and the Indians particularly who are traised up by Australians as their standdards are not as high as Australlians employed in the Computer  world, and the Australian is then "retrenched"  and the Indians who are already on a much lower wage than the Australians are moved into those positons.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I AM NOT and NEVER have been employed in the Computer world but certainly know highly qualified people who are and have been in Australia.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         Just another example of how out of touch the mediocre Politicians that Australia has had for some years now, and who "toe the party line' with their comments.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         This Report sounds like Hockey's "Intergenerational Report"  - out of touch with realities.
