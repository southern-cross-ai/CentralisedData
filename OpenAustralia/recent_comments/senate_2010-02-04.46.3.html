         I like all Australians am concerned about the loss of tax payers dollars that the federal and state governments will be getting as the baby boomers retire. Also the loss of full time jobs going to part time.  Here are some suggestions that may help.  Inform all ex PM's and MP's that due to austerity measures all gold cards will be withdrawn and only their Superannuation will be paid from the tax payers purse.  To all current MP, travailing allowances will only be paid on travel from Canberra. Remember travail to and from your place of work is not claimable.  All Members travailing by air at tax payers expense will travail economy class except those from the front benches travailing overseas.  If any of the front bench needs to travail over seas they can travail first class however anyone who travels with them must pay their own way. This alone should save the government purse millions of dollars in any one year.  An inquiry should be set up to look into claims for living away from home.  Remember Home is defined by the public service act as the place where your next of kin lives permanently. Any current MP falsely claiming expenses to pay off his second home in Canberra ect.should not only be made to repay it but face charges for fraud.
