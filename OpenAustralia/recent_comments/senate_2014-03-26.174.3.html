        I seek leave to table an open letter from a constituent group in my home state of South Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table an open letter to the Australian government from constituents in my home state of South Australia from the Stop Income Management in Playford group. It is in relation to the compulsory income management trials that are being conducted across the country, one of which is happening in Playford in South Australia. Many people are concerned about the long-term effects of this policy, and in my home state of South Australia almost 50 different organisations have come together, calling for the end of this failed experiment. Compulsory income management is discriminatory. It is a humiliating scheme that has failed to improve the living conditions of those who are subjected to it. Many of the people involved in this organisation feel very strongly about this, but the fact that they have written an open letter to the government is something that I think should be considered by other South Australian senators in this place today. That is why I table it in the parliament. Thank you very much, Mr Acting Deputy President.

         As a Housing SA resident for nearly 10 years, I have had my rent automatically taken out of my CentreLink benefits. Having this done has not been a problem it has actually been a blessing relieving me of stress and worry. I will admit that I would not want to pay my Utility Bills using this method as both my Gas and Electricity bills have been wrong on occasions and I expect trying to recoup payments for over payment would be an exercise in futility causing me financial hardship. Also as a single resident in my household I have objections that CentreLink are garnishing my benefits to pay what SA Housing say is a fair amount for my SA Water bill. Housing SA inform me that my bill is equal to my neighbour's but they fail to consider that a Single person normally doesn't use the same amount of water as the families and couples around me. In effect I am subsidising my neighbours. A side note this is discriminatory (discrimination on the grounds of marital status or lack off) and HREOC should then over ride the State Equal Opportunities Commission who are in the state governments pocket condoning the governments actions.
