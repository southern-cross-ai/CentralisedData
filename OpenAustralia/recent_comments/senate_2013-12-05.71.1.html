        As the Leader of the Australian Greens would be very well aware, we announced our policy. Part of that policy was to seek to repudiate the World Heritage area. Let us be clear about this: the previous Labor-Greens government, in cahoots with the Labor-Greens government in Hobart, declared as World Heritage areas pine plantations, eucalypt plantations, forest areas that had been harvested three times. There was misinformation provided to the World Heritage Commission by a wilful Labor-Greens government in Canberra and a wilful Labor-Greens government in Hobart, misrepresenting the situation. We have a duty to represent the truth to the World Heritage Commission and we intend to do so.

         The honourable Senator Eric Abetz has provided a good deal of the Tasmanian Deputy Premier's history and character, though he has omitted the time that these 2 persons as mentioned. (both Bryan Green and Senator Eric Abetz) were feeding from the same trough of the MIS swill, 'that would ultimately tip itself into insolvency then to go on further beggar the Tasmanian economy.'
         <br/>
         <br/>
         As for those ministers and Senators that assume the personal held high moral ground, best it be that you do not question this wily Senator Abetz's former real-estate holdings and subsequent dealings in the Kingston suburb of outer Hobart.
         <br/>
         Nor is it wise to look into the stacked-deck system that has this Senator locked into his seat safe from any challengers or voting bloc.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         So for the record, let not the weekend worshipping warrior of religion and advocate for all multi doctrines of similar cloth, ever beguile you of his true character, which doth consist of this Senator's former Kingston real-estate dealings which have since been placed deep in some dank cavern of anonymity.
         <br/>
         <br/>
         I for one look to the history of those in government office and of their pecuniary interests that appear to have had some controversy associated with said personal external real-estate contretemps.
         <br/>
         Furthermore this is the very same Senator that was in full support to all of the international monetary evils hatched during the former John 'The Fibber' Howard administration in those years of Howard's reign as Australia's Prime Minister.
