        And there are some that have a view that matches my own. They know who they are. But that is a matter for the Labor Party. I noticed yesterday that the Northern Territory Labor Party indicated its support for gay marriage. There seems to be a fight for the very soul of the Labor Party, and that is happening as we speak. There have been some articles this week by Piers Ackerman and Christopher Pearson, who have highlighted in particular that the Greens tail seems to be wagging the Labor dog and the Greens hand is very firmly on the shoulder of the Labor government as we speak. I note that a Miranda Devine article this week was absolutely spot on in my view. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of the consequences of remaking marriage to include gays is that it will be transformed from an institution centred on the well-being of children to one centred on the self-fulfilment of adults.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Marriage will become just another lifestyle choice, rather than a bedrock institution of our Judaeo-Christian society, providing the optimal chance for a child to thrive and grow up free of abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        But that belief, it seems, is not worthy of respect or protection. It deserves respect and protection and I call on the public to express their views accordingly.

         Lesbian and gay liberationists are thus as much in conflict with the tyrannical views of dominant heterosexual society today as they were in the early 1970s. This is because the regimented social order resulting inevitably from heterosexual is maintained by, and benefits, a consortium of powerful interest with vast resources. Belonging to this consortium are the churches, state institutions, conservative organizations and movements, the medical establishment (including psychiatry), the social sciences, the media, the entertainment industries, the educational system, and corporate elites.

         Heterosexism  The social Supremacy of compulsory heterosexuality acceptably manifested in only certain prescribed ways  is thus systematic. Its supremacy is predicted on rigid gender roles, the division of labour based on gender, the opportunity of social and economic benefits according to sex and marital status, and the exclusivity of privatized, monogamous, heterosexual sexuality. All people are indoctrinated with heterosexism from birth, which fosters, socially, a formidable totalitarianism. Little room exists for freedom of choice or alternate forms of relationships, or for opting out.
