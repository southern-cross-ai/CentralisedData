        and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006; and the AusCheck Act 2007.
       </p>
       <p>
        It contains five schedules which comprise a range of measures to improve and clarify Commonwealth criminal justice arrangements, including amending the POC Act to clarify the operation of the non-conviction based proceeds of crime regime following recent court decisions; amending the Criminal Code to insert two new offences of false dealing with accounting documents; amending the serious drug offences in part 9 of the Criminal Code to clarify the definitions of the terms ‘drug analogue’ and ‘manufacture’ and ensure that they capture all relevant substances and processes; clarifying and addressing operational constraints raised by law enforcement agencies with the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act, and expanding the list of designated agencies authorised to access

        ; and clarifying and extending the circumstances under which AusCheck can disclose AusCheck background-check information to the Commonwealth and to state and territory government agencies carrying out law enforcement and national security functions.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to state that Labor will—as we have in government and in opposition—continue to support building stronger laws that tackle criminal kingpins and take the profit out of crime. Indeed, the shadow minister raised several issues with the minister in relation to this bill, and the shadow minister thanks the minister for his cooperation with briefings and information provided. Also, the bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for some further examination and to allow submissions in relation to these measures. Let me go to three areas that were highlighted in the Senate committee report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Concerns were raised in submissions regarding the fundamental rights and constitutional principles that may be impacted by the proposed amendments. As the committee noted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the same time, the committee is cognisant of the importance of an effective proceeds of crime regime in combating serious crimes and those who profit from crime, as emphasised by AGD and supported by a number of other submitters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee acknowledges the department's advice that these amendments were developed in consultation with key stakeholders, and with a view to striking the appropriate balance between effectively combating crime, and respecting the fundamental rights and principles underlying Australia's criminal justice system. The committee notes that the amended legislation will if necessary be tested in the courts, who will be well placed to determine the questions of constitutionality and fundamental rights that have been raised in this inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor joins with the submitters from both within and outside of government to welcomed the proposed new offences in this bill, which will not only support Australia's compliance with our international obligations but actually go further, as was noted in the committee report, in helping combat a range of financial crimes. The committee regarded the breadth of the proposed offences, and the potentially serious penalties for those who commit them, as appropriate in the circumstances, which were canvassed in some detail in the committee's consideration.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the course of the Senate inquiry concerns were raised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Law Council of Australia
        </a>
        in relation to the operation of some provisions, but it was noted by the committee that the clarification provided by the Attorney-General's Department emphasised that the regulatory powers granted by the bill remain subject to parliamentary oversight. The committee regarded information sharing as crucial to effective action against crime, particularly where antiterrorism and other national security concerns are at stake. As such, the committee and Labor endorse the enhanced information sharing proposed in schedules 4 and 5, while encouraging AUSTRAC and the Attorney-General's Department/Auscheck to ensure that adequate and robust safeguards are in place to protect personal privacy and to appropriately govern and oversee the careful and lawful sharing of information. As the committee also noted in its conclusions:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.64 Ultimately, the issues … in relation to this bill, [come down] to questions of balance: between effectively combating crime and protection of human rights and constitutional principles; between closing unfair loopholes exploited by criminals and providing sufficient precision to ensure that the offences are appropriate to their context; between information sharing and the protection of privacy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.65 With the assistance of the information and clarification provided by the Attorney-General's Department and others in the course of this inquiry, the committee is satisfied that the bill strikes the appropriate balances within each of the legislative schemes, bearing in mind the important matters of criminal justice and national security at stake.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thus, Labor accepts the fine work undertaken by the committee in this instance and commends the bill to the Senate.

         This bill makes separate amendments to four acts, as we have heard: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proceeds_of_Crime_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Proceeds of Crime Act
         </a>
         2002, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
          Criminal Code
         </a>
         Act 1995, the Anti-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_Laundering" rel="nofollow">
          Money Laundering
         </a>
         and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 and the AusCheck Act 2007. These amendments, at least in part, are in response to recent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
          Victorian Supreme Court
         </a>
         and High Court decisions, which highlighted problems with the interpretation and operation of non-conviction based confiscation provisions, specifically sections 315A and 319 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002.
        </p>
        <p>
         Currently, that act allows the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         or the Commonwealth
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP" rel="nofollow">
          DPP
         </a>
         to apply to restrain property where it is suspected of being the proceeds of an indictable offence and have the restrained property forfeited if the court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the property is indeed the proceeds of an indictable offence. The key amendment in this schedule is to section 319. This expands the range of grounds on which a court must not stay proceedings. When we looked at this bill, I have to say that it is difficult to understand what grounds would be left on which a court could in fact stay proceedings. We have had major concerns expressed with schedule 1 amendments by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Law Council of Australia
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Human Rights Commission
         </a>
         , the Victorian bar and New South Wales
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Liberties" rel="nofollow">
          Civil Liberties
         </a>
         . In fact, the Law Council of Australia and the Australian Human Rights Commission have stated that the amendment to section 319 may be constitutionally invalid, as it may require a court to act in such a way that it would be acting contrary to the interests of justice.
        </p>
        <p>
         So there have been strong concerns registered about the section 319 amendment which, it is fair to say, significantly expands the range of grounds on which a court must not stay proceedings. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         have similar concerns to those expressed by the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Victorian bar and New South Wales Civil Liberties. Amendments standing in my name are currently being circulated to senators and I want to be very clear that schedule 1 item 4, which repeals section 319 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and substitutes a new section 319, entitled 'Stay of proceedings', does cause us in the Australian Greens significant concerns. The new section 319 that this bill proposes to insert into the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 provides that a court must not stay proceeds of crime proceedings on any or all of the following grounds. It goes through and lists a range of grounds in subclauses (2), (3), (4) and (5). These matters cause the Australian Greens so much concern that we will not be supporting these amendments today through the Senate. Amendments that are being circulated standing in my name will provide us, when moved in the committee stages of this bill, the opportunity to vote against those sections and for clarity on referring to schedule 1, item 4, page 4, lines 1 to 31. There would then be another amendment that is also being circulated that, if we were successful, would be consequential to the first amendment.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to put this in context. We have seen over recent years a suite of legislative changes that have been made with the purported aim of giving governments more power to fight crime and, in many cases, to fight terrorism. Of course, we want to see governments with a range of reasonable powers at their disposal so that crime and terrorism can be fought, but it is our view in general terms that successive governments, both of Labor and the coalition stripe, have gone too far in these areas. Particularly in the context of antiterrorism legislation we have seen the continued erosion of human and civil rights that many Australians have fought and sometimes died to protect and enhance in the course of our history. Yet we seem to be giving these powers away bit by bit in a death of a thousand cuts—and it is a death of a thousand cuts to natural justice, and we would argue that is the risk in the context of the bill we are discussing today, but it is also a death of a thousand cuts in terms of fundamental civil and human rights that many of us believe need to exist in a 21st-century Western democracy. So the Greens position on this bill needs to be seen in the context of this ongoing erosion of natural justice, the ongoing erosion of fundamental civil and human rights that we have seen in this country particularly in the last 10 or 15 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are concerned that the proposed new section 319 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 could result in proceeds of crime cases proceeding uncontested, because it is eminently foreseeable that a person could end up in the position of forfeiting their property and allowing a proceeds of crime case to proceed uncontested so as to not jeopardise a potential criminal trial that they may be facing down the track. We will, as I said, be moving amendments based on recommendations from the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Law Council of Australia. We believe these amendments are in the interests of natural justice and justice more broadly, because it is fundamental to our justice system that we in this country, when charged with a criminal offence, are innocent until we are properly proven guilty in a relevant court of law. That presumption of innocence is a keystone to our entire justice system that has been handed down through centuries of common law and jurisprudence in Western democracies. It is an incredibly important part of our justice system and of the rights that our citizens hold.
        </p>
        <p>
         I might add, and senators will become used to hearing me say this, it is time for a bill of rights in this country. We are one of the few Western democracies in the world that does not have a national bill of rights. We have a very good model in Victoria that would inform a bill of rights, and I commit myself in whatever time I have left serving in this place to continuing to advocate and potentially developing and ultimately tabling a bill of rights for Australia so that the Australian people can see very clearly what their rights are as citizens. We hear a lot about our responsibilities as citizens, and rightly so—being a citizen of this fantastic country does confer on us significant responsibilities and we should honour those responsibilities and embrace them. However, we also have significant rights as citizens of this country, and unfortunately we have seen, as I said earlier, a slow drift—and at times, to be frank, a not so slow drift—towards an erosion of some of these fundamental civil and human rights.
        </p>
        <p>
         Going back into the past, members of my family, and I am sure the families of others here, have served in the Australian armed forces, and in my case in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         my grandfather served in the 1st
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Light_Horse" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Light Horse
         </a>
         and my grandfather on my mother's side of the family served in a Highland regiment from Scotland—he went to war in a kilt. He was a very brave man, I am sure Senator Cameron would agree. They went to war, at least in part, to defend many of the rights that we are now seeing eroded by governments. I have to say, shamefully, this is a bipartisan position of the coalition and the Labor Party; they seem to rush towards legislative provisions that purportedly make us safer against crime and terror but too frequently there is no evidence presented that they make us any safer at all. We will scrutinise all of the legislation that falls within the anti-crime and anti-terror ambit, and where we think it is appropriate, as we do today in relation to the proposed new section 319, we will be voting against legislation that we think unreasonably tilts the balance and unreasonably and without evidence continues the erosion of civil and human rights and the erosion of natural justice that seems to be happening all too commonly in our country today. If we are not going to stand up for those rights in the Senate and in the Commonwealth parliament, I ask who else is going to defend those rights and where else are they going to be defended? I thank the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Human Rights Commission, the Victorian bar and the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties for their work on this issue and for expressing significant concerns with some of the provisions in the legislation that is currently before the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the constitutionality or otherwise of proposed new section 319, should the matter end up in the High Court that will of course be a matter for their honours in the High Court, but I would be interested, Minister, if you are able to provide in general terms any advice that may have been sought from the Solicitor-General in relation to whether or not that office holds similar concerns—that is, specifically around the proposed new section 319 in the Proceeds of Crime Act. If you are able to provide the Senate with any advice whatsoever on that, that would be gratefully received. For clarity, I know the minister will not table any of the Solicitor-General's advice because that has certainly been a constant position the government has run since I arrived here only a relatively short time ago. But it is fair to say that the Attorney-General has on occasions provided general overview comments around the constitutionality or otherwise of proposals that have come before the Commonwealth parliament, and specifically proposals that have come before the Senate. Are you able to provide any response at all, particularly to the question of whether the Solicitor-General's advice was sought on the constitutionality or otherwise of proposed new section 319 in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002?
        </p>
        <p>
         With those comments, I will say that not all of the provisions in this legislation are opposed by the Greens. Our opposition is constrained to the proposed new section 319 in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, that is the section that provides a range of grounds on which the court must not stay proceeds-of-crime proceedings. We will be seeking to have this bill considered in committee so that we can register our opposition by voting against the proposed provisions contained on page 4 of schedule (1) lines 1 to 31.

          With reference to the
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          of the Tasmanian government when Senator McKim was part of that government, it will be interesting to see how many legal advices were tabled in the Tasmanian parliament when the Greens had control of that. I answer Senator McKim by saying: we do have a bill of rights in Australia at the present time. It is called the common law and the courts of the land, which protect the human rights and other rights that we as Australians enjoy, perhaps more so than any other nation in the world.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation committee, which I chair and of which Senator Collins is the deputy chair and Senator McKim is a member, inquired into this bill, receiving 12 submissions. The committee has issued a report, which until today I thought was a unanimous report, recommending that the bill be passed. I note that, unusually, the Greens have a set of amendments. Those were not raised in the committee's report to the Senate.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Proceeds of Crime and Other Measures) Bill 2015 does a number of things. Principally it amends provisions relating to serious drug offences in the

           No, I am not talking about water, either; I am talking about the drug. I may be verballing them; if I am I stand to be corrected.

            I raise a point of order. The senator knows very well he is verballing us and I ask him to withdraw.

              I am only going on what I read in media reports. You will have plenty of opportunity to explain the Greens' provisions and thoughts in relation to the drug ice. The bill that we are dealing with today is another measure in the government's ongoing campaign against dangerous drugs. Whilst Senator McKim says that sometimes we have to get the balance between human rights, our legal rights and the fight against serious drugs, then we have to look at legislation like that we have here. Indeed, this bill is brought about because regrettably in Australia at the moment, there are amongst other things real problems with serious organised crime—not petty criminals down in the backyard—proceeds of that crime and very serious drugs.
             </p>
             <p>
              This bill is intended by the government—and it seems with the support of the opposition—to tighten up areas, so that our law enforcement agencies can better address the scourge of very serious drugs distributed by serious organised criminal elements. One of the elements of this bill relates to that. Other provisions of the bill enable a wider range of agencies and officials to access and share information obtained by
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
               AUSTRAC
              </a>
              under the money laundering and counter-terrorism financing bills and to further clarify the circumstances under which information can be shared. It enables a wider range of our law enforcement agencies to access the information obtained by AUSTRAC and also extends the circumstances under which AusCheck can share background checking information it gathers with other Commonwealth, state and territory agencies that perform law enforcement and national security functions.
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator McKim raised proposed section 319 of the bill, which replaces the old section 319 and relates to a new multipart section dealing with more detailed criteria for any stay on known criminal forfeiture proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Ac Section 319, the new one, provides:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              A court may stay proceedings … if the court considers that it is in the interests of justice to do so.
             </p>
             <p>
              But then the bill goes on to limit the extent to which the court may stay proceedings, through a number of provisions which are set out in proposed section 319(2) of the bill. The new provisions are designed to prevent a respondent from claiming merely a generalised risk of prejudice—
