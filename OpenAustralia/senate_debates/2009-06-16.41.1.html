        My question is to Senator Wong, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I wish to draw the minister’s attention to the recently released four-year study of the impact of phytophthora dieback in WA—Project Dieback. Phytophthora dieback is identified as a key threatening process under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC
        </a>
        Act and has been named as the most significant threat to biodiversity in south-west WA, which is a world biodiversity hotspot. Project Dieback showed that one million hectares in southern WA is infected with dieback and another one million hectares is at high risk. Nearly 80 per cent of the plant species in the south-west of WA are found nowhere else in the world. At least half of these are vulnerable to dieback. As a key threatening process under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC Act
        </a>
        , why is dieback not listed as a priority funding under Caring for our Country and what action is the government taking to address phytophthora dieback urgently?

         I thank Senator Siewert for the question. I have some information on this, but I may need to take some of the question on notice. I can tell you that phytophthora, which I might call root rot or dieback, is the subject of a threat abatement plan which was made in May 2009. I am advised that the plan is currently being enacted and the plan will be enacted across the coming five years. I am also advised that Mr Garrett’s department is in consultation with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         government to clarify proposals, particularly in relation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzgerald_River_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Fitzgerald River National Park
         </a>
         . Dieback, as the Senate is probably aware, is listed as a key threatening process under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Protection" rel="nofollow">
          Environmental Protection
         </a>
         and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The first threat abatement plan to address this issue was made in 2001. As the senator may be aware, these plans set out the research, management and other actions necessary to reduce the impact of listed key threatening processes on native species and ecological communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC
         </a>
         Act, threat abatement plans are reviewed at intervals of not longer than five years. The review in relation to this particular fungus was undertaken in 2006 and it is the findings of this review which have been utilised to develop the revised threat abatement plan made recently by Minister Garrett. This plan was revised to reflect the findings of the review, incorporating research undertaken and advances in knowledge about managing the fungus made since the release of the 2001 threat abatement plan. I indicate that, in relation to the Caring for our Country criteria, that is a matter for which I will ask if Minister Garrett can provide further information.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister and thank her for taking that question about Caring for our Country on notice. I specifically ask about the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzgerald_River_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
           Fitzgerald River National Park
          </a>
          , which is a biosphere reserve in southern WA. It is in fact one of the few remaining areas in the south-west of WA that are largely unaffected by dieback, and it acts as an ark for the flora in the area. It is one of the only places where in the future we may in fact find species that are unaffected by dieback. Researchers have said it will cost about $10 million a year to protect such areas. I ask the government if it is prepared to fund the $10 million needed to protect these vitally important biodiversity areas.

           government. I also note that I am advised that, whilst this fungus does not usually cause severe damage in undisturbed vegetation areas with less rainfall than 600 millimetres, it can cause severe epidemics in areas with high rainfall. I am also advised that the department is currently in consultation with the Western Australian government to clarify the details of proposed actions in this area.

             Man and the Biosphere

            reserve which is under international convention. This park is highly vulnerable to dieback. It is an extremely important area because it is one of the last few areas that may remain uninfected by dieback in the future. The state government proposed to put a coastal road through the park which will go through what are at present uninfected areas. Is the government funding or considering funding any part of that road?

             On that issue of the road, I will have to take on notice what involvement, if any, the Commonwealth has. I am unaware as to whether or not there have been any applications or exercise of the powers under the
