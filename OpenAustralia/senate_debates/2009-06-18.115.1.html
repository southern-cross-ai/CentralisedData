          Thank you to Senator Heffernan for the question—and congratulations to him on getting a question. These are matters which have been discussed in Senate estimates on a number of occasions. I think Senator Heffernan traversed some of these issues then. I believe he is speaking about the Sugarloaf Pipeline and the conditions that Minister Garrett put in place under the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
           EPBC
          </a>
          Act. As I said then and will repeat now: there are means for enforcement under the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
           EPBC Act
          </a>
          —that statute sets those out. I will obtain any further information from the department—and this is actually Minister Garrett’s department—that I can. I am not aware of anything further since the Senate estimates on this issue, but it is possible there may have been further actions, to which Senator Heffernan is referring. But again I say: the conditions of approval are conditions that have force under the EPBC Act. There are a range of enforcement mechanisms under that act, and this project will be treated, like any other, in accordance with the provisions of that statute. I recognise, and the government recognises, that this is an issue that has attracted a great deal of attention within Victoria, but, as Mr Garrett has consistently said, his decision on this issue is driven by the merits of the matter before him, and, of course, there is only a limited set of issues before him in relation to the pipeline.

           , I ask a supplementary question. The mean flow of the system is 2,700 gigalitres and is predicted to be 300 this year, which has serious implications for downstream and for environmental flows. How can the minister on one hand say she is trying to return water to the Murray-Darling Basin when at the same time she is allowing
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Water" rel="nofollow">
            Melbourne Water
           </a>
           to extract 75 gigalitres—which is not even considered a gross figure; it is a net figure—of environmental reserves from the

            Senator Heffernan is one of the few people on that side who should know better than to ask that question, because he knows that—whatever the merits of the pipeline—this is an issue about the division by Victoria of its own state shares. He tries to make a comparison with water purchase, but he knows that purchase of entitlement is a different issue. I share his concern about where the basin is, and the figures that he put into
            <i>
             Hansard
            </i>
            just now demonstrate the concerning and extremely difficult situation we face in the Murray-Darling Basin. I wish that more on that side would recognise that challenge, because we have a range of senators and coalition members who refuse to acknowledge the reality of the challenge in the Murray-Darling Basin, and who continue to be opposed to water purchase—

                  In relation to the first issue, I will have to take that on notice; I am not aware of the details of the incident to which you refer. In relation to the second issue: yes, we are aware of the range of means needed to try and secure water in the face of the challenge of climate change. That is why, unlike the previous government, we are funding Water for the Future, we are funding urban water projects through the urban water fund, we are funding stormwater, we are funding recycling and we are funding waste water. Those on the other side can come in here and lecture us about water policy, but Australians can look at their record, which includes, I think, the comments of Mr Costello—who is now on his way—about the Commonwealth not having a role in urban water. That is not our view. We are funding projects—including desalination, recycling, waste water, grey water, stormwater harvesting—
