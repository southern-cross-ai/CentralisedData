        The Bill also amends both Acts to provide for the alignment of the Student Financial Supplement Scheme repayment thresholds and indexation with the

       <p class="italic">
        The Student Financial Supplement Scheme was a voluntary loan scheme under which eligible tertiary students could trade-in income support in return for a loan, on the basis of a $1 trade for a $2 loan. The money traded-in became part of the loan, all of which is repayable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Student Financial Supplement Scheme was not delivering good outcomes for students or for Australian taxpayers, and as a consequence it was closed administratively on 31 December 2003. No new loans have been issued since its closure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Student Financial Supplement Scheme was closed in response to increasing levels of bad and doubtful debt and reduced take-up of loans. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        Actuary has estimated that some 84 per cent of the loans under the Student Assistance Act 1973 and 56 per cent of the loans under the Social Security Act 1991 may never be repaid.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Student Financial Supplement Scheme was introduced in a climate of high youth unemployment, high interest rates and when few commercial loan packages were available to students. The take up of the Student Financial Supplement Scheme has declined over the years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also makes a minor technical amendment to the Student Assistance Act 1973 by inserting an express provision to permit the incorporation of an instrument “as in force or existing from time to time” for the purposes of section 14 of Legislative Instruments Act 2003. This will eliminate the need to make new regulations under the Act whenever guidelines for the non-statutory ABSTUDY and Assistance for Isolated Children schemes are altered.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the Bill to the Senate.

         FRAMEWORK LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 2005
        </a>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of this Bill is to update, clarify, and align or integrate several financial management provisions in legislation. The Bill proposes amendments to 16 Acts and the repeal of 2 Acts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill is divided into 4 schedules. Schedule 1 proposes amendments to 9 Acts that establish individual Special Accounts. These amendments cover the following Special Accounts: the Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>

        Research Endowment Account, the Child Support Account, the Gene Technology Account, the Industrial Chemicals Account, the National Blood Account, the Medical Research Endowment Account and the Natural Resources Management Account.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most of the amendments covering Special Accounts are of the same type as the amendments made in Schedule 1 of the Financial
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework" rel="nofollow">
         Framework
        </a>
        Legislation Amendment Act 2005 (FFLA Act). The FFLA Act commenced on 22 February 2005. These amendments aligned financial management provisions in 85 Acts with the amendments made to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Management" rel="nofollow">
         Financial Management
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Accountability Act
        </a>
        1997 (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA" rel="nofollow">
         FMA
        </a>
        Act) by the Financial Management Legislation Amendment Act 1999. The Financial Management Legislation Amendment Act 1999 abolished separate accounting funds in the Commonwealth’s financial management framework and introduced the concept of Special Accounts. A Special Account is a ledger that records amounts in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        set aside for expenditure on the purposes of the Special Account.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed amendments covering the Medical Research Endowment Account and the Natural Resources Management Account differ from the amendments made in Schedule 1 of the FFLA Act. The proposed amendments transfer from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Finance Minister
        </a>
        to the respective Ministers responsible for these Special Accounts the power to receive money on trust for the purposes of each Account. Under the devolved financial management framework that now applies in the Commonwealth public sector it is appropriate that these powers be exercised by the Ministers responsible for the Acts that establish these Special Accounts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 of the Bill proposes amendments to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRC" rel="nofollow">
         SRC
        </a>
        Act) to authorise Comcare to pay workers’ compensation benefits to employee either through Commonwealth employers or direct to employees. The SRC Act currently authorises compensation benefits only to be paid directly to employees. The proposed amendments reflect current and best practice to ensure there is a seamless transition for the employee between payment of salary, etc and payment of compensation. The amendments also give effect to the conclusion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        of Public Accounts and Audit, in its report 395 Inquiry into the Draft Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill, supporting amendments to align the Act “with current good practice whereby Comcare makes compensation payments to agencies”.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 3 of the Bill proposes amendments to 6 Acts that are not included in Schedules 1 or 2. I will now highlight the main amendments proposed in Schedule 3.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill proposes amendments to the FMA Act to extend to law enforcement agencies access to the modifications to the FMA Act that currently apply to intelligence or security agencies. These modifications are set out in the Financial Management and Accountability Regulations 1997. Some law enforcement agencies need to undertake sensitive activities that are similar in nature to those of intelligence and security agencies. It is therefore appropriate that they be able to access the same modified application of the FMA Act for those sensitive activities, subject to Ministerial agreement and consideration by Parliament through an amendment to the FMA Regulations that would prescribe a law enforcement agency for this purpose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendments to the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 are proposed to correct, update and to express in clearer language, various provisions. The amendments cover such matters as the inclusion of non-gender specific language, Sectional Committees, evidence taken in public or in private, and payment of allowances. The amendments do not alter the intent of the existing provisions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Amendments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Title_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Native Title Act
        </a>
        1993 are proposed to transfer from the Treasurer to the Finance Minister the power to approve the investment of surplus money by an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander body and to provide the Finance Minister with a delegation power in relation to that approval power. The amendment proposed to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Marine_Science" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Marine Science
        </a>
        Act 1972 provides the Finance Minister with a delegation power in relation to his existing powers to approve borrowing by, and guarantees relating to, the Australian Institute of Marine Science. The amendments proposed to the Native Title Act and the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act align these Acts with the amendments made to 25 Acts by the FFLA Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 3 also proposes the amendments to the FMA Act and the Public Service Act 1999 to clarify that the appropriation authority for an act of grace payment, or payment to a person because of special circumstances arising out of employment by the Commonwealth, is not provided in these Acts. The appropriation authority would generally be an agency’s annual appropriation, providing the payment relates to some matter that has arisen in the course of an agency’s administration.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 4 of the Bill proposes the repeal of 2 Acts, the Employment Services Act 1994 and the Loan Act 1977. With the commencement of the Employment Services market in 1998, the case management system set up by the Employment Services Act is no longer required and the Employment Services Regulatory Authority, which is established in that Act, has become non-operational. The Employments Services Act is, therefore, now redundant. The Loan Act is also redundant. It authorises the Treasurer to borrow a specified amount of money during the financial year ended 30 June 1978.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This proposed law will update, clarify and align or integrate a wide range of financial management provisions applying to Commonwealth entities and thereby enhance the financial management framework of the Australian Government generally. The Bill largely proposes a continuation of the types of amendments made in the FFLA Act. I commend the Bill.
       </p>

         APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 3) 2005-2006
        </a>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are two Additional Estimates Bills this year:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation
        </a>
        Bill (No. 3) and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 4). I shall introduce the latter Bill shortly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Additional Estimates Bills follow on from the Appropriation Bills that were introduced on the occasion of the 2005-2006 Budget. They seek appropriation authority from Parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The total appropriation being sought through the Additional Estimates Bills this year is almost $2.63 billion, which is partially offset by expected savings in appropriations of around $603.9 million. Taking savings into account, the expected net increase in expenditure arising from Additional Estimates Bills is approximately $2 billion, or about 3.5% of total annual appropriations. These savings are described in the document accompanying the Bills, the “Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations”.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The total appropriation being sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) this year is around $1.26 billion. This proposed appropriation arises from changes in the estimates of programme expenditure, due to variations in the timing of payments and forecast increases in costs, reclassifications and policy decisions taken by the Government since the last Budget, most of which have been described in the “
        <i>
         Mid Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook”
        </i>
        document published in December last year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The major items of expenditure in the Bill include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         a net increase of $167.1 million to the Employment and Workplace Relations Portfolio, the major components of which are:
