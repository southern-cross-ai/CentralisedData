        Eleven years ago this month, the parliament was adorned by Reverend Peter Rose commencing as our chaplain. The Reverend Rose has regrettably yet understandably announced his intention to step down from this important role, a role that seeks to look after our spiritual wellbeing and practical needs. Reverend Rose had a distinguished career in our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        serving as an engineer captain based in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nui_Dat" rel="nofollow">

        during the Vietnam conflict. He has tertiary qualifications in engineering, theology and creative writing. He is a husband, father and grandfather. He has also worked with an international humanitarian aid organisation. He is an author and professional trainer. In short, Reverend Rose brought with him a wealth and breadth of experience that uniquely qualified him to be of real and practical value to senators, members, our staff and indeed all people within this building. His personable caring approach, his empathy and his compassion all bore witness to his Christian faith and was the reason so many sort his counsel, advice and guidance. He was a trusted confidant to many.

        building can bear testimony to Reverend Rose's—or as he prefers to be called 'Peter's'—wonderful Christian witness. Through the lows and highs of daily life be it in matters associated with this place or with one's personal life, Peter was always prepared to listen, sit with you, talk and, if you wanted, pray with you. His weekly devotions were always a blessing. The guidance and wisdom imparted through them was a lift and boost for all who had the privilege of hearing them. His commitment to our individual welfare, our deliberations and our nation were shown by his alternating and unfailing presence at the

        monitors outside the House of Representatives and Senate chambers when prayers were said each day to commence proceedings. This daily quiet, unobtrusive, discrete presence was always a welcome and reassuring sight.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst Peter has generously agreed to remain in the role of chaplain until a suitable replacement can be found, it is his expressed intention to retire when this, the 44th Parliament, is dissolved—and if speculation is a guide, it is believed that that could be rather soon.
       </p>
       <p>
        As one of the many beneficiaries of our chaplain's counsel, company, guidance and prayerful support, which he so freely, generously and graciously gave to me, let me seek to speak on behalf of all the others he has helped and blessed by saying thank you to Reverend Peter Rose, and to his superiors both in the church and spousal—namely his wife Marion—in lending him to us over the past decade. Individuals, our parliament and our nation have been blessed by Peter's service to us. My prayer for our retiring chaplain is that he may be blessed with good health and happiness in his retirement and that, as he reflects on the past 11 years, he be reassured that his service was treasured by many. I for one and, I suspect, on behalf of the very many others in this place, want to say a very heartfelt thank you to the Reverend Peter Rose and may God richly bless you for your faithful witness and service to us.
