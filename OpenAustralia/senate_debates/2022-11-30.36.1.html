       <p>
        Racially charged attacks and offensive language have no place in a national conversation on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to parliament, not at any time. Before we even have the legislation to trigger a referendum, I'm seeing and hearing references to rednecks, race based conspiracies and personal attacks that contribute nothing to sensible, safe discussion, discourse and debate. Whether it is in our parliaments; in community meetings; in consultations and conversations with workplace colleagues; with family and friends; or simply at a barbecue, no Australian should be silenced on this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Delivering an outcome in an environment of fear, intimidation and bullying is not cultural and nor is it an Australian value that any of us should aspire to. Sure, make it robust and loud; but be careful about what we say and about platitudes that could silence or shame, such as being on the 'right' side of history. To take an alternative position is not giving up culture, being racist or rednecked, or means that you are diminished, a loser or discredited. I have concerns and questions about details, and I would have them even if I weren't a member of parliament. As an Australian, I don't want that space filled with diatribe, insults and public attacks, even if they're not directed at me.
       </p>
       <p>
        For informed consent I need comprehensive, quality information; all I seek is the facts. I will continue to speak out against those in debate, in organisations and in communities who seek to control through fear, undermining, intimidation and silencing, because it is disgraceful, distasteful and shameful. Above all else, it diminishes contribution and involvement.
