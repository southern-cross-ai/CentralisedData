We also are committed to ensuring that our actions are both environmentally effective and economically responsible. What we won't do is shift emissions, together with jobs and economic activity, overseas where, for the same level of economic—

            Senator Waters, I can't instruct the minister how to answer the question, as long as he's being directly relevant to it. There's an opportunity after question time for senators to debate the merits or otherwise of answers. The minister can continue.

             Senator Waters, the reason what I'm explaining to you is directly relevant is that if we did not do what we're doing then we would make the challenges for the global environment worse. If we were to decide to stop producing and exporting Australian coal and it were to be displaced by coal from other sources which are more polluting, the emissions in the world would go up. If we decided to pursue the reckless agenda that you're suggesting, we would shift jobs, economic activities and emissions overseas where, for same level of economic output, emissions would be higher and the world environment would be worse off. That is why what I'm saying to you is directly relevant.
            </p>
            <p>
             The course of action that you're suggesting would not only harm working families around Australia; it would harm the global environment. This government will never do anything to gratuitously harm the Australian people in a way that would then also harm the global environment. Our agenda—we are committed to effective action on climate change, we are committed to taking action that is environmentally effective and economically responsible, and we will not make meaningless commitments without being able to tell the Australian people what the impact is going to be on them, on their jobs, on their future job security, and on their future job opportunities, particularly if it means making the situation for the global environment worse.

               The government's own inadequate 2030 targets are consistent with three degrees of global warming. Given that it appears to be government policy to heat Australia by three degrees, can you please tell us, to the nearest billion dollars, the damage expected to be suffered to the tourism, agriculture and infrastructure sectors by your government's policies, or are you not costing your own policies?

                You are quite right: we are committed to a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction target, which on a per capita basis means that we will be reducing emissions by half and on an emissions intensity of the economy basis means we will be reducing the emissions intensity in our economy by two-thirds. And do you know what? We have a target. The Labor Party doesn't even have a 2030 target—none. They're running for the hills. They're now trying to run a smokescreen. The reason the Leader of the Opposition came out with the statement he did last Friday is that he knows he can't get a consensus in his party room between Otis and Mr Butler around a 2030 target. That is what that is all about. It's just one massive smokescreen.

But we're also committed to ensuring that the agenda that we pursue is environmentally effective and economically responsible. We will not be pursuing an agenda that gratuitously harms the future opportunities of Australians in a way that makes global emissions increase more, that makes the situation for the world environment worse. We want to improve the global emissions outlook, not make it worse. Indeed, Australia as a net exporter of energy—including, of course, as an exporter of Australian coal, displacing more polluting coal from other sources—will continue to help reduce global emissions in the way that we have for some time.
