       <p>
        This is not my first speech, once again! Tonight I would like to challenge one of the persistent myths which surround my generation. There are those within this chamber and beyond who believe that we do not care about the world around us or what happens in this place. Well, we do. We are the ones who will live in the world that is being built here. This is why we are so frustrated by the petty game playing which now seems to pass for political debate in this place. It angers us, it saddens us and it causes us to disengage. You do not seem to care about our issues and so we do not care about you. You do not seem to take us seriously and so we do not take you seriously. But we do understand that, for our generation, everything is now on the line—our jobs, our homes, our education, the people that we love and the planet on which we live. We, the young people of Australia, do not have time to waste.
       </p>
       <p>
        This parliament should be a place in which our values play out. It must no longer be a place in which members of the political establishment serve the vested interests of those individuals and organisations who seek to hijack our democracy for their personal gain. Our generation, the young people of Australia, are not afraid to state this clearly. We are not afraid to confront the reality that, for so many Australians, the idea of living in a society based on justice, fairness and equality is becoming an ever more distant dream. We feel that fundamental urgency that drives us to act. For evidence of this, it is necessary to look no further than the vibrant and passionate work of groups such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Youth_Climate_Coalition" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Youth Climate Coalition
        </a>
        and Oaktree or indeed to youth-led organisations which are so often sadly underfunded such as headspace. However, as a recent entrant and rather unexpected member of this chamber, I can tell you that we look to this place and so often see nothing but wasted time—wasted time ignoring the housing crisis; wasted time denying climate change; wasted time avoiding marriage equality. Young people look to this place and are infuriated by the extent to which our politicians are willing to run the clock on our future.
       </p>
       <p>
        We do in fact care about our world and our future. We are a generation alive with the desire to rise to the challenges of our time. Contrary to what many in this place might conveniently believe, our disinterest and anger is borne not of ignorance but of knowledge. Through your words here and the actions that often play out, the members of this chamber show us that it is in fact you who do not care about our future, and we are so often left to wonder where and why that same desire has disappeared in all of you.
