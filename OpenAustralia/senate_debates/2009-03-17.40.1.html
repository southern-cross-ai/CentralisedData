        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change

        and Water and the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. In view of the severity of the oil spill off
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Moreton Island
        </a>
        in South-East Queensland last Wednesday and the loss of containers of ammonium nitrate, and in view of what appears to have been the delay and mismanagement by the Queensland and Australian governments in responding to this catastrophe, would the minister consider a royal commission to investigate all aspects of the spill, including its cause, the recovery effort, the national contingency plan and needed improvements for the future?

         It is a multiheaded question, I think. I will provide an answer on the basis of advice I have been provided as Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Australia does have a national plan: Australia’s National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil and Other Noxious and Hazardous Substances. To enable effective responses to marine pollution incidents, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Maritime Safety Authority
         </a>
         , within Minister Albanese’s portfolio, manages this national plan and works with state and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         governments in the shipping, oil exploration and chemical industries and with emergency services to respond to marine pollution incidents. I am advised that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_Safety_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Maritime Safety Queensland
         </a>
         is the lead agency under the plan and has the full backing of the plan’s other participants, including the Australian and state governments and the petroleum industry. Officers of Minister Garrett’s department are in regular contact with

          , I ask a supplementary question. My question was principally to the Minister representing the Attorney-General: does she agree that a royal commission would be useful? I repeat that question. Does the minister agree that immediate action was required to contain the impact of the oil spill, that this did not occur and that a royal commission would be able to make recommendations to ensure a better response to any future similar large-scale environmental disasters? Would the minister believe that, as of 30 minutes ago, 100
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
           Brisbane City Council
          </a>
          employees are sitting on Bulwer Island, where they have been for four hours, simply because they cannot get the personal protective equipment needed to address the oil spill? This demonstrates the inefficiency of the Queensland government in addressing this environmental disaster.

           I am invited to indicate what the proposition demonstrates. I think what the question demonstrates is that Senator Macdonald is seeking to campaign for the Queensland election in the states chamber.

            And maybe, if Senator Macdonald thinks he will do a bit better politically by standing for the state parliament in Queensland, that is where he should seek preselection. I have made it clear—

               , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the minister seriously suggesting that my concern—and the concern of four million other South-East Queenslanders—about an environmental disaster is simply a political game? The minister needs to wake up to herself. I further ask the minister: is the Rudd government’s reluctance to consider a royal commission part of a cover-up they have been involved in with the Queensland government to help hide the facts before the Queensland election next Saturday?

                   , on a point of order going to relevance: Senator Wong is accusing me of disgraceful conduct. I was repeating the words she used—that the spill was nothing more than a political ploy.

                    , on the point of order: Senator Macdonald accused the government of involvement in a cover-up. We accept robust debate in this chamber and are not overly precious like some, but I do not think the senator can then expect not to get a bit back, having made such outrageous claims, and he ought to grow up and toughen up.

                      , in Minister’s Albanese’s portfolio, is the relevant federal agency. I understand that it has been engaged in ongoing work in the way I have described. Obviously all of us are deeply concerned about this incident, and it is unfortunate that senior members on the other side have simply permitted Senator Macdonald to behave in this way today on an issue that is of importance and of concern to all Australians. I have indicated the position in terms of who is responsible—
