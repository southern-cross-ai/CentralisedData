          that took place from 28 June to 7 July 2006. I note Senator Webber’s interjection. She was involved in a delegation to China earlier this year, which she led. Likewise, I had the honour of leading the delegation to China during the period I mentioned and it was most informative and enjoyable. The members of the delegation included me, as leader, Mr Mark Powell,

          was the representative of the Australian Political Exchange Council.
         </p>
         <p>
          This was the 15th Australian delegation to China and it was hosted by the All-China Youth Federation. We travelled to Guangzhou in Guangdong province. We went to Yichang and Wuhan in the Hubei province and our delegation concluded its 10-day visit in Beijing. In the report that I prepared on behalf of the delegation, we indicated some reflections and views on the Australia-China relationship, saying that it has never been closer and that the relationship, which officially commenced in 1973, is based on mutual respect, recognition of our shared interests and differences and a desire for peace, social stability, economic growth and prosperity.
         </p>
         <p>
          In terms of the highlights of the delegation visit, we wanted to note the importance of the Australia-China free trade agreement and, in particular, the recent visit of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_Wen_Jiabao" rel="nofollow">
           Premier Wen Jiabao
          </a>
          and his meeting with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
           Prime Minister John Howard
          </a>
          . On the first day of our visit to Guangzhou, Prime Minister John Howard was in the same province signing an agreement for the export of liquid natural gas from Western Australia to China. It certainly underlined the importance of the free trade agreement negotiations. Five rounds of negotiations had been concluded at the time of our visit to China.
         </p>
         <p>
          We met many government officials and were very honoured by the respect and regard that they held for Australia and for our delegation. We talked about the economy and economic reform and we noted that economic growth in China has averaged just less than 10 per cent over the last three decades and that it is expected to decrease a little but nevertheless remain at a very high growth rate over the next 10 years, certainly in the seven per cent to 10 per cent range. Of course, that is good news for Australia as China is a very key trading partner of our great country.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a Tasmanian senator, the visit to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" rel="nofollow">
           Three Gorges Dam
          </a>
          was a very special event for me. It is the largest hydro facility in the world. It is in Yichang. Because it is important to Tasmania, it was absolutely fascinating to me. For the successful building and development of that dam they actually relocated one million Chinese people. The scale of the dam is quite amazing.
         </p>
         <p>
          We were briefed on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Olympics" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          , which are scheduled for 2008. We looked at the merit of economic development zones and education and cultural exchanges and we were briefed on the
