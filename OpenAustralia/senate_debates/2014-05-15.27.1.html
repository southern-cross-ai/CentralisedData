           I support what Senator Madigan is attempting to do here with this motion. I think it is a very worthy motion. I am concerned about subparagraph (d)(ii) as to the implications of equal childcare funding for all children, whether they are cared for by a parent in their home or through childcare places for parents who choose to return to work. I think that the concerns of Senator Madigan are expressed in particularly (c) and (d)(i) of the motion. I have some concerns—and it is not a criticism of Senator Madigan at all—as to what the implications would be of equal childcare funding and how that would work. But I think what Senator Madigan is trying to do is very important in acknowledging the role of families and being entitled to receive tax benefits to compensate for the cost of raising children.

               The government wishes to record its support for the 20th anniversary of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
                International Day
               </a>
               of the Family. Families are the foundation of our society and its future. The contribution they make socially and economically cannot be understated. However, the government will not be supporting this motion. We believe, contrary to the sentiments of part (c) of this motion, and as reflected in the budget, that family benefits should be targeted to those who need them most. Low-income families are supported through a range of specific payments to give them the resources they need to support young children.
              </p>
              <p>
               The government also supports measures to recognise and increase female workforce participation. These include our plan for a genuine paid parental leave scheme with replacement wage plus super and changes to family tax benefit B proposed in the budget. These changes reflect the reality that many mothers choose to return to work once their youngest child is at school. While we do endorse some of the sentiments in this motion, and certainly do support families, the government will not be supporting this motion.

But, in terms of the process, particularly around the issues of taxation, we think there needs to be a wider discussion in this area. We are happy to have that discussion, Senator Madigan, but, in terms of the motion before us, we are not able to support in those words.
