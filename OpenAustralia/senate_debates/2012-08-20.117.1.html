        That the Senate take note of the document.

       <p>
        I rise to take note of the statement by the Minister for Defence Mr Stephen Smith on Afghanistan, and in so doing I wish to formally express my condolences in relation to the three members of the

        died in a firefight with insurgents. I also want to formally express my condolences—and I joined the motion recently—to the Australian, Sergeant Blaine Diddams from the Special Air Services Regiment, killed on 2 July during a small arms engagement with insurgents.
       </p>
       <p>
        It really is time that Australia brought our troops home from Afghanistan. We need to bring them home as quickly as we can and as safely as we can. I note the minister's statements in relation to the progress of the mission in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oruzgan_Province" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        but, in spite of the work that the Australian troops have been doing there, Afghanistan remains an extremely dangerous environment, as has been evidenced by the deaths we have witnessed in recent times.
       </p>
       <p>
        The New Zealand Prime Minister, in response to the appalling tragic news in terms of their own troops, has said that April was the most likely time for the withdrawal. That is ahead of the time that had previously been cited. The only other option that New Zealand had talked about was September next year, which the Prime Minister of New Zealand cited as being the worst case scenario. He has talked about the fact that they want to have negotiations with their coalition partner and for the New Zealand troops to come home, as I indicated, in April next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the minister's statement in relation to the Australian troops in Afghanistan there is constant reference throughout the statement to increased allocations of funds being made in Afghanistan; but, more worryingly, there is also reference to the consideration of a special forces contribution, notwithstanding it would have to be under an appropriate mandate. But there is also discussion throughout of ongoing involvement by Australian troops in Afghanistan for many years into the foreseeable future. I just want to reiterate that the government is out of step with the Australian community on this issue. Australians want our troops brought home. We want them brought home as safely as possible, as quickly as possible. I think that would enable the Australian funds that are available to support civilian efforts in Afghanistan to continue to provide services to the Afghan population post the engagement of the troops. There is certainly a desperate need for support for the civilian population in Afghanistan. Recent reports from aid organisations have been saying that they are concerned that there will not be sufficient support once the troops are withdrawn to be able to provide the health and education services and so on that are currently provided.

        certainly support Australia's engagement in supporting civilian populations, but we would like to see our troops brought home from active engagement in Afghanistan now.
