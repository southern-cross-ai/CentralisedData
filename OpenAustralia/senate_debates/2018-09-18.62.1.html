         I thank Senator Paterson for the question. I'm very pleased to report that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         has now commenced rollout across 70 per cent of Victoria, with the scheme starting in southern Melbourne from last week. September 1 marks a significant milestone, with the NDIS now having commenced rollout in 11 of the 16 areas in Victoria—scheduled to enter the scheme by 2020. More than 42,000 Victorians are currently accessing the scheme, including more than 8,000 people who are receiving support for the first time.
        </p>
        <p>
         The NDIS is an initiative of the utmost importance, and I do want to pause for a moment to acknowledge the work of those opposite when they were in government and the work that has occurred on this side of the chamber as well. This is, I think, one of the best bipartisan—indeed, cross-party—initiatives that we have seen in this parliament. It's the biggest social reform since Medicare and one that I know all colleagues fully embrace.
        </p>
        <p>
         Once fully implemented, the NDIS is expected to support about 105,000 people with disability in Victoria. More than 54,000 Australians on the NDIS are now receiving the support to which they are entitled. More than 180,000 Australians are being supported by the NDIS at the moment, representing a 13 per cent growth on the previous quarter. Delivering improved outcomes for Australians with disability will inevitability involve challenges. This is a mammoth undertaking, and it's important that issues, as they arise, are addressed quickly and efficiently. That certainly is the objective of this government.

               is important. The implementation schedule is being finalised with states and territories, and improvements include a stronger focus on community, mainstream, informal and employment supports during preplanning, face-to-face plan implementation meetings and improvements to the participant and provider portals. One hundred and eighty-eight people with disability and carers, 76 providers, 124 frontline staff and 20 government officials contributed to the pathway review through workshops and individual interviews. This is all aimed to ensure we have continual improvement of the
