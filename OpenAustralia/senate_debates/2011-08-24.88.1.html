           Given the ESAA claims there are 'serious deficiencies in the carbon tax plan', will the government guarantee that Australia will continue to have secure electricity supply without the need for additional multibillion-dollar bailouts or assistance packages?

             <p>
              I am seeking to answer it, Senator Macdonald. The government has been absolutely focused on ensuring energy security in the development of its clean energy package and you will see from the range of measures in the package that energy security has been a priority. You will also see not only in relation to the payments in assistance to generators but also in the pursuit of a contract for closure and the involvement of the relevant regulators the government has been very clear about the critical nature of ensuring the security of energy supply.
             </p>
             <p>
              The second point I would make is that if the senator is concerned about these matters he ought to look at his own policy. Under the direct action policy funded by taxpayers, and the $1,300 per year impost on Australian families, the coalition is proposing also to shut down coal fired power generators in the

               Latrobe Valley
              </a>
              and replace them with gas. I am referring to public statements made by members of the coalition front bench.

                It is relevant, Senator Abetz, because you cannot come in here and ask questions about energy security pretending that you care about it when you are so recklessly proposing, without thinking through the energy security issues, a range of taxpayer funded purchases of abatement that even your own frontbench cannot defend and be consistent on. We have had the member for

                 , I ask a supplementary question. Given the serious deficiencies identified in the carbon tax by the ESAA, won't this undermine electricity security, the very threat of which leads to business uncertainty and to job losses? What contingency plan does that do not have to deal with the system reliability concerns in energy with suppliers so as to protect Australian jobs and businesses?

                  The government has established under the clean energy package an energy security fund to mitigate any energy security risks. We have allocated $5½ billion dollars over six years to help the transmission of highly emissions-intensive coal fired electricity generators. We have also committed to run an expression of interest process to close around 2,000 megawatts of highly emissions-intensive coal fired electricity generation capacity before 2020. The provision of assistance to the energy sector is about maintaining energy security and supporting the sector's transformation to a new low-emissions future.

                  , I would make the point if those opposite are seriously concerned about business certainty then they would back the carbon price, because the thing that is preventing or stymieing investment in the energy sector is the uncertainty over pricing carbon. That is what is stymieing certainty in the energy sector, aided and abetted and encouraged by the opposition.

                   I have a further supplementary question,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                    Mr President
                   </a>
                   . Given the minister has only been able to highlight measures that energy suppliers have described as seriously deficient, is the minister concerned about the uncertainty that is being generated by the carbon tax? How is this uncertainty surrounding electricity reliability impacting on business confidence and therefore business investment in the economy at present? Isn't the very threat of Labor's carbon tax plan already casting a dark shadow over the Australian economy?

                    The dark shadow over the Australian economy is caused by the unbelievably reckless talking down of the economy by those opposite. They come in here and talk about uncertainty, after talking up uncertainty and talking down the Australian economy, refusing to provide business with any certainty and even adding to it by saying, 'Oh, you'd better not buy anything; we'll rip the contracts up.' We know those opposite are quite happy to attack the Australian economy in their bid to attack the government, and what that shows is how completely economically reckless they are. And to come in here and talk about certainty and talk about confidence when they have members of their frontbench likening the Australian economy to that of Greece just shows how appallingly economically reckless this coalition is.
