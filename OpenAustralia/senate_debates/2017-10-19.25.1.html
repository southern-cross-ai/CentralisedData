           I think what would be helpful at this stage, Senator Gallagher, is for you to move an amendment to the date amendment that Senator Fifield has dealt with, and then we can deal with your second bill, which is listed at (1).

            Thank you. I move an amendment to Senator Fifield's amendment:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            At the end of the motion, add:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (1) but, in respect of the provisions of the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Amendment Bill 2017, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
             Committee
            </a>
            report by 4 December 2017;
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (2) and, in respect of the provisions of Fair Work Laws Amendment (Proper Use of Worker Benefits) Bill 2017, the provisions be referred immediately to the Education and Employment Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 12 February 2018.
           </p>
           <p>
            The reporting date is the only change to Senator Fifield's amendment. We don't believe that, considering the legislative workload for the rest of the year, it's reasonable to expect, for a bill which we haven't seen, which we have only read about in the paper, that an inquiry and a report be done in essentially the next two weeks. I think it's entirely reasonable for a bill on this matter—on which, I imagine, based on the reports we read in the newspaper, there will be disputed views—to have a reasonable time frame. The reason it is February is more that we don't sit in January. We're not trying to unreasonably delay, but we believe that it is reasonable for the committee to have time to take submissions, to have hearings and to report back to the Senate in an orderly way.

             ask that the dates in relation to the coastal trading amendment bill and the Fair Work laws amendment bill be dealt with separately rather than together? I intend to vote different ways on them.

              Yes. We're just dealing with Fair Work, but thank you for the clarity.
             </p>
             <p>
              The question is that the amendment as moved by Senator Gallagher to amend the reporting date on the Fair Work laws amendment bill be agreed to.
