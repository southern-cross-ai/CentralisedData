           The My Health Record has been in operation for over six years and already has over six million Australians with a health record. The My Health Record system and its expansion is widely supported by Australia's leading clinical and consumer peak organisations as well as state and territory governments. The government sees this reference as an opportunity to outline the benefits of the My Health Record for individuals, health professionals and the health system as a whole. This reference will also provide an opportunity to address any concerns or misconceptions about the My Health Record. As such, the government supports this motion.

              Labor is deeply concerned that the government's bungled rollout of the My Health Record opt-out period has severely undermined the public trust in this important reform. We need an inquiry. The Finance and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Administration_Committee" rel="nofollow">
               Public Administration Committee
              </a>
              was and remains best placed to conduct it. The committee has just finished a lengthy inquiry into digital delivery of public services and has previously reported on the Medicare data breach. However, this motion—and indeed that statement just then—is evidence that the Greens and the Turnbull government are happy to cosy up with each other and do deals in their political interests instead of putting the Australian people and the public interest first. I note that the terms of reference in this motion are identical to those proposed by Labor, and this just shows that the Greens would rather grandstand instead of working on the best policy solution. It is also disappointing that the Minister for Health,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">
               Greg Hunt
              </a>
              , has trivialised this issue, tweeting yesterday that it was just a stunt but now we have this deal. We will, however, support this referral because it is more important than politics.

                 We agree with the Labor Party that this is an inquiry that needs to proceed. There are serious concerns around the rollout of My Health Record. Let's remember that this was, of course, Labor legislation that has now been enacted by the government, but the government has shown itself to be incapable of protecting the privacy of citizens over a range of issues. We were prepared to support Labor's reference, provided it went to the appropriate committee, and the appropriate committee is the Community Affairs References Committee. It has the expertise, the knowledge and the history associated with the rollout of this project. When this was under the jurisdiction of the Labor Party, that's where this issue was discussed. It was discussed in the community affairs committee. The appropriate officials and bureaucrats are within the community affairs jurisdiction. That is the appropriate committee for it to be dealt with. We are pleased that the Labor Party has acknowledged that and will be supporting this reference.
