         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        . In his answer to my question yesterday the minister told the Senate that he knew his six-star board and lodgings at Perisher were being provided free of charge by the former Carr government minister, Mr Eddie Obeid, while he was staying there. That being so, why did the minister wait until this week—some eight years after staying there—to declare Mr Obeid's generous hospitality in his pecuniary interest register?

         thank Senator Abetz for following up on his question from yesterday because it gives me an opportunity to point out what was on the news last night. What was on the news last night was very entertaining if you watched the Channel 10 news.

          Hugh Riminton

         did an article on what Senator Abetz had been asking me about yesterday. What did Mr Riminton says right at the end? He said, 'I have been talking to a senior opposition spokesperson'. And you know what Mr Riminton said they said? 'We know there is nothing in it.' Given up by your own side, Senator Abetz.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am not in business and I do not have shares in a company with Mr Obeid like some people in this chamber, but I am not suggesting that there is anything inappropriate in that. But let me be clear about this: I have complied with all the requirements. I reject absolutely the smear from those who claimed they were starting the year with a positive agenda to sell, claimed that they were going to be on the policies, but you were given up by your own side. Senior frontbencher tells senior journalist, we know there is nothing in it. Feel free to keep firing away the questions, because your own side have given you up, Senator Abetz. We know there is nothing in it.

               No, I think there was about 15 seconds on the clock. You have got 15 seconds. That is the problem with people giving statements at the front of a question. The statement then takes up that time, apart from it being disorderly.

                   , but I accept your suggestion and I invite those opposite to continue wasting the Senate's time.

                    Does the minister now claim that his luxury accommodation at Perisher was a gift from Minister Burke when he knew at the time it came courtesy of Mr Obeid? Why was Minister Burke not mentioned in his declaration and why did Mr Burke not mention this gift to Senator Conroy in his declaration?

                       There is nothing complicated at all other than, as a senior coalition frontbencher told

                        Hugh Riminton
                       </a>
                       last night, there is nothing in it. I have complied with the requirements, as I have said publicly in a statement that I made as well as what I lodged, I was invited by Minister Burke. And that has been said to Hugh Riminton by a senior coalition frontbencher: we know there is nothing in it. So I do not think there is a lot more I can add and I do not want to waste the Senate's time, so I am very comfortable to sit down at this point.
