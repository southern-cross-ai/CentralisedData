        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services, Senator Cormann. On Monday evening this week, Sky News reported that the budget would include a bank levy. The next day, bank shares fell nearly four per cent, wiping $14 billion off their valuations. It was also reported during budget day, the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFR" rel="nofollow">
          AFR
         </a>
        </i>
        reporting details about the bank levy and sources. Can the minister confirm if there was a leak from the Treasury and whether he is investigating any leak?

         I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for that question. Sadly, in the lead-up to any budget, there is a lot of rumour and speculation leading to the budget. That is not a recent phenomenon. That is something that happens in the lead-up to every budget, and so it was in the lead-up to this budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         In answer to the specific question: Treasury—which, of course, takes a whole series of precautions when it comes to protecting the security of information inside the lockup, through measures which are consistent with those measures that have applied for some time under governments of both political persuasions—is not aware of any evidence of a leak out of the lockup. There is no evidence, according to advice that we have received from Treasury, of any leak out of the lockup. But of course there is, sadly, in the lead-up to any budget, a lot of pre-budget speculation, and so it was on this occasion.

           reported, on the afternoon before the lockup, that banking sources were aware of the design of the levy. How were banking sources aware of the design of the scheme? Did Treasury staff, or other government staff, or government MPs or ministerial advisers inform or consult the banks about the design of the scheme before the release of the budget?

              Unfortunate or not, rumours have to start somewhere, Senator Cormann. My next question is: given that there have been leaks, has the government asked ASIC to investigate if there has been any anomalous trading of equities, derivatives or options on the banks in the lead-up to the budget? If not, yet, will you do so?

               The Treasurer actually directly addressed these questions in his
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
                Press Club
               </a>
               address yesterday, when he was asked similar questions from a journalist, and the point the Treasurer made—and I would refer you to those comments—is that, obviously, to investigate something, there has got to be some evidence. Our advice from Treasury is that there is no evidence of a leak out of the lockup. I am not aware of any other leak. But pre-budget rumour and speculation is obviously not something that is in any way unusual.

                My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. When asked on 2GB why he could barely muster a slow clap for the budget on Tuesday night, the former Prime Minister
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
                 Tony Abbott

                said, 'I gave the Treasurer the applause I thought he deserved.' I think,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                 Mr President

                , that that quote is worth repeating: 'I gave the Treasurer the applause I thought he deserved.' If even Tony Abbott thinks that this budget deserves nothing more than a slow clap, what kind of Liberal budget has Prime Minister Turnbull overseen?

                    One day you will go beyond undergraduate-level questions, but I am not holding my breath. As a matter of fact, I can assure you that Mr Howard is a very strong and very enthusiastic supporter of this budget. The view that you have attributed to him, which I note you do not source, is a falsehood.

They see in this budget a charter of fairness—a charter of fairness for access to schools, based on the needs of those schools; a charter of fairness in the health system by guaranteeing Medicare and investing an extra—

                            My question is to the Minister for Finance. The government lifted the debt ceiling to $600 billion in the lead-up to the budget, yet, as Senator Ketter has pointed out, budget papers indicate that total debt across all government agencies is projected to reach $725 billion. Some of the debt that is being incurred in the budget is through equity vehicles similar to

                             I thank Senator Bernardi for that question. The first point I would make is that capital investments are those that generate returns to the government over time, providing benefits for current and future generations. It is a matter of public record that this government is committed to delivering the Western

                             </a>
                             and, of course, we have made relevant announcements in recent times. Given that Sydney Airport was not prepared to take on, on their right of first refusal, the opportunity to develop the other airport, the government has decided to develop that airport with an intention to sell the airport once developed and operational. That is something we have already announced.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             Obviously, in developing the Western Sydney Airport, for example, we are developing an asset that will have a value on our balance sheet. The reason it is treated as equity is that it is assumed to generate returns to the government over time. The specifics in relation to the total equity injections in this budget, including the profile over the forward estimates, are disclosed in table 9 on page 3-36 of Budget Paper No. 1. Also, towards the back of Budget Paper No. 2 you will be able to find the various projects that the government has decided to support with equity injections.

                                 Firstly, I completely reject the assertion that the government is going to have to write off the value of the equity investment in

                                 . Secondly—and I heard Senator Wong say that this is a very good question—there is a very straightforward answer: it is actually not the government that determines whether something is classified as an equity injection or as a grant; it is based on an assessment by the

                                 which is done quite independently. They, of course, assess based on what the expected rate of return is. In relation to whether that is a rate of return sufficient to qualify as an equity injection, in simple terms, it obviously has to be above the rate of inflation.
