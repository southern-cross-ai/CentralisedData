         I thank the Senate. Firstly, I congratulate Senator Brandis and congratulate too, in his absence, Senator Cormann, on being appointed to the leader and deputy leader positions. It is a great honour to hold any position in this parliament but particularly a leadership position. I also congratulate all of those opposite who were promoted in the context of the new ministerial arrangements. On behalf of the opposition, I also acknowledge the service of Senator Abetz, who held a leadership position for many years. Senator Abetz and I are about as far apart politically as we could be, but he has always dealt with me professionally and courteously, and I wish him and his family well.
