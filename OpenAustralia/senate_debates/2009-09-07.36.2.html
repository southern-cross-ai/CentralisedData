         I thank Senator Ronaldson for his question. As the Senate would know, successive Australian governments have required projects funded by the Commonwealth to carry signage for the life of the project or program, identifying project details and funding sources. It has always been the convention that signs relating to government projects do not carry an authorisation message. The Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan signs are used to mark

         program. The signs do carry the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan brand which is applied to all joint programs and information activities and to materials for projects initiated under the plan. The signs and government websites are intended to assist the public.

        <p>
         We have received advice from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Electoral Commission
         </a>
         which suggested that authorisations may be necessary for some signs under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Electoral_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth Electoral Act
         </a>
         , and, in light of the impending Bradfield by-election and out of an abundance of caution, I announced on 3 September that the government will affix authorisations to all signs already in place and ensure future signs are produced with authorisations. Additionally it is necessary for the government to ensure that these signs are not displayed within six metres of the entrance to a polling booth on the day of a federal election or by-election.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have taken on board the advice from the

          AEC

         . When you look at the opposition’s position, I am advised that, under the previous government’s programs, such as Roads to Recovery, around 70,000 recognition signs were erected. Roads to Recovery signs—

Minister, now that Labor has been caught out clearly and deliberately breaching the Electoral Act for cheap political purposes, will the minister give the Senate an undertaking that the government will not erect any further signs and that the 4,000 already in place will be removed within seven days? Will the minister also apologise to the Senate for misrepresenting the position in relation to the Investing in Our Schools Program in which there was no mandatory requirement for signage at all? Will the minister now apologise for indicating otherwise?

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the minister has now admitted that these signs are $3.8 million of political advertising, why hasn’t this campaign been referred to the Auditor-General for evaluation, as is required by the government’s own communication guidelines?

                    The guidelines on campaign advertising apply to advertising information campaigns which involve paid placement of advertisements in the media valued at more than $250,000. The signs in question, it was deemed, do not meet these criteria. The

                    signage was not considered by the interdepartmental committee on communications or by the

                    because the signage was seen as routine advertising for operational activities carried out by a government agency.

                      . Other examples of non-campaign advertising of this type include signage for the

                      on roads and national highway projects. Of course signage similar to those has been dealt with by this government and others.
