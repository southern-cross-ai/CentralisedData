         I thank Senator Smith for his question and for his ongoing commitment to securing Australia's borders. This government is of the opinion that, if we are going to release people into the community who have arrived illegally by boat from very different backgrounds—who do not speak English as a first language, who come from cultures that are fundamentally different to our own, who have no prior exposure to the Australian community at all—it is basically an obligation that we should tell them what is expected of them in terms of Australian community standards. That is why we have introduced a code of behaviour. It provides the framework for the government to address community concerns about the behaviour of illegal maritime arrivals who are in Australia temporarily on bridging visas.
        </p>
        <p>
         The code of behaviour is particularly relevant where
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMA" rel="nofollow">
          IMA
         </a>
         s have engaged in antisocial or violent behaviour that does not result in criminal charges. Common issues reported include: intoxication, fighting between residents at accommodation, sexual harassment, threats of violence, acting aggressively towards departmental or service provider staff, and refusing to cooperate with attempts by the department to resolve a person's immigration status. The code of behaviour sets out clear standards of behaviour and expectations relating to the values that are important to the Australian community. It also makes clear that bridging visa holders are expected to cooperate with the Department of Immigration regarding the resolution of their status.
        </p>
        <p>
         The grant of a bridging visa to an IMA is a privilege not a right. The government has a zero tolerance approach to those who violate the privilege they have been granted in the Australian community. We make no apologies for introducing the code of behaviour.

           As I was saying, the government and the community have a zero tolerance approach to those who violate the privilege they have been granted to live in the Australian community. The code of behaviour itself consists of six dot points, and everything in the code of behaviour should quite frankly be common sense to all of those in this chamber. It includes:

                <p>
                 I think the Australian public are well aware that under the former government in excess of 50,000 people arrived here illegally by boat. The situation under the former government was this: the detention centres in Australia were quite literally overflowing. There was no capacity and no money to open any further detention centres, so the government quite literally dumped approximately 30,000 people into the community and did not process their claims.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We currently have approximately 25,000 people living in the community who are part of the legacy case load of 30,000 people who arrived illegally by boat under the former Labor government. The previous Labor government quite literally dumped people into the community without any care or responsibility. What we assumed on coming into office was a messy problem on a scale which, quite frankly, Australians had not seen before, and we are cleaning it up yet again.
