         Passage
        </a>
        of the Bill is urgently required in the 2019 Spring sittings to give effect to key recommendations from the independent review of the FHA program. The persisting drought conditions make the requirement to change key FHA settings more urgent as many farmers are in great need of support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The independent review found that FHA is not meeting farmers' expectations because of the complexity of the payment and the length of the application process. FHA provides income support to meet basic household needs when farmers are experiencing financial hardship, and to create breathing space while they consider the future of their farm and take actions to improve their circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill seeks to implement key recommendations from the review, to deliver improvements to fanners and their partners who are experiencing hardship and seeking support through the FHA program.

       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of legislation would deliver on commitments made by Commonwealth, state and territory governments. Key stakeholder groups, including the wagering industry and the community sector, are already applying pressure to governments to implement the National Self-Exclusion Register as quickly as possible.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of legislation during the Spring 2019 sitting period is required to enable the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Communications and Media Authority
        </a>
        to engage a third-party provider to develop and implement the National Self-Exclusion Register.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Communications and Media Authority has since advised that these processes are expected to take 12 to 18 months, from the passage of legislation, to complete. This means that the National Self-Exclusion Register is likely to be delayed at least 12 months longer than the initial implementation timeframe.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, there is no self-exclusion system available across all regulated interactive wagering services.

       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill allows special recreational vessels trading to apply for temporary licences under the Coastal Trading (Revitalising Australian Shipping) Act 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed bill should be brought forward as a matter of urgency in order for the legislation to commence before the end of the year. The special recreational vessels industry has advised they are expecting a large number of these vessels to be in the Pacific over the this summer and over the next 18 months for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
