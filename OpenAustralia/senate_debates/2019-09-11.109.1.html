            Committee of Privileges
           </a>
           , noting that the previous committee had been briefed by the Attorney-General's Department on the implementation of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018 to support the consideration of a parliamentary scheme, and that the Attorney-General's Department held several discussions with officials from the Department of the House of Representatives and the Department of Parliamentary Services, including to explore options for a parliamentary scheme to leverage the
