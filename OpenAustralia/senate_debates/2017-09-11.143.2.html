        by leave—I raise the issue of Senator Nash's failure to provide answers to questions asked in question time that she has taken on notice. She has had notice of this. We had questions taken on notice from Senator Cameron, Senator Pratt, Senator Dastyari, Senator Watt and Senator McAllister last week.

         I indicated to the chamber last week that I would be providing answers to questions taken on notice in due course. As is the process, the conclusion of question time is the appropriate time, and I rise to table answers to questions taken on notice and seek leave to have them incorporated in

         Senator Urquhart: Yesterday, the Minister denied that her potential ineligibility as a senator had impacted her decision-making by claiming she was 'very recently with the member for Whitlam announcing $10 million for a road'. Given that the decision to fund this road was made almost 12 months ago, does the minister want to try again? Just name one funding decision made since questions about your eligibility as a senator were revealed.

         Senator Cameron: My question is to the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash. Yesterday the minister begged senators to ask her questions about issues important to the Australian people, including, 'What is the coalition government doing to improve energy affordability?' Can the minister confirm that, under the coalition government, wholesale electricity prices have doubled?

         Response:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         When the Coalition repealed the Carbon Tax, it led to the largest fall on record in electricity prices. A fall in prices of up to 12.5 per cent across Australia according to

        <p class="italic">
         Last time Labor was in office, electricity prices doubled, increasing by 101 per cent.

         Senator Dastyari: I'm going to shock everyone here. My policy question is to the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash. Grant program guidelines for the coalition government's $940 million Community Development Grants Program indicate that only applications 'identified by the Australian government will be considered'. Of the $940 million, Minister, how much has been allocated to projects in the

         Senator O ' Neill: My question is to the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash. I refer to the coalition government's $2.7 million grant through the Community Development Grants Program to Central Coast Group Training Limited for the construction of the North Wyong Skills Training Centre. What cost-benefit analysis or due diligence took place prior to the granting of this $2.7 million of taxpayer money?

         Response:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All projects funded through Community Development Grants program go through a rigorous assessment process by the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This includes a detailed value for money assessment which looks at a wide range of factors, including any risks associated with the project; project benefits; project viability and sustainability; and proponent viability.

         Projects cannot and do not proceed to funding until they have gone through this rigorous assessment process.
