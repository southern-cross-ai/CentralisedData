        I rise today to celebrate an event that has become a cornerstone of our national calendar,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Week" rel="nofollow">
         National Science Week
        </a>
        . This year, from 10 to 18 August, we marked the 28th celebration of this significant event across Australia. First held in 1997, National Science Week has grown into one of our country's largest festivals. It is a time when Australians from all walks of life come together to engage with science, meet with scientists, discuss the hot topics of the day and celebrate the profound cultural, social and economic impact that science has on our society.
       </p>
       <p>
        The significance of National Science Week cannot be overstated. It is a platform that highlights the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        , in our daily lives. A key aim of this week is to ignite a passion for these subjects from an early age and to maintain that enthusiasm through our primary and secondary schooling. Our students are the pipeline of our future scientists, engineers, inventors and innovators. These fields foster curiosity, creativity and critical thinkingâ€”qualities that are crucial as we face the challenges of our time, including climate change, public health crises and the need for technological advances to drive our economy forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the many events that took place during National Science Week, I want to highlight a particularly special festival that happens right in my home state of Tasmania, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Beaker Street
        </a>
        Festival. Founded in 2017, Beaker Street has quickly become a beloved event, not just for Tasmanians but for scientist enthusiasts across the country. What makes Beaker Street so unique is its ability to break down barriers and stigmas surrounding science. It makes science approachable and enjoyable for people of all ages and backgrounds, whether you are a student with a growing interest in science, someone contemplating a career change or simply a curious individual who wants to understand why certain foods grow under ultraviolet light, Beaker Street offers something for everyone. This year's Beaker Street Festival's theme was 'Hobartica', a theme that underscores the importance of Antarctica to Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the standout events at Beaker Street this year was the roving science series. This unique initiative allowed festival-goers to interact with scientists, engineers and even plumbers who have worked in Antarctica. They shared their experiences and insights into what an average day on the frozen continent looks like, from the challenges of conducting research in such a harsh environment to the everyday tasks that keep Antarctic stations running. These personal stories brought science to life in a way that is both engaging and accessible. Another highlight of the festival was the polar plunge, where the bravest among us had the opportunity to experience the much-loved tradition a quick dip in the icy Antarctic waters, right there in Hobart. While I must admit I did not personally take the plunge, I commend those who did for their nerve and enthusiasm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beaker Street Festival is more than just a celebration of science; it is a showcase of the very best of the Australian science sector. It is an example of how we make science engaging and accessible to everyone, and it highlights the importance of ensuring that we continue to support our scientists in the vital work that they do. As we look ahead to the future, it is clear events like National Science Week and Beaker Street Festival will continue to play a crucial role in promoting science education and engagement in Australia. They remind us of the importance of investing in our scientific community and ensure that we provide the resources needed for our scientists to thrive.
       </p>
       <p>
        The success of Beaker Street Festival is a testament to the hard work and dedication of its organisers Dr Margot Adler and her team. They have created a program that not only educates but also inspires. It is events like Beaker Street that help to demystify science and show that it is something that we can all be a part of. By breaking down the barriers between scientists and the public, Beaker Street is helping to foster a culture of curiosity and innovation in Tasmania and beyond. I look forward to seeing what is in store for 2025, and I echo the Beaker Street sign-off of 'See you next August'.
