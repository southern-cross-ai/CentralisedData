        release confirms that the government has not averted the looming supply shortfalls for 2026, and the Gippsland Basin gas wells are rapidly decreasing. Has the government released any new offshore exploration permits since Minister King's press release on 24 August 2022?

         I thank Senator McDonald for her question. The fundamental issue that you raise, of course, is the reliability of gas supplies, particularly as they relate to the east coast of Australia. Of course, what happened was that, when we came to government almost two years ago, we discovered that the inaction of the former government over those previous 10 years had left Australia vulnerable to a shortage of available gas. Of course, what we immediately started to do, particularly under Minister Madeleine King, was to set about to ensure that we had a continued reliable supply of gas.

             The reality is that we were left in the worst of possible positions as a result of the inaction of the former government in dealing with the shortage of supply. Unlike the Greens, who'd like to switch off gas today and leave us with a shortfall, this government is determined that gas will be part of the transition to a renewable future. There's no minister in this government that understands that better than Minister King, and she is working to ensure—

               We saw earlier this month that Seeley International would be axing 125 Australian jobs, after Sorbent also cut 70 jobs in Victoria, thanks to oppressive Labor anti-gas policies and the resulting instability of gas supply. Will you apologise to those workers, who have lost their jobs because of your mismanaged gas policies?

                I thank Senator McDonald for her first supplementary question. It's a sad day when any worker loses their job, and I've had plenty of examples over a great number of years in the union movement of having to deal with people who lose their jobs. There's no worse experience than losing your job. But these circumstances that you're talking about, Senator McDonald, did not occur overnight. Perhaps you didn't hear my answer to your first question, but it was the inaction of the former government in this space that's left us in this situation, and it's a—

                   I don't accept the fundamental proposition of that question. We understand—this government understands—and Minister Madeleine King understands better than anyone just how important the reliability of gas is going to be in the transition to net zero. That's why we've had to implement so many policies to make up for the inaction of the former government. And, let me tell you, Senator McDonald, in Madeleine King we have a safe pair of hands. She understands the issues, she understands why it's so important to make that transition and she is going to be delivering for Australians.
