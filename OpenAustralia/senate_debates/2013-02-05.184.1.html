         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Mr Byrnes was employed as a non-ongoing employee by the Department from 6 March 2012 to
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         9 March 2012.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department does not comment on personal matters concerning current or former employees for privacy and other reasons.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department can confirm Mr Byrnes non-ongoing employment was terminated on
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         9 March 2012 on grounds relating to matters that occurred prior to his employment with the Department, which Mr Byrnes did not disclose until after the commencement of his non-ongoing employment contract.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In ceasing Mr Byrnes employment, the Department met all its obligations under the Fair Work Act 2009.
