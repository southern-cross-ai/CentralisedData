        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Cost-of-living pressures are top of mind for all Australians, especially low-paid workers. I note that since taking office the Albanese Labor government has advocated on behalf of low-paid workers in three consecutive Fair Work Commission annual wage reviews. How does the Albanese Labor government's agenda ease cost-of-living pressures and make sure that Australians are earning more and keeping more of what they earn?

         Thank you, Senator Sheldon, for your question. You are absolutely right that the Albanese government has a strong track record on supporting low-paid Australians. Our government has gone in to bat for workers not once, not twice but three times, putting more money in family pockets. Unlike Mr Dutton, Senator Cash and the coalition, who think that paying workers fairly would mean a return to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages" rel="nofollow">
          Dark Ages
         </a>
         , we see strong and sustainable wages growth as a part of the solution to the cost-of-living challenge and not a part of the problem.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm pleased to say that new data released today by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Bureau of Statistics
         </a>
         shows annual real wages continue to grow under the Albanese Labor government. The Wage Price Index rose 0.8 per cent in the June quarter to be 4.1 per cent higher through the year. Annual real wages also grew 0.3 per cent in the year to the June quarter 2024, meaning wages continue to grow above inflation. Under the Albanese government, annual real wages have been growing now for three consecutive quarters.
        </p>
        <p>
         How does that compare to the coalition government? Under the last government, annual real wages were going backwards by 3.4 per cent. Under those opposite, annual real wages were going backwards; under the Albanese Labor government, they are going forwards. That is a vital part of dealing with cost-of-living challenges, and, if you had your way, people would be having their wages cut as well as having their tax cuts taken off them as well as having their energy bill relief taken off them and every other cost-of-living pressure laid on top of them. It's only because of the actions of the Albanese Labor government that we are getting wages moving again, and that is helping Australians deal with cost-of-living pressures.
        </p>
        <p>
         This return to sustainable wages growth under a Labor government is welcome, but we know that people are still under pressure. That's why we're focused on tackling inflation and delivering responsible cost-of-living relief, including our tax cuts for every taxpayer which have been rolling out since 1 July.

           At the 2022 election, the Albanese Labor government promised to get wages moving. Since then, the government has introduced and implemented reforms to protect and grow the wages of Australian workers. How are the Albanese government's reforms helping Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn while relieving cost-of-living pressures, and why are these reforms so important.

            We all know that workers need successful businesses to stay employed. Likewise, businesses would cease to function without workers. To retain quality staff, do you know what businesses need? They need to ensure their staff are paid appropriately. Because of the reforms the Albanese government has delivered, we are now seeing full-time minimum-wage workers earning an extra $143 per week. Again, if those opposite had their way, those minimum-wage workers would have been getting nothing more to deal with the cost-of-living pressures that they're facing. Under the Labor government, they're getting an extra $143 per week. As we announced last week, we are backing a 15 per cent pay rise for early educators that you still don't support, and that means a typical early childhood education and care educator will receive a pay rise of at least $103 per week, increasing to at least $125 per week from next December. Increasing wages is not only a win for workers; it's also a win for productivity and a win for the economy.

              In the face of cost-of-living pressures, I note that the Liberals and Nationals have not once advocated for low-paid workers at the Fair Work Commission and they voted against the Albanese Labor government's reforms to get wages moving. What are the main barriers to getting wages moving again?

               Hello, there they are right over there—all of them! Look at them all. The main barrier to continuing getting wages moving and dealing with cost-of-living pressures is the scary possibility of a
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">
                Peter Dutton

               prime ministership with Senator Cash in the driver's seat on wages policy. I know this side of the chamber can't bear to think about it, but we also know there are a fair few over there who don't really want to think about that either.
              </p>
              <p>
               Australians, you simply cannot risk Mr Dutton and the coalition dipping their hands in your pocket and cutting your wages. They've already committed to targeted repeals of the legislation we introduced that is contributing to wages growth. They've also committed to cutting pay and conditions for casual workers. They want you to work after hours without getting paid by abolishing the right to disconnect, and today we learned they are developing a specific election policy to strip away workers' rights in the
