        My question is to Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. Can the minister advise the Senate of the Morrison government's plan to prepare for the global challenge of the coronavirus in the aged care sector?

         I thank Senator McLachlan for his question. While we may be faced with responding to a worldwide pandemic, Australia is leading the way in preparedness, including in planning for aged care. The Department of Health's website carries a number of fact sheets on the novel coronavirus named COVID-19 that I would like to table in the chamber today. I'd also like to table a copy of a letter that's been sent to providers by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Medical_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Medical Officer
         </a>
         . COVID-19, as with the influenza virus and other respiratory viruses, particularly affects the elderly. The COVID-19 Plan, agreed to by all governments, is an outline of the measures being undertaken—and now planned—should the risk increase. Under the COVID-19 Plan, Australian governments work to promote the safety and security of people in aged-care settings through infection-control guidelines and safety and quality standards. State and territory governments will establish public health systems that promote the safety and security of people in aged-care settings and support outbreak investigation and management in residential aged-care facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         To support the aged-care sector, we will be shortly hosting briefings and forums to inform the aged-care sector about COVID-19 and assist its preparedness and for the possibility of cases. The COVID-19 Plan will consider what is needed to protect the most vulnerable members of our communities and address the needs of special groups, such as the aged-care sector. Under the COVID-19 Plan, the Australian government works to promote the safety and security of people in aged-care settings through infection-control guidelines and safety and quality standards. We continue to work in consultation with state and territory governments and the community.

            Under the Aged Care Quality Standards, aged-care homes are expected to take steps to prevent, detect and control the spread of infections. Indeed, facilities should already be prepared for other viruses, such as seasonal peaks of influenza virus. Infection control is paramount. Homes are required to have in place an effective infection prevention and control program that is in line with the national guidelines. Aged-care homes should also have established protocols in place to manage any health emergencies that arise, including service-wide infection outbreaks or broader community epidemics such as COVID-19. An aged-care home provider emergency plan would consider first steps if infection is suspected; arrangements to ensure adequate care of the infected individual; protection measures for other residents, visitors and staff; and notification of families, carers and relevant authorities.

               Thank you to Senator McLachlan for the question. Information for families and friends is contained in the fact sheets that I have just tabled. The fact sheets inform residents in aged-care homes, and their families and visitors, how good hand, sneeze and cough hygiene is the best defence against most viruses: washing hands frequently with soap and water before and after eating and toileting, covering coughs and sneezes, disposing of tissues, using alcohol based hand sanitizers, and avoiding contact with others when unwell. It also provides guidance about the travel restrictions initially put in place by the government on 1 February 2020, including the circumstances in which a resident may need to self-isolate in an aged-care home and what it means to be isolated.
