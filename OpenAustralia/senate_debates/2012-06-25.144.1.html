        In this month 20 years ago Australia lost two great figures in our cultural life, two unique contributors to our nation's artistic legacy, two men who died too young, two men who will be remembered not only for their colourful art but also for their colourful lives. June 1992 saw the deaths of

         Arkie Whiteley

        , was born in London in 1964. During the 1960s he studied and worked in Europe, the United States and Fiji. He was at the cutting edge of modern art, experimenting with colour, forms, styles, techniques and genres to create a unique Australian art form.

        When he returned to Australia in the 1970s, he set up the

        <i>
         Alchemy
        </i>
        . This sexually charged multimedia work is an exploration of extreme levels of consciousness. It hangs in the Brett Whiteley Studio in

        By his own admission, it was during the time Whiteley was working on
        <i>
         Alchemy
        </i>
        in the mid-1970s that he began to use 'more serious mind-altering chemicals'. Brett Whiteley died as a result of drug use on 15 June 1992. Like so many brilliant modern artists, part of his imagination and inspiration was drug assisted. Twenty years after his death, I think we can confidently say that the genius of Brett Whiteley—an extraordinarily influential Australian artist—will endure and that his work will be enjoyed and studied by generations of Australians to come.

        Legendary Australian songwriter and entertainer Peter Allen also passed away 20 years ago this month, on 18 June 1992. Peter Allen, 'the boy from Oz', made a unique and indelible mark on the Australian and international music and entertainment scenes in the 1970s, 1980s and, until his death, the early 1990s. His most famous songs, including

          in 1981. He was a musician and entertainer of immense talent. He was a great showman and he was a great ambassador for our country. I much admire Peter Allen's courage as a visible gay identity at a time when this was taboo. But like Brett Whitley he died far too early. Peter Allen's final performance was in Sydney on 26 January 1992—a truly memorable
