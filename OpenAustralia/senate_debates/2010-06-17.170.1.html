        My question is to Senator Wong representing the Minister for Resources and Energy. Is the minister aware of the admission by former mining company executive, former general secretary of the Labor Party and now Parliamentary Secretary for Western and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gray" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , that the great big new tax on mining had created uncertainty in the mining sector, saying, ‘We wouldn’t want to have the current degree of debate and uncertainty in play in August’? Does the minister agree with Parliamentary Secretary Gray and concede that the great big new tax on mining has created uncertainty in the mining industry?

         I thank Senator Macdonald for the question. Mr Gray has made a range of comments over the period of time which are consistent with the fact that he is a strong supporter of the mining sector and a person who understands the need to ensure a sustained economic growth and a sensible tax reform in relation not only to the mining sector but more broadly. It is the case—

           It is the case that we on this side of the chamber believe that this is necessary tax reform. We believe this is tax reform which shares more reasonably the proceeds of the mining boom and provides a profits based rather than volumetric tax, which we believe—consistent with what has been put to the Henry review by many participants—is a more economically efficient tax. Our view is that there is also merit in the other aspects of the tax reforms, which include some of those outlined by Senator Sherry today: a reduction in the company tax rate, a more generous taxation regime in relation to small business, as well as a greater share for working Australians through an increase in superannuation.
          </p>
          <p>
           We do think this is a debate that can be progressed sensibly. We are engaged, as Mr Gray outlined, in sensible consultations with the resources sector. We will continue to do that in a measured and sensible way. We have no doubt that that will not be the approach taken by the opposition, who are determined in relation to any aspect of any policy to run a scare campaign, to run politics—

               I would remind the Senate of the fact that Mr Gray went on in the same interview—which I think the senator is seeking to paraphrase and perhaps misquote—to say, ‘I am absolutely confident that the discussions and the way in which the matters of difficulty are being resolved will allow us to go forward in the right time frame.’ What we do know—

                 I am asked about what would be bad for the Australian economy. Well, Senator Macdonald, what would be bad for the Australian economy is if this government had taken the economic advice of those opposite. That is what would have been bad for the Australian economy, because we know that this nation would have fallen into recession. We know that we would have had a recession—a recession that those opposite were pleased to foist on the Australian people. We would have seen more Australians unemployed. We would have seen more small businesses going to the wall. That is what would have happened to our economy if we had taken the economic advice of those opposite.
