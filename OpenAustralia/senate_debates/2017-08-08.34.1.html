         Barnaby Joyce
        </a>
        , said that allegations of theft and corruption in the Murray-Darling Basin were 'overwhelmingly an issue for

         New South Wales
        </a>
        '. Only four days later, the Prime Minister announced a compliance review by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. Minister, what changed? Or was the Deputy Prime Minister just brought into line by the Prime Minister?

         I thank the senator for his question. I think, at the outset, it is important to assure the Australian people of the coalition government's absolute commitment to the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. Indeed, that has been very obvious for some period of time. We can look back at the National Water Initiative under
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
          John Anderson
         </a>
         . We have seen the Murray-Darling Basin plan come into creation—and I do have to credit the current Prime Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
          Malcolm Turnbull
         </a>
         , for the work he did on the water plan. Interestingly, it has been a difficult period. It has taken 100 years to get this plan into place. There have been times, of course, when we have had to make concessions on both sides, but I do acknowledge that the opposition, the Labor Party, has worked with us from time to time to ensure that we do get good outcomes for the Murray-Darling Basin.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the senator's question, I do not think it is an exclusive thing that one jurisdiction should take responsibility to respond to the allegations that were made. Of course, primarily, the allegations were made in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , so New South Wales is the appropriate jurisdiction to take the lead in the response. But, of course, the Commonwealth is committed to the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. We do have the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, and it was quite appropriate to ensure that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority conducted a review of the compliance regimes which were ordered. I don't see that it is mutually exclusive—that one jurisdiction should take the lead in the response. Indeed, I think everybody out there in the community would want us to respond to those allegations—and I do note that they are allegations. They should be treated as such. We have seen a methodical, sensible response from both New South Wales and the Commonwealth to those allegations.

           Can the minister confirm that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority compliance review announced by the Prime Minister cannot compel witnesses to appear, cannot take evidence under oath, cannot compel the provision of documents and cannot protect whistleblowers?

                I am very happy to take this specific detail on notice for the senator, but I do note—and the senator may not be aware—that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority has significant information-gathering powers under the Water Act, including powers to request information directly related to the implementation of the Basin Plan. This has been a very considered response from the government. I think people out there in the community would think that we are indeed doing what we need to do in response to the allegations at hand.
