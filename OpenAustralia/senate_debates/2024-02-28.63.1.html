        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. Last night the Albanese Labor government delivered on its commitment to give all Australian taxpayers a tax cut from 1 July by passing legislation with unanimous support in this Senate. As a result all taxpayers in my state of Victoria will get a tax cut on 1 July. Can the minister outline what the unanimous vote of this Senate will mean for Australian taxpayers and how the Albanese Labor government's tax cuts will provide tangible relief to struggling households, in addition to the other cost-of-living relief measures delivered by this government?

         On 1 July this year the Albanese Labor government will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer; that's 13.6 million people. Our No. 1 priority is addressing inflation and cost-of-living pressures. We know people are doing it tough, but our tax cuts will deliver a bigger tax cut for

         to help with that cost of living. This builds on our targeted relief while not adding to inflation. Already we have delivered electricity bill relief, which those opposite opposed. We are making medicines cheaper, which, again, those opposite opposed. We are making it easier and cheaper to see a doctor through much-needed investments in Medicare. We are making child care cheaper and expanding paid parental leave. We are building more social and affordable homes and increasing rent assistance. There are our fee-free

           and, yes, Senator Ruston, we have had real wages growth. Of those, 3 million people—we've done that as well. Eighty-six per cent of taxpayers will get a bigger tax cut than they would have got under the plan

               I know you don't want to hear the facts. Despite the challenges facing Australians, the Albanese Labor government has the right economic plan to ease cost-of-living pressures on households, to navigate those challenges we face and to maximise the opportunities for the year ahead. Today's
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
                CPI
               </a>
               results show that we continue to make welcome and encouraging progress in the inflation challenge, and that the government's policies are helping. But it is not 'mission accomplished' because people are still under pressure. The cost of living and the fight against inflation remains our highest priority. But the ABS statistics have shown that our cost-of-living plan is helping to directly reduce inflation across the economy.

Minister, how will Labor's tax cuts plan provide more benefit to Australians facing cost-of-living challenges when compared with the former Morrison government's plan?

                     That's right. When we first announced the revised tax plan, remember that it was going to be rolled back? It was going to be abolished. Remember there was a call for an election over it? 'Let's call an election.' And then what? 'Oh, actually, no, it's okay. We may vote for them.'
