        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to photos published today showing bundles of cash that Indonesian police say were paid to people smugglers by Australian officials to turn back boats. A recorded interview with the captain of the asylum seeker vessel confirming the payment has also been reported. Will the Abbott government confirm or deny these reports?

         The captain of the people smuggler vessel would be a very reliable witness, Senator O'Neill—a very reliable witness indeed! As a matter of fact, Senator O'Neill, if you want to know, there is only one political party under whose watch people smugglers grew rich in Indonesia, and it was under your watch, because under your watch 50,000 people journeyed to Australia, not including those who lost their lives—

                     , I rise on a point of order on relevance. The minister is now repeating the answer exactly, to the word almost, that you have already drawn to his attention is not answering the question. This is now the third attempt from this side of the chamber to ask him to comply with your ruling. So could you please call him to order on a point of relevance and ask him to answer the question?

                                We understand that ministers will speak on tangential matters in the lead-up to answering a question. This minister, serially, has defied your ruling. He has not once even attempted to pretend to answer the question. He might sit there smirking and thinking that this abuse of Senate question time is appropriate, but you, as President, should put a stop to it.

You have asked me to comment on a security matter. I direct you to what your leader, Mr Shorten, said. Of course, Mr Shorten said many things. Mr Shorten once said, '

                                      The minister, in answering the question, straight up said, 'We do not comment on those security matters'. I believe that he answered the question.

                                         My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Minister Brandis. He suggested that the captain of the vessel, Yohanis Humiang, was an unreliable witness. Does he have evidence as to why his testimony is wrong? If so, can he produce it? Can he provide an account of what actually happened, whether bribes were paid, when they were paid and to whom they were paid?

                                          have evidence that the captain of a people smuggler vessel is an unreliable witness? Yes, I do. Do you know what that evidence is? It is because the man is the captain of a people smuggler vessel. The man is a person engaged in earning his living from the misery of other human beings and accepting a very large sum of money from it.

                                           That is my evidence. As Senator Macdonald interjected before, perhaps you should stick to medicine. Because if you do not think that that is pretty compelling evidence that that particular man's assertions and allegations should at least be treated with scepticism then, Senator Di Natale, you must come from another planet.

                                                        , I rise on a further supplementary question: I would like to ask the minister to confirm whether the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection will do as the Senate requested yesterday, and that is to table all the documents relating to this tawdry affair? And I ask whether they will be shared with the Senate and the Australian people, as confirmation of his statement yesterday that everything that was done was within the law?

                                                         Well, it is certainly not the practice of any political party in this country, or at least any governing party, on this side of the chamber or the other, to bring into the Senate and to table documents relating to the national security of Australia. You should know that, as the leader of a political party, Senator Di Natale. But notwithstanding that, I can advise you of some facts you seem to have forgotten: that during the period of the Labor government, as a result of policies you supported, more than 1,100 men, women and children drowned at sea—as a direct result of policies that you supported. But since the Abbott government was elected, not one life has been lost. As a result of the policies you supported, 50,000 people made a mortal passage to Australia, and since the Abbott government has been elected, the boats have been stopped. The boats have been stopped, the smugglers are out of business, and the lives are no longer being lost.
