         I am not able to give the senator an exact answer to that particular question. I do not have a brief which covers Commonwealth funding for the particular hospital he has mentioned. I anticipated that we might have questions on state election issues relating to

           I am trying to be helpful to the senator. I am able to indicate to him that under the healthcare agreement, in which we will deliver $64 billion over five years—an increase of more than $20 billion, or 50 per cent, on the last agreement—Tasmania will receive about $1.33 billion. But, as I indicated—

As the senator understands, the minister for health is in the other chamber. Senator Ludwig normally represents the minister but he is in Queensland inspecting the flood damage.

Many have tried but generally they have been unsuccessful, and I think Senator Barnett has been here long enough to know that. I said to him that I would take the question on notice.

A large amount of this goes to Tasmania—for emergency department funding, elective surgery and many other aspects of health funding—to try and ensure a first-class health system for all Tasmanians.
