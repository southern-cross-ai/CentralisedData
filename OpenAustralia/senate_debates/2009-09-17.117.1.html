        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Arbib. Minister, why did the government remove the requirement for companies tendering for projects under the so-called Nation Building and Jobs Plan to have occupational health and safety accreditation?

        <p>
         That is a very important issue because
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OH" rel="nofollow">
          OH
         </a>
         &amp;S is something that the government is working on across the board and cooperatively with the states. There are national requirements for occupational health and safety and there is accreditation that must be in place. As all senators know, the stimulus package was undertaken in the middle of a global recession. There was a need for urgency to ensure that infrastructure was put in place to support jobs and small business.
        </p>
        <p>
         We received numerous representations from small business at the time saying that under the national OH&amp;S regulations they would be excluded from undertaking work. The Labor Party and the Rudd government has always and will always support small business, and there were changes made to ensure that small businesses were not disadvantaged in the purchasing and tendering arrangements from the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. I am proud of the decision we made to undertake that.
        </p>
        <p>
         Occupational health and safety is still in place under state legislation. It is still in place in each state and each project, but at the same time we have ensured that small businesses, the same small businesses that the coalition would deny work to, the same small businesses that the Liberal Party would be happy to close down by withdrawing the stimulus, are getting support through thousands and thousands of projects. I have told the Senate on numerous occasions that there are 35,000 projects getting under way over the next 14 months. That is what the Rudd government is about.

             I am very surprised that the Liberal Party, who once thought they were the champions of small business and claim to be the champions of small business, would be happy for small businesses not to work on stimulus projects.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
              Mr President
             </a>
             , I can inform Senator Brandis and all senators that we consulted across industry, across the union movement and with all the states and the territories and there were discussions at

             . In the end it was about jobs and it was about small business because we care about small business. Every job we can save in small business has a multiplier effect. Unemployment is such a terrible phenomenon.

              The Liberal Party

             do not care about it and they do not understand that unemployment does not just affect the person who loses their job; it affects their family, it affects their friends, it leads to crime and it leads to social dislocation. That is what unemployment is about. The Liberal Party could not care less. The shadow Treasurer has said, ‘It is not our top priority’—

               I reaffirm, again, that this decision has not compromised safety standards in any way, and I again confirm to the Senate that this decision was taken to ensure that the thousands and thousands of small businesses that operate in this country had access to nation-building projects. I do hope that Liberal Party and National Party senators never come in here and blame us for local tradespeople not being able to get access to work while at the same time criticise us on this change in
