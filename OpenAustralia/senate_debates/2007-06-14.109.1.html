        My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts. I refer the minister to a recent email from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Trujillo" rel="nofollow">
         Sol Trujillo
        </a>
        to Telstra staff, outlining the position of the company on the rollout of fibre to the node. Is the minister aware that Mr Trujillo states that Telstra:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … has a plan in place that reflects negotiations and discussions with the Government that are now complete.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister confirm that the government has completed negotiations with Telstra on the terms of its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTTN" rel="nofollow">
         FTTN
        </a>
        proposal? In light of Mr Trujillo’s email, why should the Australian public believe that the government’s panel of experts on FTTN is anything more than an elaborate rubber stamp for a deal that the minister has already negotiated with Telstra?

           Well, that is just proof positive that Senator Conroy has written his answer before he hears what I have to say, because he just said again that the government had an agreement with Telstra. I repeat: the government has no concluded agreement with Telstra, and I have not been the recipient of any email from Mr Trujillo.

                   waking up to the idea of 24-hour production chains using Australia’s broadband connections.

                   </a>
                   , this time, is the culprit. The Labor Party, of course, are putting up yet another plan, whereas this government has actually been doing the job of rolling out new and innovative broadband services since 2004. And, through funding provided by the Howard government, sectors like health, for example, as Senator Patterson knows, are already using broadband to provide 24/7 support for doctors. Radiographic images transferred using fast broadband connections are already viewed by radiologists both here and overseas. As an example, I recently visited a facility where an Australian company is using Australian qualified radiologists in Israel to support the north coast area health service, ensuring that, for instance, when a patient wakes up, the diagnosis is already waiting and treatment can start without delay.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Through programs including the government’s $113 million Clever Networks program, and the earlier Coordinated Communications Infrastructure Fund, we are already supporting projects which deliver world-class services to Australians, regardless of where they live. Back in 2005, for example, the government funded groundbreaking technology for BreastScreen Victoria, involving the use of a digital access network connected to mobile screening vans in rural and regional Victoria. This innovation has vastly improved services for women, and better utilises scarce radiologist resources by using digital images and broadband, with key funding from the Howard government.

And this is really the important thing: this is just another example of the human dividends made possible by the Howard government’s strong economic management.
