        by leave—My very short statement is really in the form of a question to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I was informed a minute ago that the government had reordered the business of the Senate to delay the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2559" rel="nofollow">
         Migration Amendment (Designated Unauthorised Arrivals) Bill 2006

        and bring on the

         </a>
         ) Amendment Bill 2006
        </a>
        . I concede that it is always the prerogative of the government to change the order of business but, even by this government’s standards, notifying us after the bells had started ringing and with a minute’s notice was extraordinary. It is no wonder Senator Bartlett, like many others in the chamber, is unclear as to what is occurring. The government may well have problems internally with the migration amendment bill, but it seems to me highly unusual and improper for us to be treated so poorly when dealing with important legislation.

        Before I was so rudely interrupted by what I assume was a cunning plan—I do not know what it achieved other than to get a few Liberal senators out of their offices—I was making the point that we were given a minute’s notice that the government had pulled the migration bill and was not prepared to debate it today, or certainly before lunchtime, as had been advertised for a week or so. I do not know what has occurred—whether the government is in disarray or is unwilling to proceed with the bill at all this week. That is obviously for the government to decide.

          It is a statement, actually. I put it to Senator Ellison whether he intends treating the Senate with such contempt and whether he can explain what has happened to the migration bill. Why has it disappeared and why were people who were preparing to speak on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_land_rights" rel="nofollow">
           Aboriginal land rights

          bill not given any warning that it was coming on? Fundamentally, what has happened to the migration bill such that you could only give us one minute’s notice that the bill was not to be debated when Labor and other senators were ready to debate the bill?

           </a>
           is that the government will not be proceeding with it. On that basis it is appropriate that we consider other legislation, which we are doing—that is, the

            ) Amendment Bill 2006
           </a>
           . There was debate on this last week; it is in continuation. I see Senator Scullion is in the chamber. I believe he is in continuation and can continue that debate. The decision was made a very short time ago. In the circumstances, it was appropriate that we dealt with other legislation. I can tell the Senate that the Prime Minister is making an announcement, I think as we speak, in relation to the migration bill. It will not be proceeded with.
