         I thank the honourable senator for his question and acknowledge his very deep commitment to the people of rural and regional Australia. I am pleased to advise the Senate that this government is investing billions of dollars in road, rail, telecommunications, health and education infrastructure and community facilities right across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of our commitment to supporting local communities, particularly in rural and remote Australia, last week I was pleased to announce the successful projects under round 3 of the National Stronger Regions Fund. Under round 3, we are investing $126 million into 67 projects right across the nation—projects ranging from $25,000 up to $10 million that will deliver huge benefits for local communities. The great news is that that $126 million will leverage an extra $336 million in partner funding, meaning that $462 million will be invested as part of round 3. I think this goes to show what can be achieved under a very strong coalition government.
        </p>
        <p>
         What this means for communities right across the country is not only are we improving their quality of life but we are also strengthening their economies. In Dubbo, we are investing $6.6 million to upgrade the Dubbo airport and aeromedical facilities—a tremendous initiative. In Bega, on the south coast of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , we are investing $855,000 to upgrade the community owned aged-care facility, Hillgrove House.

         , in your own state of Tasmania we are investing more than $3.8 million in the

            I am happy to advise the Senate that round three of the National Stronger Regions Fund was very successful, as were rounds one and two of this program. The coalition government's investment in community infrastructure through the Stronger Regions Fund now stands at $632 million for 229 projects: investments like the $8 million into the Waltzing Matilda Centre in Winton and $1.8 million for the

             Margaret River
            </a>
            business events hub. I am very pleased to say that we are investing in coalition as well as non-coalition seats—$10 million for the Fowlers Road to Fairwater Drive road link in the seat of Whitlam, $850,000 for the construction of the Upper Murray events centre in the seat of Indi and $10 million for the construction of the Charleston dam facility in the seat of Kennedy—and these are investments that will change lives in those communities.

               I am very pleased to advise the Senate that the government will now be moving to what we are calling the Building Better Regions Fund from the existing National Stronger Regions Fund. What this will do is better target funding to projects outside of the major capital cities.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are also going to introduce a new stream. The current infrastructure spend, which is so important for our rural communities, will continue. We are also going to introduce a community investment stream. We know that local communities so often understand the best delivery mechanisms to grow their economies and grow their futures. We are also going to assess like-for-like projects so that projects of the same size will be compared and small will not be compared against large—which I am sure you will appreciate, Senator Sterle. We are going to ensure that we continue to deliver those funding dollars that are so important for strengthening these communities.
