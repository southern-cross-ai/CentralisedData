         I overheard a comment from my colleague Senator Milne that we might as well point out the obvious at the outset, which is that this committee is now dealing with a whole raft of amendments and changes to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         legislation and the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Change
         </a>
         and Water is tabling explanations as to what she is doing in the debate. The process is one of guided ignorance. The government and the opposition have been negotiating these amendments over the last couple of days. There is a rush to have the amendments come in to be debated. I am not going to prolong it except to say we are now dealing with billions of dollars of Australians’ money through a deal stitched up between the government and the Turnbull opposition without any airing of that deal with the public. There has been no committee to allow the public or business to feed in to this outcome which is going to divert billions of dollars of their money into the big polluting industries. There has been no committee because the Rudd Labor government and the Turnbull coalition voted that down today.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have never known of a process in here where so much has depended upon the government and opposition getting together and treating the Australian public with utter contempt when it comes to the ability of the Senate to service their interests and take in information from the wider public, including the scientific community which is so important but which has effectively been shut out and had a deaf ear turned to it by this minister, this government and this opposition. There is no point in railing about that because the numbers are in here, and numbers rule in politics. It is the planet that is at stake, and the process here is one that is clearly going on the record but it is one that the government will live to regret and the coalition will live to regret. It is just a pity that the onrush of climate change—and the minister spoke about that in question time today—is only used as a veneer for the government’s failure to act in a proper fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendments we are dealing with here will no doubt go through because the government and the opposition are providing the numbers for it. The debate becomes one in which the outcome is known regardless of the content and the submissions in the debate. The first thing the minister does is table her explanation for what is going on with the debate already underway. It is a signal of what a bereft process it is for anybody who thinks this is, as the opposition itself has described, perhaps the most important legislation to restructure Australia since Federation. The opposition, in league with the government, is treating the Senate and the people of Australia with contempt. At the outset that is a sign of where this committee is going to.
        </p>
        <p>
         I predict there will be no changes here. There is going to be no listening ear from this minister. There will be no listening ear from the numbers that have it in here. There has been no committee. The Australian people, their businesses and the scientists who want to be heard on this issue, and should be, have been effectively locked out by the process. The government and this minister—is it for or failing climate change?—will live to rue the process that is unfolding here in the next couple of days. That is up to her; that is up to the government; that is up to the opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         My colleague Senator Milne, who has had a very large input into the debate on this issue and will continue to do so, has brought forward a series of amendments on behalf of the Greens. We will be speaking to those. We are not going to delay this debate. There is no point in that. But we will be heard; we will put on record the alternative; and we will test the government through the amendments because it is not just a matter of us voting for or against government amendments here. It is a matter for the government and the opposition to vote for or against the amendments that Senator Milne is bringing forward on behalf of the Greens. That is on the record, it will be on the record and it is something that we will be referring to in the future, as climate change continues to grow in the way in which it wreaks havoc on Australia’s environment, its lifestyle, its economy, its employment opportunities, its export income and the hopefulness and happiness which a community which respects future generations truly, through legislating in their interest, has a right to enjoy but which it is being deprived of in large measure by this legislation now before the committee.

              I thought I might just raise that slight technical issue. I would like to make some brief comments. We are keen on this side of the chamber to proceed with the substance. However, there are some things which Senator Brown said which I do not intend to respond to over and over again if they are said over and over again but which I will respond to on this occasion. It is the case that amendments are being moved. It is also the case that the Greens chose not to attend a briefing that I arranged for them with departmental officials which occurred prior to these amendments being publicly announced. They sent a staffer along who was there for 15 minutes and left. They are entitled to do that. If they do not wish to be briefed by the government on the amendments, that is a matter for them. But I make the point that it is difficult to take Senator Brown seriously, coming into this place saying he does not know about or understand the amendments, when the Greens party made so little effort to acquaint themselves with the detail of these amendments at a briefing that the government organised.

                In fact the Senate was not sitting. We made the effort to do that as a matter of courtesy for the Greens,

                 Senator Fielding

                and Senator Xenophon. I simply make that point. As I said, the Greens do not have to attend briefings. That is entirely a matter for them. But it is a little unfair to come into this chamber and say, ‘We haven’t known about these amendments,’ if you do not avail yourselves—

                    Senator Brown says he is annoyed about me not being there. I would not have thought that a left-winger would be so worried about status. I would have thought a left-winger would be keener on content. I had a bit on yesterday, Senator Brown.

                        Senator Brown suggests that he did not want to turn up because I was not there. It is an interesting requirement. I am happy to meet with Senator Brown if that is his request. I was not able to provide the briefing, so we sent a deputy secretary, from memory, of the department and some of my staff to provide that briefing. If Senator Brown does not want to attend, that is fine. But I think it is unreasonable—

                          As I said, I was not of the understanding that it was a requirement of any senator in this place that a detailed briefing on policy required the attendance of the minister or else the person would not attend. I would have thought, if you were interested in content, you might have been interested in attending. Whatever the reason for it, as I said, the Greens are entitled not to attend if they do not wish. But I am not sure that the criticism that they do not know what is in the amendments holds much water.

                          There has been an enormous amount of consultation with the community on this debate. I described earlier today some 13—I think it was 13, but I could be wrong—inquiries that Senate, House or joint committees conducted in relation to climate change matters since we came to government. Let us consider just this legislation alone. It has been in draft form to one Senate committee. It has been again to a Senate committee post the bill being introduced. It was introduced into the parliament in May. It has been before the Senate previously, when the Greens voted against the legislation. It has now come back before the parliament at this point. There have been a green paper, a white paper and substantial consultation in relation to this legislation. It is the case that some final amendments now have been negotiated with the opposition. We hope that the opposition will therefore support the legislation. Without the opposition’s support, this legislation will not become law. It is quite clear that the crossbenchers—the Greens and

                          , which is a rather unusual alliance—and others will vote against this legislation.

                             I want to make some comments very briefly in relation to the matters that were raised. I am grateful for the briefing the government provided through the minister’s chief of staff. Brenton Prosser from my office attended and it was useful to get that information. I think it is fair though to say that there have been a number of significant changes. In relation to these particular amendments I will get guidance from you, Temporary Chairman, as to whether it is appropriate to ask this question. As a result of the changes that have been negotiated with the opposition, has any modelling been done in relation to the impact of those changes on, for instance, electricity price rises and the effectiveness of the scheme in terms of abatement? In other words, to what extent does it change the parameters that the government has already put with its existing modelling? That is my broad question. I suppose it would relate reasonably to this whole issue of extending the time of commencement.

                               The government has not done any additional specific modelling on these amendments. My advice is that the changes proposed do not alter the results of previous modelling, which has been released publicly, in relation to the likely, for example,
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
                                CPI

                               impact including electricity prices. There has been a minor change to anticipating the impact on CPI which was disclosed in the MYEFO, the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which indicated because of an anticipated lower carbon price that there was a minor reduction in the impact of the scheme over the first two years from 1.2 per cent to 1.1 per cent.

                                 Obviously, given MYEFO you will see that the government will continue to monitor its own forecasts about not only this policy but a range of other policies. That is normal government practice. The Treasury modelling which was undertaken last year is, as I have said in this place before, the largest modelling exercise in Australia’s history. We are not proposing to redo that at this stage, but the government will always continue to monitor its own forecasts including in relation to the projected effects of this scheme.

                                   I am advised that the department will undertake an analysis. For example, there are a range of projections associated with the scheme which we will have to ensure continue to be accurate. I have to say that is not a one-off process for these amendments. That is a reasonably regular approach to considerations of, for example, where Australia’s emissions are, what the impact of various policy parameters are and so forth.

                                    To follow Senator Xenophon on that, I note with interest that the government recalculated the subsidy to households as a result of the mid-year economic forecasts but there were no other adjustments in the cash payments available in the scheme. Can the minister explain to me why it was only for households that the financial adjustment was made?
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    While I am on my feet, I want to put on record the facts of the matter in relation to the briefing that the minister just spoke about. The fact is the government has been negotiating with the coalition for many, many weeks. Prior to that the Greens provided the minister with our amendments in full, so she has had them for that period of time. When it became obvious that a deal was to be concluded, I wrote to the minister saying that the Greens would like to have a briefing in confidence before the deal was announced. That did not happen. On the morning in question we received a letter from the minister saying we would get a briefing at 12 o’clock, bearing in mind that the Senate was to sit at 12.30 with the bells ringing at 12.25. My staff rang the minister’s office and asked whether the minister would be there in person or whether she was just sending her staff. We were told that it would be staff. We asked why 12 o’clock when clearly the coalition party room was dealing with the matter at that very moment; therefore the deal should have been made available to other people. We were rudely told that if we wanted to play politics, that would be an end to it.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    The issue is that 12 o’clock was the briefing with the minister’s staff and a departmental adviser. When my staff arrived, the minister’s staff were late. They did not get there until after 10 minutes past 12, and the bells rang at 25 minutes past. So let us not have any nonsense here about how long a time was provided at that particular time to brief us on the entire package of amendments that the government had negotiated over many weeks with the coalition. In the course of this committee debate, we will get to trying to find out—no doubt Senator Xenophon and the Nationals will be quite keen to know—the exact details of the deal, and we will go through it in that time. But I think it is disingenuous to be suggesting that there was some comprehensive briefing arranged.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                    While I am at it, as I provided the minister with my full amendments at least six weeks ago, it was extremely disingenuous—when the minister had our amendments to show that the Greens opposed compensating the energy-intensive trade-exposed industries for their profitability but supported compensating them for their trade exposure—for the minister to say on national television at least twice that the Greens opposed any form of compensation. That is not true. Our amendments were with her. They are still with her. They are before the Senate now and they will demonstrate that that simply was not the case.

                                    I return to my original question as to why the only adjustment was in household compensation and why other cash payment compensation in the scheme does not seem to have changed.

                                     The adjustment to the household package was reflective of the lower than expected carbon price. That change resulted from a change in parameters in relation to MYEFO, and accordingly the dollar compensation which had previously been calculated was obviously calculated in relation to a higher carbon price; I think the change was from $29 to $26 for the first year of a floating price under the scheme. Accordingly, the government agreed that we would adjust the household assistance to reflect the lower than previously expected impact on

                                     The government is maintaining its commitment, and we have made that quite clear publicly. It has maintained its commitment to 120 per cent compensation for the overall costs of the scheme for low income earners and will continue to make a significant contribution to middle-income families. In relation to the other expenditure items under the scheme—I am not sure which ones the senator is referring to—obviously there are a significant number of programs where assistance is provided in the form of permits, so you would not adjust that. You would cost it differently in the sense that a permit cost post MYEFO might be different to the projected cost pre MYEFO, but, for example, for the electricity sector and the emissions-intensive trade-exposed programs, they are provided in the form of permits. So an adjustment to the carbon price projection is not going to affect the number of permits. It may reflect the costed value in terms of the forward projections.

                                       The minister will not be surprised to know that I have a number of questions around the area of agriculture. Obviously there will be some significant potential impacts in that area, and I have received a lot of correspondence and communication from those farmers out in the community who are extremely concerned about the impacts of the potential

While, of course, we are well aware that ‘agriculture’ has been excluded, there will be a number of embedded costs within the emissions trading scheme itself that will impact on those farmers. I firstly ask the minister if she could give me some indication—I will start with a very simple area—of the impact of fuel and of how any increases in fuel prices through the emissions trading scheme will impact on the farming sector.

                                        Prior to the amendments negotiated with the opposition, the government had already announced that, for a transitional period of three years, we would offset the increase in fuel cost as a result of the carbon price for the agriculture and fishing industries. Subsequent to the negotiations with the opposition, the government has agreed to the opposition demand that that fuel credit should be extended to forestry. The assistance in this transitional measure involves the offset, either in excise or in other taxation on fuel, offsetting for three years the increase in fuel costs due to the introduction of the

                                         Minister, you might explain—I think this is what you said—the excise and other taxation arrangements. Firstly, in relation to the excise, could you explain to the Senate how that is going to work given that—as the minister would of course know—current arrangements for farmers are that they pay but that they get a rebate for the excise anyway. If the arrangements are around the excise provision, how will there be a benefit for farmers in that and how will that operate?

                                          Senator, I do not seem to have the Treasury officials here who could answer some of the details of that question, because that obviously is dealt with in one of the other bills, but I will see if I can endeavour to get them here shortly. What I can say to you is that, whatever taxation arrangements are utilised to deliver that, the government has made clear that that offset will apply to the industries I have outlined.

                                           Thank you for the indication that those Treasury officials might be here to answer that. I would say that is a very significant component not only for farmers but across the primary industry sector. It is one that would probably be top of mind for most of our agricultural producers. If the Treasury officials are not able to attend themselves, perhaps some of the other officials might be able to get that information for us in a reasonable time frame. Minister, as part of that answer you also mentioned other taxation measures, apart from the excise, that would apply to the arrangements surrounding fuel. Perhaps you could indicate what they were as well.

                                             As a separate measure entirely, if you would like to answer that at the same time as the Treasury officials give that information, that would be highly appropriate. Given the fact that this is going to be one of the biggest issues, I would have thought that information might have been readily available. Minister, I think you indicated there would be three years for the offset in the fuel cost. Does the Senate take from that that after that three-year period there will be no further assistance in the provision of offsetting that fuel cost for agriculture?

                                              Senator, I might be able to assist you by referring to the white paper released in December 2008 which actually went through this. You may not have had an opportunity to read it. Chapter 17.6.3 goes through the fuel tax adjustment. I can photocopy it and pass it across to you if you would like. It indicates that we will:
                                             </p>
                                             <p class="italic">
                                              … reduce excise and excise-equivalent customs duty (fuel tax) on 1 July 2010—

                                             <p>
                                              this was obviously in place before we deferred the start of the scheme—
                                             </p>

                                              will periodically assess the adequacy of the initial fuel tax cut and adjust fuel taxes accordingly. At the end of the three years, the Government will review this adjustment mechanism.

Any reductions will take effect on 1 February and 1 August each year.

I put that to the minister and thank her for her answer. For those listening, though, just so we can get a very simple answer which perhaps might be helpful to those who really want to understand this, could the minister explain for us in very simple terms if it would be correct to say that after three years there will be no assistance? I understand the minister just mentioned something about a review. I am sorry, that was extremely complicated.

                                                Senator, what I said was that at the end of the three years the government will review this adjustment mechanism. I do not know how much more simple I can make it than that. I can try if you would like.

                                                    I am being civil. Senator, the details of that review have not been finalised or formalised. It is some three years hence. The government is simply saying that we are giving transitional assistance to those sectors because we do understand there is the need to adjust over time and that we would review at the three-year time frame the adjustment mechanism at that point. I am not sure I can really add to that. If you are asking me whether we have set up a committee and determined how it would occur, no, that is not the case. It is obviously a decision government would need to make down the track.

                                                     Thank you, Minister. I do indeed take a very keen interest in all the detail of this. Just because I do not have the same view as you does not mean I do not have an incredibly detailed level of interest in this particular piece of legislation. I do thank you, and we will look forward to getting some responses in terms of the detail. I would say it is probably rather concerning then for the agricultural industry to know that after a three-year period the process for any kind of review to determine whether or not there should be any further assistance is still being determined. I think that would lead to a great deal of nervousness for a lot of our farmers. Perhaps the minister might not be aware of the significant financial component that fuel does indeed make up for the costs that our farmers have on an ongoing basis in terms of running their farming businesses.

What work has the government done to determine what impact, firstly, in general, those increases in electricity prices will have on the profitability of the farming sector?

                                                      Senator, I can provide you with some details, if my adviser could hand me back my brief, of the impact on electricity prices. There have been a range of modelling exercises done which have been in the public arena. I seem to recall you may have even asked me about one of them during question time or at some point.

                                                      can also go back to the fuel tax issue, you are asking me about a review in 2014, given the one-year fixed price and the later start to the scheme. In relation to household electricity prices, the increase in electricity prices which was released from the Treasury modelling I think last year is around $1.50 a week—this is an average increase or the household impact—in the first year of the scheme and about $2.50 a week on average in 2012-13.

                                                       Minister, thank you for that and, given that farmers live in houses, I am sure that will be very useful for them also. In essence, I did not ask you about the farmers’ household prices. I asked you what work the government had done on the impact of the electricity increases on the farming businesses themselves, not the farmers living in their houses. They have a pretty good idea of how much that is going to go up. I am keen to understand what the government has done in determining the impact of electricity prices on the farming businesses, not the households.

In relation to the whole issue of electricity prices, are the modelling assumptions based on other countries coming into the scheme or are they based on Australia having a stand-alone scheme? I am happy to put that on notice. I am just seeking some clarity on the whole issue of electricity prices.

                                                          This is a question that goes to the modelling which was released last year, so my memory might be hazy. My recollection of that modelling is that we did make assumptions for various scenarios, all of which were referenced in the modelling documentation. We made assumptions about the extent of the action taken internationally, including some assumptions about the extent to which each nation—particularly those economies that will have a very significant impact on the global trajectory—had acted. I am not able to detail all of that. That was quite a detailed piece of work that was undertaken and released in October last year. The basis of the assumptions behind the various modelling scenarios in the Treasury modelling did need to extend to the extent of action taken in other nations.

That would be very useful.

My question is: to what extent have there been any changes in modelling assumptions about electricity price rises since that time? I am happy for you to take that on notice or for that to be communicated by the minister’s office.

If Senator Joyce’s question is, since he often talks about them, about China and India, it certainly assumed much later entry into reduction in emissions or, to explain it better, a much later set of actions from developing countries than developed nations. That was already something the government included as part of its assumptions. Obviously the difference between the way in which developed countries like Australia have to undertake action and developing countries such as China and India have to take action will differ. But my recollection is—and, again, this is from October 2008—that the assumptions were of a range of scenarios which included different dates by which different nations might start to restrain and reduce their emissions.

I would make the point that the United States, as I think I read out in question time today, has committed to reduce its emissions—not by as much as some would like but it has made that commitment politically. It is not yet implemented because obviously—a bit like what we have been going through here—there is political debate associated with the way in which that should occur.

I would be very happy, if you would like, to get one of the modelling people to explain it to you because they are interesting people. But your question does not have a yes or no answer because the scenarios had to assume different points at which different nations would act.

You may have been out of the chamber, Senator Joyce, but I had an exchange with Senator Milne in which we discussed why MYEFO had changed the projected carbon price. A range of assumptions by Treasury went into that. Obviously one of the assumptions is the likely international price of carbon, and behind that assumption are a range of assumptions about what the rest of the world is likely to do and about the nature of the global carbon market.

So we have a specific number—29 becoming 26. I am asking you the question: in the modelling that came up with that price, is the United States of America in or out of a carbon trading scheme?

They are either in and it models through to a price, or they are out and it models through to a price. They cannot be in and out at the same time.

You are asking a question about a range of assumptions behind a very complex modelling exercise—all of which were released publicly and in relation to which the government modelled a number of reduction targets. Yes, there were assumptions made about United States action—just as there were assumptions about China’s actions, India’s actions and so forth—because you have to do that in order to get some sense of what the likely carbon price is. It was a highly complex and sophisticated process that was gone through, and it was quite transparent.
                                                                            </p>

The assumption is not what the mechanism is; the assumption is that the nation will take action. And they may do it by other means. In fact my recollection is that there has been some suggestion in domestic politics in the US that the

So, Senator Joyce, if your question is, ‘Did we assume certain nations had a

There were different times assumed for different nations, which is logical—of course what the US does is going to be different to what China does—but we did not assume, and I might be corrected here, any specific policy mechanism to drive that change.

So I could not answer for every single parameter which was assumed, for example, in MYEFO. I can tell you that the MYEFO assumption about the reduced carbon price was made because the Australian dollar was assumed to be at a higher level and therefore, following through, there was an assumption as to a lower Australian dollar carbon price. So I am not sure what your question really goes to—perhaps I am misunderstanding it. Again I say that we did not assume in our modelling any type of policy action, because that is a matter for domestic policy; we assumed, consistent with, I think, what is logical, that you would see action at various times by developed nations and that you would see growth and then decline by developing nations, particularly India and China.

Whilst you could assume that is consistent with normal budget process, assuming that the current exchange rate will continue into the future, on this basis the government is redirecting a total of $5.7 billion out to 2019-20.
                                                                               </p>

There are many reasons why your assumption that these exchange rates are going to continue as they are may in fact not be valid—for example, Australia’s current interest rates are higher than the rest of the world therefore encouraging financial capital inflow and raising the value of our dollar, but as the rest of the world recovers their interest rates could be expected to increase thus reducing demand for the Australian dollar. The demand for our mineral resources might be less than expected, reducing our exports and demand for the Australian dollar. As other currencies strengthen against the US dollar—for example, the euro—that will push up the US dollar permit price, and that is something that is beyond Australia’s control.
                                                                               </p>

                                                                                Therefore what I am asking you, Minister, is: does the government reasonably expect that in the long run interest rates will continue at their current levels? What happens if the Australian dollar and costs to households are higher than anticipated by the government’s agreement with the coalition? What are your contingencies for assisting households if this is the case since you have redirected $5.7 billion out to 2019-20 on the basis of exchange rates? From the way we are looking at it, the assumption that you have made to justify the transfer of money from households to business is that there will be stability in foreign exchange markets. I find that extremely difficult to defend as a contention, so I am really interested to know: what is the contingency if indeed interest rates do not continue at their current level and what happens if the Australian dollar falls and the cost to households is greater?

There is a white paper commitment, which continues to be the government’s commitment, that we would review the adequacy of assistance to households every year—‘in the budget context’ is, I think, the wording used. That commitment is maintained. I have previously outlined the 120 per cent or more of overall cost-of-living increase for low-income earners, and we will provide additional support to middle-income earners. As you would know, Senator Milne, because you do take an interest in this scheme, the revenue obviously reflects the carbon price. So in the scenario that you talk about the government will be able to scale the assistance to the carbon price. That is what we would propose to do.

I just wanted to make sure that was clear. I refer the senator to the MYEFO where the explanation of the parameter change was set out. If the senator does not have a copy, I can provide him with one. That parameter change—assumption is not quite the word to use in these circumstances—was clearly spelt out. I will come back to you, Senator Nash.

I said there was a range of assumptions in the Treasury modelling. The Treasury modelling has been made publicly available. There were different assumptions about when action would be taken. We did not assume any specific policy mechanism to reduce emissions. In other words, we did not make an assumption about whether the US would have a cap-and-trade system or do it by regulation. We made assumptions about when countries would start to take action.

That would suggest that you have to come up with a specific type of action and try to correlate the specific type of action that you presumed the United States would take. Is that the extent to which the United States has taken that action or not? Can you please explain to me how a range of actions from the United States—from no action at all to a 20 per cent reduction; I do not know what your range of actions is—could be all incorporated at exactly the same time to come up with one price?

In fact, there are already mechanisms in place. For example, there are the renewable energy and fuel efficiency policies of various state governments which are seeking—not as much as I am sure many of us would like—to reduce emissions in the United States.
                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                               I again say the assumptions in MYEFO are about the likely carbon price. Obviously, like any budget forecast, they may change. Senator Joyce is an accountant and he knows that budget forecasts may change, and obviously the government would have to ensure the scheme is calibrated when it starts and that the scheme continues to be calibrated against the future projections. That is why we have built in annual reviews, as I said in answer to Senator Milne—in order to ensure that the commitment to compensate and assist Australian families continues to be met.

There are a whole range of baseline assumptions that are made. You cannot make a model out of a range of assumptions. You have to be specific if you want to come to a specific price. Otherwise, you must deliver a range of outcomes and a range of prices. If America are as advanced in the action as you presumed then the demand for permits will be higher. If they are below expectations then the demand for permits will be lower. If there was a presumption in the 2008 modelling that Copenhagen would be successful then the demand for carbon will be higher, the price will be higher and the assumptions about what you will gain on the income side of your budget will be extensively advanced from where it will be if there is not a successful outcome at Copenhagen and you have to purely rely on a domestic set-up.
                                                                                               </p>

The answer that there are a range of assumptions seems to deny us the capacity to hear in this chamber exactly what the assumption was about this point in time. You stated that you are not happy with where the United States is at this point in time in your quote—without verballing you—that you ‘would like them to have been further along’. Is that also the view of the Treasury modelling?

I want to make clear a number of things. The first is that we did not assume in the modelling, nor has Treasury assumed, a specific outcome for Copenhagen. That was one of the assertions you made. That was not assumed.
                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                <p>
                                                                                                 The second is that you seem, Senator Joyce, to be suggesting that the assumptions about carbon prices were wildly inaccurate. I am advised that the current international carbon price is around $22, so I would have thought an assumption that, as at 2012, the carbon price will be in the order of $26 seems reasonably sensible. Senator Joyce seems to be suggesting the current government has pulled some trick or is wildly inaccurate in its assumptions about the carbon price. As I said, it is reasonably close. You would assume that there would be an increase in the carbon price over the next couple of years. It is around $22 currently. If Treasury forecasts change in relation to the carbon price—as they change in relation to a great many factors, as the senator knows—certainly in relation to Australian households the government has built in an annual review in the budget context to ensure we maintain our commitments.

The minister quite rightly says that Treasury modelled, I think, five, 10, 15 and 25 per cent reductions between the Treasury and the Garnaut modelling, which used Treasury’s assumptions and so on. Why did the government refuse to model 40 per cent when it had been shown in the other modelling that there was virtually no difference in cost, or very little difference in cost, between a five per cent reduction and a 25 per cent reduction? Why did the government refuse to ask Treasury to model the 40 per cent reduction when the Greens wrote and asked the government to do so?

I understand the Greens position that they would seek a 40 per cent target—that is well known. That is not the government’s position. The government took the view that a 25 per cent reduction, as the upper end of the likely 2020 target range for consideration, was an appropriate and responsible target. It does, of course, imply a very substantial reduction between 1990 and 2020. My recollection is that that is something in the order of a 48 per cent reduction in the carbon footprint of every Australian over that period, which is a significant reduction. So the government made a decision as to what we regarded as sensible and appropriate targets to model, and that has informed the decisions that were made. We also took the advice in relation to this of Professor Garnaut, who considered that 25 per cent by 2020 was an appropriate target for Australia in the event of an ambitious global agreement.
                                                                                                  </p>

We have to remember that 2020 is one of the milestones on the way to a far deeper reduction in emissions. That is what the world has to do and that is what Australia has to do. The government’s election commitment was to a 60 per cent reduction by 2050, which is obviously very significantly beyond 25 per cent. The Prime Minister made clear—last year, I think—that in the event that we believed a more significant midcentury reduction should become Australia’s target he was prepared to make it so, subject to receiving a mandate for same at a subsequent election.

If the modelling showed there was very little in costs between five and 25 per cent reductions, why would you not have gone out to 40 per cent?

                                                                                                     I have a couple of points. The senator suggests there is not a different economic cost. I just sought advice because I could not recall what the starting carbon price for a 25 per cent reduction was, and the Garnaut model of 25 per cent had a starting carbon price of some $52. So I do not think it is correct to say that the costs are virtually identical. I think that is one of the difficulties in this debate. I respect the Greens having a different policy position on this issue, but I disagree with the assertions that these do not come with different economic costs. The reality is that the transition of our economy—which, as the senator knows, is a highly carbon intensive economy—from one that is highly carbon intensive to one that is low polluting is very substantial economically, and where we differ from the Greens is that we believe that transition has to be dealt with responsibly and effectively. We want to support industry and Australian jobs through that process of transition, so I am a little unclear why the senator says there are virtually identical costs.
                                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                                     Regarding the point about what the rest of the world was asking, I am trying to recall if there is any developed country that has promised that level of ambition. We do face a significant challenge in reducing our emissions precisely because we are such a high per capita emitter. That is not an excuse. We should not use that as an excuse to not act, which is what occurred for too many years under the previous government, but it does demonstrate the scale of the structural change to our economy that we have to achieve in order to reduce our emissions.

That is the point that I am making. The minister still has not explained why she would not have modelled the Bali road map, since that is the road map that was understood and agreed for developed countries.
                                                                                                     </p>

I can inform the minister that Britain has said that it would go with a 34 per cent target. The Norwegians, I think, have an even higher target than that. I will check that in a minute. Scotland has gone for a 42 per cent target. So there are other countries.

There are some commitments which are in the legislation—from memory, the energy sector adjustment scheme permit. The number of permits is in the legislation, so that is clear. From memory, there is also reference in the legislation to the EITEs—emissions-intensive trade-exposed—assistance, which of course will also, in relation to the activity definitions, have how that will be delivered in the regulations. But it is not hypothecated revenue, if that is what the question is.

I think those are the figures she gave to the committee. They indicate that regardless of which you choose there will be a significant growth continuing in the economy when you get to 2020.

                                                                                                               </p>

It was very much publicised at the time. It has always been part of the debate in Australia. If you take the Greens out of the debate, you are left with the leading climate change scientists in Australia, who are always calling for their preference—a 40 per cent reduction by 2020. But the government, deliberately, with forethought and with a great deal of political consideration, not only decided not to model a 40 per cent reduction but to refuse a very clear request from the Greens to have that reasonable and responsible alternative, which would make this country much safer from climate change, modelled. I put it to the committee that the reason for that is the government did not want to face the reality that that modelling would have shown it was a very reasonable and responsible option—economically as well as in every other way.
                                                                                                               </p>

                                                                                                                This government and this minister studiously refused to allow that modelling to occur so that when we were debating this tonight we could not have that alternative debated from a point of public interest let alone Senate common sense. This minister, this Prime Minister and this government deliberately set out to refuse this Senate and this parliament crucial information to be able to evaluate whether the prime call for scientists to make this country safe was within reasonable economic reckoning. It was deliberate and with aforethought. It was a studied effort to stymie the parliament’s and the public’s right to know whether that alternative was a reasonable one. If you just look at the figures that the minister has revealed about the 25 per cent reduction over the five per cent reduction, a simple extrapolation will tell us that the 40 per cent reduction would have allowed the economy to continue to grow and would have made this country much, much safer, and the government did not want the public to know that.
                                                                                                               </p>

It is an abrogation of responsibility not done by mischance, mistake or oversight but a deliberate and studied abrogation of the right of the parliament to be informed. The government made a decision based on its own selfish politics against the wider interests of the Australian people and their right to be informed. Let that be on the record, because it was a disgraceful decision made by the Rudd government not to have an enlightened debate on the alternatives which the best scientific minds in this country said we should be debating here tonight. I cannot go further to express the absolute disgust that should be expressed about that behaviour from the minister, the Prime Minister and the government in cheating this assembly and the people of Australia of their right to have a full and informed debate on a scientifically based option which we should have adequately and equally debated before this chamber tonight.

We do believe that as a government. We also believe that if you set targets you should ensure you achieve them and that means taking action and introducing a scheme that delivers that. We also believe that we have a responsibility as the national government to manage the transition. I do not think the proposition that you can ignore the impact of a higher carbon price on different sectors of the economy or disregard it is a sound one. The reality is a higher carbon price will fall very differently depending on the industries involved. Obviously over time what you do want to do is encourage the economy as a whole to move to a much more low polluting economy; you want to encourage the development of clean energy jobs; you want to encourage much more energy efficient processes and new industries. I think the question here is how you achieve that and how you manage the transition. We do think there is a significant economic difference, particularly on a sectoral basis, between, for example, a starting carbon price of $50, $60 or $70 and a starting carbon price which is lower. I think that is self-evident, and the question is: how do you best manage that transition?

I just make the point that out to 2050 it is obviously a much bigger number. The

They range between minus 5.1 at 2050 to minus 6.7. We agree you can grow your economy. You can continue to grow jobs and reduce emissions. The government absolutely believes that. That is why we reject some of the scaremongering in this debate and we believe that as the nations of the world increasingly move towards those low carbon goods and services the world will increasingly move towards a global carbon constraint. We do want Australia to be able to compete in that world. In addition, we also know the costs of climate change to this nation. That is why we are doing what we are doing.

The modelling for MYEFO assumes minus five for the purposes of budgeting. Obviously, if Australia goes for a more significant reduction at 2020 then those parameters will change. Again I emphasise that the government will adjust household assistance to continue to meet the commitment we made that 120 per cent of low-income households’ overall costs will be met.

My recollection is the Garnaut modelling assumed a much deeper and more liquid international carbon market because it was predicated on an assumption of greater action. I do not want to speak for Professor Garnaut—my recollection might be hazy—but his report looked at different scenarios. The 25 per cent scenario was in the context of an ambitious global agreement where other developed economies were doing more and developing economies were taking action consistent with an environmental objective of atmospheric stabilisation around 450 ppm.

The MYEFO is now predicated on less action and that has an effect on the price. Therefore, the deepness of action, to use a clumsy phrase, correlates to price. Yet we do not seem to be able to get to a clear and decisive statement about what extent of action the current price is actually predicated on. You have now clearly elucidated for the chamber that variations in action produce variations in prices. The range of actions that were predicated in 2008 are obviously different to where the world is now. What is the state of action that we are now at? Is it in line with what was predicated in 2008?

The Garnaut 25 per cent assumed a 450 ppm scenario. Obviously one is a greater level of reduction than the other and has a consequently higher carbon price. The greater the level of reduction, the higher you would anticipate the carbon price to be.

So are you now saying the MYEFO is predicated on 450 parts per million?

You seem to be suggesting, if I have understood you—and I may not have understood you, because I am finding it a little difficult to follow the argument—that somehow the government’s figures are all wrong because we assume that the US will have a cap and trade scheme by 2011 on the dot. That is not how the modelling works. You are talking about action over decades. That is what it will take to start to reduce the growth in global emissions—to get them to peak and then decline—and that is what it will take to stabilise the atmosphere. We did not assume a specific outcome for Copenhagen. We did not assume particular action by the US. This is all in the documents which were released last year. For the purposes of that modelling, we did assume action by developed nations over a period of time. We did assume action over different periods by developing nations consistent with their emissions growing and then declining over time. I do not know how much more I can assist you, because you want a simple answer, a yes-no answer, to a question where there is none.

The premise of one plus one is perfectly right. One plus one gives an answer. It is two. What we seem to have is a question of, ‘What is one plus one?’ and the answer we are getting is, ‘An apple, a pear and Tuesday morning at sunrise.’ It is really quite simple: are we on track? The modelling has to be based on something. It cannot be so nebulous as to not be able to be defined in any way, shape or form, because the whole thing is premised on an aspiration of collecting $70.2 billion in the next six years. That is a pretty precise figure. I am asking a very simple question: is the consistency of your expectations of global action in line with where the modelling was in 2008 or not?

Senator Milne referenced the European Union targets of minus 20 to minus 30. They are coming off a lower level, which I am sure you would know, Senator Milne. I think their Kyoto target was 92 per cent off 1990 so obviously their reduction in percentage point terms from where they are is reasonably comparable to that proposed by Australia—but I digress.

India also has a solar target of 20,000 megawatts by 2020.

Their acting is almost Shakespearean to some extent. The issue is that their acting and our legislation are two different things. I look forward with foreboding to your monitoring of how India and China actually go with their commitments. It will be something to watch someone tearing around about Hubei province or the Punjab to see how they are going with their carbon emissions. It is also going to be fascinating to see what we tell the United States when their depth of action, as you put it, is not quite what we expect when the Waxman-Markey bill finally finds its way, even if it does, out of the

Is there anything in that exemption that would otherwise have been in place in 2011?

We have agreed with the opposition’s demand that agriculture be excluded indefinitely, so our previous policy position, which you have been, I think, quite critical of, is no longer the government’s policy position.

All right, thanks. Minister, thank you very much for supplying those figures from

I think you said that is a percentage of on-farm input costs. What inputs were taken into account in determining those figures?

What I was reading was the electricity impact. You asked me about the electricity price increase. There were also electricity, freight and fuel. I did not read those out because I was asked about electricity. I do not know if it is easier if I simply get someone to copy this and provide it to you, Senator. Would you prefer that I do that?

I read the column dealing with electricity. There is also a column which deals with the cumulative cost of electricity, freight and fuel, and I am offering to read that table out if you would like me to.

I gave you 2011 figures for agriculture. In percentage terms it was: broadacre industries, one per cent; wheat and other crops, 1.3 per cent; mixed livestock-crops, 1.2 per cent; sheep, one per cent; beef, 0.8 per cent; and dairy, one per cent. I should emphasise—I will check this, but this is my recollection—that this assumes no change.

I just make the point that cement has been given assistance under the government’s scheme as an emissions-intensive trade-exposed activity on the basis that the industry do not believe they can pass on the price.

I just want to know when you made that decision, because my recollection is that the government had just been elected at the end of 2007 and that the Bali road map was in December 2007. Developed countries were clearly being asked to reduce their emissions by between 25 and 40 per cent in December 2007. When did the government make the decision not to model beyond 25 per cent? Can we clarify what you said about Professor Garnaut’s role in your decision not to model beyond 25? Are you suggesting that it was his idea not to do that or that the government made the decision that it would not be done, whether by him, Treasury or whoever?

I made the point that Professor Garnaut modelled, chose and put a view about 25 per cent. This is going back to last year now, but my recollection is that he did that by working back from the 450 ppm to considering what was an appropriate share for Australia as at 2020. There were decisions made about what should be modelled over a period of time. There was certainly a discussion about assumptions. There was consultation. My recollection is that it was Treasury which in fact conducted the modelling.
                                                                                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                                                                                         We are just trying to recall when various decisions were made in relation to Professor Garnaut’s decision, Senator. I am sorry, I might have to take on notice the sequence of that. This was last year sometime. Certainly Professor Garnaut looked at the 450 ppm and worked out the 25 per cent. The government made a decision to model five and 15 per cent in addition to that. I think Professor Garnaut might have modelled 10 per cent as well. So it was a five, 10, 15 and 25 per cent modelling which was undertaken. I understand the Green’s position in relation to 40 per cent. I think I have indicated to you the government’s view about a 40 per cent reduction by 2020. I again say I think what we have to look at is not just one milestone but the turning around of the trajectory. Without action on climate change this country’s emissions will go to 120 per cent of our emissions at 2000. So a 15 or a 25 per cent reduction is a very significant reduction of what we would otherwise be doing. That is why the government would like this legislation passed.

Actually, it is interesting, because all the government has said is that the government made a decision that it would not go beyond 25 per cent. I am asking: when did the government make that decision? I would really like to know when that was the case. I would also like to know, if you did not model beyond 25, on what basis you made the decision to not model beyond 25. In the absence of any information, why was 25 it? Was it because you were not looking at the impact on

I really would like to know when. The rest of the world deserves to know why Australia would not model the Bali road map range. I want to know when that decision was made and why it was made.

Senator Milne, I understand you have a different policy position; I respect that. I do have to put on record my objection, every time there is a difference of policy position that the government takes, that you impute it is because of some base political motive. It seems to escape the Greens that fair-minded people might come to a different view because they come to a different view. It is not because we have been corrupted. It is not because we have been got to. It is not because we somehow do not care about the environment. We just have a different view about what the best way forward is. There is no great conspiracy associated with it. We simply do not have the same view as you about what the appropriate policy is. We do not have to personalise this. I just disagree with the policy proposition you are putting. I again say my recollection—and I would like to hedge this because we are talking about things which occurred last year—is that in fact Professor Garnaut looked at what an ambitious global agreement would look like and then considered what Australia’s reasonable share of that would be, and that was the 25 per cent that he included in his report to the government. Then the government did choose to model a range of scenarios other than 25 per cent.

I was making a policy point that the difference in

That was the only point I was making.

That is why I am asking the question: how did you choose 25 if you did not know what 40 was going to cost? That is the point that I am making. I am just trying to understand. As I said earlier, given that with five, 10, 15 and 25 there was not very much difference in the

But we do not have anything. All we have got is that the government made a decision not to model it. In the context of the 25 to 40 per cent Bali road map, it is actually an insult to the rest of the world that we did not model the road map. That is what we came home from Bali with. That was the ask from the developed countries—to make that cut, 25 to 40, and I simply do not understand when the government made the decision to just jettison what the world had asked for in Bali and not model it so that you would not know. It is not that you chose a different figure; it is that there is no basis on which to have chosen it.

The Bali road map referenced the 25 to 40 per cent as one scenario and called on developed countries to put forward mitigation targets and called on developing countries to take, I think, measurable, reportable and verifiable actions. So I think your construction of the international context is perhaps a little skewed, if I could suggest that.
                                                                                                                                                            </p>

That is what we have outlined as one of the conditions of our 25 per cent target and I think is in the legislation from memory. I know the Greens seek 350. The world has already passed 350 ppm. We think 450 or lower is in Australia’s national interest because it gives us a 50 per cent chance of stabilising the increase in warming to two degrees. We know that that is a more reasonable proposition than six or seven degrees. I think there is a policy issue here. It is about how you transition an economy. That is the fundamental difference in views between the government and the Greens. We take the view that a 25 per cent reduction, which is the top end of the government’s target, is ambitious and credible. It is more off our Kyoto target, which is an important indicator, than many if not most other developed country targets. We also take the view that you do not achieve a target by talking about it; you achieve it by getting on with the action that is needed to reduce emissions. That is why we want passage of the legislation.

The decision was made by government not to model the 40 per cent option. In other words, it decided to dismiss a vital option before it had the information about it. It is pretty vital because the minister herself in her presentation said that the 25 per cent would give a 50 per cent chance that the world would go on beyond two degrees of warming, with all the catastrophic consequences of that. She and this government are prepared to take that risk on behalf of the future generations who are going to have to put up with the options. It is playing dice on a huge scale in studied ignorance.

The minister smiles at that, but she has given no explanation for not modelling 40 per cent, except to say the government did not do it. You would expect in a contribution like this she would give reasons for it, but there are none. It is appalling procedure to dismiss such an important scientifically based, safer option for this country and the planet through the expedience of not looking at it, not studying it. It is a dereliction of duty.

The minister can say, ‘That is a Greens option,’ and it certainly is, but more importantly than that it was a Bali option, it was and remains a global scientists option and it was a safe option. That is the important thing about it. It is a very much safer option, according to the minister’s own judgment—and that judgment is based on what the intergovernmental panel itself is saying. To settle for a 50 per cent chance that we would trip into catastrophic climate change and not model an option which would have made us much safer was a complete dereliction of duty. It was a political decision by the government overriding its obligation to look at what was a safer option for this nation.

Various assumptions were made about different groups of economies: for example, international emissions trading gradually expanding, developed economies participating from 2010, developing countries joining over time and global participation by 2025. That is an indication of some broad explanation of the assumptions that Senator Joyce was asking about.

I believe that where a household earns less than $60,000 a year—I imagine that is a gross wage or is it a net wage?—it will receive a 120 per cent rebate on its electricity account. Could you explain the brackets—I believe the first is from zero to $60,000—and whether that is gross wage or net wage? Those electricity users get a 120 per cent rebate. I think the bracket above that is $60,000 to $100,000 and they get a 50 per cent rebate on their electricity bills. I want you to clarify for the chamber how a household income is defined. When we look at a household’s income, and take a typical example of a mum, a dad and perhaps their eldest son working, are those three incomes part of the household income or is it just the parents’ income? Another example might be a family with three children: mum is a part-time worker, dad is working, the eldest son might be an apprentice mechanic and the other two younger children might still be at school. Do you take the gross of the total household income to determine those brackets for the changes in rebates? And is it gross income or net income?

We deliver assistance through the tax and welfare system. It is very important to note that. We deliver through the tax and welfare system through various means. Whether it is low-income tax offset or family tax benefit or other allowances, that is how the assistance will be delivered. That is how it is delivered in the bills before the chamber. Because of that, we utilise the existing definitions of low and middle income which already exist in the social security system. For example, a low-income single person is defined as somebody earning $30,000 or less, which is linked with the minimum wage, whilst the top end of middle income for a couple with children is defined in the advice to me, and I hope this is correct, as $160,000. That is related to the particular threshold in relation to family tax benefit B. So there are a range of different definitions of what would be low and middle income—as there are currently in the social security system, as I am sure the senator would know.

Is that what you are saying comes under the family allowances? Just going on what I had explained to me yesterday by Mr Macfarlane, he was saying that household income would determine those levels of changes. The question I ask is: is it a total of everyone in that household working—for example, if the parents are working and one of the children is working? Is that how it works?

In terms of how we assume it, Treasury models various cameos—various types of households—and looks at what the average overall cost increase would be for a particular household type, and that assumption is used to calculate how much additional assistance should be delivered through the tax and welfare system.

Is the government going to take an argument to the gathering in Copenhagen next month that the storing of carbon in the soil should be acknowledged? Does the government have the goal of realising that carbon can be stored in the soil and that it can be increased? I know it is very good for the soil and I have seen a lot of improved farmland as a result of it. Is your government going to take that argument to Copenhagen so that the conference actually realises soil carbon?

This is a good thing because in the international community we want everyone to play their part and do their fair share. To know what is fair we need to be able to measure it. Accounting rules provide ways and methodologies for measurement of what a tonne of carbon is and therefore what has to occur in order for it to be regarded as being sequestered.

There are some anomalies, and one, which I think you would be aware of, is where there is difficulty in differentiating between the emissions from natural disturbances such as bushfires and emissions from human activity. This is important because a country should not have to account for emissions from disturbances like a bushfire but should be able to account for land management activities that are properly measurable. There are certainly potential benefits in soil carbon and a whole range of other sequestration opportunities. The issue is: can we measure that properly? Can we ensure that we have consistent measurement of that? Australia is absolutely advocating for a better set of rules that reflect our national circumstances, and this includes a more comprehensive and fairer way to look at land sector management.

That was some 90 million tonnes of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Around 200 tonnes per hectare is what the scientists believe is a result of bushfires. You mentioned land management. Surely it would be in the interests of everyone to actually manage that land properly, especially national parks, and to take actions to reduce the fuel levels in preparation for the prevention of severe bushfires?

Surely a serious argument to reduce carbon dioxide emissions around Australia would include those bushfires and looking to take appropriate action to reduce fuel levels. In much of our country—hundreds of thousands of hectares—there is simply a fire bomb waiting to happen because a lot of that land is locked up and left. Hence we face huge amounts of carbon dioxide being put into the atmosphere. Surely this must be a priority for your government.

I know that this is an area of particular concern to you but, as I indicated to you then, the management of national parks is not a federal government responsibility; it is a state government responsibility. In relation to agricultural soils and biosequestration through soil carbon and biochar I would just make the point that, in the absence of those things being included and being capable of being included in the international rules, what we have committed to the opposition is to promote these through the voluntary market. We will implement a national carbon offset standard to provide a market for abatement from sources that are not counted currently under the international rules. They include: agricultural soils; grazing and cropland management, including biosequestration through soil carbon and biochar; and a range of other things which are contained in the offer document, which I think you would have seen.

But, as a matter of logic, you would not anticipate that it would be the same. The benefit of it, I think, is that it does provide a ‘learning through doing’ opportunity. So if we have a range of land management practices and agricultural practices that do have environmental benefits in terms of sequestration and that are not yet ready to be counted because the research and methodology and measurement associated with those is not at a point where it should be then it is a sensible thing to try and develop methodology that enables those to be in the voluntary market so that, through doing that, it makes it easier to make the transition to the internationally agreed framework when that recognises these activities.
                                                                                                                                                                        </p>

                                                                                                                                                                         So I suppose it is a staged process whereby if we can demonstrate that this works well as a voluntary measure and there are sound methodologies then I think that will be good evidence internationally for Australia to continue to advocate for what we regard as more comprehensive and more sensible international accounting rules. But to do that we have to show that this can be done robustly and sensibly, that it can be measured and that people can have confidence that a tonne of carbon sequestered through these activities is in fact a tonne of carbon sequestered.

I think the minister acknowledged there are some countries saying, in terms of the science, that that would be a more desirable target than 450 parts per million in terms of managing the risks inherent in climate change and temperature rises. My question is: in relation to the construct of these particular bills, is the government constrained if the evidence provided down the track indicates that we need to go to 350 parts per million rather than the current target?

                                                                                                                                                                           I think it is important to remember that the time at which stabilisation will be likely to occur will be well after all of us have gone—we are talking about next century, because there is already so much stock in the atmosphere. So I think that, with respect, this is a bit of a false debate—that might be too strong a way of putting it—or perhaps a misleading debate when we talk about targets whilst we are not acting and Australia’s emissions continue to rise. We know that every year we delay we emit more and we lock in more growth in our emissions. That is the policy reality. To get to 350 parts per million you have to go through 450 parts per million first. Let us be clear: to get to 450 parts per million is an enormous challenge for the world. It will require international action and cooperation on a level that probably humanity has not really achieved to date because it will require everybody to be part of it and it will require us fundamentally to change our economies.

Under the provisions of cap setting and gateways we set caps for five years and up to 10 years ahead we will set a range of data—that is, what we call a gateway. We will continue to set caps. Obviously over time if we as an economy and as a nation do far better—and I hope we do; I hope we are much more energy-efficient and much quicker at adapting and changing—then we will have the capacity to go further. But it will take some time.

Those targets will be set after Copenhagen, and we have laid out in the white paper the process by which that will occur. I cannot speak for future governments but I can say that this government, in setting its targets, will consider action around the rest of the world and a whole range of environmental and economic factors.

Can the minister advise whether there was any consideration given to at least looking at the additional costs of modelling a higher figure? Was that considered in the extensive modelling exercise of the government? For instance, was it largely a linear exercise? Was any consideration given at least to what the costs would be of undertaking that further modelling?

There have been an enormous number of different modelling reports commissioned by industry, by Senator Xenophon and by the government through Treasury. They are important but they are not determinative in the sense that government still has to make a decision about what it thinks the right policy outcome is.

I again emphasise that there is a political debate here about whether the target should be 15, 25 or 40. I have made the point that we have to get to 40. We are actually having an argument about whether that should be on the table now, through this legislation, for 2020—Senator Milne says yes—or is that something that Australia would achieve some years later, perhaps around the middle of the next decade. So some time around 2025 you would assume, if we have a linear reduction, you would get to that level of reduction, if you achieve 25 per cent at 2020.

The question is what is the judgment about the appropriate path for the nation, bearing in mind that this is not an easy adjustment. I wish it were. I wish that we had a no-emissions source of energy for baseload tomorrow, but we do not. I wish we were able to work out how we could quickly transition so many emissions intensive industries to being much more efficient. I wish we could simply develop clean energy, low pollution industries quickly, but these things are inherently an economic transition. This is fundamentally a discussion about how we best make the economic transition, because it is the economic transition which will deliver the result for the climate.

The relative price signal will still be there. In other words, people will still face an increase in their energy costs of the amounts I have spoken about. We will offset that for a significant number of Australian families through the tax and welfare system, but the relative price will change. I know white certificates have been discussed, but the most recent consideration by the

Right now, as you know, we do pay the costs of climate change—they are just not visible in the same way. They are not visible in terms of the prices that businesses face. The costs and the economic decisions and investment decisions a business makes do not have the costs of climate change visible. We think it is important to have that, because that is how you actually start to change how your economy operates.

Up until now, as I understand it, one of the reasons why we have opted not to include our land-use sector is that the emissions from our bushfires would be quite significant. You said that Australia is working to have bushfires excluded from our accounts. I would like to know, since the majority of bushfires in Australia are deliberately lit, whether the emissions from bushfires generated by human activity count. Secondly, in relation to land clearing, if you succeed and Australia does not have to account for the emissions from bushfires, does it mean that a person can light a bushfire to clear land in order not to pay a carbon penalty?

I was making reference to the way in which the international accounting rules do not differentiate between human disturbance and natural disturbance. I think not just Australia but a number of countries have said that that is problematic in terms of trying to encourage what Senator Williams talked about, for example—abatement activity in the land management sector or the agricultural sector, subject to appropriate methodologies and measurements being developed. That is the point I was making, and I may not have expressed it clearly.

I would like to know if that is Australia’s position in the negotiations, and I am asking this second question: how do you determine whether a bushfire is a natural disturbance—that is, caused by a lightning strike—as opposed to most of our bushfires, which are deliberately lit? What are you pushing for in the negotiations in relation to that issue? That is an important one. The second thing is: if you succeed in having the emissions from bushfires taken out, wouldn’t that mean that Australia would automatically get a substantial reduction in its emissions from actually doing nothing?

I do not have those officials here, but I think the position is as I articulated—about Australia, amongst a number of other countries, suggesting that the current accounting rules do include both natural disturbance and active, human disturbance, and that does not necessarily lead to the best outcomes.

That is why Australia has opted for the position we have. But I understand that Australia, in the current negotiating process, is trying to change the accounting rules to have natural disturbance excluded from the way that emissions are accounted for in the future. If natural disturbance were excluded then the accounting rules would be changed, if that is what was agreed, and then Australia would opt in. That would mean that bushfires in Australia would not be counted in Australia’s inventory, which means we would automatically get a substantial reduction in our emissions from not actually doing anything. The question I am asking is this: if you want to exclude natural disturbance, as in bushfires, and since most bushfires are deliberately lit, are you pushing in the negotiations to have bushfires taken out and how are you going to account for the different emissions—the emissions from a fire that is deliberately lit, which is not a natural disturbance, and a fire caused by a lightning strike, which is a natural disturbance?

I will come back to this when the relevant amendments come up, so it may be that the minister will have more detailed information then, but when it comes to credits for regrowth on legally cleared land between 1990 and 2008 I ask what the definition of regrowth is and if the minister could say what the difference is between this and the pre-existing situation—in which, presumably, there was no crediting for whatever happened on legally cleared land between 1990 and 2008.

The value of that permit is the value.

We have also included a $40 million green carbon fund to build the resilience of natural ecosystems under threat from climate change.

As Senator Williams has pointed out, the emissions of the Victorian bushfires were more than the emissions of Australia. Either you have bushfires that are actually going to be accounted for or you are not going to include them, in which case the whole thing is a fallacy.

I am advised that through the international negotiations we are seeking to address the problem of exceptional natural disturbances that are not controllable by human management.

So if there is a wild variation or large fluctuation, then obviously you would not want those sorts of exceptional circumstances to be included in the country’s national inventory.

You are saying that we are going to count carbon emissions from that fire, but we are not going to count carbon emissions from that other fire. What someone is going to say is, ‘Well, they were both started by a lightning strike and therefore they are both natural.’ If the carbon emissions of the Victorian bushfires were greater than the total carbon emissions of Australia, this is going to cause a slight problem. What happens if I see a lightning strike that I could have put out, but I let it get away—is that a natural fire or an unnatural fire?

We release these figures—I cannot recall when the last one was, but these are public figures. I am happy to take these questions and I will ask the department to get the official who is the expert in these areas here tomorrow morning because I do not have an official who is an expert in the international accounting rules in the box. I make the point that we have had some three hours of debate, and we have done one amendment. Senator Joyce, I am very happy to have a discussion with you about it for a number of hours, but you have already made it clear that you are going to vote against the bill.

I have said that I do not have the official here. I have given the chamber an assurance that I will ensure he is here tomorrow morning. We can continue this debate about a highly technical issue, talking about lightning strikes and cigarette butts, but I do not think that is going to assist. We on this side of the chamber advocate for consistent and coherent international accounting rules that do encourage appropriate practices. That is what we do. If you want technical detail about bushfires, I have said I will bring the official. I do not have the official here tonight. Senator Joyce or Senator Brown, you can continue to talk about this issue, but I have indicated to the chamber that I will ask the official to come tomorrow morning.

In fact, they are substantially the premise of this legislation, which is what we are discussing.

I find that peculiar in the extreme, seeing it is such a glaringly obvious question. If this thing is going to stack up, you would expect the person to be here—especially when we are in the middle of the bushfire season, for goodness’ sake, and this town that we are sitting in tonight is one that was devastated by a bushfire. It seems an interesting question that should have been able to be answered. It obviously blows an absolutely mammoth hole in the whole carbon accounting process if it is unable to be answered. If you say you are going to leave it out, the whole thing is fallacious. If you say you are going to put it in—boy, haven’t we got a major problem coming our way. I think you should use about $70 billion of your $70.2 billion to invest in the rural bushfire brigade, otherwise we are all going to be broke.

From the assertion you gave with that great rendition of all the countries and the things they are doing, can you please now tell me—for whatever time frame you want—what the current global prediction is for parts per million under the current trajectory of all those countries and all the things they are doing; how they are going and where we are going to be—in five years or 10 years time, I will leave that up to you.

You might make a judgment this week and the level of ambition in international pledges would be different next week or the week after depending on who pledged, and I laid out some of the pledges on the table for you.

It would be somewhat misleading now—and frankly, inaccurate—to try and construct current pledges or current commitments and to work out what that would lead to when we know the whole purpose of Copenhagen is to try and get a clear commitment to global action, and there are a number of countries which have said they will set a target and they will come to Copenhagen with targets. But they have not yet done so.

I am very concerned about the money that is going to be paid to the developing countries for their mitigation actions, and I am told there is a recent UN report that calls for existing climate change funding of $21 billion to be astronomically increased to $500-$600 billion a year. I think you owe it to the Australian public to give us a price on what we are going to pay for asking the developing countries to become part of climate change action. I have asked you this question on a number of occasions and you have ducked it. I think you should be prepared to tell Australia what the cost is to developing countries. We are told it could be up to $600 billion a year. If that is the case, what is Australia’s share of that and how will that be worked out?

Part of the reason for international climate change finance is that it is in our interests to encourage developing countries to take a different path and not follow the path that we have followed which is to become more highly polluting. We want to support low pollution development and low emissions development, and it is in Australia’s interest to do that.

Senator Boswell, I make the point that one of the things that is not yet determined or agreed is what proportion of that is private finance and what proportion is public. For example, I have said publicly on a number of occasions that the scale of the transition that is required is beyond the capacity of governments alone to finance. That is why we need cap-and-trade systems to give private sector the incentive to invest in abatement activities in developing countries. We need the private sector to get that incentive. That is a good thing. These are still matters that will be the subject of discussion and negotiation. I cannot really add to the Prime Minister’s words that Australia obviously wants an agreement, is finalised and would be prepared to put forward its fair share. I again emphasise that the mix of how that would be funded, publicly and privately, is still something that is the subject of negotiation.

Is it a fair share of $100 billion? Is it $1 billion or $10 billion? You will be going to Copenhagen, and I am asking you what offer you are going to put on the table. People are getting very concerned about this. They think they are being taken for a ride on the emissions trading scheme, and that sends them into overdrive. But when they realise that they have to pay someone for else’s climate change they just get absolutely furious, and I do not blame them. If they are going to pick up the tab they should know what they are going to pay. It is their money. It is not your money. It is the public’s money. It is the working families’ money. It is the battlers’ money. It is the businessmen’s money. It is not your money. You should tell the Senate how much money it is going to cost. You can have a guesstimate. Are you telling me that you are going over there with a completely blank page, that you do not know what it is going to cost, that you have not worked out what it is going to cost, that you have no idea what you are going to put on the table or that you do not care what it costs?

You have to take them into your confidence. If you think this is such a great idea you have to get out there and sell it. People are ringing us up and emailing us, and they want to know what the cost is. What can I tell them: ‘It’s going to be your fair share’? What is our fair share? No-one knows what our fair share is. How are you going to calculate our fair share? The people of Australia deserve to know this. They deserve to be able to open their computers tomorrow or the next day and access the information that is provided by the Senate and you as a senator in the executive. I do not think you are being particularly forthcoming about this. You have dodged it for the last three months. I have asked you continually, and you tell me it is a ‘fair share’. Forget about

I agree with Senator Boswell that the Australian people need to know what Australia’s approach is to the issue of equity as part of a global agreement. There are two aspects to what is being negotiated. One is the target that we put on the table in Copenhagen. The other is the finance mechanism: how much Australia is prepared to contribute to the global financing. As you would be aware, Madam Chair, I have an amendment to put into the legislation to ensure we do put in financial support for developing countries. Either way, it is going to be required.

They have said recently that €5 billion to €7 billion will be needed per year over the three years from 2010 to 2012 as fast-start finance. I understand that there was a pre-

As the minister, you obviously either were there or had your officials there. I note that Japan announced at that fast-start finance meeting a figure of $9.2 billion to 2012. So Japan has put that on the table as its fast-start finance.

Are we looking at capacity to pay, a formula for who took early action, a formula on the historic legacy or a formula on population growth? What are the parameters that we are going to be negotiating on to say what our fair share ought to be? I have a very strong view that, if we are not going to cut the mustard in our effort on the target, we will end up quite rightly having to contribute more in terms of the global financing figure. It would be unjust to opt out on both. Senator Boswell is right: people who are following these negotiations want to know what Australia’s position is in putting money on the table for the financing mechanism so that there will be a global deal. Without a fair financing mechanism there will be no global deal.

Australia has not made any formal offer in relation to financing. I have made that clear. When the terms of the international agreement are clear, obviously, any announcement of any funding by Australia would clearly be made public. Senator Boswell, I agree with you—we do not agree on this bill and we do not agree on a lot of things—but, yes, if Australia does make these sorts of policy decisions, the Australian government should explain it, absolutely. But there has been no announcement and no pledge of funding at this stage.

Some countries have made offers, many have not and there is a lot of discussion about the mechanisms and frameworks for that. As I said to you, Senator Boswell, and you have asked me the question in the chamber before, there is also a very live discussion about what proportion of that is public finance and what proportion is private finance and there are different views about that. These continue to be issues that Australia and others will negotiate and consider and it is the case that climate finance is something that needs to be looked at—and why is it? It is because we do need to try and encourage developing nations to take a lower pollution development path. It is actually in our national interest to do that because if you believe, as the government does, that climate change has an effect on this country then we do have an interest in trying to support reductions in emissions elsewhere and/or adaptation.

We also have consistent in fact with Mr Turnbull’s own initiative prior to the last election a $200 million International Forest Carbon Initiative which assists developing countries in reducing emissions from deforestation, which can account for around 18 per cent of global emissions—that is, deforestation and forest degradation. Through that program, Senator Boswell, we are working in Indonesia; we have demonstration activities there. We are working with the Indonesians on how we can help to support them in reducing emissions from deforestation given that is a significant source of emissions. These are partnership arrangements. The sorts of figures that are being discussed are global figures at 2020 and there is no agreement as yet about the proportion of public and private finance or the mechanism.

I think the merit of some of the assistance to date is that there have been some very good projects in the Pacific, for example, and also in Indonesia arising out of Australian assistance just as—as Senator Boswell will know—under both governments Australia provided aid and continues to provide development aid to many developing nations.

If we take the assumption—and there has been much discussion this evening around assumptions and how they relate to this whole process—that at some point this assistance will go forward perhaps the minister might like to inform the chamber, given the current level of Commonwealth debt which is around $115 billion would the minister envisage that we may well potentially in the future be in a situation where we are borrowing money from China to give back to China to enable them to go down this lower pollution development path?

I merely posed the question: given the debt level the country has, is there the potential that we will need to borrow money to be able to assist the developing nations and might China be in the future a country that we would look to borrow money from? That was not a disparaging remark about any country whatsoever; it was merely a straightforward question. Whether the minister says yes or no or has a particularly different answer, it was simply a question: is that a possible course of action?

Following up on the question that I asked before in relation to the financing mechanism, I asked what negotiating parameters Australia was taking to the negotiation in relation to framing what would be a fair burden share. I am aware that capacity to pay, early action, historical legacy and population are four of the parameters some countries are using, and others are using a variety of those and others. I am just asking: in terms of what we are taking to Copenhagen, what are the parameters around which we are going to be negotiating our burden share in relation to a finance mechanism?

I know the European Union, in their proposal, also spoke of categories—I think those that you identified. These are matters still under discussion, and I do not think it would be correct to say that Australia has a rigid view about these issues. We think that ultimately this comes down to getting agreement around what people think is a reasonable way to approach this. I keep emphasising this: we have made no announcement, nor have we put forward any pledges to finance, and we have also said that we need to consider the very important role of private finance. One of the live issues in these discussions, as I have said in response to a question from Senator Boswell, is the mix of private and public funding. I would have to say that that is still a matter under discussion.

Can the minister explain very clearly for the Senate and those people listening at the moment what the global situation will be as a result of those who are undertaking some kind of carbon pollution reduction scheme if no other countries come on board when Australia does?. I just want to be very clear that I am talking not about any countries coming on board in future but about the existing ones. When this scheme does come in, if it gets through the chamber in the manner that is being put forward to the Australian people at the moment, exactly how much will the world’s emissions reduce by? I ask this question because it is one of the key questions that are being asked via my National Party colleagues consistently: exactly how much will the reductions be when Australia goes down this

First, the extent to which Australia’s national emissions are reduced will depend on what the government sets the Australian targets and caps at. We put on the table a range depending on how much the rest of the world is doing. That range is between five and 15 per cent off 2000 levels, or 25 per cent off 2000 levels if the world is doing an ambitious agreement. The extent to which the world acts will be a question of what targets and reductions all nations of the world are prepared to put on the table. That is self evident. So the extent to which a global agreement can achieve a particular environmental outcome will be a question of how much all of us are prepared to put on the table. Unlike the National Party, the government does not believe that simply because Australia produces about 1.5 per cent of global emissions we should just say, ‘It’s not our problem.’ If everybody sits back and says, ‘We’ve got to wait for everyone else to act, not just some,’ we will all still be waiting. That is the reality. It is just simple logic. If we all sit there and say, ‘I’m going to wait till they do it and they do it and they do it,’ everyone will still be waiting. So we take the view that if you believe climate change is real and is bad for Australia then we have to do our part and try to help build a global agreement.
