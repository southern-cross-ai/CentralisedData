        On a day that follows the presentation of what is manifestly one of the most significant of Commonwealth budgets, my question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. Will the minister advise the Senate of the Australian government’s very strong commitment to the protection of our northern border and to enhanced national security?

         That was a very good question from Senator Trood, and one which all Australians are very interested in—the border security of this country. In this budget is a strategy which has been worked on by the Minister for Defence; the Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation, Senator Abetz, who is here today; and me. We are approaching this in a whole-of-government fashion. There will be half a billion dollars going to border protection in the north of this continent. Resourcing will go to Navy for two Huon class minehunters to add to those assets they already have looking out for our borders in the north, and to fisheries for the processing of illegal boats that are apprehended and brought into port to be destroyed. This is aimed at doubling the number of illegal fishing boats that we apprehend and seize, and of course there will be more illegal fishermen to prosecute and process. In Senator Abetz’s area we are also looking at the increasing of penalties to include imprisonment for people found illegally fishing in our waters.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of crucial relevance to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         —and Senator Evans should listen closely as a senator from Western Australia—we are looking at funding to the port of Dampier of $15 million to increase the Customs staff there from around 19 to over 40. That will provide significant resources for the Pilbara and it will back up the two Armidale class patrol boats which will be based in Dampier to assist us in looking after our offshore oil and gas rigs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, in relation to illegal fishing, further north we will increase air time for Coastwatch, which will increase night-time surveillance. We will have money available to charter private and commercial fishing vessels to assist us in towing back illegal boats that we apprehend, and thus give our Navy and Customs boats more time to remain on station. As well as that, Customs will have money to charter and lease a larger vessel to act as a mother boat in extensive operations where we seize and apprehend a number of fishing vessels at one time. Importantly, we will also extend funding to engage local Indigenous communities, much as we have in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         with the ranger program. There will be just under $7 million for that. It will bring in the local community to join with us in the fight against illegal fishing.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a comprehensive strategy in dealing with the protection of our northern borders and illegal fishing. It spells good news for the fight against illegal fishing in the north and north-west of this country. We also have initiatives focused on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef
         </a>
         which involve further funding. This sends a very clear message that we are deadly serious in relation to the protection of our borders to our north. There is also funding to engage the Indonesian authorities even further in relation to this. We acknowledge fully that in any solution we have to have the cooperation of the Indonesian authorities, and we are intent on securing that. It is a very good initiative which spells added security for this country.
