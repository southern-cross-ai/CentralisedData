        My question is to the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash. I had a surreal experience last week, Minister, standing with uncommon allies supporting an independent inquiry into allegations of water theft aired recently on the ABC

        program. I noticed that you, Minister, were photographed in the
        <i>
         Goulburn Post
        </i>
        in 2012 with your allies, former state water minister, Hodgkinson, and current primary industries minister, Blair. Both are key players in the Barwon-Darling affair, and you were photographed at a National Party event.

        claims Mr Blair long knew about the illegal water-pumping allegations against the same Mr

        . Then Mr Blair, last week, lobbied state cabinet and gave himself powers to retrospectively approve water allocated to Mr Harris. Is this the same Peter Harris who donated $5,000 on two occasions in 2011 to the National Party? And if so, does this not strengthen the case for a truly independent inquiry?

            Firstly, in answer to the senator's question relating to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Harris" rel="nofollow">
             Peter Harris
            </a>
            , I would certainly want to check that and not assume that is the same Peter Harris, but I am certainly very happy to do so for the senator. Secondly, it is entirely unsurprising that I was photographed in 2012 with National Party ministers. At the outset, reject any assertion of impropriety by National Party ministers. I would also note around these issues of water that, as recently as June this year, all basin states—including
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            —agreed to the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin plan. Now, I am aware—as I suspect everybody is around this chamber—of the allegations that were raised in the
            <i>
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Corners" rel="nofollow">
              Four Corners

            </i>
            program.
           </p>
           <p>
            Firstly, noncompliance will not be tolerated. Nobody condones theft. People who act illegally should face the full force of the law.
           </p>
           <p>
            I also point out that these are, indeed, allegations. While I note Senator Bernardi's interest in this issue, I don't think we should be driven in our response by reports in
            <i>
             The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" rel="nofollow">
              Daily Telegraph
             </a>
            </i>
            . Therefore, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            government and the Commonwealth have taken very measured and considered steps to respond to these allegations. Firstly, the Commonwealth has instigated a Murray-Darling Basin Authority review of compliance regimes, which we very recently put in place in response to these allegations. I also note that the New South Wales government has instigated an inquiry, headed up by Ken Matthews AO, whom I think everybody in the chamber would respect, not only for his public service but also in his role, under the then Labor government, heading up the National Water Commission. As well, there are three members on that committee who have
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
             ICAC
            </a>
            experience, indicating the depth of response to this issue.

              I thank the minister. The federal water minister nominated Ms Perin Davey to the MDBA and she recently withdrew that nomination as it was alleged she said 'Rebadging leaked departmental material would be fabulous,' in the secret recording aired on
              <i>

              </i>
              . One of the two big cotton farmers accused in the program employs an MDBA regional engagement officer. Does the minister accept these matters diminish confidence that the MDBA can get to the bottom of the water theft allegations?

               I have every confidence, as I know the minister does and I know the entire government does, that the MDBA is entirely competent to get to the bottom of these issues, as well as the other entities that have been put in charge of the response. I'm not here to provide a commentary on the content of that story. I'm here to provide information. In relation to Perin Davey, she is a very well-known player in the water industry. She has had extensive experience in water policy issues over a number of years. It is unsurprising that she was put forward to be part of that group. Indeed, I note that the Queensland Labor government supported that going forward. However, I do note that, in the interests of the Murray-Darling Basin and in the interests of the health of the river, Perin Davey has withdrawn that nomination and asked not to be considered. I think she should be commended for putting the Murray-Darling ahead of any of her own interests.

                 . The announced reviews into the Barwon-Darling water theft allegations all fall under state or federal ministerial direction. Given the minister's own party's significant entanglement in the matter, in the interests of public confidence in the Basin Plan, in the interests of justice and transparency, will the minister explain why the government refuses to back an independent judicial inquiry into the allegations?

                  The government believes that it is neither necessary nor justified to have either a royal commission or a judicial inquiry, which would take around nine to 12 months and cost millions of dollars.

                    Indeed, if those opposite were listening, they would recognise that, in addition to the two issues I outlined earlier—the Murray-Darling Basin Authority and the

I don't think anybody in this chamber would be of the view that the ICAC has the powers absolutely to look into this issue and to determine appropriately the response, with the power to compel the production of documents or other information, the power to compel a public authority or a public official to provide information, the power to enter properties, the power to obtain search warrants and the power to use surveillance devices. The response has been thorough and appropriate.
