         I think all colleagues would agree that Monday was a momentous occasion for Australia, with Minister Robb securing a trifecta of free trade agreements with the signing of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
          FTA
         </a>
         with China. I am sure all colleagues would also agree that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robb" rel="nofollow">
          Andrew Robb
         </a>
         has been a phenomenally successful trade minister, with the Japan,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and now China FTAs.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am pleased to inform the Senate that the government has secured the best ever market access provided to a foreign country by China on services. When it comes to services, as Minister Robb has said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This is the best ever deal China has done by a country mile.
        </p>
        <p>
         The FTA has secured the best ever commitment with China agreeing to permit the establishment of wholly Australian owned hospitals and aged-care services in China. This does represent an unprecedented opportunity for Australian health services and aged-care providers to access China's vast and growing market.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese" rel="nofollow">
          The Chinese
         </a>
         population, like our own, is ageing and China will soon need to significantly increase its aged-care services to ensure that older citizens can enjoy a high quality of life.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opportunities presented to Australian aged-care providers as a result of this agreement are completely unprecedented. Is it truly is a once-in-a-generation chance for aged-care providers to enter a new market that will be experiencing significant growth in demand over the coming years and the coming decades. It is almost impossible, I think, to overstate the significance of the opportunities this FTA has heralded for Australian aged-care services. Again, I think we should at a time like this put partisanship aside, give credit where credit is due and acknowledge the incredible work and results that Andrew Robb has secured.

           As I said, Minister Robb has secured a best ever commitment from China for Australian services, including aged care, to operate in their domestic market. Australian aged care is, we all know, world class. We have a world leader in the Australian aged-care industry. Countries such as China, Japan, Vietnam and Sweden have previously sought our advice and expertise on aged care. This is a truly brilliant opportunity to export Australia's world-leading, quality aged-care services and expertise to China and to bring quality care to older people living in China. It will greatly expand the private health and aged-care sectors' wide offering of services throughout the region, and it will reinforce Australia's position as a world leader in health and aged care.

             On 1 July this year you would be aware of some changes that came into effect around how aged care is funded in Australia. As I outlined in a speech to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEDA" rel="nofollow">
              CEDA
             </a>
             last week, there is still unfinished business. In particular, there is more red tape to get rid off and there is more to do to move closer to a consumer-directed care model. But the 1 July changes are having an impact as private dollars are converging in the aged-care market, leading one stockbroking firm to state that there is a veritable 'smorgasbord of opportunities in Australia's domestic aged-care market'. The chair of Estia Health and former Ramsay
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
              CEO
             </a>
             , Pat Grier, has compared the aged-care sector now to where the private hospital sector was 20 years ago as 'on the brink of a new era filled with possibilities and new business opportunities and challenges'.
            </p>
            <p>
             Add to this the opportunities presented to Australian aged-care providers through the opening up of China through the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
              FTA
             </a>
             , and it is indeed a great time to be in the sector.
