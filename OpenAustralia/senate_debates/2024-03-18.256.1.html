         The speech read as followsâ€”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today I am proud to introduce the biggest government crackdown on tax adviser misconduct in Australian history.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government is appalled by the outrageous behaviour by PwC, and the allegations about other firms in the consultancy sector more broadly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through the misuse of confidential government information, large multinational organisations had a head start on how to sidestep Australia's tax laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A headstart that put $180 million a year at risk.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Tax Practitioners Board's investigation exposed a tax advisory firm that betrayed trust for personal gain, rather than ensuring tax was fairly paid in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This government has a clear agenda on multinational tax.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        New laws, currently before the parliament, will tighten multinational tax loopholes, increase transparency and ensure multinationals pay their fair share of tax in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We cannot let tax advisor misconduct undo that work, or undermine that agenda.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The PwC scandal exposed severe shortcomings in Australia's regulatory frameworks, and that undermines community confidence in our tax system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It showed that it is not only the multinational companies, but also their tax advisers, that need to be held accountable for their actions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill will crack down on tax practitioner misconduct and rebuild public confidence in the systems and structures that keep our tax system and capital markets strong.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 1 will expand tax promoter penalty laws to ensure that promoters of tax exploitation schemes face significant consequences for their actions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Penalties will be extended to significant global entities, to ensure that both corporate entities, and non-corporate entities like partnerships, are captured.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The maximum penalties for these entities will be increased 100 fold from $7.8 million, to as much as $780 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will also make it easier for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        to apply the promoter penalty laws, by broadening the scope of important definitions and providing an additional two years for the tax office to gather information and evidence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The message from government is clear: do not promote schemes that sidestep our tax laws. You will be caught, and you will be punished.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 is about whistleblower protection. It extends existing tax protections to whistleblowers who disclose information to the Tax Practitioners Board.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Those who become aware of misconduct within the tax agent profession should be protected when they bring that information to the appropriate regulator, without fear of recriminations or punishment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure responds to a key recommendation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Review" rel="nofollow">
         Independent Review
        </a>
        into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPB" rel="nofollow">
         TPB
        </a>
        and the Tax Agent Services Act 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It protects tax whistleblowers from detrimental conduct, such as termination or litigation, in response to a disclosure. And if detriment is suffered, it will allow whistleblowers to seek compensation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 3 will allow the Tax Practitioners Board to publish more details of its investigations and decisions publicly, and will require them to keep those details published for five years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The schedule will also increase the investigation timeframe from six months to two years, enabling the Tax Practitioners Board to investigate a wider scope of issues raised by a potential breach.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 4 will remove limitations on information sharing that were a barrier to regulators acting in response to PwC's breach of confidence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We know that it took too long for the government to be advised of PwC's actions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On that occasion, the misconduct first occurred in 2014, and was discovered by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        in 2017, but it was not until December 2022 that the government was made aware. This isn't acceptable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures in Schedule 4 will enable our tax regulators to share protected information with Treasury about confidentiality breaches by those engaging with the Commonwealth. Treasury can then take necessary action to properly and quickly respond to the breach, including by disclosing information to other agencies and certain ministers, in order to deliver an appropriate response.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Taxation Office and Tax Practitioners Board will also be able to share protected information with prescribed professional disciplinary bodies where they suspect actions may constitute a breach of the relevant professional codes or standards.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will ensure all professionals, no matter the framework they are regulated under, will be able to be held to account.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These four schedules reflect the government's decisive next step in better regulating tax practitioners, and strengthening accountability within the tax system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They are not our first step, nor will they be our last.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further areas of reform have been foreshadowed. These will follow reviews which have been separately announced, and these will deliver options to government progressively over the next two years. We will soon commence consultation on the first of which, stronger sanction powers for the Tax Practitioners Board.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Together, our immediate and longer-term measures will drive good behaviour, deter misconduct, and strengthen the resilience of our regulatory frameworks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill also delivers on the Albanese Government's 2023-24 Budget commitment to implement a cap on the use of deductions under the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax. This is the first element of the government's response to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Gas Transfer Pricing Review.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 5 will limit the proportion of Petroleum Resource Rent Tax assessable income that can be offset by deductions to 90 per cent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes will mean that the offshore liquefied natural gas industry pays more tax sooner, contributing to an expected increase in tax receipts of $2.4 billion over the forward estimates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the current law, most
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
         LNG
        </a>
        projects are not expected to pay any significant PRRT until the 2030s. These reforms address this issue. These sensible changes will deliver a fairer return to the Australian people from the resources they own, provide certainty to industry and investors to allow the sufficient supply of domestic gas, and ensure that Australia remains a reliable trade and investment partner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consultation on further measures to deliver on the government's Petroleum Resource Rent Tax reforms will follow introduction of this bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Full details of the bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.
