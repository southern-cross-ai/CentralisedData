        My question is to Senator Minchin. I ask: why on earth did this grim Howard government contrive to turn sunny Sydney into ‘sad city’ while the world watched on over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">

        Empty streets with concrete barriers, high fences and riot squad officers, snipers in buildings and helicopters. We just got out of control ... we just didn’t get the balance right between the imagery and security. It was not the image we should send to the world and I can understand completely why those from the tourism industry, who had thousands of rooms given back and who had no customers for the period in the city ... that there would be a concern today.
       </p>
       <p>
        What was the cost to the tourism industry of the excess above necessary security? I ask the minister: what gong will this government give to

There was a view that it might be nice if it could be held in Canberra, and there was some logic to that, but that was deemed not possible because there was simply not the commercial accommodation available for it to be held in Canberra. Therefore, it was decided, in cooperation with the—

           Yes, Adelaide might have been a good venue—I agree, Senator. It would have been lovely to have had it in Adelaide, but it was deemed that it would be a good idea to have it in Sydney because Sydney—and I speak as someone brought up in Sydney—is, I would have to say, our most beautiful city. It was an opportunity to showcase that great city to the world, with great respect to my Melbourne friends—

             the whole world has seen what a fabulous city Sydney is. I dare say that the tourism industry, having reaped a harvest from the Sydney Olympics, will now reap a harvest of tourism dollars from the fact that Sydney has received such extraordinary advertising—and I dare say, now that you have mentioned it, that

             I think Senator Brown should acknowledge the great opportunity that APEC provided for Australia. It is a great pity that meetings of this kind involving some 21 world leaders, leaders of three or four of the biggest countries on earth, the biggest economies on earth—such as China and Russia—regrettably have to be surrounded by inordinate security. I can say, as Minister for Finance and Administration, that I hate having to pay those bills. But the fact is that all these leaders are under threat. We do live in a much more dangerous world than any of us would like. There is terrorism abroad. All of these leaders face threats in their everyday lives. It is sad that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_President" rel="nofollow">
              United States President
             </a>
             , on the advice of his security delegation, has to get into a convoy to go 200 metres—that he cannot walk. That is a great pity, but I am afraid that that is the sort of world we live in and therefore inordinate security, regrettably, is required for these leaders to gather. But woe betide the world where leaders of this kind cannot meet together.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is fabulous that leaders of these major nations, representing the APEC economies, can meet together in the great city of Sydney in the great country of Australia and discuss the very significant issues that face our region, from climate change to free trade, to security, to developing our economies, to increasing the prosperity of the peoples of the Asia-Pacific region. So I congratulate both the Prime Minister and the Premier of
