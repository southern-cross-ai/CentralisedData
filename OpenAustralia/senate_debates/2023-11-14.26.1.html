        Over the last few months, we've tried to do the right thing by the government over here. We tried to split a bill which is terribly contentious, leaving all the contentious parts off to one side and having all the parts where we know we've got the numbers and that are not contentious. They include that first responders suffering

        are recognised without fighting and that domestic violence victims are not being discriminated against in the workplace. We've tried to bring silica into line with asbestos and we're making sure that workers are getting redundancy payments.

        For our efforts to do that, this is what's happened in the last week and a half. This is what I want to show you about bullying in this place. Last week, I asked for a pair so I could go see some veterans last Friday. I gave you a week's notice. On the Friday morning, because I was out there, going for the cause for these people, because we wanted to split the bill and do the right thing, you said no. Yesterday, I asked so I could go and spend an hour last night with some veterans who are town and who are sick. You told me, no, I couldn't be paired. What you are doing Friday to Senator Tyrrell, just so you know—Senator Tyrrell would like to be paired Friday. Do you know why? Because her only niece, her sister's daughter, is walking out of police training and becoming a copper in Tasmania. But you know what you're doing? You're bastardising Senator Tyrrell. This is what you are doing. You won't give her a pair, because we don't agree with the legislation that you are putting through. You know what? That is bastardising or, as we like to call it when there is a relationship going on—

          With all due respect, it's called bastardisation in the military. It is bastardising.

              I withdraw. Let's say you're bullying because that's what you're doing: you are bullying. After the Kate Jenkins report, this is how you present it. It's okay to do this sort of stuff to workers. It's coercive power. That is what you're using on Senator Tyrrell, and it's absolutely disgraceful. You should be disgusted with yourselves.
