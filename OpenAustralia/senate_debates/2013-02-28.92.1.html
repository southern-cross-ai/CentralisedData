        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. Given Minister Butler's comments that he would not stay at Rooty Hill
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        residents, who are more worried about their own credit position as they juggle their increasing bills and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
         AAA

           NBN
          </a>
          is rolling out, we are supporting thousands of local families with the schoolkids bonus and we are delivering record investment in infrastructure. That is what the Gillard Labor government is doing for Western Sydney. And, as some have already commented, we know where Western Sydney is, unlike some members of the opposition who think it is in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia

          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Last time the coalition won government, in 1996, the first thing that new government did was slash $2 billion off the roads budget and fail to fund infrastructure. That is the track record of those opposite: slashed $2 billion from infrastructure. I know that Mr Abbott voted against the economic stimulus plan, he voted against the funding of major public infrastructure works such as the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Rail_Link" rel="nofollow">
           Regional Rail Link
          </a>
          and he voted against the NBN. A whole range of infrastructure projects in Western Sydney—and those opposite, with Mr Abbott, voted against them. So we know what will happen if Mr Abbott becomes the Prime Minister of this country. We know he will cut investment. We know he will slash and burn. We know that that is the form.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Leader of the Opposition shifts the goalposts every time he talks about the WestConnex project. First, he promised funding was unconditional. Now, apparently, it comes with strings attached. The government has committed $25 million to assist the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales

          government with detailed planning on the project as well as to develop a business case and identify a process—

           rather than commute from Kirribilli against the traffic—even with green lights all the way—show that she has no idea and no interest in the infrastructure problems facing Western Sydney and that this visit is nothing but a desperate and cynical tactic?

The PM has spent a lot of time in Sydney over the last year, and anyone who has spent time in Sydney understands the pressures of the commute. So those opposite should just continue to advocate slashing and burning jobs and investment in Western Sydney, because the Liberal Party cuts in

                know is that Mr Abbott will slash and burn health jobs, education, nurses and teachers. The people of Western Sydney know because this is what Mr Abbott has said in respect of the state cuts:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                … I think it’s important that the state premiers do the job they were elected to do and that was to put their fiscal house in order and I respect the job that they’re doing.
               </p>
               <p>
                How much respect are the people of Western Sydney going to get when those opposite start slashing and burning to cut a $70 billion black hole? They will be faced with the same arrogance and indifference—

                 Just resume your seat, Senator Conroy. I will remind senators once again: it is a reflection on yourselves; the interjections are completely disorderly during question time, on both sides. I remind both sides that the questioner is entitled to be heard in silence, as is the minister responding.
