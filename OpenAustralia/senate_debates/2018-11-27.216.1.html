        As I rise to give my adjournment speech in the Senate tonight, hundreds—possibly thousands—of Tasmanians will be gathering on the lawn of Tasmania's parliament to celebrate the Tarkine in the north-west of Tasmania, one of the world's last wild, fully accessible wilderness areas. The rally will be celebrating a petition—the biggest petition on environmental matters in this country's history, with 252,000 signatures from around Australia and indeed internationally. This petition has been pushed by both the Bob Brown Foundation and international clothing company Patagonia.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many reasons that we want the Tarkine protected under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage
        </a>
        protection. One of those reasons came to parliament today in the form of a tourism forum that visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and walked the corridors of power to talk to decision-makers about the need for $20 million in federal funding for a trans-Tarkine track. This was a group of 15 small businesses—15 passionate tourism operators. I certainly enjoyed spending my time today with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Irons" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Irons
        </a>
        , the owner of Bonorong Wildlife Sanctuary, one of the key attractions in the south of our state. Greg is also one of the operators of Tarkine Trails, an ongoing business, and has been walking the Tarkine for over a decade. And Greg and his wife and his team do wildlife rescue. He was telling me today that they have saved nearly 8,000 animals this year. A record number of injured animals have been brought to the wildlife sanctuary. Greg's up here today working with 15 tourism operators to get the ear of federal politicians for $20 million of federal funding for what will be one of the world's great walking experiences—a 10-day track that will cover the Tarkine. It is a large area, and the track can be broken up into two separate walks of five days each, with camps set up for walkers. We believe that it will rival the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overland_Track" rel="nofollow">
         Overland Track
        </a>
        , which is one of the world's great walks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, although the Tarkine is absolutely one of the most precious jewels in Tasmania's crown, it is unprotected. Only a very small area was protected by the Labor government in 2012, and nearly 550,000 hectares that have been valued under National Heritage listing for both their ecological and their cultural values remain open for mining and logging. We believe that the area has huge potential to generate employment and income for Tasmania and for Tasmanians if it is protected, if it is given the certainty for the investment that's needed to provide a world-class tourism experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, the Tarkine area, in the north-west, which spans all the way down from Wynyard to virtually above the west coast in Queenstown, a massive area, gets one of the state's lowest visitations. Whereas
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cradle_Mountain" rel="nofollow">
         Cradle Mountain
        </a>
        , nearby, gets one of the highest visitations, this area receives between five and seven per cent of the state's tourism visitors, who tend to go to other locations. It is absolutely one of the most stunning, rare, wild places that's accessible to Tasmanians and to visitors.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that Tasmania is already rated both in Australia and internationally as one of the world's most iconic walking destinations, but this provides a viable alternative. This has already been scoped with a $100,000 feasibility study, which was raised through crowdfunding. We've had a demand study done. This project is a goer. All it needs is federal assistance, and then we have the potential to develop a significant economic asset for north-west Tasmania, an asset that will bring people through, not just to do the walk and experience our wilderness—and, of course, those people will all go away converted to wanting to save World Heritage—but also to spend their money in the region. They'll go to local restaurants, wineries and hotels. They'll buy other produce. They'll tell their friends, and they'll all come to Tasmania. This is a win-win. It just needs some leadership. And it was great to see, in Canberra today, a delegation of small businesses so passionate about promoting Tasmania and what it has to offer.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would urge senators who haven't been down to the Tarkine to go down there this Christmas, go for a walk, and see for themselves what I'm talking about. Visit the rainforest. It is an absolutely stunning mixed species rainforest. It's on the world's last wild river areas. It is amazing cultural and ecological heritage and, of course, has some of the world's best surf beaches. So it's got everything on offer. All it needs is a ticket down to Tassie. Don't go to MONA straightaway and don't necessarily go to Cradle Mountain or Freycinet straightaway—much as they're fantastic. Go visit the Tarkine and see for yourself.
