       <ul>
        <li>
         All prescribing data reflects a complex interaction of prescriber behaviour, patient characteristics and the availability and appropriateness of adjunct or alternative therapies.
        </li>
        <li>
         A simple correlation between socio-economic status derived from postcode and number of prescriptions provides only limited information about the needs of patients or the appropriateness of prescription medicines to meet these needs. There is significant variation in the socio-economic status of individual families even within postcodes.
        </li>
        <li>
         It is not possible to draw any firm conclusions from such studies about the relationship between socio-economic status and choice of treatment therapies, including use of prescription medicines.
        </li>
        <li>
         As the study itself notes, it is not clear whether there is any causal link between socioeconomic status and psychostimulant treatment.

         As a part of the 2009-10 Budget the Australian Government announced an increase of $21 million over four years to the NPS. This new funding will increase the reach of NPS programs with health professionals, through engaging with more health professionals and specialists.

         The Australian Government recognises that both pharmacological and non pharmacological options play an important role in treating ADHD.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Australian Government funds a range of psychological services which can support the non-pharmaceutical treatment of people with ADHD and we do not simply rely on state and territory governments to provide services for these children. These include mental health services available under Medicare and services available in all locations, including rural and outer metropolitan areas available under the Access to Allied Psychological Services initiative and the Mental Health Service, Rural and remote Areas Program.
        </li>
        <li>
         The Early Intervention KidsMatter suite of activities is also ensuring that broader mental health promotion and information is available to children, schools and parents to help them understand the pathways of support available, including psychological therapies.

        <li>
         Senator Xenophon asked about benchmarks to apply to state service provision for children with ADHD. States and territories do have a role in providing services to children with severe ADHD through child and adolescent mental health services.
