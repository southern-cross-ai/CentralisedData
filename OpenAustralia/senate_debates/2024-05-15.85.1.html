        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Considering Gaza has been effectively controlled by a genocidal terrorist group which invaded Israel and murdered more than 1,200 innocent people last year, how is Australia's support for Palestine's membership of the

         I thank Senator Hanson for the question. I would make the point to her, first, that the government unequivocally condemns the actions of Hamas. I have said publicly on many occasions that Hamas is a terrorist group and that Hamas is dedicated to the destruction of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel" rel="nofollow">
          State of Israel
         </a>
         and to the destruction of the Jewish people. Hamas has no place in the future governance of a Palestinian state, and we have consistently called for Hamas to release hostages.
        </p>
        <p>
         The resolution that you are referencing was a resolution supported by some 143 countries which was fundamentally about how the world was trying to overcome the cycle of violence in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         and create momentum for a two-state solution. I want to make this very clear: Hamas does not support a two-state solution. Hamas supports the destruction of the State of Israel. That is clear. People might have different views about whether we should have a two-state solution, but it is wrong to say that voting for a resolution that supports a two-state solution is somehow supportive of Hamas. It is contrary to their views. I believe, after having visited the Middle East and engaging with both Israelis and Arab leaders, that the only pathway to long-term security for the State of Israel as well as for the Palestinian people—the only path, ultimately, to ending the cycle of violence which has dogged so much of our lives and has worsened post the atrocities of 7 October and the events since then—is to work towards that two-state solution. That is the spirit in which we supported a resolution which extended more rights as an observer—

            Firstly, the resolution extended additional rights as an observer. Membership of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             United Nations
            </a>
            General Assembly can only be granted by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
             UN
            </a>
            Security Council. The resolution that was negotiated through the week reflected those provisions of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Charter" rel="nofollow">
             UN Charter
            </a>
            , which is the power of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
             UN Security Council
            </a>
            to grant membership. So what we did support was additional rights.

              Minister, you never even touched on answering my question at all. We will try for a third one. An editorial in the

               Australian
              </i>
              newspaper two days ago reported Hamas has welcomed the resolution that your government supported in the

               UN
              </a>
              last week. Would you please explain to the Australian people why your government has done the bidding of terrorists who have committed the greatest atrocity against Jewish people since the Holocaust?

               I don't agree with your assertions, Senator Hanson. I don't propose to repeat them, but I don't agree with them. I have explained to you that a vote for two states is not a vote for Hamas. In fact, it is precisely the opposite of what Hamas wants. I would make the point, now that they have made clear their intent, that what we as an international community have to do is look at how we might bring momentum to security for both Israelis and Palestinians. That is what we are doing. I appreciate you don't agree with it, Senator Hanson, but that is our motivation. I think it is wrong to make the assertions that you are making about why we took that decision and why we voted as we did. As I have said publicly, I would make the point that our special strategic partner Japan, the Republic of Korea and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
