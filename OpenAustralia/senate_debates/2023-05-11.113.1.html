        My question is to the Minister representing the minister for regional development, Senator Watt. Colleen is a registered nurse living in Theodore, west of Gladstone. Colleen has found it impossible to secure housing. On the housing crisis, Colleen has said, 'We don't have any options. We are out on the street. Basically, we are homeless.' What is the Albanese government doing to address housing challenges in regional and rural Australia?

         Thank you, Senator Green, for being such a strong advocate for the needs of regional Queenslanders. It's a shame we don't have a few more of them in this place, especially around there—over there in particular. Certainly, Colleen's story in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         is not an isolated one. At the end of last year the vacancy rate in our home state of Queensland was 0.8 per cent, and the numbers in the regions were far worse, particularly in Gladstone, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Downs" rel="nofollow">
          Southern Downs
         </a>
         , the cape, Goondiwindi and the tablelands—all seeing near zero vacancy rates.
        </p>
        <p>
         The lack of housing in regional Australia disproportionately hurts women, low- and middle-income earners and the very essential workers and tradies that certain people here say they stand up for. It constrains regional economies and puts people in really difficult living situations. And it is the direct result of nine years of inaction and underfunding of housing from the former coalition government, who pretend that they are on regional Australia's side but always let them down. For years, under the former government, we saw state governments, peak groups and regional communities crying out for national leadership and funding from their federal government to address what was a looming housing crisis. As a result of their inaction, as a result of the mess they left behind, we see far too many regional Australians being hit by growing rents, struggling to buy a home, and facing or experiencing homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
         We, of course, as the new Labor government have a policy to develop 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes across five years through the Housing Australia Future Fund. In fact, we've committed to distribute the homes equitably across urban, regional and remote Australia. So why are Senators Canavan and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald" rel="nofollow">
          McDonald
         </a>
         , for instance, working with the Greens to stop this happening? Why is Gladstone based Senator Allman-Payne taking instructions from the inner-city based Brisbane housing spokesperson on the other side of the building? These people should get behind regional Australia and back in those homes.

           Kelly, a disability pensioner from Tasmania, was forced to live in a tent while waiting over eight months for social housing, and she was on the priority list. Can the minister outline how the Albanese government's housing initiatives guarantee social and affordable housing for regional and rural Australia?

            Thank you, Senator Green, for the question. We all know the impacts the housing crisis is having in Tasmania, none more so than our Tasmanian senators. I appreciate the advocacy of local senators on this side of the house, as well as Senators Lambie and Tyrrell, and their willingness to work together for good housing outcomes. It's a little bit of a shame that a couple of other senators from Tasmania didn't have the same approach.

            The Albanese government has been working hard to implement housing initiatives to increase housing supply in regional and rural Australia. In Tasmania, for example, we are delivering 48 new affordable homes in Launceston in partnership with community housing—

                         Will do. As we know, the Liberals and Nationals have profoundly let down regional Australians, but the Greens have done so too. For all the Greens' cries for more housing, they don't back it up in their own homes. Which Greens senator, for example, owns a $1 million investment property in Brisbane? It's apparently quite nice. It features a master suite of epic proportions that would keep any of the Kardashians happy. And why did that senator increase the rent on their investment property by nine per cent while calling for a rent freeze? Which Greens senator owns four separate properties while telling the Senate last year that the great Australian dream today is owning a property portfolio with tenants who pay your income and pay for your assets? Why would those sorts of people now want to stand in the way of other people getting a home and a roof over their heads?
