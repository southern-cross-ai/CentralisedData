         Australia is, by definition, a multicultural nation. Since 1945 more than seven million people have successfully settled in this country. We are a country that includes large numbers of people who have actively chosen to be Australian and, as a result, we are unique among the countries of the world for our breadth of cultures. This diversity is a great strength economically, culturally and socially. Australia's successful approach to multiculturalism has been underpinned by practical settlement strategies, including migrant resource centres, multicultural youth organisations, English tuition, case management and coordination, and referrals to mainstream government services.

         Last night, Mr Frank Lowy
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
          AC
         </a>
         , a prominent and distinguished Australian citizen, delivered the inaugural Multicultural Council of Australia lecture here in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         . In his address Mr Lowy made the point that multiculturalism has worked in Australia because we say to newcomers:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … you are welcome; you are free to worship; you are free to honour your heritage; and, we will respect the differences between us.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         And in return, you should agree to live by the standards and values of this society, the one you have chosen to be a part of.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is this mutual respect that is at the core of multiculturalism and it is this mutual respect that I hope will always be at the heart of the bipartisan political support for multiculturalism in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         With respect to settlement services, it is our investment in those early periods of settlement of people newly arrived to Australia that underpin the ongoing social cohesion and social inclusion that sit at the heart of, as I have said, a unique form of successful multiculturalism in the world.

           While Senator Bernardi resigned as the opposition leader's parliamentary secretary yesterday over other outrageous comments, he still has not been held to account by Mr Abbott for attacking multiculturalism and undermining the bipartisan character of this important policy. This bipartisan character was expressed, for example, in February 2011 by Senator Brandis when he said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … everyone who matters in the Liberal party has the same view about multiculturalism in Australia, and that is we strongly support it.
          </p>
          <p>
           Given this, Mr Abbott needs to urgently clarify whether his party supports the divisive inflammatory and anti-multicultural stance peddled by Senator Bernardi or the bipartisan approach offered by Senator Brandis and many others in the Liberal Party. The opportunity exists for Mr Abbott to rebuke Senator Bernardi specifically on these issues—

             last night by Mr Lowy in the inaugural presentation to the Australian Multicultural Council. An unquestionable multicultural success story is his own story. Mr Lowy came to Australia with just a small suitcase to his name having survived the horrors of World War

              II
             </a>
             , and through hard work and initiative he has built a successful business empire. As reflected by Mr Lowy, and the Prime Minister in her introduction, the strong condemnation of last week's violence by Australian Muslim leaders is a good example of the strength of multiculturalism in Australia. It was not any one part of any of Australian society that condemned last weekend's behaviour; it was the whole of the Australian community that condemned the violence. This is an example of the strength of multiculturalism in Australia. It shows that the community is able to respond to divisiveness with strength—
