         Senator Cameron, thank you for your question. In a year when the Commonwealth funding for schools is increasing, following upon the 50 per cent increase in funding this government has provided for schools, it is a tragedy to see the state government of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         cutting back their school funding by $1.7 billion. Of course, we all know that budgets are about priorities; we all understand that basic principle. What the New South Wales government have done is demonstrated their priority—that is, their hostility to education, their hostility to ensuring that students in New South Wales, no matter what their background, actually get a fair go.
        </p>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         is committed to increasing school funding. It is a pity that the states are not prepared to come to the party. We know that Liberal governments across this country are cutting support for education. What we have seen is the field work now being done for the future
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Abbott

         experiments in education. What we are seeing is cuts in the funding in Victoria, like in New South Wales and in Queensland. Premier

          O'Farrell
         </a>
         says, 'It isn't about the quantum of funding.' What an extraordinary, self-serving defence of inequality that is! As we know, the wealthy in this country can always look after themselves; it is the poorer students who look to government to even up the score. They cannot do that in New South Wales. The evidence is clear—very clear—that school funding makes a difference for children, particularly from disadvantaged backgrounds.

             Labor takes the view that education opens the doors of opportunity for Australians. Labor takes the view that it unlocks the doors of inequality. Labor takes the view that education has to be the first priority of government. However, that cannot be a one-way street. What we have seen in

                New South Wales

               Minister for Education actually said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I sleep very well at night knowing the decisions that I've made and announced today are in the best interests of students across all schools.
              </p>
              <p>
               That might be a mighty sweet dream for a Tory recidivist, but it is a nightmare for many parents in this country. They are the ones who will have to deal with the hikes in fees and the staff cuts.
              </p>
              <p>
               And this money they are saving in New South Wales is being used to build an $8 billion railway line that would actually be slower than the buses that currently operate. We cannot for a moment believe that this is the philosophy of a modern government. We are looking at very 19th-century views about what is in the interests of parents and what is in the interests of students.
