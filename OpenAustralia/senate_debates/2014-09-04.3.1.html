        . I pass them on my way to the Senate, on the way to committee meetings and every time I leave or arrive at my office. They are reminders of the responsibility I carry. They are reminders of the people I represent—the people of Victoria who feel let down by traditional politicians and politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        The DLP has been the party of principle in the face of opposition, and no other political party in Australia can say its founders were prepared to sacrifice promising political careers to uphold their commitment to freedom from undue and corrupt influence. I have been a member of the DLP since 2006, so I have arrived at my decision today only after deep introspection and consultation with trusted friends and colleagues. It has become apparent to me that the DLP's own worst enemies are within its own ranks. Ever since my election, I have witnessed firsthand attempts by those in the party to assume power through any means, even if it means the very destruction of the party itself. This will not be news to many. A simple internet search will reveal part of what I have been talking about.
       </p>
       <p>
        But more recently that attack moved into my electorate office. Earlier this year, at the strong recommendation of senior party members, I employed an office manager. This person already had a relationship with the DLP and was involved with the party's senior members. It has now become apparent that that person systematically ran a campaign of disinformation and disharmony in my office. Attempts by me to undertake normal communication with party members were thwarted, confidential information was leaked and lies were told. Even more alarmingly, it has emerged that, two weeks after joining my staff, that person sent an email to the Liberal Party asking about preselection in the forthcoming Victorian election. The cancer of political intrigue clearly has infected the Victorian state executive of the DLP. That person suddenly resigned from her position in July, three days after being elected Victorian state president of the DLP. I have sought answers from the state executive about these events. I have sought a plausible explanation. So far, I have received none.
       </p>
       <p>
        My commitment to the party has, I believe, been second to none. So it is with a heavy heart but with resolution that today I announce my resignation from the DLP to continue my term as an Independent senator. I look back at my achievements, such as they are, over the last three years and know that I could have achieved more. I could have achieved more with less distraction from party politics and from the culture of complaint, disruption and undermining that now exists in the DLP amongst senior members.
       </p>
       <p>
        I remain committed to DLP values. I remain committed to supporting manufacturing and farming jobs and supporting those in our country who are the most vulnerable. I remain committed to the sanctity of human life, from conception to natural death and at every stage in between. I remain committed to those long-term and loyal DLP party members who are unquestioning in their support and faith in DLP principles. I remain committed to the people of Victoria and Australia, and I confirmed to them that I will not rest in my efforts to represent them and to fight for those things we equally believe in. I seek leave to table documents in relation to this matter.

          No. Just so there is no misapprehension in relation to this, as I understand it, the coalition has not seen all the documents as yet. Therefore, this is not a blanket denial; it is just subject to inspection of the documents, and then we will make our position known. I understand that I reflect the
