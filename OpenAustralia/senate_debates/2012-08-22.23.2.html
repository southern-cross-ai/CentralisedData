        faces an increase in its electricity bill of $70,000 per year, an increase of some 30 per cent, as a direct result of the government's carbon tax? Isn't it the case that every school in Australia will, like the Anglican Church Grammar School, face significant increases in running costs as a result of the carbon tax resulting in either cutbacks in student services, higher fees or other costs to parents, or both?

         The answer is no because, as the senator would well know—and it is embarrassing that the only way he can get a question on education is to ask a question on carbon. That is how much priority those opposite place on education. The only way you can get a question in the portfolio area is to ask a question about carbon pricing.
        </p>
        <p>
         As you would well know, Senator, the Commonwealth funds schools on an indexed basis. The funding is based on the AGSRC, average government school recurrent costs, amount that takes into account increases in operating costs, and utility costs are included in that index. That is the truth, but of course what we really want to know is what the coalition would do when it came to education because apparently, according to Mr Robb, they are going to give all of education to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
          Campbell Newman

She is outlining what the opposition's alternative would be to school funding and operating costs, which may include any costs associated with running schools, and Senator Brandis understands as well.

                   , on a point of order: with respect, you cannot allow this minister to defy your authority as she continually does. Having ruled the last point of order out of order, you are now entertaining a minister answering a question about the effect of a carbon tax on schools by making a comment on the motives of one senator in taking a point of order on relevance. How can that be relevant to the question she was asking?

                     As I pointed out to the senator in the first 15 seconds, the AGSRC does take into account increases in operating costs, and utility costs are included in that index—and this is from the government that doubled funding to schools.

                       , I ask a supplementary question. The minister has indicated that schools will be compensated for the carbon tax through the indexation of federal funding, which I understand is currently calculated at around six per cent a year. How much does the government intend to increase school indexation to cover the cost of the carbon tax?

                         No, 'knuckle draggers' is Senator Carr's trademark. He has a patent on that. I understand that the AGSRC is calculated using the expenditure by state and territory government schools and is updated by the ministerial council. Whilst the main inclusions offer salaries and allowances for teachers and related on-costs, the index also includes other recurrent costs such as the cost of utilities. If you want further information, Senator, I suggest you ask the relevant minister.

                         In relation to the broader issue of funding, this is the government that has doubled school funding—something that cannot be matched by the opposition, given that their plan is to slash services such as health and education.

                          , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the many sacrifices Australian parents already make to send their children to school, and the tireless effort to which school communities go to raise funds for their schools, why is the government making it harder for schools, harder for students and harder for parents by taking money out of the education system to pay for this toxic tax based on a lie?

                           This government has been second to none when it comes to supporting education. Unlike those opposite, where we have the Leader of the Opposition declaring war on the public school system, we have sought not to divide and not to play the politics of division when it comes to education. If we want to talk about making it harder for parents and schools, those opposite voted against the schoolkids bonus. I am asked about making things harder for schools and school communities. Those opposite have continued to criticise the
