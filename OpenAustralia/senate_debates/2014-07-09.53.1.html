        In the few minutes before question time I would like to put a few things on the record. There is an old saying that children should not be condemned for the sins of the father—and that is certainly something that I cling to in the hope that my children will live a fruitful and beneficial life free of the baggage that I give them. But I do want to put on the record today how appalled I am at the goings on between Hamas and some of the Israeli militants in which children are now the victims. It is no secret that I am a very strong supporter of Israel and it is no secret that I have absolutely no time for terrorist outfits or political organisations that shepherd them, facilitate them or mask them. As a father and as a citizen of the world, the kidnap and murder of three Israeli children is an absolutely barbaric crime, as was—and I want to put this on the record—the slaughter of the Palestinian boy by Israeli citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, there has been a stark difference in the treatment of these two barbaric and hideous crimes. Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel has said that those responsible for the heinous crime will face the full force of Israeli law—as they should. I would like to contrast that with the response from Hamas, which was stunned silence. I have seen interviews with widows of some of those who are supposedly accused of this crime in which they have said that they would be very happy if their sons had committed it. It is quite appalling. But Hamas itself has failed to condemn it, and that should be a concern for all of us who are concerned with

        peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I noticed in press reports that rockets are now being hailed down on Israel once again and they are reaching Jerusalem. They have what I believe is called an 'iron dome', which launches retaliatory rockets to destroy incoming missiles. Where two barbaric acts have been committed and Israel stands behind the rule of law to charge those who have committed this crime within their own borders and yet those on the other side choose instead not to rely on the rule of law but to rely on more rockets into Israel, there is a stark contrast in how these things are being dealt with. Once again I want to put on the record that I stand with Israel for upholding democratic values in the Middle East.
