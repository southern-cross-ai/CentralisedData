        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for

         Social Services
        </a>
        , Senator Fifield. I refer to reports that the Minister for Social Services, Mr Porter, is looking for more savings from his portfolio. Mr Porter is reportedly on the hunt for savings in his new portfolio, hinting spending cuts to carers' and disability payments may be needed. This week is Carers Week and Anti-Poverty Week. Carers and people with disability are at a higher risk of poverty than the general population. What further cuts to carer and disability support payments is the minister planning in Anti-Poverty Week?

         I thank Senator Siewert for her question. One of the reasons why the government have been working extremely hard on budget repair is to make sure that we as a government are in a position to fund and support that which is the core business of government. I know from my previous portfolio that an important part of the core business of government is providing support to people who face extra challenges, often for reasons beyond their control. What that means is we want to make sure that we are in a position to fully fund the National Disability Insurance Scheme. What that means is we want make sure we are a position to continue, as we all want to continue, to have a good and generous social safety net in terms of age pensions, disability support pensions and Newstart benefits.
        </p>
        <p>
         Government has to make sure that it has a sustainable budget and that it is repairing its budget so that, in the long term, it can continue to be in a position to support those important things, which, as I say—

            Obviously, we have a budget every single year, and in the context of a budget all ministers have a duty and an obligation to make sure that the taxpayer dollar is being spent to its best benefit and that taxpayers are getting the best possible value from government programs. The Minister for

            , like every minister, makes sure and looks to make sure that spending is appropriate and is targeted in his portfolio. I think you only need to look at the commitment that this government has made to budget repair to be certain that—

              Everything that this government does in terms of policy and in terms of framing each of its budgets is about improving the standard of living of Australians. At the heart of that is seeking to pursue policies that will increase growth, introducing policies that will increase growth, because we know that a growing economy means more jobs and the best poverty buster known is a job. Everything we do is about helping to create an economic environment that is conducive to business growing, prospering and employing people. That was our approach in our first two budgets; it will be the approach that we take in the coming budget.

                I know from my previous role, as well as anyone on this side of the chamber, the important role that carers play in our community. The work that unpaid family carers do could never be replaced by government. It is very important that government recognises and supports carers, and this government does so through carer payment and through carer allowance. This government will always make sure that there is appropriate support for unpaid family carers.
               </p>
               <p>
                Senator Siewert is referring to media speculation. There is always media speculation the closer you get to a budget. But this government's commitment to carers is clear, has been clear and will continue.
