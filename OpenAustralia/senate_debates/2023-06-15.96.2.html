        , Senator Wong. On 4 June 2021 in a Senate committee hearing, when confronted about whether Senator Gallagher knew of allegations of an alleged assault before they became public, she said, "No-one had any knowledge. How dare you?" Over the last few days she has admitted in this chamber that she did know about the allegations before they became public and received information about them. Minister, will you ask Senator Gallagher to admit that she misled the Senate and to simply correct the record?

         (—) (): Again, I do not accept the assertions that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Leader of the Opposition in the Senate

         makes in that question. Senator Gallagher made a statement to the Senate this week and has been asked multiple questions. She has made clear what her knowledge was and has responded to, I think, basically the same question that Senator Birmingham has put to me today. She has responded to that directly. I would make a point here about respect, if I may. We seem to have forgotten, in this debate and in this chamber, about what actually occurred here. Those opposite seem unable to accept their own responsibilities and unable to accept that one of their own staff felt disrespected in her workplace. They seem to be unable to accept that she might have exercised her own agency and told her own story in her own voice. Now they compound that disrespect with the use of personal text messages and other confidential information being leaked to the media. I think the message that many Australians looking at this will take is that those opposite are willing—instead of accounting for their own actions—to punish those who speak out.

           In the same estimates committee hearing on 4 June when you and Senator Gallagher were continually asking questions about this very matter in the parliament, you also made the statement, 'I had no knowledge of this until that night.' Minister, will you simply correct the record?

               I refer to my answers yesterday about this, and I again say that I did not know the full details of Ms Higgins allegations until she chose to tell her story in reports published on Monday 15 February. Also, to the best of my memory, I did not know her identity until after these reports. I had no contact with her, her partner or her supports.

                 President, I have a point of order on direct relevance. Yesterday, questions were asked, which the minister responded to, about the breadth of her knowledge or when she received information. Today, this is a very specific question that goes specifically to when she learned that the allegations would be revealed in the media. I ask the minister to be directly relevant to that question, which I repeated twice: to be very clear and specific about when she learned the allegations would be revealed in the media.

That's what it is all about from those on that side. It's not about Ms Higgins. It's not about women who are watching—

                   <p>
