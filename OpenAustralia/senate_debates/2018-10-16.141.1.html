           Yes, on a point of order: the question is not whether the Nationals have given up. The question is: what reasons did Prime Minister Morrison give the Deputy Prime Minister for shutting down his proposal?

            You've reminded the minister of the specific nature of the question. The minister's been speaking for just over 30 seconds. At this stage I consider the minister to be directly relevant to other parts of the question. I call upon her to continue.

             over the weekend, which we welcome. It is actually ensuring that for those Australians who are looking for a job, who want to work, we have many, many roles available out in regional and agricultural regions and in our industries, and we look forward to welcoming them on farm to do this work. But we know that this won't be the single solution. We know this isn't the silver bullet and there is much more work to do. We've got the Seasonal Worker Program, which is filling significant gaps, and the Pacific workers scheme, which is also filling significant gaps. There are significant opportunities, I think, right throughout our region to have a win-win situation where those on Pacific islands can actually come and assist us with the great food task and support our farmers but also support their families at home. There's a lot of work we can do in ensuring that our farmers have the workforce and the skill levels they need to assist and get on with the food task. We're wanting to see agriculture grow from a $64 billion industry, as it is right now, to a $100 billion industry. That's going to take a lot of know-how, a lot of research and development, and a lot of workers.

                            I can confirm one thing out of the article you're quoting from, Senator Cameron, and that is that the Deputy Prime Minister is a nice bloke. He isn't just a nice bloke; he's a fantastic bloke. Out there in regional Australia, they know he has their back. He has their back each and every day in the party room, in the cabinet room, in the leadership conversations—and, on the floor of the House of Representatives right now, he'll be standing up for the third of Australians that don't choose to live in a capital city, for the 70 per cent of our export industries that employ over two million Australians. As the National Party, under his leadership, we have been delivering, not just having conversations around mobility schemes but looking at digital connectivity. There is the Building Better Regions Fund—round 3 is open now; if you had any seats out there, I'd say you're welcome to apply. We've also got $22.5 million for the Stronger Communities Program—
