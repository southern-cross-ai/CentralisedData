          Shire of Broome
         </a>
         . For example, the Commonwealth Government, through the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (FaHCSIA) funds service providers to deliver a range of community, family and individual support programs. To date in 2011-12, FaHCSIA has committed funding of around $12 million to a range of services in the Shire of Broome and over $50 million across the Kimberley region of Western Australia, including almost $30 million for Community Development Employment projects, around $1 million for Family Relationship Centres and approximately $6.4 million for municipal services.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As Broome is recognised as an area of workforce shortage it also qualifies for a number of Australian Government programs to improve access to health services. This includes the General Practice Rural Incentives Program that aims to encourage medical practitioners to relocate to and practise in rural and remote communities. Medical practitioners relocating to Broome may be eligible for a Rural Relocation Incentive Grant of up to $60,000.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In addition, the Australian Government is funding a number of specific initiatives to improve local health services in Broome. This includes providing $7.9 million in 2009-10 from the Health and Hospital Fund to construct a 12 bed paediatric unit at the redeveloped Broome Regional Resource Centre and $16.9 million in 2011-12 to upgrade and expand the Broome Hospital.
