        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Farrell. In 2012, when announcing an additional 450 gigalitres of water recovery over and above sustainable diversion limits detailed in the Basin Plan, then Prime Minister Gillard said the water would be recovered via 'water recovery projects that minimise the impact on communities to ensure there is no social and economic downside for communities'. This intent was then written into the 2012 Basin Plan. Does the new Labor government stand by the 2012 commitment to communities for no negative social and economic impacts?

         I thank Senator Davey for her question. What the federal Albanese government stands by, Senator, and what Minister Plibersek stands by, is the commitment that we made when we were last in government to restore the health of the mighty river system, the Murray-Darling river system, and, in doing that, ensure that the 450 gigalitres of water that were promised to that river system are delivered upon.
        </p>
        <p>
         We don't want life to be any harder for inland communities in this country. There was significant consultation at the time that that plan was delivered. I, in fact, was the deputy water minister to Minister Burke who delivered that system. We made a promise to the people of Australia. We made a promise to all of those people whose livelihood survives along that river system, and the promise that we made was we'll deliver that 450 gigalitres of water.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, it wasn't just the federal government that entered into that understanding, that promise; it was all of the state governments, including those governments that are of a Liberal persuasion now, like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . So, the federal government and the state governments all committed to the delivery of that 450 gigalitres, and we intend to do it.

           So I'll take it as a no about your commitment to communities. But in 2018—you mentioned basin state ministers, and I appreciate the segue—all basin state ministers, including the Labor

           n minister and the Labor Victorian minister, agreed to a set of criteria by which they could assess that there would be no negative social or economic impacts from this water recovery. Does the new Labor government respect the consensus of the ministerial council—

                Thank you, President. I don't see anything inconsistent with what you've just read out. That has been the commitment of the state governments to what the Labor Party committed to when we were in government more than nine years ago, and that was the delivery of 450 gigalitres of water. I notice we haven't got one of the

                s haven't asked this question because they know that the most important thing for the South Australian community—and I'm speaking now as a South Australian senator—is the delivery of that 450 gigalitres. How much did you deliver in the nine years that you were in government?
