        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Colbeck. Can the minister confirm that, under Mr Morrison's latest announcement, Australians will continue to face lockdowns even with 70 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated?

        <p>
         [by video link] I can confirm that, at the rate of 70 per cent of the eligible population being vaccinated, there is still some scope for lockdowns under the Doherty institute modelling. The modelling contemplates those sorts of circumstances occurring as a part of the development of the phased plan for reopening the economy. There are a number of targets that talk about the progressive rates of vaccination within the country increasing to provide more and more freedoms. That's the point of the exercise: that the Australian community can understand the circumstances under which they might enjoy more freedoms; the circumstances by which governments—state, territory and Commonwealth—may make decisions about reopening the economy and the community. That is the point of the government commissioning the Doherty modelling, so that those circumstances would be clear to the Australian people.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is contemplated that there still could be lockdowns under those circumstances, particularly as we see new variants of COVID-19 coming into circulation. Those circumstances may change, as they have done throughout the pandemic, and we will have to be prepared, as we have done so far, to adjust to those new variants and the new circumstances. But the Doherty Institute modelling has been put in place so Australians have a full understanding of the circumstances about reopening the community and the economy.

            [by video link] Again, that is contemplated in the Doherty modelling. The Doherty modelling talks about when at least 80 per cent of the adult population is fully vaccinated we can consider transition to phase C, which is regarded in the plan as the vaccination consolidation phase. Measures may include minimum ongoing baseline restrictions adjusted to minimise cases without lockdowns or highly targeted lockdowns only. The whole purpose of this vaccination process and the plan is to minimise serious illness, hospitalisations and fatalities. But we are going to have to continue to be prepared to adjust, as we have been throughout the pandemic as new variants to the virus have occurred. So, yes, there are targeted lockdowns contemplated.

              When asked yesterday, Minister, what date the 70 per cent target will be reached, you said, 'The government deliberately has not established a date for that to occur.' Why is the Morrison government keeping Australians in the dark? Is it because Mr Morrison doesn't want to take responsibility for meeting his own targets?

              <p>
               [by video link] I completely reject the insinuation by the question. We want all Australians to front up and get vaccinated as soon as possible. Reaching the targets and putting the targets into the public domain is putting the power into reopening the economy back into the hands of Australians. That's the point of it. Australians can understand what the thresholds are for the reopening of the economy, and they can then work towards meeting the targets. Our responsibility, the responsibility of the government, is to make available the vaccine and make available as many as possible outlets for Australians to access the vaccine.
