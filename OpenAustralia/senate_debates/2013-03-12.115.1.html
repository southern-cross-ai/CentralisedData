        The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union has produced many great working class leaders over its history.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Adamson" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Adamson
        </a>
        ranks with the best of them. Bob passed away on 19 February 2013 at the age of 89 after a battle with cancer. He will be sadly missed by his wife and lifelong partner Vi, his children Jennifer, Stephen and Margaret, and seven grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        His passing is also a sad time for his many friends who enjoyed his company and his unstinting commitment to working class values and principles. Australia is a better place as a result of the efforts of Bob Adamson. Bob fought for a good society and decent rights at work in his roles as shop steward, state and national organiser, community activist and founder and driving force of the Hunter Labour Cooperative.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was known everywhere in the union movement as the 'Silver Fox' or the 'Grey Ghost' due to his silver hair and strategic capabilities. I spoke to Bob the week before his death and despite the ravages of cancer he engaged in a conversation about the big political issues facing Australia's working class.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was born in Belfast in 1923 and along with his wife, Vi, and his first born, Jennifer, moved to Australia in 1950. After a short period in Melbourne, the family moved to Newcastle where Bob worked as a boilermaker at the state dockyard. After years of rank and file activism in the Boilermakers and Blacksmiths Society, Bob was elected at the age of 42 as an organiser in the Newcastle branch. Bob was a key player in the fight to maintain the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
         AMWU
        </a>
        as a progressive, militant, rank and file based union. The battles with the right wing 'groupers' for control of the union have become legendary and Bob was central to winning the support of Newcastle rank and file members for a strong membership controlled union.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was the epitome of the mindful militantâ€”smart, strategic, and tough. Bob could inspire workers during disputes and provide skilled advocacy in the industrial tribunals. Bob was also a man of unquestionable integrity, respected by his members and employers. He led Newcastle district campaigns for shorter hours, industrial democracy and improved wages and conditions in a range of industries, including the manufacturing, steel and power industries. Bob's abilities were recognised by his election as a national organiser with responsibility for construction and a range of other areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob was my friend and mentor. I first met Bob when I was a shop steward at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liddell_Power_Station" rel="nofollow">
         Liddell Power Station
        </a>
        in 1976. Bob was not one for babysitting shop stewards. He was determined that AMWU shop stewards would be well trained, capable and not rely on union organisers to make a decision. I will never forget ringing Bob during one of the many industrial disputes at the power station and being told words to the effect: 'Why are you ringing me on this issue? Think it through and fix it yourself!' His comments were actually much more to the point and much more colourful. They are not for repetition in this august chamber. This was a good lesson in self-sufficiency for a budding shop steward.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following his retirement from the union, Bob became a keen golfer and the driving force behind the Hunter Labour Cooperative. The cooperative was established to provide labour-hire workers with union wages and conditions equivalent to those enjoyed by permanent workers. The Hunter Labour Cooperative stands as a fantastic symbol of Bob's commitment to workers and his foresight and capabilities. Like many of Bob's comrades, I will miss his friendship and advice. He was a truly magnificent trade unionist and one of the best people I have ever had the honour to meet. My condolences go to Vi and the family, and I want to thank them for their support for Bob during a magnificent trade union career.
