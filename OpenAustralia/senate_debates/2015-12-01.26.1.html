         I can indicate to the senator that I am not aware of that particular comment, so I cannot give her a view on that. But can I be very clear, as the Prime Minister has been clear and others making comment both in the House of Representatives and in the Senate have: there is nothing on the table regarding the

           It is most interesting to see that those on the other side both in this place and in the other place are embarking on a scare campaign for the Australian people. It is a scare campaign because there is no basis to the assertions and the hypotheticals that those opposite are raising. It takes a coalition government to be prepared to have a sensible, measured national debate about taxation issues. Those on the other side would much prefer to talk about an increase in the carbon tax and talk about an increase in the smoking tax, none of which are based on anything that is going to provide a benefit to the Australian people.

                    hike the senator is referring to, because it is clearly hypothetical and made up with the fairies at the bottom of the garden that the senator opposite is obviously talking to to get an idea of the GST hike. Those opposite know very well that the coalition government is having a sensible, responsible discussion about taxation matters.

                    You can try to scare the Australian people as much as you want, Senator, but they know that we need to have a balanced, sensible, mature and responsible debate about this issue, and that is what they will get from the coalition government.
