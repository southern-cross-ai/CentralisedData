        This week we have had a very special guest in this building. Yavuz is the uncle of Burak Dogan, a 30-year-old food delivery rider who was tragically killed on the job on 2 April 2020. Burak is one of the 11 food delivery writers who have been killed since 2017. I'll use the rest of my time to share Yavuz's words:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was one of the most difficult jobs of my life to inform the family of Burak's death.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Burak was an engineer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was a hard working man.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He came to study in Australia to improve his English so that he could get a better position at work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He had 6 months to go to finish his study.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was killed by a big truck, very tragically.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We had to wrap him up in plastic to keep his body all in one piece.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To send it to his family.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have been contacting Uber and the insurance companies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The insurance company said Burak finished his last job 11 minutes after the 15 minutes insurance cover time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So they were not liable for anything.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Then Uber made a comment after the investigation finalised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They were not liable for anything because Burak was not working for them at the time of his death.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But Uber sent their records of his log ins to the police.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They were trying to give him job offers at the time of his death.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most likely he was looking at it when he went under the truck.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When he was dying, they sent another message 3 or 4 minutes later.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That's the attitude of the company.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What we would like to see is justice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We hope Parliament is going to do something about this injustice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is all the family is asking for.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say this. Stop Uncle Sam's sweatshops killing Australian drivers here.
       </p>
