        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Senator Faulkner. Minister, why has the government increased the rebate for cataract surgery on its Department of Veterans’ Affairs fee schedules for medical services to $1,291 while at the same time reducing the patient rebate for the exact same surgery on the Medicare Benefits Schedule by 46 per cent, down to $340?

         In relation to the question that I am asked, my understanding,

          Mr President
         </a>
         , is that funding cataract surgery for veterans is not dependent on there being a Medicare Benefits Schedule item; my understanding is that the Department of Veterans’ Affairs is continuing to process accounts for cataract surgery consistent with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs fee arrangements. If it would be of assistance to Senator Cormann and the Senate, I can also provide additional information in relation to this important matter that might be of interest to Senator Cormann and the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         First of all, I could indicate to the Senate that the government is fixing the mess that the Liberal Party created in the Senate two weeks ago regarding cataract procedures by introducing new items to ensure that patients were not left without a rebate at all. I could also say that, thanks to the action by the government, patients have not been left in the lurch and ophthalmologists will continue to receive significant payments for these procedures. The new fee for the most common cataract procedure, which typically takes between—

                   I need to check with the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs about what his view is but as the minister representing him in the Senate let me tell you what the situation is from a broader government perspective. The government’s regulations in the Senate to reduce the Medicare rebate payable for cataract surgery have been blocked. The consequence of this is that the cataract items did not exist in the Medicare Benefits Schedule, effective 1 November 2009, which means that there was technically no rebate payable under Medicare.

                   </a>
                   will continue to process DVA claims for cataract surgery provided to veterans consistent with the DVA arrangements. Under the treatment principles, DVA funds

                   listed services and DVA can pay for services not listed in the MBS unlisted services in certain circumstances. I hope that helps you, Senator Cormann.

                    rebates, on top of previous cuts of 30 per cent and 10 per cent, was justified because the procedure was now so ‘quick and easy’ to perform? Given the cut in patient rebates is now clearly exclusively targeted at the many thousands of mostly elderly patients accessing cataract surgery through the private health system every year, does the government now concede that this is nothing more and nothing less than another strike against patients in its ideological crusade against private health?

Fundamentally, you might be aware, Senator Abetz, that what Senator Cormann requested I do is to pass these questions on to my colleague the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. I will do that. I will also say in the time available to me, adding to my previous answer, that if there were no
