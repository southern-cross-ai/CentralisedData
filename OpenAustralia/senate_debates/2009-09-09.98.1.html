They could not take up one reasonable broadband plan put forward by those in the National Party. They at least understood the benefits. But, no, Senator Minchin has decided to be as lazy as he can be and to see if he can get

                   I think most of the response to the broadband initiative has been positive and in fact most of the negative commentary has really come, essentially, of a political nature rather than in terms of the operators and the landscape.

                    , which found that its costs would exceed its benefits by between $14 billion and $20 billion? Doesn’t this finding necessitate a full cost-benefit analysis by the government before it borrows up to $40 billion to pay for its optical fibre rollout?

                     The whole premise of that question was false. The government are not going to be borrowing $40 billion. We have made it absolutely clear.

                       As for the ‘respected’ economic commentators Concept Economics, they are the advisers you hired for your tax policy that has vanished without trace. Frankly, they should take this analysis and put it in the same place you put their tax advice.
