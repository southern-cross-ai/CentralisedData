        ask a question in terms of the time lines and the need for timing the processes of both the wellbeing exemption and the exit application? In terms of time lines, how are you going to address the need for timely decisions?

         One of the things that is currently built into the wellbeing exemption process is that, for somebody who had made an application, we would seek to have had that successfully processed within six to eight weeks, and that would certainly be the kinds of criteria that we would be putting on the exemption process for the financial wellbeing criteria. As we discussed earlier this morning, there are times when the complication of the process will mean that they are not always going to be able to meet those time lines, but they're certainly the kinds of time lines we've been meeting in the past and we'll be seeking to meet in the future.

           Certainly that's our intention or our understanding. However, because it's potentially a simpler process for the financial aspects as opposed to the wellbeing, it may be possible for it to be shorter. I wouldn't want to give an undertaking to this chamber until we've gone through a few of the processes, but we certainly would be seeking for it to be no longer than the current wellbeing process.

             I can take on notice the intent of your question. One of the things that we would be seeking to do is, obviously, expedite the process in cases where it's very simple, so we wouldn't like to give the applicant the view that it's going to take six or eight weeks when in fact it may be a much shorter time frame. But I'll take on notice the intent of your question in relation to providing applicants with some sort of indicative idea of how long the process may be expected to take.

             <p>
              As I articulated in my second reading contribution, the Greens are deeply concerned about the exit criteria. I appreciate the answers to my questions that I received from the minister. However, we still remain very concerned about the broadness of the criteria and the way they may be interpreted. We believe that the process should focus on the participants' capacity to manage their finances, which is clearly something that is able to be documented, whereas many of those other criteria aren't. I commend the amendment to the Senate.

              <p class="italic">

              <p>
               These amendments would remove a provision that allows the minister to specify other requirements a person must meet before being permitted to leave the cashless debit card and replace it with a provision that allows the minister to specify more details about how exiting the requirements should be met. This is because Labor does not think the government should be able to make it harder for people to get off the card, particularly given the breadth of the existing requirements in relation to the management of financial affairs, the protection of children and unlawful behaviour.
