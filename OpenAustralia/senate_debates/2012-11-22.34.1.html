           This motion was only circulated in the chamber immediately before housekeeping, and it was only emailed to all parties at 11.53 this morning, so it is fair to say that the usual courtesies were not applied to these amendments. The coalition will support the motion moved by the Labor Party. I note yesterday in question time that Senator Bob Carr said he would have preferred a motion that would be supported across the chamber. The coalition would like the same but would not compromise with those who qualify their condemnation of the violence of Hamas with the criticism of a nation simply defending its civilians. It is disappointing that yesterday Labor could not support a simple, unqualified and unconditional condemnation of the rocket attacks upon Israel orchestrated by Hamas, because there is a very simple truth: if the rockets from Hamas stop, there is no need for Israeli action.

              I just want to respond to the comments made earlier about lack of consultation. As the minister said yesterday, he has had a general view that a uniform, unanimous motion from this parliament was the preferred position. Work has been going on, and of course we have all followed the details of what has been going on overnight and the achievement of a ceasefire. This motion, as amended, now reflects the current situation. I apologise to the opposition if the process was not actually as they had expected.

               I seek leave to move an amendment to the amended version of the motion as circulated. The amendment would replace the word 'aspirations' with the word 'rights', in paragraph 3 of the amended motion. So it would read:

                 I am very distressed to think that the Senate would not recognise the rights of the Palestinian people to also live in peace and security within their own state. Australia has been elected to the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
                  UN

                  Security Council
                 </a>
                 . We have an obligation to be even-handed. If we want to be a respected middle power on the Security Council we have to be even-handed.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In terms of this motion as it currently reads, we agree with all of it. We do condemn the attack on the bus in
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv" rel="nofollow">
                  Tel Aviv
                 </a>
                 overnight. We condemn the rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel. But we also condemn the bombings and blockading of Gaza by Israel. Why is it that the government and the opposition cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the devastating harm done to the Palestinian people by Israel with the continued bombing and blockading? The Palestinian people have rights, not just aspirations, alongside the people of Israel. So, whilst we support each element of the amended motion that Senator Stephens has moved, it is the omission from the motion that raises concern.
