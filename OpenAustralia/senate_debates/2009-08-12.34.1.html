        , Senator Ludwig. Is the Rudd government still pushing ahead with its ill-considered $100 million budget cut to chemotherapy treatment which, according to the budget papers, is due to take effect in less than three weeks, despite the resounding and massive outcry from cancer patient support groups and healthcare professionals from across Australia?

         I thank Senator Cormann for his question. I do hope in giving me notice of the question that he does not need to refer himself to the Privileges Committee! The Rudd government is committed to a sustainable and strong PBS. This means we must always seek value for taxpayers’ dollars. The government remains committed to implementing its chemotherapy measure that will reduce wastage of expensive chemotherapy medicines by funding the actual quantity of medicines which are delivered to cancer patients. The PBS, and ultimately taxpayers, will benefit from reducing wastage of these expensive medicines. There are currently no incentives to promote efficient use of these very expensive medicines—a situation which the government considers is untenable. I note that the question goes to the measure which seeks to achieve $100 million in savings through more efficient arrangements for the payment of benefits for chemotherapy drugs. This government is seeking to improve the way we use these medicines so that we can continue to ensure they are affordable and accessible for all Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         This measure was to commence on 1 July 2009 with resulting savings of around $105.4 million over the budget period. The government is undertaking to briefly delay implementation of the measure beyond 1 September and will provide a further update on its implementation plans into the near future. There is, I can say, ongoing consultation with stakeholders. This government believes it is necessary and important to consult with stakeholders in respect of this implementation measure, and consultation will be wide-ranging.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Does the Rudd government now recognise that, whilst phial sizes remain as they are, there will always be an unavoidable and inevitable excess of a chemotherapy drug if patient safety is put first?

           This is one of those areas where Senator Cormann needs to be able to distinguish between what we say are legitimate concerns and the misinformation that can arise. For example, despite claims to the contrary, patient safety will not be adversely affected by this measure, as it does not promote any change from current pharmacy practices in relation to the multiple use of chemotherapy phials. The government is reviewing the measure to ensure that patient treatment is not compromised and public and private oncology pharmacy services remain viable so that there will be no influx of patients from the private to the public sector. In taking on board the question that Senator Cormann asked, there are two matters that I have gone to: firstly, ensuring that patient safety will not be adversely affected, but also ensuring—

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the minister has just advised the Senate that the Rudd government will press ahead with forcing vulnerable cancer patients and community pharmacists to fund the government’s $100 million cut to cancer treatment, when will the government inform cancer patients, who need to know now whether they can afford their chemotherapy drugs next month or indeed whether they will even be available? This is now the second delay and we are less than three weeks away from when, according to the budget, this measure is to be implemented.

             The government recognise—and I think this is an important point to make—that cancer is the leading burden of disease in Australia. The government are committed to tackling cancer and reducing its burden on Australian families. We said that this measure was to commence on 1 July 2009, with the resulting savings, but the implementation measure will be delayed briefly beyond 1 September. The government will provide a further update on our implementation plans in the near future to ensure that there is certainty for those people in the community who are affected by this. It is important to ensure that there is consultation with stakeholders so that we can be sure that these issues are well dealt with. One of the medicines, Avastin, was listed on the PBS from 1 July—
