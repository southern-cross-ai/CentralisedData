        My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts. Has the minister seen the report by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Institute
        </a>
        which warns of the dangers of advertising that sexualises children? Is the minister aware that research suggests that such advertising jeopardises the healthy development of children, can lead to severe eating disorders and sends a message to paedophiles that children are sexually available? Does the minister share community concern about advertising that sexualises children in the interests of the corporate bottom line and will the government strengthen media legislation to protect our children from exploitation?

         I thank Senator Stephens for her question. Yes, the government does take very seriously indeed advertising in relation to sexuality and the depiction of children in the media.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Children" rel="nofollow">
          The Children
         </a>
         ’s Television Standards impose obligations on broadcasters regarding the depiction of content and the times at which those matters can be broadcast. During children’s viewing times any advertisements must, of course, comply with the code and the classification standards. The Children’s Television Standards are currently being reviewed by the regulator, and the role of these matters in advertising is clearly going to be considered. The review is going to be undertaken later this year and should be completed early next year.
        </p>
        <p>
         All commercial television broadcasters are also governed by the Commercial Television Industry Code of Practice. The code covers, amongst other things, obligations regarding advertising and depiction of children and is designed to reflect prevailing community standards. The review of the code is due to commence in July 2007. It is worth pointing out also for Senator Stephens’s information that the Australian Association of National Advertisers code relating to advertising to children is obviously also relevant in relation to content.
        </p>
        <p>
         In July 2006 the government launched broader initiatives relating to healthy living that certainly affect matters such as advertising not only in terms of sexuality and depiction. That particular initiative relates to obesity and other issues of great significance to children. The issue really is that the government takes this matter seriously, together with all of the matters that the government is undertaking in relation to the initiatives on pornography and the depiction online of images of children. We are very serious about the review of these standards so that they can not only appropriately reflect community standards but also address the various serious concerns that parents have had as to the sexualisation of children and the times at which these matters might otherwise appear. We will be inviting submissions for the review of the code. Requests for those, as I understand, will be advertised in the press shortly.

          I ask a supplementary question,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
           Mr President
          </a>
          . I thank the minister for her answer. Is the minister aware that the retailer
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Jones" rel="nofollow">
           David Jones
          </a>
          is suing the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Institute" rel="nofollow">
           Australia Institute
          </a>
          because the institute criticised its use of children in company advertisements? Does the minister think it is appropriate for big business to use the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Practices_Act" rel="nofollow">
           Trade Practices Act
          </a>
          to circumvent state laws preventing companies from suing for defamation? Isn’t this just an attempt to bully not-for-profit researchers into silence on an issue of widespread public concern? When will the government act to stop this abuse of the legal system?

          <p>
           I would not accept that that is an abuse of the system. I do not know the instance that Senator Stephens refers to, so it is certainly not appropriate for me to comment further. However, I do make the point that, under the national system of advertising, advertisers are expected to comply with the advertisers code of ethics and the code of advertising for children. They have actually been adopted by the Australian Association of National Advertisers. The codes contain a range of provisions relating to taste and decency and are intended to reflect community values and expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are reviewing this particular matter, as I said in my primary answer. Complaints about any advertising, of course, can be made and obviously they have to be fair complaints. The processes by which anyone is accused of not complying with these codes have to be fair processes, Senator Stephens. Beyond that, because I am not aware of the circumstances, I do not believe it is appropriate to comment. The framework is there and the framework is working appropriately.
