        My question is to Senator Birmingham representing the Prime Minister. Last week Sky News was banned from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">
         YouTube
        </a>
        for spreading COVID-19 medical misinformation. Sky is broadcast on subscription and free-to-air television. What is the Morrison government doing to prevent the spread of COVID misinformation on our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her question. The provision of accurate information in relation to all health matters, but particularly in relation to COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccine rollout, is particularly important. The government is investing in communications to ensure that accurate, timely information is provided to Australians to give them reassurance about the facts around the COVID-19 vaccine availability, about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines as well. Those information measures that the government undertakes are important means of communicating with the Australian people along with, indeed, the support provided by many, be they by many in the media, be they by many in public life. Even people like the member for Maribyrnong, I note have being quite vocal in their information provision in relation to vaccines, including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
          AstraZeneca
         </a>
         vaccine. I welcome that.
        </p>
        <p>
         Obviously our media regulators are empowered under Australian laws to act where necessary. They have the processes in place in relation to the way in which they respond to complaints, conduct investigations and respond to such matters. Those processes don't involve political interference, but I am happy to seek any further information in terms of actions those regulators may be taking that could be provided to the chamber.

           Senator Rennick and George Christensen MP, both members of the Morrison government, have made several statements that have been flagged by online platforms like Facebook because they contradict medical advice and undermine medical experts. What is the Prime Minister doing to stop the spread of COVID misinformation from those sabotaging his own health response?

            As I indicated before, the government takes very seriously the importance of ensuring accurate and timely information is provided to Australians, providing them with reassurance about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines. I restate in this place the very thorough process that Australia went through. Unlike other parts of the world where there were emergency listings that short-cut regulatory approvals, in Australia we went through the thorough processes of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
             Therapeutic Goods Administration
            </a>
            to ensure the safety of the vaccines. In this country we have developed a type of modelling that, as you've heard from Senator Colbeck, outlines very clearly the efficacy of those vaccines. The fact is that, be it the Pfizer vaccine or the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
             AstraZeneca
            </a>
            vaccine, they reduce the rate of serious illness and indeed death by up to 90 per cent for eachâ€”

               I make it clear that false information shared online can create public confusion and can be harmful and create difficulties for vulnerable people in our community. That's why, as the government, we have developed a code of practice on disinformation and misinformation. It's why we have in place the regulatory processes that I spoke about before. As I indicated, I will bring back to the chamber any information in terms of regulatory actions underway.
