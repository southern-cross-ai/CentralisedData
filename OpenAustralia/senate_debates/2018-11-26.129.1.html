        . The government has announced it wants to make it easier to strip dual citizens convicted of terrorism related offences of their Australian citizenship and have them deported, so long as this would not render them stateless.

         I thank Senator Hanson for the question. Unfortunately, Senator Hanson, I am going to have to disagree with the proposition that you have put forward. Why? Because those of us on this side of the chamber, the Liberal-National government, are known for our very strong stance when it comes to border security and ensuring that Australians are safe. What we have announced recently builds on the suite of measures that we have progressively put in place since we were elected to office in 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the first instance, Senator Hanson, you will be aware that, when we came to office in 2013, we had to clean up the Labor-Greens mess. Labor and the Greens had outsourced our borders to the people smugglers. As a result, in excess of 50,000 people had come to our shores illegally. We, of course, had the issue of children in detention. We, of course, had the issue of detention centre after detention centre being opened. Progressively, we were able to put in policies to restore the integrity back to our borders and to ensure that, as a sovereign government, we decide who comes to Australia and the terms upon which they come.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is now, as you know, taking further steps to modernise and strengthen our counterterrorism legislation. The purpose of the amendments that we have announced is twofold: firstly, to keep Australians safe from evolving terrorist threats—and, Senator Hanson, you would be aware that the terrorist threats continue to evolve—and, secondly, to uphold the integrity of Australian citizenship and the privileges that attach to it. As has been outlined by the minister for border protection and the Prime Minister, we will be amending the Australian Citizenship Act 2007 so that a dual national convicted of a terrorist offence in Australia would be eligible to lose their Australian citizenship, irrespective of any custodial sentence.

           Minister, I am so pleased to hear that you're worried about border security and you're doing your best to actually make sure that Australian streets are safe for the people. But what is stopping the government from applying their proposed changes not just to terrorists but to other criminals with dual citizenship such as chronic repeat offenders, gang members or those convicted of severe violent crimes?

             Senator 'Hanson'—before you take a point of order! Senator Hanson, at this point in time, the government has announced that it is taking further steps to modernise and strengthen counterterrorism legislation. I don't think that you can argue that this government is anything but consistent when it comes to border security and counterterrorism legislation. We believe that, at all times, you must put Australians and Australia first. We believe that the No. 1 priority of a government is to be the security of its borders and the safety of Australians. And, as I stated, the announcements that have been made of late are in relation to modernising and strengthening counterterrorism legislation. We will always put the security of Australians first.

               Experts say many potential terrorists will plan a domestic attack if their passport is cancelled. In light of this, why has the government not changed its current policy on passport cancellation, when it knows full well the current policy places the lives of innocent Australians at risk?

                Thank you, Senator Hanson, and, again, I don't think there can be any argument in relation to the priority which this government gives to both border security and counterterrorism legislation. We take very, very seriously our responsibility to protect the Australian community from the risk of harm posed by noncitizens who engage in criminal activity or other behaviours of concern. Again, you would note that, in relation to the announcement that has been made of late, it is in relation to steps to modernise and strengthen counterterrorism legislation. I have to say that the Minister for
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
                 Home Affairs
                </a>
                , and, in fact, the Prime Minister, in his former role, have been absolutely outstanding in terms of ensuring that our border security and keeping Australians safe are absolute priorities for this government, and we will never shy away from that.
