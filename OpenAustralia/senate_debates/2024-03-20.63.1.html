        This morning I received a briefing from the National Emergency Management Agency regarding Cyclone Megan, currently impacting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        's north-east. While the classification has been downgraded to a tropical low, the situation in the Northern Territory remains a serious and dangerous one for many in remote communities, and flooding is a significant threat throughout the area. Because of how much rain the region has received during this wet season, it does not take much for a situation to take a devastating turn. Towns along the river, such as Borroloola, face the threat of floods. I encourage other inland communities, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_Hole" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Daguragu, to remain vigilant and to do their best to stay up to date with the latest from emergency services. I know that many in the area are having trouble getting in touch with emergency services. I invite those people to contact my office for any assistance that we can provide.
       </p>
       <p>
        Emergency services in the area are, of course, doing their very best. I commend them on their efforts so far. I also want to thank them for their continued work. I'd also like to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA" rel="nofollow">

        team for their work and for keeping me informed of the circumstances that many remote Territorians are currently facing. I do hope that all Territorians remain safe during this time. I also urge Territorians not to take any unnecessary risks and know that there are many that are ready to help when they can.
