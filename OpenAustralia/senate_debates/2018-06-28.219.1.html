When did the minister or his office first become aware of the BCA's intention to campaign in support of the Turnbull government's policy in South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania, and does the minister support the BCA's decision to use a front group to run a phony grassroots campaign?

            Yes, on relevance. The question in this one is when did the minister, or his office, first become aware? He said on the face of it he's not aware. We would ask him to take it on notice. We've asked him about his office, and he's not taking it on notice.

             Senator Collins, please resume your seat. Senators know I cannot instruct a minister on how to answer a question as long as he's being directly relevant. The question did have a substantial preamble. I believe that at the moment he's being directly relevant to the question.
