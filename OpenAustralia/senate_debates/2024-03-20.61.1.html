        8, Daniel and Kabay, who said the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our connection to the country doesn't stop at the water's edge … Our oceans have fed us, are home to our totems and are central to our culture.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are only here to comment on schedule 2 part 2 of the bill. We believe these provisions should be withdrawn. Consultation with traditional owners must be done properly. We have a right to a voice about what happens in our sea country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Jack Pascoe said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is not a process that we believe is consistent with free, prior and informed consent. We question why this bill is being brought now, while the

       <p class="italic">
        Our songlines are sacred to us. They have been passed on to us through lore, generation to generation, for the sustainability and longevity of all life on Earth. It is our collective responsibility to pass them on to our children intact.

        said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For us Tiwi people, our ties to sea country are so important to the survival of our connection to our cultural and spiritual beliefs, which non-Indigenous people may not understand or comprehend … We will always be part of the sea environment and the land where our ancestors lived, where they are buried and where they practised our ancient culture.

        Finally, Raeleen Cooper, traditional custodian of Murujuga, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is shameful and disgraceful that this government is using a bill designed to protect workers after injuries and deaths at Woodside's Burrup Hub to wipe out environmental approvals.
