        Mr Deputy President, I have a question to raise with you. It is a matter of regret that the President has left the chair because I was hoping to raise this matter with him. There is no doubt that Senator Hutchins was unusually slow—some would say unnaturally slow—in asking his questions, which were—

            I think in any observer’s mind, simply designed to wind down the clock and deny the opposition a further question. If order within the Senate is to be maintained, those sorts of tactics do need to be dealt with and dealt with very expeditiously by the chair. I therefore simply draw that to your attention and seek that the President come back with a ruling as to that sort of behaviour.

            <p>
             Mr Deputy President, I listened carefully to Senator Abetz’s question. I think you, Mr Deputy President, Senator Abetz and other senators in the chamber would be aware that I rarely receive, and never ask for, questions from government senators to me during question time. I think the record stands very clear on this. In this case, Senator Hutchins, I know, had a close interest in this particular matter.
            </p>
            <p>
             From my own perspective, I have to say that I wanted to add to my answer after question time because I did not have an opportunity to provide all the information that I think it was necessary to provide due to the time available and interruptions and the like. Normally I would not worry, but when a senator is asked in a question to provide a guarantee and does not have time to provide the guarantee, there is always a risk that these things might be misinterpreted.
            </p>
            <p>
             However, in speaking to Senator Abetz’s point, I am making absolutely clear that there was no request from me that this issue be slowed. I have no interest at all in curtailing question time. In fact, I do know that senators and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
              Procedure Committee
             </a>
             members are looking at the issue of how we might be able to curtail supplementaries by Senate processes—perhaps by sessional orders and perhaps even by standing orders. I know that is a matter that is currently being considered by senators around the chamber. If there is an insinuation—and I am not suggesting that there was—that there was any request from me or a member of the executive, I can assure you, Senator Abetz, that it would be wrong. If you want to ask me any number of questions, please feel free.

              I am sure Senator Abetz was by no means insinuating any inference against Senator Faulkner whatsoever. I am sure Senator Faulkner did not take it that way and certainly Senator Abetz did not mean it that way. But I think it was obvious to all on this side that Senator Hutchins was speaking in an extraordinarily slow and delayed fashion, which is not the normal way that he asks a question. I do think that, if this place is to operate effectively, we have to operate on normal procedures and people must ask their questions normally, not prolong them in such a fashion as to ensure that the opposition is denied a question. I do not think that goes to the good running of the Senate and I would ask the government to consider that matter in the future conduct of question time.

               I will discuss the issue with the President. I think those who are watching or listening to the broadcast will make their own judgments as to what took place. I do not believe that there was any breach of standing orders because we already have time limits on the asking of questions, and how senators choose to speak is not something that is covered in standing orders. I think it is a matter we will reflect on and I will certainly discuss it with the President.

                There was no aspersion at all, in relation to my point, on Senator Faulkner, but might I say there absolutely was on Senator Hutchins. His is the behaviour that we on this side are complaining about.

                 On that point, it is not appropriate for you to cast aspersions on Senator Hutchins, as you know, Senator Abetz. You may be critical of Senator Hutchins or any other senator in the chamber, but it is actually out of order to cast aspersions in that way on a senator.
