           I thank Senator Madigan for his question. I am asked about, essentially, why people should believe the Treasury modelling. The government absolutely stands by the Treasury modelling. These are the finest modellers in the country. Despite the denigration that has occurred of Treasury by those opposite and in the other place—which I have to say was a new low in the debate in the other place earlier this week—these are the people who advised Prime Minister Howard, these are the people who advised Treasurer Costello and these are the people whose advice was taken by former Prime Minister Howard when he put in place a policy to impose a price on carbon.
          </p>
          <p>
           The modelling that was originally done in 2008 was updated by the Treasury. It was one of if not the most extensive, robust and thorough exercises in economic modelling ever performed in Australia. It has stood up to scrutiny from various sources and remains one of the most well-documented, transparent and credible modelling exercises undertaken, which puts it, if I may say, in stark contrast with the Victorian state modelling which was previously released and misconstrued by the state Treasurer and the Premier, who formerly supported a price on carbon. In terms of jobs, I would remind—

                 It is true that reducing emissions by 2020 will require transformation of the energy sector. What I would say to the senator is that both parties acknowledge that. In fact, Mr Hunt, for those opposite, after the last election, pointed out that, were they in government, they would be negotiating the conversion of both Hazelwood and Yallourn from brown coal to gas. That would have an impact on electricity prices and that would have an impact as well, obviously, on the nature of those plants. Both parties are committed to reducing emissions. In response to your question, we would justify implementing the reduction in emissions through a price on carbon for a very simple reason: it will cost Australians less. It will cost taxpayers less, it will cost Australian families less and it will cost Australian business less.

                   Unsurprisingly, I do not accept the senator's proposition about devastation. I would point to the evidence which shows we can continue to grow the economy as well as grow jobs whilst putting a price on carbon. I would also point the senator to the very significant set of assistance that the government is providing through various parts of the clean energy package, which are about supporting jobs and communities. They include the Energy Security Fund, the regional structural adjustment assistance package and a range of other measures, including in the $9-plus billion Jobs and Competitiveness package.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The government is very conscious of the importance of supporting industries and communities through the transition, but I again say that the coalition also wishes to reduce emissions by the same amount as the government; the difference is their policy will cost Australian families more. It will cost families more, it will cost taxpayers more and it will cost Australian business more, and that is what the Australian Treasury has said.

                     I am acutely aware of the risks, particularly in the global economy, and I spoke about some of those yesterday. If the senator with an interest in this matter has taken the time to read the various

                     documents which have come out in the last couple of days, he would see that one of the things that is spoken of consistently by the IMF is the importance of a sound and transparent fiscal strategy. I would have hoped that the senator who was once in this portfolio in the opposition would care about the fact that his colleagues have no fiscal strategy, have a $70 billion black hole, went to the last election refusing to disclose to the Australian people what their policies cost—

They have not yet once got their numbers right—and numbers that matter. What they have is a $70 billion black hole.

                                     Broad based taxes on greenhouse gas emissions are the most natural policy instrument as they exploit all possible behavioural responses for reducing emissions throughout the economy.

Isn't the government's refusal—both version 1 and version 2—to consider the delay more to do with their reliance on the Greens to stay in power than their ever-shifting belief in a carbon tax and their ever-shifting belief in who their leader should be?
