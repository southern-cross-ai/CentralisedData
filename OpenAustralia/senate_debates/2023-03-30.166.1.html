        I've got a ripper for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. After a decade of inaction on climate thanks to those opposite, the Albanese government is taking decisive action to combat challenges of climate change. The passage of the safeguard mechanism legislation delivers landmark reforms that will result in the reduction of 205 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions to 2030. Minister, why does Australian agriculture support action on climate change?

         Thank you, Senator Sterle. It's really nice to get a question about agriculture. I've had questions from Senator Sterle, Senator Ciccone and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_White" rel="nofollow">
          Senator White
         </a>
         —all sorts of senators over here—but I never get a question from the National Party about agriculture. It seems that they've given up.
        </p>
        <p>
         Due to the Senate's efforts today, Australia is one step closer to reaching net zero by 2050—not just meeting the target but ensuring our economy is geared up to take advantage of the opportunities that will come with it. The safeguard mechanism reforms passed by the Senate today will deliver 205 million tonnes of emissions reduction by 2030. So, after 10 long years—and a couple more days—of delay and dysfunction, Australia now has sensible reforms to ensure Australia's largest emitters reduce their emissions while remaining competitive in a decarbonising global economy. We know Senator Canavan and his mates will never accept reality. We know they'll never open their eyes to what is happening around the world. But the rest of the world is moving on. I'm telling you it's moving on.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is fantastic news for farmers, along with everyone else in our agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors, because the truth is that, as much of the former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Country Party
         </a>
         used to recognise, our farmers are on the front line of climate change in this country. Whether it's repeated flooding, more intense fires, more severe cyclones, larger hail or more prolonged drought, the impacts of climate induced disasters are hitting our farms and their bottom line, driving up the price of fruit and veggies for consumers. In fact, we know from ABARES modelling that climate change has reduced annual average farm profits by 23 per cent, or around $29,000 per farm, due to seasonal weather changes over the last 20 years. It is well beyond time for this country to take action.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're not telling the ag industry something they don't already agree with. Whether it's the

           The Australian people, businesses and farmers have long been calling for action on climate change. What opportunities will the Albanese government's strong action on climate change create for Australian farmers, Minister?

            Thanks again, Senator Sterle. I think you've asked five times as many questions about agriculture as the National Party have since the election, but, you know, that's just the kind of guy you are.
           </p>
           <p>
            The latest ABARES figures show that, on the back of good conditions for the past few seasons, farm incomes are at record highs. While obviously this isn't the case for everyone, on the whole it is a good time to be in the agriculture sector. But imagine how high those incomes could have been if action was taken on climate change 20 years ago, not today. As I say, we know what difference it would have made. ABARES tells us that farm incomes have suffered by 23 per cent due to seasonal climate and weather conditions.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also know that climate change presents an ongoing risk to farmers, especially given the inevitability that drought is around the corner. That's why having a diversified income is vital for our nation's farmers. Increased activity in the carbon market will provide that opportunity, along with the activity in the nature repair market, which will be able to happen now that Labor has introduced legislation to make it happen.

              Under the previous government, climate inaction was a deliberate policy choice and, as a result, we saw increases in emissions. What risk do farmers face if we do not take action on climate change?

              <p>
               Thank you again, Senator Sterle. Of course there are long-term natural impacts that come with not addressing climate change. I see them almost every day in my role as Minister for Emergency Management. In fact, I was recently in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Carpentaria" rel="nofollow">
                Gulf of Carpentaria
               </a>
               after the floods there. There were more media reports this morning suggesting that early estimates from gulf flooding are that tens of thousands of head of cattle could have perished. These are the events we will see more often if we don't take action on climate change.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's not just those economic and environmental impacts that farmers face as a result of climate change. It is crucial to our position as a trusted trading partner around the globe that we continue to increase our sustainability effort. Who could forget those embarrassing images of former prime minister
