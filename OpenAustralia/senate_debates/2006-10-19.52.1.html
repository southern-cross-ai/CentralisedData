        As chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Crime_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Crime Commission
        </a>
        , I present the report on the examination of the annual report for 2004-05 of the Australian Crime Commission, together with the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        record of proceedings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be printed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The duties of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission are prescribed in section 55 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002. These duties include the examining of each annual report of the Australian Crime Commission and reporting to parliament on any matter appearing in or arising out of that report. In the course of its scrutiny of the Australian Crime Commission report, the committee held a hearing in Canberra on 28 March. The committee made a number of recommendations which I draw to the attention of the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Briefly, I highlight the first recommendation that the act be amended to provide for the appointment to the board of the Australian Crime Commission of the Commissioner of Taxation. The committee thought that the appointment of the taxation commissioner would enhance the role of the Australian Crime Commission and lead to better administration of the fight against serious and organised crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the other recommendations that I would highlight to the Senate is that the act be amended to prescribe the maximum number of examiners to be appointed. Examiners have very wide coercive powers and the use of examiners has extended—and I think for all the right reasons. However, the committee thought that, because of the very extensive powers of examiners, parliament should keep an eye on just how many examiners were appointed. The other recommendations are worthwhile, but time does not permit me to go through them in any detail.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conducting the evaluation of the annual report, the committee particularly wants to acknowledge the assistance of the Chairman of the Australian Crime Commission Board, Commissioner Mick Keelty, and of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Australian Crime Commission, Mr Alastair Milroy, and his officers. Throughout the reporting period, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACC" rel="nofollow">
         ACC
        </a>
        provided considerable assistance to the committee through written reports and briefings as well as through verbal presentations. The commission’s willingness to assist the committee has been of great assistance and has contributed to a transparent and cooperative relationship. On behalf of the committee, I would also like to acknowledge the considerable assistance given by the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor John MacMillan, and his staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to recognise the committee secretariat for their work and assistance. I must say that, as a former minister and now a backbencher, without the research and clerical staff to which I had become accustomed, I perhaps more than many understand how important it is to have the assistance of qualified, talented advisers in performing the duties which both the parliament and the Australian public expect the committees of the Senate and the parliament to do.
