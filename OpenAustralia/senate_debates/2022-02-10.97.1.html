        My question is to the Attorney-General. Minister, I just read this headline from the ABC, 'Government shelves religious freedom bill indefinitely'. Can you confirm that you no longer plan to bring on the Religious Discrimination Bill for debate in the Senate before the election?

         Thank you, Senator Rice, and thank you for your question on the very important topic of protecting Australians from discrimination on the basis of their religion. The bill actually passed the House of Representatives last night—the Religious Discrimination Bill. It passed with the government amendments. But in relation to another bill, which

               As I said, the Morrison-Joyce government takes issues of discrimination very seriously in Australia. We are committed to protecting Australians of faith and those not of faith from discrimination on the basis of their religion. And, as I said, the bill passed the House of Representatives last night. We made a commitment to the Australian people at the last election that we would, on this issue, address it, and we are progressing that commitment. But when amendments passed the House of Representatives, supported by the right of Labor, that have the potential impact of actually increasing the discrimination and the grounds of discrimination that can actually now be against students, we take that seriously.

                 Minister, thank you for your non-answer to my question. We are still in the dark as to whether the government will bring on the bill. The media is full of headlines: 'Bill on ice', 'Indefinitely delayed', 'Bill not proceed'. Minister, given that, and I take it that it's not going to proceed, why won't you commit to taking meaningful action to protect people of faith rather than this sham bill which was the rushed product of right-wing culture wars?

                  and those on the coalition side in government. We believe in protecting people of faith from discrimination, and we made a commitment to the Australian people. We consulted widely, across the board, and we presented to the parliament what was a fair and reasonable bill. It honoured our commitment to people of faith to protect them from discrimination on the basis of their religion. Senator Rice, do you think it is fair for a Muslim to be discriminated against in employment? Do you think it is fair? Do you think it is fair for a Sikh to be discriminated against in employment? Do you think it is fair—

                    On a point of order, the answer to those questions of course is no. But I'd draw to your attention,

It leaves out protections for those in the intersex community. This is why you need to properly understand the consequences of amendments that you make.
