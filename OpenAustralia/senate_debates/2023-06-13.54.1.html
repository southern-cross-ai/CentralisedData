        . Having a safe and affordable place to call home is critical for all Australians, but after a decade of policy delay and failure by the former coalition government we've seen increasing homelessness and homeownership out of reach for so many people around our country. Can the minister explain how the Albanese government is addressing housing challenges for Australians through its ambitious housing reform agenda, and what obstacles may be blocking its path?

           Well, if you'll listen, I'll tell you. Fundamental to our plan is increasing the supply of new housing. The Housing Australia Future Fund will be the largest boost to social and affordable rental in a decade. I'll repeat that for you, Senator: our fund, the future fund, will be the largest boost to social and affordable homes in a decade, a guaranteed ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable rental homes. The 30,000 homes the fund will deliver in its first five years are one part of the Albanese government's ambitious housing agenda.
          </p>
          <p>
           It's astounding to me that there are those opposite who are all too happy to acknowledge the problem but then block the solutions, blocking homes for people in need right across the country, blocking the solution that is supported by the homelessness sector, the housing sector and every state and housing minister in the country. I think most Australians would be appalled that there are people in this place prepared to vote no to more social and affordable rental housing.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Albanese government's ambitious housing reform agenda will deliver the housing Australia needs, and we call on those opposite—that's all of you—to put aside the grandstanding and support the Housing Australia Future Fund.

              I thank Senator Smith for her first supplementary question. Yes, I can, Senator Smith. The Albanese government hit the ground running and is already delivering on its housing commitments. The Minister for Housing, who's doing a terrific job, has announced and visited many of the new developments and homes our reforms are delivering. There are projects delivering new affordable rental homes in places which include Westmead, Adelaide, north-west Tasmania, Balaklava and Brisbane, to name just a few—and they're just the start.
             </p>
             <p>
              In addition to these early measures, the Housing Australia Future Fund will deliver 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes in the fund's first five years and set up a guaranteed ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable rental homes into the future.

                 Thank you, Senator Smith, for your second supplementary question. Yes, I can answer those questions. The National Housing and Homelessness Agreement sends approximately $1.7 billion each year to the states for addressing housing and homelessness. The Albanese government has offered a $67.5 million funding boost to assist the states' delivery of homelessness services for the coming year.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The homelessness sector is also eagerly awaiting the passage of the Housing Australia Future Fund. In its first five years, the fund's return will deliver $100 million for crisis and traditional housing for women and children and $30 million to build housing and services for veterans. Emma, of the National Shelter, said:
