        My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister for Finance and Administration. Can the minister confirm that the former Minister for the Environment and Heritage agreed in August last to pay $150,000 in legal costs to the company
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_Power" rel="nofollow">
         Wind Power
        </a>
        ? Weren’t these taxpayers’ dollars used to settle the action the company had brought against the former minister over his decision to block the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Bald Hills
        </a>
        wind farm? Didn’t the former minister also rack up $100,000 in Commonwealth legal expenses on a case he was never going to win before settling out of court on the company’s terms? Minister, isn’t it true that your government has played politics with the Bald Hills wind farm right from the start?

         I have no knowledge of the matters to which the senator refers. The question really should be asked of the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
          Water Resources
         </a>
         . I take this opportunity to say to the Senate that Senator Ian Campbell was one of the finest environment ministers this parliament has had. He did an outstanding job as minister for the environment. He was properly promoted to the position of Minister for Human Services and was doing an outstanding job in that portfolio as well at the time of his resignation. He will long be remembered for his tremendous service as the minister for the environment. The passion he brought to that portfolio and his tremendous work in a whole range of endeavours in that portfolio will be remembered by this nation and acknowledged as such.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware that the $250,000 spent by taxpayers to defend the former minister’s illegal decision is almost four times the amount spent by the government in 2005-06 on protecting the orange-bellied parrot? Why was more money spent defending the former minister’s politically motivated blocking of the wind farm than defending a threatened species?

           It is outrageous of the senator to walk in here and accuse a sitting senator of acting illegally. It is an outrageous suggestion and I would ask him to withdraw it.

            On reflection, Senator Marshall, I do believe you may have imputed improper motives to a senator. I ask you to withdraw.
