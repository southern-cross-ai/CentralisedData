        Endometriosis is a disease that is estimated to affect one in seven Australian women. It's an untreatable, unpreventable and, in many cases, extremely painful disease. One woman in every seven is a significant number. It's a complex disorder that can disrupt every aspect of a woman's life from physical health to emotional wellbeing, engagement at work and the ability to conceive. It can be difficult to diagnose endometriosis, which often means a young woman can have multiple years of intense pain, emotional distress, frustration, anxiety and uncertainty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Olivia and Isobel are two cousins in Tasmania who suffer from endometriosis, and I've heard their story. They speak of having to choose between a specialist appointment and an important work priority. They speak of having to exhaust their sick leave to cope with the disease. They speak of feeling as though their voices are not being heard.
       </p>
       <p>
        The health and wellbeing of women and girls is something I'm very passionate about, and I'm proud to be part of a government committed to taking endometriosis and women's health seriously. As part of the 2022-23 budget, the Albanese Labor government announced a $58.3 million package for endometriosis and pelvic pain. This includes the establishment of 22 clinics, an Australian firstâ€”one in each state and territory. These clinics will provide life-changing support for women and girls who've suffered in silence for far too long. The endometriosis and pelvic pain clinic in Tasmania has been established in Glenorchy at the Family Planning Tasmania offices. This clinic provides expert multidisciplinary services and care for women. Family Planning Tasmania will receive more than $700,000 over four years to support the hiring of specialised staff, including nurse practitioners and allied health professionals, and investment in equipment and training.

        This month, March, is Endometriosis Awareness Month. It is fantastic to see many buildings in my home state of Tasmania lit up in yellow, the Endometriosis Awareness Month colour, as part of Endo Enlightened to mark the start of this significant month. It's an opportunity to raise awareness and understanding of endometriosis. By promoting education and empathy, we can create a more supportive environment for women with endometriosis and encourage open dialogue that is free from any stigma. Supporting women with endometriosis can lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention and improved outcomes for women. We can all play a role.
       </p>
       <p>
        Take the time to learn about endo, its symptoms and treatments, and the challenges women and girls face. Understanding the condition better will enable you to offer informed support and empathy. There are some incredible resources available, especially through organisations like Endometriosis Australia, which has been promoting awareness, pursuing advocacy, producing resources and information, and highlighting the impact of endometriosis in the workplace for over a decade. Recognise that the symptoms of endometriosis can fluctuate, and women may need to adjust their activities or schedules accordingly. Be flexible and understanding if plans need to be changed at the last minute due to pain or fatigue. Help raise awareness about endo by sharing accurate information, participating in awareness campaigns or having conversations with your close ones to educate them about the condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Women with endometriosis deserve to be heard, believed and supported in their management of the disease. It's our job to be open, adaptable and understanding. It's our job to keep challenging the stigma or any misconceptions around the disease. We will continue to take endometriosis seriously and provide the best support we can to the many thousands of Australian women who suffer from it.
