        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, how much has been added to monthly repayments on the average $750,000 mortgage since Labor was elected in May 2022?

         I don't have the figures on that in front of me, but we know that we have been experiencing a period of higher inflation than we would want. Certainly, when we came to government, we know what the inflation figures were, and the independent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         has made its decision when it comes to interest rates. What I would say to the senator is that obviously the way in which we seek to deal with this, as Senator Gallagher and the Treasurer have outlined and have made clear in their budget, is to balance those competing economic considerations—that is, to ensure we do respond to the challenges that Australians are experiencing in terms of cost of living and to deliver responsible cost-of-living relief but doing it in a way that manages inflation. If you look at the recent inflation figures and what inflation would have been but for some of the measures of this government, including in relation to energy and rent, you can see that is what we are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         We obviously understand Australians are doing it tough, and we understand that the inflationary environment and interest rate changes have made life much more difficult for many people. That is why we are doing what we can to deliver cost-of-living relief for Australians, as well as delivering budget surpluses rather than just talking about them. Now we're putting it on mugs. But I would also say this: we on this side have been clear about how we approach this. Those opposite have opposed cost-of-living relief time and again and continue to do so.

                Point of order on relevance: I was very clear, and it was a very short sentence. It was about real household disposable income and the fall over the two years. Obviously, what the minister is saying is one piece of that data. The other piece of the data is how much of that has been eaten up by inflation.

                  Senator McKenzie, I think we have been very clear about the challenge inflation poses to consumers and to the economy. And that is why we are working to respond to it in the most responsible way that we can. We don't have the same view that your party does that the way to respond to a high inflationary environment is to push back on wage increases.

                     I think that's the same as a question that was answered earlier by Senator Gallagher. As she pointed out, we don't speculate on interest rate increases or interest rate movements. Decisions on that are made by the independent

                     . I do think it's interesting—isn't it, colleagues?—how much those opposite are barracking for an interest rate increase. If you ever want to see an example of the way in which the coalition are always happy to look at their own political interests, this is it.

                           I can comment on the barracking by Senator McKenzie and those opposite: you are always happy to try to see Australians lose if you think you will win. The only people in this country barracking for an interest rate increase are Senator McKenzie and her colleagues. They are the only people in this country who are seeking to barrack for an interest rate increase. Shame on you!
