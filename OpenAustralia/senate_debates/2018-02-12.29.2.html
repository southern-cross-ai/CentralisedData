         <i>
          Closing the gap
         </i>
         report, which was tabled by the Prime Minister in the other place, has shown the most promising results, with three of the seven Closing the Gap targets now on track to be met. Encouragingly, we have seen improvements in health outcomes, with the target to halve child mortality back on track. Education outcomes are also improving. I'm pleased to report that, thanks to the collaborative approach of government service providers in communities, the current early childhood education target is on track for the first time. Year 12 attainment remains on track. Whilst the remaining targets may not be on track, we've achieved solid progress in other target areas compared to a decade ago.

         We on this side know that the best form of support we can provide is in the form of a job. Today the Prime Minister announced the first ever comprehensive road map for growing the Indigenous business sector, the Indigenous Business Sector Strategy. The Prime Minister also announced that our game-changing Indigenous Procurement Policy has reached $1 billion in Commonwealth contractsâ€”pretty successful given that in 2012-13 Indigenous businesses were winning only $6.2 million in contracts. The establishment of the Indigenous business hubs, which are going to be anchored in some of the major cities, includes a one-stop shop for business advice and support starting in

         in partnership with the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council. I plead with those on the other side: you should do what you can to ensure that all levels of governments are cooperating in this process. There is the $27 million Indigenous Entrepreneurs Capital Scheme to unlock a range of finance and capital products for Indigenous businesses that are transitioning to mainstream banking. We've also doubled the microfinance footprint across Australia to support more entrepreneurial activity.

            The government is committed to the Closing the Gap agenda, but, with the expiry of four of the seven targets, there is an opportunity to refresh targets to ensure they are focused on delivering the change that we know we need. We need targets to be developed in partnership with Aboriginal and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
             Torres Strait Islander
            </a>
            Australians and not by government alone, but we also need the state and territory governments to be at the table, because we know that, while the Commonwealth can do a great deal, many of the levers of change are in fact held by the states and other jurisdictions. In the area of justice, the practical reality is that the state and territory governments have the responsibility for the justice system and for the corrections system. The custody notification service is a state and territory responsibility, and, because we know it saves lives, I have offered to every state and territory to fund it for three years. We made this offer on 31 August 2017. I'm disappointed that none of the states are yet to take up this offer. I call on everyone here to support this.

               We are absolutely committed to continuing the bipartisan focus on the Closing the Gap agenda, but with four of the seven targets expiring there's an opportunity to refresh these. We need to use the best evidence in how we go about doing that. We'll be ensuring that our targets are specific, measurable, agreed on, realistic, and time framed. That's smart targeting. That's international best practice with targets. This is the principle across our work. That's why we're working in partnership with the Healing Foundation to complete a detailed analysis to inform our future actions to support the surviving members of the stolen generations. That's why we'd encourage those opposite to better consider its approach when it would only appear to support around 106 of the surviving members of the stolen generationsâ€”well below initial estimates, which indicate the number might be as high at 500.

                </i>
                found that since the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing commenced in 2008, overcrowding amongst Indigenous households has fallen from 52.1 per cent to 37.4 per centâ€”a reduction of 28 per cent. The review also found that Queensland, WA and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                 South Australia
                </a>
                exceeded their targets for Indigenous housing refurbishments by 23 per cent, 35 per cent and 60 per cent respectively. Minister, given the findings of your own

                 Remote housing review

                 Perhaps that's one of the challenges with question time: you're stuck with the same question. I provided the answer to that before, in my first answer to Senator Dodson. I'm not moving away from any of those things. If we're going to stop overcrowding, the refurbishment of a couch doesn't provide an additional bedroom or more houses. The only things that provide that are a rebuild or a new house.

                  Can I
                 </a>
                 make it absolutely clear: we're not moving away from this, but we want to hold the states and territories to account. In the first five years of the program, under programs like
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP" rel="nofollow">
                  CHIP
                 </a>
                 , it was an absolute outrage, with jurisdictions taking 15 per cent and not putting a single cent into the process. So, yes, we have used our independent review into housing to look very carefully at those processes. I'll tell you what it means when a state says, 'Oh, we've exceeded our number.' That means: 'I didn't build a house because it was too hard. I took the money for that and I painted up a couple of others.' I can give you heaps of examples of the disingenuous approaches from the remainder of the jurisdictions of all political persuasions. I can promise you we are engaging, but we're ensuring that the states actually have funds on the tableâ€”rather than us just putting money into their budgets and the outcomes turning up in a whole variety of places, but not necessarily in remote communitiesâ€”and are actually putting it towards reducing the number, which means investing in houses and in rebuilds. The refurbishments are a very small part of this, and they are far easier to do than going out and building a new house or rebuilding a house on a new site.

                   Given that in Queensland alone the NPRH has supported 2,640 jobs over the past 10 years and currently supports a growing number of Indigenous businesses, along with more than 850 Indigenous apprentices and trainees, why are you withdrawing Indigenous housing support as a result of these?

                      We have indicated that we've undertaken in the

                      , because that's the only bilateral that's been finished, to put in $120 million a year and that the Northern Territory would be matching it. So, that is the way it's going. We are looking to the states and territories, who I suspect actually withdrew. So in the places where we're requiring NPRH to be built, there was a decision by those jurisdictions to act by not spending a cent of the funds that the Commonwealth invests and that they should invest in remote communities. We've yet to find out if that is the case. I hope I'm wrong, but I have seen absolutely no evidence to demonstrate that they have taken any other course.

So, instead of saying, 'Oh, I know somebody who owns an Indigenous business,' we will be buying bricks and mortar and we will be ensuring that Indigenous businesses are out there building those homes, because that's how we have to value-add to it. There is no point just saying, 'Oh, we're doing things with Aboriginal people,' instead of to them. You've got to actually do that. And this is another example of how this government has delivered on that promise.
