        My question is to the Senator representing the Senator representing the Prime Minister, the Hon.

        . Yesterday the Prime Minister reportedly stated during a party room meeting that the Senate crossbench is feral. I understand this to mean that every crossbench senator in this chamber in the eyes of the Prime Minister is feral. As Australian senators, we carry out our responsibilities with great pride, honour and diligence. Why would the Prime Minister of Australia call the crossbench feral and, by implication, therefore call every crossbench senator in this great chamber feral? Does the minister believe such language will be helpful to positively negotiate with the Senate in the future?

            Senator Lazarus, I can assure you that the Prime Minister and every minister in the government have the greatest respect for the eight crossbench senators, including for you. We may disagree with you, as plainly we do on a number of important measures, but we respect you personally, and we respect your constitutional position and the way in which you discharge it.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I am bound to say that the Prime Minister and the government are frustrated at the fact that so much legislation that is important to the Australian people has been blocked by this chamber.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
             The Senate
            </a>
            should be a chamber of review, a house of review—not a house of refusal. Yet time and time again, the Labor Party and the Greens—with which, I am sorry to say, on occasions the crossbench senators have joined—have blocked important legislation. The most recent example is the government's higher education reforms. As we all know, last night this chamber blocked those reforms and, in doing so, dealt a terrible setback to the Australian higher education sector, a terrible setback to Australian universities—

               This is a package of measures that had the strong support of 40 of the 41 Australian university vice-chancellors. Forty out of 41 thought that this was a good thing for the Australian university sector.

                , I ask a supplementary question. According to dictionary.com, the word 'feral' means 'existing in a natural state, as animals; not domesticated; or wild like a pack of feral dogs or wild animals roaming the woods'. Did the Prime Minister have any senator in mind when he referred to the Senate crossbench as 'feral'? Is the Prime Minister going to apologise to each and every one of us for such an appalling and disrespectful statement?

                 The Prime Minister certainly did not say that about the crossbench. He did not say that about the crossbench. It may be that the Prime Minister had some senators in mind, Senator Lazarus, but, if he did, it was not you.

                           There is no point of order. It would be no surprise to any senator in the chamber that I did not hear the comments of Senator Brandis, because of the level of noise within the chamber. If Senator Brandis has said something which needs to be withdrawn, I will leave it up to Senator Brandis to make that assessment. Please can we just keep the noise down. The odd interjection can be amusing but not the level that we have had.

                            , I was merely speculating on what might have been in the Prime Minister's mind; I was not making a comment about any individual senator. Amidst all this merriment and jollity, Senator Lazarus, there is a more important point to be made. These higher education bills are absolutely critical for the university sector. I know that we have not yet been able to persuade you and others of the crossbench to support them, but the government will, after a period of deliberation, be re-presenting these bills.

                             , I ask a further supplementary question. Rather than describing Senate crossbenchers as 'feral', wouldn't it be better for the government to actually consider the Senate's suggestions? For example, yesterday's Senate references committee report regarding higher education recommended a proper review into costs and funding of the sector and alternatives to deregulation. Will the government take this recommendation on board or just keep calling senators names?

                              Senator, I have assured you that that statement was not made by the Prime Minister about the crossbenchers. But I will tell you, Senator Lazarus, because I know that you have been engaged in this discussion, I know that you have been good enough to give the minister and his staff a good audience on these bills, we will re-present the higher education legislation in a few months time. In the meantime, if you will entertain us, we will continue to try and persuade you why 40 out of the 41 Australian university vice-chancellors are right. We will seek to persuade you why, for example, the Nobel laureate Professor Brian Schmidt was right when he said:

                             <p class="italic">
                              … this is an incredibly important reform. The current university funding model is … not very good. I would say it's close to being broken.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              We will continue, with respect, to seek to persuade you, Senator.
