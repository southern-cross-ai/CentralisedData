           The government acknowledges the United Nations World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims and the invaluable work of emergency services across the globe in responding to and assisting those in need. Road safety is a key priority of this government. No-one should be killed or seriously injured on our roads. The government commends the work of Mr Peter Frazer in his tireless advocacy in the promotion of road safety across the country. The government commissioned an independent inquiry into the effectiveness of the National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020, which was released in September. The government will continue to work with key road safety stakeholders, all levels of government and the parliament. To this end, the Deputy Prime Minister recently wrote to all members of parliament and senators and chaired a discussion with his state transport ministerial counterparts.
