        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Following Senator Parry's resignation from this place, the Prime Minister said to the media:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I learned about it probably about the same time you did, on Tuesday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is the Prime Minister so out of the loop that Senator Fifield and other senior members of the government were aware of concerns about former Senator Parry's eligibility, but he was not?

         Senator Farrell, none of that is correct. None of what you have asserted is correct. The fact is that the Prime Minister was travelling—indeed, in transit—during part of the time. Senator Fifield has addressed the question. I don't think the characterisation you've placed on what you heard from Senator Fifield earlier in the day or earlier in question time is fair or accurate. What the Prime Minister said at his press conference in Israel, that he heard about the matter at about the same time the journalists heard about it—when the news broke, I think it was on a Tuesday afternoon—I'm sure was accurate.

           I refer to media reports which state that former Senator Parry spoke to 'various ministers'. What steps has the Prime Minister taken in order to determine which senior members of the government, or officers, were aware of concerns about former Senator Parry's eligibility but withheld the information?

            Once again, Senator Farrell, with respect, you are misrepresenting the position. Those words have never been attributed to Senator Parry. The words you quoted are speculation by some journalists, not the attribution of words to Senator Parry.

               Senator Fifield has always conducted himself on this, as on every other occasion during his career as a minister, in an exemplary fashion. He explained to the chamber, candidly and thoroughly this morning, the nature of the conversations he had with Senator Parry. None of those conversations warrant the characterisation that you have placed upon them or the imputation you make.
              </p>
              <p>
               Senator Fifield has at all times upheld and, I'm sure, will always continue to uphold the letter and the spirit of the ministerial standards.
