        My question is to Senator Cormann, the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to yesterday's release of the

        Monthly Business Survey for August 2019, where their chief economist, Alan Oster, said:

         The only thing that is floundering, as I said yesterday, is Labor's socialist economic agenda, which was comprehensively rejected by the Australian people at the last election. There are always various comments that are issued by various banks. I could refer you to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBS" rel="nofollow">
          UBS
         </a>
         analysis, which has suggested that, in the September quarter, growth is expected to nearly double compared to the June quarter, on the back of our income tax cuts. You know what our income tax cuts have done? They've put $15 billion more money into workers' pockets. They have increased the take-home pay of workers around Australia. You would have thought that the Labor Party would say that's a good thing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course the Australian economy is facing headwinds. Of course we are facing global economic headwinds. And other substantial economies around the world, like Germany, the United Kingdom and others, are actually going backwards. We are continuing to grow. The reason we're continuing to grow is because of our plan to build a stronger economy, and it's because fiscal policy and monetary policy are working in the same direction. As well as lower interest rates, we've got lower income taxes, we've got more investment in infrastructure and we've got an ambitious free-trade agenda helping our exporting businesses sell more Australian products and services around the world, which is very ably prosecuted by none other than the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, my good friend and colleague Senator Birmingham. We've got an ambitious agenda to reduce the regulatory burden on business to make it easier for business to be successful and hire more Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me tell you: these sorts of questions show that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         still does not accept the verdict of the Australian people at the last election. All of these arguments were put to the Australian people in the lead-up to the last election. And you know what? They opted for our plan of lower taxes—pro growth, pro business, pro jobs—and they voted against your socialist agenda and the politics of envy.

            Clearly, Senator Gallacher was provided a question by the tactics committee, and he clearly didn't listen to a single word I said in my primary answer. We are not suggesting that tax cuts are the only thing required to build a stronger economy into the future. Of course we are committed to investing more in infrastructure. That is why we have boosted infrastructure investment from $75 billion to $100 billion, and about half of that over the forward estimates.

              , another bank, is predicting that there would be a near-doubling in economic growth in the September quarter on the back of personal income tax cuts. There are different analysts making different comments. But you know what? What will matter is what comes out at the end of the day when the September quarter results are released in early December.

                   , I've listened carefully to your instructions about points of order, and I take you to standing order 72(3)(c). All it says there for our guidance is:

                  <p class="italic">
                   Answers shall be directly relevant to each question.

                  <p>
                   I hardly see how our conduct, as alleged by Senator Cormann, is directly relevant to the question I asked.

                    On the point of order—I may have prepared for this!—you are correct that ministers must be directly relevant. Using one word of a question does not make an answer to a question relevant to a question. However, it was a very open-ended question, Senator Gallacher, and, in that sense, the minister is being directly relevant to it.

                     As I said yesterday, the Australian economy continues to grow, unlike many other economies around the world. More jobs are being created. A record number of Australians are in work. Wages growth in the 2018-19 financial year was the strongest it has been—2.3 per cent, above inflation at 1.6 per cent—since 2013-14, Labor's last budget year. Labor's socialist agenda is not only floundering with the Australian people; it's even floundering with the member for
