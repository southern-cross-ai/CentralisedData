       <p>
        Today I want to talk about a matter that's occurred on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Island" rel="nofollow">
         King Island
        </a>
        in the last week, where King Island Dairy has been put under review or its existence as a holding within Saputo has been put under review by that multinational organisation. The King Island brand is probably one of the most recognised brands in the country. The concern that I want to express is the impact on that brand that's occurred through ownership of businesses like King Island Dairy by multinational owners who have not appropriately or properly managed that brand. It's my view that the previous owner of King Island Dairy,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Foods" rel="nofollow">
         National Foods
        </a>
        , neglected the brand and saw the brand diminish in value and prominence, although we all understand and know of the fabulous King Island cheeses that come off King Island. It's a magnificent place for agriculture. It's a magnificent place to grow beef and dairy. The trophy cabinet at King Island Dairy is probably one of the best filled trophy cabinets in Australia in relation to the production of cheeses.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be a great tragedy for us to lose King Island Dairy and that brand, so I would urge Saputo to seriously consider investing into the brand, which I know will deliver value back to the organisation but also continue to provide important employment and value to King Island and to Tasmania. This is an important brand. It deserves continued investment. It deserves to be supported.
