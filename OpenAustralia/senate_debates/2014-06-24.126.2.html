        I rise to speak about a good friend who passed away recently. His name is Khun Kanit Wanachote, a Thai bloke. He was born on 15 February 1928 in

        , and having his exploits recognised.
       </p>
       <p>
        A chance meeting occurred between Weary Dunlop and Khun Kanit when the touring party of Aussies met Khun Kanit whilst traveling up the

         River Kwai
        </a>
        , hoping to locate the Kennyu and Hintok river camps—old prisoner of war camps from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        and the infamous Thai-Burma railway project—which were in the region of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellfire_Pass" rel="nofollow">
         Hellfire Pass
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Khun Kanit was developing his Home Phutoey River Kwai Resort down river from the camps. With the proximity of Hellfire Pass to his development, Khun Kanit had constantly thought of there being some association between the Thai-Burma Railway and his project, and here were a group of Australian ex-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWs" rel="nofollow">
         POWs
        </a>
        who had actually been in the area, including the revered Weary Dunlop, who was already well known. Weary Dunlop and Khun Kanit struck a chord which was the genesis of an enduring association. Khun Kanit dedicated a large section of his resort to a Weary Dunlop park, which includes the Weary Dunlop pavilion. He was nominated for an OAM as he had served the Australian community through his contribution to the preservation of Australian-Thailand history. He assisted significantly in preserving the memory of the sacrifices of Australian military personnel. Khun Kanit was awarded the OAM in 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        These days, Quiet Lion Tours travel to Thailand, and Khun Kanit's Home Phu Toey Resort is a central focus at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
         ANZAC
        </a>
        day. Some of Weary Dunlop's ashes were spread in Hellfire Pass, and the balance were floated down the Khwae Noi after being blessed by some of Weary's Buddhist medical colleagues. The dominant feature of Home Phu Toey resort is the peace park, and Weary's statue has pride of place. Perched on rails on a ledge on the side of the hill and floodlit, an old locomotive and wagon overlook the scene. There is also a replica of a prisoner of war camp. The Weary Dunlop Museum, dedicated by Khun Kanit to his friend Weary, overlooks the park guarded by a huge carved wooden statue of Weary Dunlop. Sir Edward's son and other relatives formally opened the Dunlop museum on 24 April 1997.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not only the history of the Thai-Burma Railway that can be taught to Australian youth by the generosity of Khun Kanit. Ex-POWs are able to revisit areas where they were imprisoned, and the relatives of deceased POWs can visit graves and participate in ceremonies. All Australians should attempt to attend a dawn service at Hellfire Pass, which I have done several times, and a wreath-laying ceremony at Kanchanaburi. All this is possible because of the foresight and friendship of Sir Weary Dunlop and Khun Kanit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our dear friend passed away in Bangkok on 1 April this year, and next month a series of funeral functions will be held in Thailand, concluding with a Loy Unkarn ceremony where his ashes will be floated down the River Kwai from Home Phu Toey.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank

        </a>
        who every year takes groups of students across to Thailand and to the Thai-Burma Railway for Anzac Day in order to educate the young about how these prisoners of war suffered so much. I also know that former prisoners of war that I have met, such as Neil Macpherson and Snow Fairclough, have fond memories of Khun Kanit and of what he did for the preservation of the war history of so many who suffered so much—not only Australians, but British, Dutch and others—on the Thai-Burma Railway. I am sorry I cannot be in Thailand around 20 and 21 July, but I know Eric Wilson will represent Australia well as they float the ashes of Khun Kanit down the River Kwai and thank a great man.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I think it is quite amazing that someone in Thailand received an OAM from Australia. That clearly shows his contribution and his dedication to those Aussie prisoners of war and to preserving their history.
