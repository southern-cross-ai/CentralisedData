        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Will the minister rule out increasing taxes to pay for the new spending promises the government has made since the May budget as advocated by none other than Senator Doug Cameron?

            Order! Senator Wong, ignore the interjections. There is a primary question that has been asked by Senator Abetz. Address the primary question; ignore the other questions that might come from an aside.

             They don't like the truth; it hurts—peaked under which government? The Howard government—24.2 per cent—and was in fact still high at 23.7 per cent in 2007-08 when they left office. In fact, if the government was receiving the same level of taxation in terms of tax to GDP ratio that we inherited from those opposite, revenue in this financial year would be $24 billion higher than is projected in the budget figures. The reality is: we on this side have committed to keeping the tax to GDP ratio at or below the level we inherited and that is what we have been doing. The 2012-13 figure for tax to GDP in the budget papers is 22.1 per cent.
            </p>
            <p>
             The only party at the moment that is actually advocating for a tax increase is of course the one opposite—1.5 per cent increase to the company tax rate to pay for Mr Abbott's millionaire's paid parental leave scheme; an increase in company tax brought to you by the Liberal Party. Of course what it also wants to do is take back the tax cuts for working Australians this government has put in place.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister agree with the Prime Minister's statement that 'every time we announce something we properly account for it and properly fund it'? Can the minister confirm to the Senate that the Prime Minister's announcements about the National Disability Insurance Scheme, the Gonski review and the new dental scheme have all been properly accounted for and properly funded? Can the minister give the Senate details of the accounting and the funding?
