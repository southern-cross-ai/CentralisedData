        I am delighted to advise that I do have a question of substance and an issue of national security that is worthy of this place and this question time. My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Can the minister inform the Senate of any recent reports which highlight the success of the government's border protection policies?

         I thank Senator Reynolds for her question. Unlike those on the other side, to quote Senator Abetz, we on this side are getting down to business, in particular in relation to this important portfolio area. What this government is doing that the former government did not do is backing up our commitment with the increased resources and the funding that our agencies need to protect us and to assist in the creation of economic opportunities for all Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Reynolds referred to recent reports. I can advise the Senate that the recently released Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Customs
         </a>
         and Border Protection Service annual reports highlight the continued dividends of the coalition's strong border protection policies. These dividends include that this government is stopping the boats. We have had but one single, solitary venture to Australia this year. This compares with the record of those on the other side, where we saw, in but one month, in excess of 4,000 people arrive.
        </p>
        <p>
         These successful policies which, we have seen this week, continue to be vehemently opposed by those on the other side and by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         , are freeing up resources which we on this side of the chamber are responsibly reinvesting back into this important portfolio area. What does this achieve for the Australian people? It will achieve greater compliance. It achieves greater integrity and what it ultimately gives them is strong borders.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have also invested an additional $88 million of funding into Customs to increase screening and examination of external mail, air cargo and sea cargo. What has this delivered? It has delivered an additional 1,700 items being screenedâ€”more than those on the other did when they were in government. In the last financial year our protection officers prevented around four tonnes of drugs and precursors from reaching Australia's streets.

           Indeed I can. The fine work of our border agency personnel is backed up by a government that actually believes in border protection. Not only that: it is prepared to fund our border protection agencies and has the resolve to do what is necessary. The savings that we are making by way of our policies are going to be reinvested back into front-line services. We are reversing the cuts of over $700 million made to our border agencies by those opposite when they were in government. Quite frankly, they ripped the guts out of customs and border protection. This government is providing an additional $150 million to our border agencies, specifically to deal with counter-terrorism activity. Counter-terrorism units have been in operation now for some time. Eighty specialised officers are either up and running or are being put into place across the network. This is what happens when you stop the boats.

             There are a multitude of dividends that a government can deliver to the Australian people when you have the resolve to put in place strong border protection policies. Under this government, we have saved $283 million from closing the detention facilities that were not only opened by those on the other side but, quite frankly, were overflowing because of the number of people arriving here.
            </p>
            <p>
             There are 600 fewer children in detention today under this government than when this government came to power. That is a commitment to getting children out of detention. Could I also refer Senator Reynolds to the report of the
