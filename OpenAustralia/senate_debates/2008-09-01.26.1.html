           I thank the senator for his question. I had a brief on this issue when it was current some days ago but I actually took it out of the file, thinking that you had not got round to it. I will do my best and get any further information for you later, Senator Ronaldson, if I do not answer it all. I can say that Prime Minister and Cabinet continue to provide commentary in a coordination way on cabinet submissions. As I understand it, there have been some changes in the way those processes are applied, but they do provide commentary on submissions. They are very actively engaged with ministers and their departments on their cabinet submissions. I can vouch for that. They take a keen interest in any cabinet submission you make and engage with you fully on all the issues. So there is still strong engagement by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
            PM
           </a>
           &amp;C on all cabinet submissions but there have been some changes to processes, and I will get the detail on notice, Senator Ronaldson, about how I can help you. I do not have the brief in front of me. But it is the case, as you would expect, that the Prime Minister continues to get extensive briefings from the department on all cabinet submissions. He is always very well prepared and is fully briefed by his department. But there have been some changes to the processes and I will take on notice the remaining parts of the question I have not been able to help the senator with and provide him with an answer.

            , I have a supplementary question. Minister, earlier this year in the

            the Prime Minister told a large gathering of public servants that he wanted ‘frank and fearless’ advice. In light of this extraordinary decision to discontinue coordination comments, aren’t these words to be seen now as nothing but spin and isn’t this just another example of a micromanager in overdrive?

             I can say that one of the things that has really impressed me since Labor came into government is that we do get frank and fearless advice from our public servants. They are prepared to offer it and they accept the fact that this government welcomes it and respects their role. I am pleased to say that we were very impressed by the former head of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
              PM
             </a>
             &amp;C, Dr Shergold, who provided fearless and frank advice and I know that the Prime Minister appreciated his contribution. The new head of PM&amp;C, Mr Moran, also provides frank and fearless advice. So I have no concerns with regard to that, Senator. You are obviously trying to make some sort of cheap political point, but I can assure you that we still receive very strong advice from PM&amp;C on all policy decisions that go to cabinet.
