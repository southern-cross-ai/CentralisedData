         Thank you, Senator Reynolds. The escalating terrorist situation in Iraq and Syria and the risk of returning foreign fighters is the greatest national security threat Australia has faced in many years. This problem does not only exist on the other side of the world, it has its origins in our own suburbs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The number of Australians involved in the Syria and Iraq conflicts is significantly higher than in previous foreign conflicts. For example, of the 30 Australians who fought or trained with extremist groups in conflict zones between 1990 and 2010, including Pakistan and Afghanistan, 25 returned; of those, eight were convicted of terrorism-related offences on the Australian mainland. By comparison, we know that around 60 Australians are currently participating in the conflict zones in Syria and Iraq, while we know that another 100 Australians are assessed to be supporting the conflicts through activities such as funding and facilitation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The national public terrorism alert level is at medium, which means that a terrorist attack could occur. The terror level is under constant review by the Australian government, based on advice from our national security agencies. This is an analytical judgement of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         —not a political decision of the government. The government is taking all necessary steps to keep Australia and Australia's interests safe. We will continue to work with state and territory governments and in consultation with our agencies to review and monitor the current threat environment.

           Senator Reynolds, Australia's national terrorism public alert system informs the public about the risk of terrorist incidents occurring. It is an important mechanism to keep the public informed of the terrorist threat facing Australia and the level from time to time of that threat. As the Director-General of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
            ASIO
           </a>
           said recently:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The security environment today is becoming more complex since I was appointed as director-general of security in 2009 …
          </p>
          <p>
           For that reason, and in that context, the Australian government is currently reviewing the alert system, drawing on the advice of agencies to ensure that the gradations and descriptors are as precise as possible in the complex national security environment in which we now live.

             Yes, I can, Senator Reynolds. You may be aware that, on 30 August, the United Kingdom raised its terrorism threat level from 'substantial' to 'severe'. That change reflected that the threat of a terrorist attack against the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
              UK
             </a>
             was assessed to be highly likely. This move by the UK indicates the significance of the threat posed by ISIL and other terrorist groups in Syria and Iraq to the United Kingdom. In 2011 the US government updated its terror alert system.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US" rel="nofollow">
              The US
             </a>
             national terrorism advisory system removed the standing alert levels and replaced them with an approach based on advising the public of specific elevated or imminent terrorist threats.
            </p>
            <p>
             Australia continues to work closely with the UK, the US and other partners about the threat from terrorist groups active in Syria and Iraq and from returning foreign fighters. The government will take all necessary steps to keep Australia and Australia's interests safe.
