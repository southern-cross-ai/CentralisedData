        It has been a big week in Tasmania on the issue of not just the state election but, indeed, sport in Tasmania. After many a decade and efforts by many—on all sides of the political spectrum, but most importantly people in the sporting community—we're well on the way to having our own
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        team. We had the launch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Devils" rel="nofollow">
         Tasmanian Devils
        </a>
        team with its own jersey and logo, and it was a wonderful time for Tasmanians to celebrate something we've wanted for so long. Of course, it would be remiss of me not to highlight that it has been quite a journey getting here. Many different views have been expressed on exactly what's been required to get here. All of that being said, though, we have the team and it's a wonderful thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moving on from what is a momentous occasion and a historical point in time for our state, I do want to talk about some other fantastic achievements from high-level Tasmanian sporting personalities and members of the sports community, and to take this opportunity to pay tribute to them. They include the Tasmania JackJumpers, our own

        team, which is participating in the finals this week. Our

        cricket side is also participating in its national finals, along with the Tasmanian women's cricket team, which recently completed a spectacular three-peat of national one-day titles.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many, many great individual Tasmanian sportsmen and sportswomen, and I won't be able to mention them all, but there's a few I would like to pay tribute to, including the amazing young cyclist Felicity Wilson-Haffenden, gymnast Tristan Styles and sailor Will Sargent, each of whom has won world titles in recent months. That's not to mention our multiple world- and Olympic-title-winning swimmer Ariarne Titmus, who, despite her recent time in hospital, continues to go from strength to strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        To all of those who have done so well on behalf of our state and our country, I say congratulations to you on behalf of all Tasmanian members of this place and the other place.
