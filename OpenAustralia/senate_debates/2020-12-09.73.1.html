              The government, despite what you have been told, has no plans to ban on-the-job training. In fact, we are firmly of the belief that workplace requirements are a critical part of developing the skillset required and an important element of competency based training in Australia.

                and the loss of 140,000 Australian apprentices, isn't dropping on-the-job training the latest example of the Morrison government leaving Australian apprentices, like Isobel from Tempco and John from Incat, who are up in the gallery here today, behind?

                 The answer to your question is no. What I'd say to both Isobel and John—I understand they met with my office today; I was unable to meet with them but I congratulate them on the work they're undertaking—is that the premise of the question is false. The government have no plans to ban on-the-job training; in fact, as I've already stated, we value workplace requirements. We believe they are critical to developing skills and an important part of competency based training in Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 But, more broadly, you've actually asked me this Quill's question—thank you; that is fantastic. What has the Prime Minister said? Vocational education and skills are at the forefront of our economic recovery from COVID-19. That is why the government is investing, this year alone, almost $7 billion, colleagues, in vocational education and training. That is why we have put in place the Supporting Apprentices and Trainees wage subsidy.

                    Please resume your seat, Senator Cash. Please resume your seat. Senator Cash! I was calling on the minister to resume her seat, and I have been ignored much more while calling for order generally across the chamber. Ministers should actually resume their seat when I say time has concluded.
