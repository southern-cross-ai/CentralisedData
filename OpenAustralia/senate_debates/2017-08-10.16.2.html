        The Bill proposes to amend the
        <i>
         Migration Act 1958
        </i>
        and is targeted at deregulating the migration advice industry. This will see lawyers who hold practising certificates removed from regulation by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Migration_Agents_Registration_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Migration Agents Registration Authority
        </a>
        , so that they are regulated entirely by their relevant state or territory legal professional body.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are concerns that if lawyers were removed from the current system of registration through OMARA, consumers and other stakeholders could not rely upon receiving a consistent quality of service from those lawyers who have not been required to either demonstrate that they have sound knowledge of migration practice and procedure or undertake specialist studies in migration law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the proposed amendments it would be possible for someone with a legal practising certificate to be registered as a migration agent without demonstrating any knowledge of Australia's complex migration law and policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The level of concern that has been raised about the proposed amendments suggests that further examination of the bill is necessary.
