         (b) The approach that is applied to indigenous engagement regarding the use of training areas or other land or sea areas for training is multi-pronged. The method of consultation is tailored to the differing requirements of the local indigenous group or groups involved. In some areas, Indigenous Land Use Agreements (ILUAs) or Memorandums of Understanding (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOU" rel="nofollow">
          MOU
         </a>
         s) require consultation to be undertaken in a particular way. Land councils often take a role under ILUA or MOU arrangements. In other locations there are well-established local Environmental Advisory Committees that meet regularly and on which traditional owner groups are represented. There are also Heritage Management Plans for most major training areas that have been developed in consultation with relevant indigenous groups. These Plans require consultation for certain types of actions or activities in certain areas, depending on their nature.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         From a Civil Lands perspective, the Defence Support Group Regional staff routinely advise all ADF Units undertaking activities to consult with the respective Land Councils and where necessary apply for permits to access traditional country. This process is currently managed via Defence's Directorate of Operations and Training Area Management (DOTAM) who have civil liaison personnel to administer these arrangements.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For Talisman Sabre specifically - the exercise is cyclic and is now a routine activity. Indigenous consultation has occurred through the Environmental Advisory Committee meetings, through routine consultation with land councils or other traditional owner groups and individuals, as required under Individual Land User Agreements or Memorandums' of Understanding.

         (ii) In the Bradshaw Range area Defence complies with the consultation requirements of the local Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA). In Delamere, consultation with the Local Land Council is conducted routinely, every six months, for planned activities.

More broadly, Defence engaged environmental consultants to develop a Public Environment Report as part of the environmental impact assessment process. This process included community engagement with local communities in Rockhampton,

         (g) The Urban Operations Training Facility at Shoalwater Bay provides essential military training in urban environments to the ADF and it has been deliberately constructed to be culturally neutral while representative of the urban environments the ADF is likely to operate in or currently operates in. There is a religious building of no denomination that is part of the fictitious society created for training purposes. There is no mosque.

         (4) (a) Live fire exercises during Talisman Sabre 2009 (TS09) were restricted to specific target areas within Defence training ranges. Some fires did result but these were all contained within Defence training range boundaries. Whale sightings were recorded and vessels implemented the appropriate procedures whenever whales were in the immediate vicinity – no incidents were recorded. Mine countermeasures training is undertaken using simulated underwater mines made of concrete – these are retrieved at the end of the training – there were no identified impacts. Anti submarine warfare training using military sonar was undertaken in areas away from features likely to attract whales, and well out to sea away from the main humpback whale migratory route. Standard operating procedures for both Australian and US ships required that sonar operations cease if whales were sighted too close to warships operating sonar equipment. These procedures are well rehearsed and effective. There were no known impacts on marine mammals.

        <p class="italic">
         (b) Water quality is routinely monitored in the Shoalwater Bay Training area. It has never indicated that military activities pose any significant threat to the water quality of Shoalwater Bay or the Great Barrier Reef. Strict protocols that generally exceed the obligations that apply to commercial, tourist or recreational shipping and boating apply to all warships participating in the exercise, particularly in relation to discharges of sewage and other shipborne waste, management of fuels and other chemicals.

         (c) In 2009 Defence developed the TS09 Environmental Management Plan to guide key participants through the environmental management requirements for TS09. This document has evolved over several major exercise iterations. This Plan compliments the ADF Maritime Activities Environmental Management Plan that was first promulgated in 2004 and has been updated regularly since to incorporate new advice. Guidance on whale avoidance incorporates the results of surveys in the

         and a number of Universities, in 2008 and 2009, into whale distributions, particularly that of beaked whales. These surveys informed the development of mitigation measures. During the same period however, a number of studies were conducted on land and air operations to introduce mitigation measures to minimise the impact on flora and fauna by such things as hydrocarbon emissions and aircraft noise. As an example the RAAF Air Operations Environmental Management Plan was developed between 2006 and 2009.
