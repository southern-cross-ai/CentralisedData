I refer to reports in this morning’s newspapers that state governments are having increasing difficulty in borrowing due to the effect of the Rudd government’s bank guarantee scheme which makes state government bonds less attractive to investors. What infrastructure projects are at risk as a result of the unintended consequences of the Rudd government’s bank guarantee scheme, of which

          He’s not really a Queenslander? The government is supporting business investment during the global credit crisis. The government has already taken steps to facilitate the flow of credit to businesses by securing their deposit base. We have offered bank deposit guarantees to ensure the banks could attract deposits and wholesale funding in exceptionally difficult credit market conditions.

                . As I was saying, banks will be able to attract deposits and wholesale funding in exceptionally difficult credit market conditions so that they continue to lend. The coalition rejected the Australian Business Investment Partnership we put before the parliament to assist large-scale commercial property access financing. They have committed to voting it down in the parliament.

                  , the question started with a reference to the availability of credit for state governments and the funding situation to finance infrastructure projects. Senator Conroy is directly on the question when talking about credit, the bank deposits and guarantees, and how we actually make sure that credit does flow to both private and government investors. So Senator Conroy is directly answering the question. He is only a minute into his answer and I think that he ought to be allowed to finish his answer.

                    As I have been outlining, there has been a deterioration in the global economy that has not deterred the government’s long-term nation-building agenda. The truth is we started acting before the global recession hit. One of the key aspects that we have identified is setting aside more than $26 billion for the nation-building funds to finance critical national infrastructure projects. The reports in the newspaper that Senator Brandis is referring to are nothing more than speculation.

                      The government is investing over $6.5 billion in vital road and rail infrastructure in Queensland with the nation-building program. This is almost double what the opposition spent over the same period of time when in office. Take, for example, the

                      . The opposition only spent $900 million on it, whereas the Rudd government is investing $2.2 billion on the highway. On the notoriously dangerous stretch of road from Curra to Cooroy the Rudd government has committed $200 million towards this project to undertake necessary planning and design work as well as to progress with land acquisition.
