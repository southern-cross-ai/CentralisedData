         Notes
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1. Where a document is identified and exempted in full, access to the document can be denied, with reference to the relevant exemption provisions of the FOI Act. During the period in question, one denial related to documents to which section 47E certain operations of an agency provisions applied, two denials related to documents to which section 47C deliberative processes provisions applied.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2 Section 24A of the FOI Act provides for requests for access to documents to be refused if the documents cannot be found or do not exist. Access may also be refused if the work involved in processing the request would substantially and unreasonably divert resources of an agency. For the period in question, all nine refusals related to documents that did not exist or could not be found.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         3 In accordance with section 21 of the FOI Act, where a decision has been made to grant access, a decision maker may defer access to a document for a period of time. There were two such deferrals during this period.
