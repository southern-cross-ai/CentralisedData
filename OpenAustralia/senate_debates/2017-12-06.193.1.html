            The government does not support this motion. The motion has no basis in fact. There are no children in detention in Nauru. The coalition government is very proud of the fact that we removed all children from detention. It is worth remembering that 8,000 children were detained because of the disastrous border protection policies of Labor and the Greens in government. It is also worth remembering that 1,200 men, women and children drowned at sea under the policies of Labor and the Greens. The coalition government's strong and consistent border protection policies have saved lives, and they will not be changing.
