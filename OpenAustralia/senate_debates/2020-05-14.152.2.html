       <p>
        Labor's amendments to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2019, as outlined on sheet 8878, seek to achieve two things. First, on the topic of the modelling underpinning the charge, there does remain scope to improve transparency around the charge level, and there is broad agreement that the modelling undertaken in 2015 is based on inputs and assumptions that are no longer accurate. Given the government has not acted on the agreed joint standing committee recommendation of 2018 to update the model, these amendments propose that the levy modelling be updated and a report outlining certain matters be produced and published within 150 days. The responsibility for this task will be placed in the hands of the ACCC.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the report is to provide updated costings using the same model and methodology developed by the Bureau of Communications Research in 2015, while taking into account changes to inputs and assumptions that have occurred since the levy charge amount was first determined. Some examples of inputs that are known to have changed are costs to deploy the fixed-wireless network and the number of premises over which the levy charge might be spread. We do not consider updating the model will be a complex exercise, given a model has already been developed and updated data inputs are available.
       </p>
       <p>
        Should the Senate carry this amendment, we understand the government will propose a further amendment to give the ACCC power to seek information from NBN Co and other carriers to support their efforts to update the model. Labor supports that amendment. The amendment also proposes that the updated costings produced by the ACCC provide a breakdown for the proportion of the levy charge from costs which are already sunk and the proportion of the levy charge that derives from forecast future costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second aspect of the Labor amendments is to improve NBN rollout data on the NationalMap website. This builds on an existing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        amendment from the previous term of parliament to make rollout data available on the NationalMap. I want to acknowledge the government has incorporated that amendment into this reintroduced bill, and this amendment before the Senate today is a further supplement to that. These are reasonable and constructive amendments that seek to improve the bill. We hope they receive the support of the Senate on their merits.

         Before I respond to Senator Kitching's comments, I'd like to table three supplementary explanatory memoranda relating to the government amendments to be moved to the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer) Bill 2019 and the government request for an amendment to be moved to the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank Senator Kitching for her comments and for the Labor Party's feedback on their amendments. The government does accept the amendments proposed by the opposition to the Regional Broadband Scheme. These amendments do not impact on the government's original policy intent for the legislation and these amendments provide an opportunity for the

          Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
         </a>
         to review the modelling for the scheme prior to its commencement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nonetheless, the government remains confident that the 2015-16 modelling undertaken for the Regional Broadband Scheme continues to provide a reasonable estimate for the introductory charge. The short time frame for delivery of the report by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         means that it will naturally be limited in scope. In recognition of the limitations of this analysis, the minister intends to ask the ACCC to commence a review of the costings for the

          RBS
         </a>
         in due course.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the legislation, the ACCC will review the base and administrative cost components at least once every five years, to ensure they are sufficient to meet the reasonable net costs associated with

             SIP
            </a>

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
             ACCC
            </a>
            . The SIP regime requires SIPs to supply wholesale services and SIP standards or rules that could be made dealing with issues such as time frames for connecting and repairing services and other terms or conditions of supply.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ACCC may also make instruments that deal with the same matters. In this case SIPs need to know which instrument has primacy. The bill currently provides that SIP standards or rules prevail over ACCC instruments made after the commencement of the section, to the extent of any inconsistency. It is possible that there could, at least in the short term, be a conflict between an SIP standard or rule and an existing ACCC instrument made prior to the commencement. Amendments (1) and (2) clarify that the SIP standards or rules will also prevail in this case, to the extent of any inconsistency.
           </p>
           <p>
            Amendment (3) provides for the deferral of the commencement of the

             RBS
            </a>
            to 1 January 2021 by replacing the proposed definition of 'designated start date' with the new definition, '1 January 2021'. Amendments (4) and (5) are consequential to amendment (3). If passed in May this financial year, the designated start date would commence on 1 July this year, at a time when the telecommunications carriers are offering hardship relief due to COVID-19. This would provide little time to make arrangements for the commencement of the scheme. The date change recognises the impact of COVID-19 on the telecommunications industry and will provide certainty to carriers and regulators about when their obligations under this scheme commence.

             systems and, in some instances, develop new capabilities in order to determine levy liabilities in their enterprise footprints. We think this amendment to delay the commencement of the levy is sensible, given, as the minister has stated, the impact of COVID-19. We are quite close to the next financial year. With the priorities facing the industry in relation to COVID-19, having a commencement date of 1 July would have presented serious challenges, so Labor supports this amendment.

                ACCC
               </a>
               under existing section 102ZF. This amendment is complementary to opposition amendment 8878, as it would ensure that the ACCC has current information from carriers when undertaking its review of the Regional Broadband Scheme modelling. The government's complementary amendments on QL144 make sure that the ACCC will have access to current information from carriers as an input to its report.
              </p>
              <p>
               Amendment (1) would shorten the period of provision of the one-off report by carriers within 60 days of the bill's royal assent. Amendment (2) updates the reporting period to the month prior to the due date of the report. The report gives a snapshot of the high-speed fixed-line broadband market after commencement of this bill. This information will be an important data source for the ACCC as part of preparing advice to the minister about the base component of this charge. This allows more timely information and support and it also supports the government's evidence based decision-making sooner, meaning better outcomes for consumers and also for industry.

                  This amendment makes a technical correct to the definition of 'fixed wireless broadband service'. The charge bill incorrectly defines fixed wireless broadband service as having the same meaning as in the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecommunications_Act" rel="nofollow">

                  </a>
                  1997, where it is not defined. The amendment corrects this definition and provides that such a term has the same meaning as in part 3 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999. This amendment does not change the policy intent or operation of the Regional Broadband Scheme.

                     These are amendments which reflect the position that I put, on behalf of the Australian Greens, during my speech in the second reading debate. Schedule 4 sets out various charge, collection and other administration arrangements associated with the Regional Broadband Scheme, found in the Telecommunications (Regional Broadband Scheme) Charge Bill 2019, which the Australian Greens do not support. As I said in my second reading speech, the most appropriate, equitable and technology-agnostic means for funding the Regional Broadband Scheme is directly from the Commonwealth budget, and that remains the Greens' position.

                        Labor is opposing the Greens political party's amendments. We won't be supporting them. There are no doubt shortcomings and issues with the design of the levy. These issues have been identified by the

                         The government does not support the Greens amendments. We believe it's inherently inconsistent and it's not practical to have a national broadband delivery obligation if there is no way to fund it, so we do oppose this.
