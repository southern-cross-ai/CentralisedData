         Just briefly, I want to make a statement in relation to One Nation's second reading debate amendment. I didn't do a speech in the second reading debate. One Nation's amendment was seeking to constrain the amount of money that is being spent on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         , and it was ambiguous in its nature. I just want to put on the record that the providers to the NDIS only ever charge the maximum rate. There's no competition. If you rock up and seek a service and you then mention you're on the NDIS, the full tote odds are paid. There needs to be some mechanism used to address that, because that means that people don't get the maximum service for the money that is available. It means the money's getting chewed up more quickly than it normally does. I ask the minister to consider how that problem might be addressed. It's the typical 'I'm here for a wedding, therefore the price that will be paid is very high'.

          I thank Senator Patrick for his question and his comments and also for his support for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
           NDIS
          </a>
          and the safeguarding framework. In relation to the particular point that you raise, it is something that has been raised frequently with me as the minister. There is currently a pricing review underway by the NDIS to have a look at the whole pricing structure and rates for the NDIS. The government, in the last budget, is also having a look at how we better integrate the workforces themselves between disability, veterans and aged care. One of the things that I, Minister Hunt and Minister Gee are very conscious of is that we do pay the same providers very different rates for similar services. I think we absolutely need to improve that so that we move towards a single rate that not only doesn't actually inflate the cost of participants' services but also doesn't inadvertently push people, such as veterans, out of the market, which has been reported to be the case.

           Minister, I echo Senator Patrick's comments in many ways. Senator Hanson and I have been very strong in our comments because we see the need for protecting people with disabilities and supporting them, but we're afraid that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           system, as it is, has been built on very poor foundations. It was a thought bubble by the Labor government to get votes—that's the way we assess it. It was never properly designed. Now it's too easily rorted and it's too bureaucratic in its control, so that the people who deserve support do not have it.
