                     The offshore covered bond markets are currently the only term funding market which are effectively open, and were the only term funding markets which remained open during the global financial crisis. Our banks were not then able to issue covered bonds and the Government was required to introduce a wholesale funding guarantee to allow our banks to raise funds on competitive terms.
