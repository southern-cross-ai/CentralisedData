         I'd like to acknowledge Senator O'Sullivan's continual commitment to north Australia. Our government has implemented 31 out of the 51 north Australia white paper recommendations, and the remainder are well underway. Out of the $500 million National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, $40.5 million has actually been allocated to 16 programs that are currently being assessed. We have the $5 billion NAIF, which is going to be able to provide funds and a real injection into the economy by partnering the private sector with the various state governments and the Commonwealth to ensure that we provide concessional loans to major projects.
        </p>
        <p>
         That NAIF pipeline is going very well. There are 57 active inquiries. Five are up to the due diligence stage, and there are 16 at the assessment stage. We know that infrastructure is absolutely essential to deliver outcomes. We've got the best prices we've ever had in the cattle industry. We are just recovering from the political decisions of those opposite. We are going really well in the market, but you need to connect opportunities with the market—and what we need to connect opportunities are, of course, roads. That's what we have to build. We have got $700 million in roads—$300 million to Queensland, and $200 million each to the

                Barnaby Joyce
               </a>
               , at the inaugural Ministerial Forum on Northern Development that was attended by state, federal and territory representatives. It was a very exciting meeting. They focused on beef, the aquaculture sector, horticulture—all those opportunities the north provides. Importantly, from my portfolio, Indigenous leaders actually had a seat at the table for the first time with their ministerial colleagues. This partnership is going to provide really serious outcomes not only for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
                Indigenous Australians
               </a>
               and the say that they have in this country but particularly for the north. Peter Yu said that this was a historic day and that never before had there been such engagement at such a senior level on this matter of national importance. Our government will continue to engage and deliver for northern Australia.

                   Tiwi Islands
                  </a>
                  , and I had a report from Mr Rioli, one of the rangers there. He had found a mango hopper and he was delighted to tell me the news that we are building a new biosecurity laboratory in Darwin. So, when he finds these new creatures that are a threat to the north, instead of having to go all the way down south, the level of amenity provided by this laboratory will enable the identification of this pest, particularly, but also pathogens and diseases that are going to threaten the north. Again, our investment in the ranger groups is a huge amount of funds but, most importantly, 2,500 individuals, many of whom are across the north, are looking after the biosecurity of Australia and ensuring we can protect the north.
