        I inform the Senate that the President has received the following letter, dated 3 July 2024, from Senator Scarr:

        Pursuant to standing order 75, I give notice that today I propose to move "That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:

        The need for the Albanese Government to stand with our allies in investigating the listing of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir as a terrorist organisation in light of the group's praise for Hamas's October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel and revelations Hizb ut-Tahrir has sought to radicalise students on our campuses and use Australia as a safe haven to run digital influence campaigns here and overseas."

         I move:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The need for the Albanese Government to stand with our allies in investigating the listing of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir as a terrorist organisation in light of the group's praise for Hamas's October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel and revelations Hizb ut-Tahrir has sought to radicalise students on our campuses and use Australia as a safe haven to run digital influence campaigns here and overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
         I rise to speak in relation to this matter of urgency—and it is an urgent matter and a matter which the coalition progressed through the answering of questions by the Labor government earlier this week, in particular with regard to an extremist group called Hizb ut-Tahrir and its potential listing as a terrorist organisation under the laws of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth of Australia
         </a>
         . There is an urgent need for the Albanese Labor government to investigate the listing of this extremist group as a terrorist organisation following its activities after the dreadful Hamas attacks of 7 October last year. It is deeply concerning that, in response to our questions earlier this week, the Labor government referred to statements of a previous Attorney-General years ago instead of focusing on the current context and the current activities of this hateful organisation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that, in January this year, one of our closest allies, the United Kingdom, declared Hizb ut-Tahrir a terrorist organisation. It begs the question: why hasn't Australia taken such action under our laws? We have laws similar to the United Kingdom with regard to the proscription of entities as terrorist organisations. Why has the United Kingdom taken this action? Why has Germany outlawed this organisation? Why have other countries, including Indonesia, one of our closest neighbours, outlawed this organisation while we haven't taken the necessary action under our laws here in Australia?
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition is calling for all senators to support this motion, which calls for—I want to make this very clear:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The need for the Albanese Government to stand with our allies in investigating the listing of the extremist group Hizb ut-Tahrir as a terrorist organisation in light of the group's praise—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         its praise, of all things—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … for Hamas's October 7 terrorist attacks in Israel and revelations Hizb ut-Tahrir has sought to radicalise students on our campuses and use Australia as a safe haven to run digital influence campaigns here and overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is deeply, deeply disturbing, and urgent action is required, especially in light of the fact that the United Kingdom took the action which we called for back in January. Months have passed. Months have passed without appropriate action being taken, and action needs to be taken.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to quote from the debate in the House of Commons in relation to the proscription of this terrorist organisation in the United Kingdom. This is what the minister for security said in the House of Commons:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I want to make something very clear: I am a champion of freedom of speech, and I have no issue with people saying things that I regard as insensitive, uninformed or wrong, but this is different. Free speech includes neither the promotion of terrorism nor the celebration of terrorist acts. It is not acceptable to describe Hamas as the "heroes" of Palestine or the events of 7 October as a "long-awaited victory". It is not acceptable to refer to the killing of Jewish tourists by an Egyptian police officer as—
        </p>
        <p>
         and this is what this organisation said—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         "a simple example of what should be done towards the Jews".
        </p>
        <p>
         Can you believe it? This hateful organisation which has a presence here in Australia is sowing the seeds of division. It is calling for, endorsing, promoting and advocating for acts of terrorism. The Australian government should be undertaking an urgent investigation and finding its way, through our laws and regulations, to have this dreadful, evil organisation declared a terrorist organisation. We should be united with our allies overseas, including the United Kingdom. The fact that the United Kingdom, back in January, declared this organisation a terrorist organisation and we have failed to do so—and it is now July, nearly six months later—is deeply, deeply concerning. This is a matter of urgency, and the Labor government should act.
