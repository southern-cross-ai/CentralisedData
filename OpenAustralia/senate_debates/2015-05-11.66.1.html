        , my question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. Can the minister confirm that the Chief Government Whip, Mr Buchholz, has delivered a message to the Prime Minister's office that, if tomorrow's budget is received badly, the Prime Minister must sack the Treasurer or his own job will again be at risk?

          Niki Savva clearly thinks that is the matter; she seems to be extremely well informed. But I ask a supplementary question: can the minister confirm that before Christmas the foreign minister urged the Prime Minister to sack the Treasurer?

           Here we are, the day before the federal budget, and where do the Labor Party get their questions from? The gossip columns in the newspapers. The gossip columns in the newspapers are the feedstock for the Labor Party's question time in this place. When we were promised by the Leader of the Opposition that 2015 would be the year of ideas, what are their ideas? To trawl through the gossip columns of the newspapers and ask questions and say, 'Is this bit of tittle-tattle true?' rather than asking, 'How can we help the government restore the economy?'

               , I thought I had answered it very clearly. Just in case I have not, for the benefit of Senator Moore, let me say: this is a government that does not engage in the gossip columns of the newspapers and rely on the sort of tittle-tattle that the Labor Party use as their stock in trade. What we do is: we get on with the business of fixing the economy.

                 say yet again: what is the source? 'An unnamed source.' It always is with the Labor Party. When they want to deal with the issues of gossip, we on this side want to deal with the issues of repairing the economy, reducing the cost of living and getting on with the job of creating jobs for our fellow Australians. That is what we are focused on. That is what we dedicate ourselves to. And the budget tomorrow night will indicate that we have been concentrating on job creation rather than tittle-tattle creation.

                              I can assure you, Senator, it is not a replay, but it is very good news for the Australian taxpayer. If it were a replay, I would be telling you about the $2.5 billion this government returned to the Australian taxpayer in the budget as a result of last year's budget and the savings made by Operation Sovereign Borders. If it were a replay, I would be telling you about the $11 billion budget blow-out that you incurred in this portfolio when you were in government. But this is not a replay. This is a new figure for the benefit of all Australians.

                              Given the ongoing success of Operation Sovereign Borders, we will now provide the Australian taxpayer with savings of more than half a billion dollars in the 2015-16 budget. As I said, that is on top of the already $2.5 billion in savings that we provided to the budget in 2014-15. How has this been possible? When you stop the boats, the people stop coming. That is something that those on the other side just failed to comprehend. In stopping the boats and in stopping those arriving here illegally, the government has now managed to close many of the—

                                  hate fiscal responsibility, they hate the truth and they hate responsible border protection policy. In terms of closing down detention centres, we have managed to close down 13 detention centres under this government. In terms of the further impact on the budget, logistics and service requirements across the detention network adds a further $112 million in savings. In terms of the reduced requirement for charter flights, it is another $66 million in savings. So, yet again: $2.5 billion last year, half a billion dollars this year. That is what you get when you stop the boats.

                                      Just by way of statistics I can do that. Under the former Rudd-Gillard-Rudd governments, 50,000 people arrived here illegally by boat. Under the coalition government, one vessel has successfully arrived. Under Labor, in excess of 1,200 people tragically died at sea. Under the coalition, Operation Sovereign Borders has seen deaths at sea stopped. Under Labor, children in detention peaked at 1,992 children in one month alone, July 2013. Under the coalition, as of last Friday, I am advised that there were 120 children in detention on the mainland.

                                      Of course we yet again go to the budget blow-outs. Under those opposite in just 5½ years there was $11 billion in budget blow-outs—versus us with responsible government on this side; we saved the Australian taxpayer $2.5 billion last year and we will save the Australian taxpayer an additional half a billion dollars this year.

                                       My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Prime Minister and it seems half of the frontbench today. Minister, budgets are about choices. Why does the Prime Minister persist with choosing to attack the most vulnerable members of our community, for example by slashing support for sole parents, rather than asking large multinationals to pay their fair share?

                                        The Leader of the Australian Greens is refreshingly correct when he says that a budget is about choices. We as a government are determined not to saddle the next generation with a burden of debt and deficit because this generation could not act responsibly, so be assured that we as a government are concerned about making the right choices for today and especially for the next generation.

But it is indicative that the Greens have already started their negative mantra on the budget before it has even been delivered. Senator

Given that your government has clearly got a revenue rather than a spending problem, here is some advice. Will you now consider revenue measures such as abolishing the $10 billion subsidy that provides cheap fuel to multinational mining companies who are making superprofits?

                                           , I ask a further supplementary question. Minister Abetz, why won't the government learn the lessons from the last budget? Why does it continue to link unfair and harsh spending cuts to pay for essential services such as child care?

                                            of some of the changes that have been suggested for tomorrow night's budget. I say to the Leader of the Australian Greens: 'Watch this space. Let us see what happens tomorrow night.' The leader may well change his tune in relation to some of these matters.

                                            Having said that, I say to the Australian Greens that the most important choice we have with this budget and in future budgets is intergenerational accountability and responsibility. We want to ensure that we look after the next generation without burdening them with a legacy of deficit and debt, which the Labor-Green government inflicted on the Australian people and would have inflicted on the next generation had we not taken the sort of action that we had to take.
