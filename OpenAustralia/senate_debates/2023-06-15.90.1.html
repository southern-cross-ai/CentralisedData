        I have to comment today on Senator Thorpe's remarks in this chamber with regard to the safety of this building. I first entered parliament when I was first elected as an independent, and no-one felt more alone than I did at that stage. I've been an independent woman in the lower house. The parliament is a safe place. I have no problems with it and have never had any problems with walking the halls and in this chamber.

        What I find offensive is her remarks and her crocodile tears. I'm not going to defend Senator Van because I don't know the circumstances. But I do know that this is coming from a person who is the most abusive woman, in one case to a respectable Aboriginal elder, Aunty Geraldine Atkinson, who had to receive medical attention. There was her abuse of Senator Hollie Hughes, and there were cases of abuse involving other senators here—'All the war; this is war.' The fact is that to lay yourself in front of a

        truck or you stand on the streets of Melbourne, in a criminal space with a lot of criminality, and abuse men there at three o'clock in the early hours of a Sunday morning. I made a comment to a woman of this chamber and I got a reply: 'Fuck off.'

         Senator Hanson, I believe there are some personal reflections that would be considered to be against standing orders. I will refer it to the President to review, but I will give you the opportunity now to withdraw any comments made to assist the chamber.

          Unless you point it out, what I'm talking about is factual of a person. I don't think that what I have said is reflective because, when this chamber is used and abused by a certain senator, I will stand up and defend this chamber and what this chamber stands for, as well as every other senator in this place that has been abused by her. I don't believe her crocodile tears. I just want to put that on the record. This is a safe place in the chamber. And another thing I will say is that if you have an issue—

           Senator Hanson, please take your seat. Senator Hanson, that is a reflection on a senator, which we all understand in this place is against standing orders. Thank you. You may proceed.

            The message that must go out to all people is: if you have a claim of sexual harassment, go to the police. Her message today to the people who may be affected by sexual abuse and harassment was not that. Don't say it on the floor of parliament. Take it to the police, where it belongs.
