        The Australian Government is pleased to respond to the recommendations of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration as set out in

         No one teaches you to become an Australian: Report of the inquiry into migrant settlement outcomes

        Australia is a successful and vibrant multicultural nation, with nearly half its population either born overseas or having at least one parent born overseas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is unwavering in its commitment to a multicultural Australia: one which celebrates and acknowledges the benefits that diversity brings — socially, economically and culturally.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 20 March 2017, the Government launched its multicultural policy statement, Multicultural Australia: United, Strong, Successful. This statement identifies the Government’s priorities and strategic directions that will guide programs and policies for the coming years, and is available online at www.dss.gov.au/settlement-and-multicultural-affairs/australian-governments-multicultural-statement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to supporting the successful settlement of all migrants to Australia and is already addressing many of the recommendations.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Inquiry" rel="nofollow">
         The Inquiry
        </a>
        repeatedly heard how Australia is recognised as a world leader in providing settlement services. Australia also has one of the smallest discrepancies between locally born and overseas born unemployment rates in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        . We are one of the most successful and cohesive societies in the world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Settlement is a complex process, and both settlement and mainstream support services are important to enable new arrivals to achieve full economic and social participation and to adjust to Australian society. Australia’s approach to settlement is based on mutual benefits and responsibilities. The Australian community benefits as a whole both economically and socially from migration, which brings different skills, perspectives and knowledge. Migrants benefit from joining one of the world’s most stable, democratic and welcoming societies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government acknowledges the significant work being done by government agencies across jurisdictions, service providers and other non-government organisations to support the settlement of migrants and refugees across Australia. The level of collaboration and co-operation achieved by these stakeholders contributes to Australia’s successful settlement outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government also takes its responsibility to protect the Australian community from the risk of harm from non-citizens very seriously. We are continuing to develop ways to ensure that people who migrate to Australia are not a risk to the safety of the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Entering or remaining in Australia is a privilege, not a right. Every person who lives in Australia, whether that person is a non-citizen, a citizen by birth, or a citizen by application, must uphold and obey the law. If a person commits serious offences, they are accountable for their actions and are liable to be dealt with in accordance with Australian law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government thanks all those who were involved in the work of the Inquiry and delivery of the final report, in particular the members of the Committee and those organisations and individuals that contributed submissions.
