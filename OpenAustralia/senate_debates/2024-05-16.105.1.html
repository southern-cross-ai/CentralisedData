        by leave—I wish to update the Senate on developments in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Caledonia" rel="nofollow">
         New Caledonia
        </a>
        . The government continues to closely monitor the situation in New Caledonia, and we echo calls from all parties for calm. As senators may know, a state of emergency has been declared, and a curfew remains in place. New Caledonia's La Tontouta International Airport has been closed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I advise the Senate that the government has increased the level of travel advice for the Noumea metropolitan area and now advises Australians to reconsider their need to travel, due to civil unrest, travel disruptions and limited essential services. The government has also increased the overall level of advice for New Caledonia and now advises travellers to exercise a high degree of caution. Those are increases to level 3 of four and to level 2 of four.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        is also advising Australians in Noumea to minimise movement, monitor the media and follow the advice of local authorities. The Australian consul-general in Noumea has been sharing this advice on social media.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians in need of consular assistance should contact DFAT's 24-hour consular emergency centre on 1300555135 within Australia or +61262613305 from overseas. Australians in New Caledonia should subscribe to Smartraveller for updates as the situation on the ground continues to evolve. I thank our consul-general and all of the staff at the Australian Consulate-General in Noumea for their work supporting Australians in New Caledonia. I take this opportunity to repeat Australia's call for calm. We respect and support the referendum process under the

        and the discussions underway between all parties. We encourage all parties to work together constructively to shape New Caledonia's institutional future.

         on indulgence—I rise to associate the opposition with the remarks of Senator Wong to encourage calm and a return to peace in

         as soon as possible. New Caledonia is an important part of our Pacific family. It is a most beautiful part of the world, with beautiful people with whom Australia shares a special relationship. We remain concerned by the present situation and by the distress faced by many in New Caledonia. We urge those responsible for violence and disruption to cease and cooperate with law enforcement and for negotiation to ensure resolution of the issues before them.
        </p>
        <p>
         We echo the remarks of the government, in relation to Australians who are considering travel, about the need to reconsider, follow travel advice on Smartraveller and use the emergency contact information provided. We also extend our thanks and acknowledgement to Australian officials working in New Caledonia and others who are engaged in supporting Australians or other foreign nationals there and trying to achieve peace in the situation.
