         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Two formal complaints have been finalised by the

          Hydro Tasmania
         </a>
         . The SBS Ombudsman's responses to each complaint are set out below. SBS notes that the SBS Ombudsman's responses have been published by SBS on the
         <i>

         program website and are also available on the Ta Ann Tasmania and Hydro Tasmania websites

         "After a review of the program against the provisions of Code 2.2 (Accuracy, Impartiality and Balance) of the SBS Codes of Practice, and considering your complaint, the program was found to have breached the provisions of the code.

         "The report was found to be inaccurate in two of three areas identified in your complaint.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         "First, Mr Rolley did not say the words attributed to him about plantation and regrowth timber. Secondly, as you know, there is a difference between a contract to log, that is go into an area and fell trees, and a contract for the supply logs from trees felled (logged) by others. In this case,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forestry_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
          Forestry Tasmania
         </a>
         supplies Ta Ann Tasmania (a manufacturing company) with already felled timber, which Ta Ann Tasmania processes to produce a range of timber products. It is inaccurate, and in breach of Code 2.2, to say that Ta Ann Tasmania is a logging company.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         "I find that the report that 50 workers were retrenched was not inaccurate, being an accurate reflection of what was said by Mr Rolley. It is not inaccurate to say that Ta Ann Tasmania

        <p class="italic">
         "retrenched 50 Tasmanian workers" when Ta Ann Tasmania's executive director said that "we've had to sack 50 people".

        <p class="italic">
         "On balance the report breached Code 2.2 with respect to accuracy, balance and impartiality. Put shortly, the program did not include accurate and balancing material that was available and did not include a response from Ta Ann on key questions. It unduly favoured the views critical of Ta Ann (both Ta Ann Tasmania and Ta Ann Holdings Berhad, the Malaysian company) and "Hydro Tasmania over both the facts and appropriate balancing views. In addition the relationship between Hydro Tasmania and with Sarawak Energy Berhad (
