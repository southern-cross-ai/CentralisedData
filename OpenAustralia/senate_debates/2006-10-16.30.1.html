        <b>
         Purpose of the bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed Bill will amend the Parliamentary Superannuation Act 2004 (the 2004 Act) to vary the rate of superannuation contributions payable for Senators and Members covered by that Act, that is, persons who joined the Parliament, or returned to Parliament after a break, from the 2004 general election.

        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Prime Minister announced on 7 September 2006 that the Government intended to introduce legislation to adjust the level of superannuation for Parliamentarians elected at the 2004 Federal election and subsequently so that it is the same as that paid to Commonwealth public servants, that is, 15.4 per cent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Early passage of the Parliamentary Superannuation Amendment Bill 2006 is highly desirable so that parliamentarians’ superannuation contributions can be increased to the level of contributions paid for public servants as soon as possible.
