        Several years ago, long before I was elected to this place, I had the wonderful opportunity to visit Myanmar for the launch of Walk Free, a movement to eliminate modern slavery. Myanmar is a spectacular country. The people were warm and welcoming, and I have very fond memories of my time there. This is why I was especially pleased to welcome members of our Burmese community to Canberra as part of the delegation from

        continues to wage civil war against the very people it is supposed to be defending. Peaceful demonstrations have been met by violent opposition from the military, and clashes between armed resistance groups and the military junta are now rife in this country. As a result, many have fled their homes and now live in makeshift shelters, relying on humanitarian aid to support their families. Some have left the country and are watching from afar, hoping that one day it will be safe for them to return home.

        I admire the courage and the tenacity of the Burmese, who continue to fight for democracy in their country, despite what may seem like insurmountable challenges. Like our Burmese diaspora here in Australia, I continue to pray that one day we will see peace in Myanmar and that we will be able to return to a country that has embraced democracy and the rule of law on its journey towards a prosperous and fair future for all.
