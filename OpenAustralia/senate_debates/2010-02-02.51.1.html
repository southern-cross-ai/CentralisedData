        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. Since the last meeting of the Senate, how many boats—in addition to last night’s arrival—carrying how many unauthorised arrivals have arrived or been intercepted in Australian waters?

         The number of boats that arrived last year was 60, and the number of people who arrived last year as unlawful offshore arrivals was 2,726. I can take on notice the question on the number since the Senate rose, Senator Cash, if you are interested in that figure, but clearly that is not how we record the statistics. We do not align the statistics with the sitting of the Senate; we actually collect annual figures.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I can tell the Senate is that this year we have had nine boat arrivals and last year there were 60. I can also confirm the information that in 1999 under the Howard government there were 86 boat arrivals, with 3,721 people; in 2000 there were 51 boat arrivals, with 2,939 persons; and in 2001 there were 43 boat arrivals, with 5,516 people. So last year was the fourth highest in terms of arrivals; the top three years were under the Howard government when it was dealing with the spike in people leaving Afghanistan and Iraq; when it, like the rest of the world, was dealing with that problem during a particular period. We are now dealing with the situation in Afghanistan and

         </a>
         in particular, where we have seen large numbers of people fleeing. Those people have been fleeing all around the world. That has seen an increase in arrivals in Australia but it has also seen an increase in arrivals in Canada, Europe and most other Western countries. Those are the figures for last year and this year but, as I remind the Senate, we have had arrivals in about 25 of the last 30 years.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the minister has been unable to confirm the arrival of 22 boats and 985 unauthorised arrivals since the Senate rose last year, will the minister concede that the continuing surge of boats over the monsoon season, which is traditionally a period of low arrivals, demonstrates that the people-smuggling industry has been invigorated by the Rudd government’s weakening of Australia’s once strong border protection policies?

           No, obviously I do not accept that. As I say, if you track the regular movement of persons out of source countries who have traditionally headed towards Australia you see an increase in activity, as you do for countries in Europe and elsewhere. This is driven by the situation in Afghanistan and of course the worsening situation in Pakistan. That is where the largest number of arrivals we have had have come from. I also want to suggest to the senator that this argument about the monsoon season is not actually folklore but I do not think it is a major factor, from the advice I have had about impacts on arrivals. Because of the shortness of the journeys, it has not in recent years had a huge impact. But, Senator, I am being very clear: we are dealing with an increased rate of activity, it is a serious public policy problem and the government is working very hard to address it. We are using all our capacities to address this issue.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the policies the minister describes in response to the situation are patently not ‘strong’, are patently failing not only in the eyes of the people smugglers but also in the eyes of the Australian community in general, will the minister now tell the Senate what new approaches the government will take to reverse the reality of an open door Australia?

             I am not sure I am going to do anything about ‘Australia’, but I certainly am interested in protecting Australia’s borders, in ensuring that we have orderly migration to this country and in working with our neighbours to restrict unlawful movement into this country. We are very focused in trying to deal with the recent spike in activity. We are working with Indonesia, Malaysia and other neighbours to try to address this. We are maintaining strong border protection measures that see boats intercepted, see people detained, and see people undergo the normal health, identity and security checks before they are released into the community. Those found to be refugees are given protection; those found not to be refugees are returned to their country of origin. We think that is sound public policy and if you are asking whether we are going to go down the
