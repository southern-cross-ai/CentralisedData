        My question is to Minister Wong. A recent report by Oxfam and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionAid" rel="nofollow">
         ActionAid
        </a>
        shows that Australia is funding just one-tenth of its fair share of global climate action. For one of the world's largest fossil fuel exporters and a wealthy colonial country which has contributed significantly to global climate change, this is pretty pathetic.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Island
        </a>
        people are on the front lines of the climate crisis despite contributing negligible amounts to global emissions. Recently Pacific elders visited parliament and once again called for Australia to do more and to take the lead on climate change. Minister, will the government commit to finally paying our fair share of climate finance, which has been assessed at $4 billion a year?

         I thank Senator Faruqi for the question, and I would make the point that I think there are a number of aspects to her question. First I'll go to the assistance that the government does provide, and I would make the point that over the period that those opposite were in government they cut nearly $12 billion from development assistance. And I regret deeply that the bipartisanship that was offered by us in opposition for continuing the maintenance, the growth and the development in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Official_Development_Assistance" rel="nofollow">
          Official Development Assistance
         </a>
         program was never taken up by either Minister Bishop or Minister Payne. I regret that, because I think it would have been much better for the country and also for the people of our region if that bipartisanship had been maintained and there had been less of a chase for some of the right-wing populists who opposed development assistance. I think there is a strong national security case for development assistance, there is a strong peace dividend from it and there is a strong ethical imperative for it as well, given that we know we can avert the loss of lives and we can improve education and health outcomes for people who need that so much in the region.

         In relation to climate, this government has come to office with a much more ambitious commitment on climate change. This will see Australia's emissions reduced by 43 per cent. This will see the vast majority of Australia's energy, notwithstanding that we are an emissions-intensive economy, being renewable energy—in excess of 80 per cent—this decade. I appreciate that the Greens do not have the same view about the need to transition. We recognise the need to transition and deliver in the real world. When it comes to development, we have come to office with additional assistance to be provided to the Pacific, which was an election commitment, and I thank my colleagues for that. We made clear to Pacific family members the importance of—

           Minister, Australia is currently contributing only around 0.22 per cent of its gross national income towards international aid—and I take your point that the Liberal-National government reduced that to a pittance—and this is extremely low: well under one-third of what is recommended by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
            OECD
           </a>
           and almost the lowest it's ever been, and it's totally inadequate to meet our obligations. So, Minister, what is your government going to do? And my question is, will the government increase its overall aid commitments in the upcoming budget, and by how much? And I would actually appreciate an answer to this question.

            In relation to budget questions, there's been a lot of 'rule in, rule out'—which is a usual political process in the lead-up to the budget, and I can remember both Senator Cormann and Senator Birmingham standing here and saying, 'Well, these decisions will be made, and they will be made in the budget, and the budget will be handed down on'—whatever day it was at that time. So, I'm not going to do the 'rule in, rule out' thing. But what I would say to the senator is that we made a very clear and costed election commitment to additional funding for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODA" rel="nofollow">
             ODA
            </a>
            , which was announced in the election campaign. We did that—in excess of a billion dollars over four years. That included additional ODA to the Pacific, additional ODA to South-East Asia and an additional $32 million to the Australian

             NGO
            </a>
            Cooperation Program, known as ANCP. We did that because it was the right thing to do for Australia. Our security lies in our region, and we have a national interest in doing what we can to make the region more stable and secure. We will deliver that commitment.
