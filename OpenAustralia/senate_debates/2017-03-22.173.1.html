       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "l.10 The committee would like to draw the department's attention again to the use of quantitative KPI targets. The use of quantitative KPI targets has been utilised in some programmes, such as programme 2.1, and in this instance it simplifies the performance monitoring process. The committee recommends the department applies this approach to the assessment of its other programs; however, it also acknowledges the difficulty in using quantitative KPI targets to assess the effectiveness of departmental programs that involve policy development."

       <p class="italic">
        The Attorney- General' s Department notes the recommendation made by the Committee, and will implement this as appropriate in future annual reports.
