        My question is to Senator Abetz, representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement as opposition leader in 2011:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I think any government which makes it harder to manufacture cars is making it harder for us to continue to be a first world economy …
       </p>
       <p>
        Isn't it the case that removing $500 million from the Automotive Transformation Scheme makes it harder to manufacture cars in Australia? Isn't it the case that the Prime Minister's 14 December point-blank refusal to offer any financial assistance to Toyota makes it harder to manufacture cars in Australia? Isn't it the case that this government has thrown the automotive industry and Australia's advanced manufacturing to the scrap heap?

         The short answer to the question is, absolutely, no. This is a question from a minister who presided over a job loss in the manufacturing sector every 19 minutes that he was the minister, over that six-year period.

           Given that the former minister was willing to provide me with a quote, allow me to respond that 'international company executives were left wondering just what they had to do to get a consistent government policy commitment in Australia'. Do you know what he was referring to? His very own government. Senator Carr was reflecting on his very own government. So we can trade quotes across the chamber, and at the end of the day—

                 What it shows is that Senator Carr will distort the truth for his tawdry political exercise today. Many workers face an uncertain time. We are working with them, with the unions and with the companies to seek to ensure that they do have a future as individuals. The circumstances are difficult but we will work with them to ensure the best possible outcome, in circumstances where Toyota said that no matter what we did they would leave—as Holden did, and as Ford and Mitsubishi did with a Labor government.

                   Once again, proof is never a relevant consideration for this particular former minister. What a shameful thing to say—that it was this government that forced Holden out of Australia, when we all know that Holden itself has repudiated that false assertion by Senator Carr. So, having been repudiated by Holden, Senator Carr still peddles the dishonest lines.

                   suggest to him: we do have difficult circumstances, and occasions like this require people to elevate themselves out of the political gutter and consider the future of these workers—workers whose future is now in doubt, and with whom we want to work to ensure a good future.

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. I ask the minister: can you confirm that the Prime Minister has once again today sought to blame the automotive workers in his address to the party room this morning? Is it yet another example of baseless accusations being made which are clearly refuted by the company's own statements?
