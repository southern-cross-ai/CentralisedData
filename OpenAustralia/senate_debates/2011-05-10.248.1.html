        I stand tonight to speak to a matter of serious concern relating to the professionalism, or lack of it, of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Bowen" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Bowen
        </a>
        . On 4 April the minister, on behalf of the Labor Gillard government, caved in to coalition pressure and overturned Labor's ban on the distribution of Bibles and other holy books as gifts at citizenship ceremonies. Labor's changes to the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code in 2008 specifically banned the giving of Bibles and other holy books as gifts at citizenship ceremonies. That was confirmed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Immigration and Citizenship
        </a>
        in answers to questions on notice that I put in October last year and again in the Senate in February. The ban was also accepted by the relevant minister in this place, Senator Kim Carr, in answer to a question I asked. He even tried to blame it on the Howard government. But we see that, as of 4 April, Minister Bowen tried to pretend that there was never a ban at all—both ministers directly conflicting with each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        The serious concern I have relates to the lack of a response from the minister, Chris Bowen, to correspondence I forwarded to him on 28 October seeking clarification of the matter following Senate estimates in October. I wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dear Minister
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am writing to seek clarification on the current confusion surrounding the status of Bibles as "gifts" under the Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code. I refer also to recent communications I have had with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bible_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Bible Society
        </a>
        of Tasmania who have serious concerns. I seek your confirmation that Bibles have not been—and will not be—banned at citizenship ceremonies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I never received a response to that letter. On 12 January I followed up in a courteous way in another letter. I wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I refer to my previous correspondence dated October 28, 2010 addressing the confusion surrounding the status of Bibles as "gifts" under the current Australian Citizenship Ceremonies Code.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As at the date of this letter no response has been received. Your early response would be greatly appreciated.
       </p>
       <p>
        And still no response. On 28 March, there was still no response. So what do I do? I write to the Prime Minister, the Honourable Julia Gillard, and ask her to take up the matter with her cabinet colleague Minister Chris Bowen. As of today, Tuesday, 10 May, there is still no response from this government.
       </p>
       <p>
        If they are treating a senator, a fellow member of the federal parliament, in this way, how are they treating members of the public? With disdain and contempt, no doubt. The lack of a response from this minister is outrageous. It is not only patronising and demeaning; it is condescending, disrespectful and downright insulting. For the minister not to provide any response in any way, shape or form—either via an email, a hard copy letter or a telephone call from his office—is not good enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason I raise this in the Senate is that this parliament is meant to have some sort of standards. There is meant to be some sort of ethic to the way that they deliberate. Clearly it is not good enough. I raised it with the Prime Minister on 28 March, and here we are early-ish in May and there has still been no response—absolutely nothing. If they are treating a fellow member of the federal parliament in this way, how are they treating members of the public—with the same level of disdain and contemptuous behaviour? That is a question I pose, and it remains to be answered.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why would the minister not respond? Clearly, there is a conflict in understanding with respect to their views on whether or not there was a ban. Clearly there is a conflict between Senator Kim Carr and the minister. It is on the Senate

        . He put out a media release in early April, indicating that they overturned the ban. He did not use those words; members of the public have used those words. Indeed, the
        <i>
         Mercury
        </i>
        newspaper used those words. Their headline on that day, 5 April, was 'Unholy row ends as bibles stay'. I congratulate Bruce Mounster for writing that report, which read as follows:

        got it right and I thank them for covering that story. But I would like to know whether it is right and appropriate for a minister of this government not to respond to or to communicate in any way with a fellow member of the federal parliament.

          Is it typical, Senator Humphries? If so, that is very disappointing, but I am not surprised. I would ask those on the other side in this chamber to take it up with the minister and ask, 'Why haven't you responded? Are you treating fellow members of parliament with disdain and contempt in the same way you treat members of the public?' That question has been asked. Two letters have been sent. It was raised in Senate estimates. I have raised it a third time in writing to the Prime Minister. Nothing has happened. Be it on your own heads in terms of the manner in which you behave in this place.
         </p>

          Finally, in the few moments I have remaining, I would like to pay a special tribute tonight to the world champion from Launceston, Tasmania,

           Daniel Geale
          </a>
          . He is known as the 'real deal'. He was born and bred in Launceston. He studied at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_High_School" rel="nofollow">
           Brooks High School
          </a>
          in Launceston. He has stunned the world by becoming a world champion, winning the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Boxing_Federation" rel="nofollow">
           International Boxing Federation

          middle-weight crown in Germany, just a few days ago. It was Sunday the 8th, and it was reported widely across the nation and in particular in the Tasmanian media. I thank the media there, including the
          <i>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Examiner" rel="nofollow">

          <i>
           ,
          </i>
          for giving him the appropriate recognition.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was against the odds, it was in Germany, it was against a German and it was in front of a parochial crowd. He is only 30 years old and he still has a very long way to go. He is now a world champion. I say congratulations to Daniel Geale, to his team, to his family. Congratulations and well done.
         </p>
         <p>
          I particularly note the comments by Graeme George, his trainer, who had trained him as a young boy in Launceston. He said that he would like to make the first defence of his
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBF" rel="nofollow">
           IBF
          </a>
          middle-weight crown in Tasmania and has urged the state government to get behind the state's newest world champion to make sure that it happens. I want to support that call and call for the state government, the Labor government in Tasmania, to try and wriggle out of the despair and dismay that it is in at the moment—the wrecking of the Tasmanian economy, the trashing of the budget and the sacking of thousands of Tasmanian public servants and others—and just for a moment to grab hold of this wonderful opportunity, get behind it and support this event, so that the defence of this title can take place in Tasmania. It would do wonders not just for tourism and not just for the people who would attend such an event, but Tasmania would be the eyes of the world. The international media and tele­vision would be focusing on Tasmania for such an event. I hope that other members and senators in this place and those in Tasmania as well will get behind this push to make sure that Daniel Geale can defend his IBF title in Tasmania. Wouldn't that be just fantastic? Wouldn't it just be so good?
         </p>
         <p>
          I also note that it is beamed all around the world. It would be a big confidence boost for Tasmania in terms of the hosting of events. There are a whole range of different sporting events but this would be one of the biggest opportunities, and we should grasp it with both hands. I call on the state government to get behind this call, make it a success and give Daniel Geale the honour that he deserves. I thank the Senate.
