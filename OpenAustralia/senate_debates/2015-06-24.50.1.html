        My question is the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to the failure of the Attorney-General and the foreign minister to correct the record for a full parliamentary week after misleading evidence was provided on the provision of the Monis letter to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Place" rel="nofollow">

        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
         Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
        </a>
        advised his department at 12:15 pm on Monday, 1 June that they had not received the letter? Can he confirm that, at 5:30 pm that Monday, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet asked the Attorney-General's Department when the false claim would be corrected? Why did the Attorney-General ignore the advice on that Monday from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and fail to correct the record until the afternoon after question time of Thursday, 4 June?

         Senator Collins, I am perplexed by you. I am perplexed because I thought that you were a member of a Senate committee that, at the moment, was considering this question and that the hearings of that Senate committee were current. So how you can be a member of a Senate committee examining a matter which is still current and have announced conclusions about it—

             on two occasions on Monday, 1 June which appear to have been ignored by this minister in his failure to correct the record after that advice twice. He may think that it is amusing to criticise Senator Collins

               . I was merely making the point that it is very strange for a senator who sits on a committee examining a matter, where the proceedings of the committee are still current, to be announcing conclusions already before all of the evidence has been heard. So, Senator Collins, your question is actually inappropriate, but you do rather tip in your hand as somebody who has prejudged the issue. In any event, Senator Collins—

                   , on the point of order, the Leader of the Opposition has form in using points of order to get up and lecture people and make speeches, and I urge you to call her to account, rather than listening to the spurious points of order.

                    Order! There is no point of order. Both sides come to order. It would assist if we allowed the minister to be heard. I had trouble listening to the last 15 seconds of the minister's answer. Minister, you have 57 seconds.

                     Apparently not. Apparently it is not being treated seriously by the opposition, but, nevertheless, let me proceed with my answer. Senator Collins, in any event, your question is based on a false premise. I have addressed this more than once before. The record was corrected immediately—immediately it was confirmed to me that the evidence was incorrect. That occurred early on the Thursday afternoon of the second week of estimates, and I actually took the trouble, Senator Collins, of having the correction of the record hand-delivered to the Senate committee secretariat so that the Senate committee could be made aware of the correction as soon as possible.

                      , I ask a supplementary question. Can the Attorney-General confirm that he did not inform the foreign minister or her office that the minister had misled the House of Representatives on Thursday, 28 May until the afternoon of Thursday, 4 June, despite the Attorney-General becoming aware that the statements were misleading on Monday, 1 June?

                       That is simply not true, Senator Collins; I did not become aware of that. It was drawn to my attention that there were doubts about the earlier evidence, so I asked the secretary of my department to conduct an urgent inquiry. The results of that inquiry were communicated to me early in the afternoon of the following Thursday, at which time it was confirmed to me that the earlier concerns were correct and that the evidence the previous week was wrong. I immediately corrected the record and I immediately advised the foreign minister of the matter, who herself immediately corrected the record.
