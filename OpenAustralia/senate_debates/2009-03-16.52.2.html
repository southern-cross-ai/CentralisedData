        notes that previously, in relation to another airline operator, different instruments were made for a particular series of aircraft with a maximum seating capacity of 180 people when carrying fewer than 50 passenger seats, and when carrying more than 50 passenger seats.

       <p class="italic">
        This instrument revokes and remakes the Other Grants Guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Appendix 2A to these Guidelines specifies the conditions that apply to a Commercialisation Training Scheme grant. Clause 7 deals with rights of access to the premises and records of a grant recipient. Subclause 7.1 states that access must be given to certain prescribed officers, including “any person authorised in writing by the Secretary”. This appears to be a wide discretion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Subclause 6.3 in Appendix 2A states that the Commonwealth’s right to be indemnified is “in addition to, and not exclusive of” any other right, power or remedy provided by law. The words “not exclusive of” are, presumably, intended to mean “does not exclude”, rather than implying that the Commonwealth’s right is inclusive of other rights.

        The Committee has written to the relevant ministers seeking advice on the above matters.

          Reasons for Urgency
         </b>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Introduction and passage of the bills is sought in the 2009 Autumn sittings to ensure that ABIP is operational at the earliest possible opportunity.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Global credit conditions are likely to remain tight in 2009. Foreign banks play an important role in the Australian financial system, but global economic conditions mean that some foreign banks may consider withdrawing funding from viable Australian businesses, creating a funding gap. Other lenders, including second tier banks, may also consider withdrawing funding from viable Australian businesses.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Given its highly leveraged nature, the impact of any funding gap is likely to be felt first in the commercial property sector. Withdrawal of finance from viable commercial property projects may force businesses to sell assets in a depressed market, leading to a more rapid and disorderly fall in prices than would otherwise occur, resulting in adverse macroeconomic consequences.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Accordingly, on 24 January 2009 the Prime Minister announced that the Government will establish ABIP as a temporary contingency measure to provide support for viable commercial property assets where there is a withdrawal from refinancing arrangements due to abnormal conditions in global capital markets (
         <i>
          Building Australia’s future – a $4 billion Australian Business Investment Partnership to support Australian jobs
         </i>
         ). The Prime Minister also announced that the Government and Australia’s major banks would work together with a view to having ABIP operational by March 2009.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         ABIP will be initially funded at $4 billion, with the Government contribution of $2 billion matched by a $0.5 billion contribution from each of the four major banks. The initial $4 billion funding may be extended via the issuance of Government guaranteed debt to create up to $30 billion in financing.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         If the bills are not passed in the 2009 Autumn sittings, there will be no provision to support the commercial property assets of viable Australian commercial property projects, and the jobs and businesses they support, should financiers withdraw funding because of unrelated and uncontrollable fluctuations in global credit markets.

         <li>
          require people who make gifts above the threshold to candidates and members of groups during the election disclosure period to furnish a return within 8 weeks after polling day. Agents of candidates and groups have a similar timeframe to furnish a return in relation to gifts received during the disclosure period;
         </li>
         <li>
          if they fall within the relevant provision, require people who make gifts, agents of registered political parties, the financial controller of an associated entity, or people who have incurred political expenditure to furnish a return within 8 weeks after 31 December and 30 June each year rather than following the end of each financial year;
         </li>
         <li>
          ensure that for the purposes of the $1,000 threshold and the disclosure of gifts, related political parties are treated as the one entity;
         </li>
         <li>
          make unlawful the receipt of a gift of foreign property by political parties, candidates and members of a Senate group. It will also be unlawful in some situations for associated entities and people incurring political expenditure to receive a gift of foreign property;
         </li>
         <li>
          extend the current prohibition on the receipt of anonymous gifts above the threshold to prohibit the receipt of all anonymous gifts above $50 by registered political parties, candidates and members of a Senate group. It will also be unlawful in some situations for people and candidates to incur political expenditure if an anonymous gift above $50 enabled that political expenditure. The receipt of an anonymous gift of $50 or less may only be received in two specified situations;
         </li>
         <li>
          provide that public funding of election campaigning is limited to declared expenditure incurred by the eligible political party, candidate or Senate group, or the sum payable calculated on the number of first preference votes received where they have satisfied the 4% threshold, whichever is the lesser;
         </li>
         <li>
          add, with specified restrictions, five additional categories of electoral expenditure. These additional categories are the rental of premises, the payment of additional staff, the purchase and hire of office equipment, consumables and running costs for that equipment and travel and accommodation;
         </li>
         <li>
          prevent sitting members of Parliament from claiming electoral expenditure if allowances, entitlements or benefits received by a member of Parliament in his or her capacity as a member are used to meet that expenditure;

         The proposed Bill requires introduction and passage in the Autumn 2009 sitting period to give sufficient notice to all those involved in election campaigning – from parties and candidates, Senate groups and associated entities, through to third parties – to amend their record-keeping practices and plan their activities in accordance with the new rules scheduled to come into effect on 1 July 2009.

         In order to increase transparency and accountability in the funding and disclosure scheme, the bill proposes the introduction of six-monthly reporting combined with shorter deadlines to furnish returns. It is far more efficient if this six monthly reporting commences at the beginning of a new financial year on 1 July, rather than half way through, on 1 January, given the financial-year basis of current reporting.
