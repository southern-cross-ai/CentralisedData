          Can the minister inform the Senate on how the government’s economic stimulus has supported jobs and economic growth? What do market economists have to say about the impact of economic stimulus? What has been the trend of Australia’s unemployment rate since the stimulus has commenced? How has this stimulus helped support economic activity during the downturn? What examples is the minister aware of where local jobs have been supported as a result of the education stimulus?

            I thank Senator Polley for the question. There is a very good reason why Australia’s economy has performed so well over the last 12 months. It is because the Australian government took early, decisive action to support the economy through the economic stimulus package—a package which those opposite, Liberal and National Party senators, opposed and voted against six times; a package that has helped maintain confidence in the darkest days of the global financial crisis.
           </p>

            I think it’s actually a very enviable position, quite frankly. Many countries would die to have that sort of full and diversified exposure.

             <p class="italic">
              A large part of the divergence between expectations and reality reflects the fact that aggressive policy action—fiscal and monetary—worked. And it worked quickly.

              We have seen that reflected in the ABS labour force figures for February, which showed unemployment continued to track down to 5.3 per cent in February. Those opposite normally at this point would be thanking

              Economic stimulus has supported 200,000 jobs. The economy has added 180,000 jobs in the last year alone. Without the stimulus package, the economy would have contracted by 0.7 per cent last year. We would have been plunged into a fourth quarter recession. As I said earlier, the master builders are saying that the stimulus package is supporting 50,000 jobs—

                   Over on the other side the coalition senators talk about the

                   </a>
                   program and they criticise it. But out there in the community, Liberal Party MPs are supporting it. Today, Mr Laming, the member for Bowman, said at the doors, in relation to Building the Education Revolution:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   Look I am very grateful for every one of the projects in my electorate. They are all of high quality and the community appreciates them.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There you have it: the real feeling of the Liberal Party on the education stimulus—‘high quality’, ‘the community appreciates them’ and ‘very grateful’. But it gets better.

                     Mr Laming has been so badly caught out. He said he did not have a single problem with the schools stimulus. In his own seat there are 48 primary schools and $86 million worth of projects—not a single problem. A journalist said, ‘So you are delighted?’ Mr Laming said, ‘Absolutely, yes, I’m happy.’

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the minister aware of any threats to jobs in the form of a ‘great big new tax’? What would be the effect of such a ‘great big new tax’ on employment and economic growth? Why is it important for those looking for work to have policies designed that do not cost jobs?
