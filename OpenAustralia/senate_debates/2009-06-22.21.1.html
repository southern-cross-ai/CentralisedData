        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research. I refer to the pulp and paper industry strategy group which he announced last week, and I ask: how much is that group going to cost the taxpayer between now and November or whenever it reports? I also ask the minister, who has said that there is a balance to be sought between environmental concerns and economic activity by the pulp and paper industry: who are the environmentalists on this wall-to-wall industry group of lobbyists being facilitated by the government to draw up a lobbying plan for the government to get their hands on taxpayers’ money or taxpayer funded facilitation of the industry?

         I thank Senator Brown for his question. On Friday, 19 June I announced a review of the Australian pulp and paper manufacturing industry. The review will develop a long-term industry wide strategy for achieving a world-class sustainable pulp and paper industry. I have established a pulp and paper industry strategy group to undertake the review, including senior representatives from industry, unions, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         and all levels of government. The industry strategy group will develop a roadmap for the sustainable future of the pulp and paper industry and report back to me by November. An issues paper is currently being developed and will be made available publicly at the end of July.
        </p>
        <p>
         The future of the Burnie and Wesley Vale mills is currently under consideration by Tas Paper, or PaperlinX, and I understand a decision may be made by the end of June. While the government are concerned at any prospective job losses, we will not pre-empt Tas Paper’s strategy review of the mills nor the strategy industry group’s long-term review.

                   With regard to the pulp mill in Tasmania, the government has indicated that it will follow all of the appropriate procedural guidelines for the assessment. The pulp mill has been given approval to operate and it is now going through other measures that Minister Garrett currently has before him. As to the matters to do with the search for finance on an international basis, I am not aware of any support that the government has provided in that regard. If there is anything further that the Minister for Trade has to offer in that regard, I will come back to Senator Brown.
