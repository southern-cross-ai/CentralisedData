        Police this week responded to 597—I repeat: 597—domestic and family violence callouts in just seven days, and that number is most definitely underreported. Seventy-nine women are formally recorded as having been killed by a former or current partner in the Northern Territory since the year 2000 and 74 of them were Aboriginal.

        Hundreds of millions of dollars of additional taxpayer funding are going into the Northern Territory right now to address the ever-increasing statistics in a population of just 247,000. This week the Northern Territory coroner opened an inquiry into why the deaths of four Aboriginal women who endured long-term domestic violence had not been prevented.

Also impacted by this trauma are children—children who are likely, if not already, to be well represented in the youth justice and child protection statistics.

        , the wellbeing of local children is not being measured to understand the change. There's not nearly enough peer review or independent evaluation of new and existing programs to ensure maximum impact from this investment, and it's well past the time for much-needed further investigation.
