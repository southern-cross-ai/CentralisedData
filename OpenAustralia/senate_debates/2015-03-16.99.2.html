       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bills
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the bills is to implement the Government's 2013 election commitment to strengthen Australia's anti-dumping system, and a range of other reforms aimed at simplifying the system to make it quicker, more effective and more responsive to the interests of Australian businesses injured by dumping or subsidisation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Enactment of several reforms by 1 March 2015 is required to benefit Australian industry by ensuring that investigations of alleged dumping against groups of countries are not prematurely terminated, reducing the regulatory burden of lodging applications, and ensuring refunds are paid to Australian businesses whose imports do not harm Australian manufacturers. Furthermore, these reforms implement the Government's election commitment to create a level playing field for Australian manufacturers and enable stronger action against dumping. The Government has made reforming Australia's anti-dumping system a key priority so that material injury to Australian industry caused by dumped or subsidised imports can be remedied faster and more effectively.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Early passage of the bills is required to maximise savings that will be redirected to more efficient and effective services for Australian businesses. Some of these services have already commenced operation with the additional costs to government being absorbed until the legislation is passed. Swift passage will also address several live issues regarding the administration of the anti-dumping system, minimising legal risk for the Government.

        The Australian Government mandated a two year implementation period (May 2013 to May 2015) and it is essential that the bill be passed by 17 May 2015 when the transition period ends and the offence provisions come into force.
