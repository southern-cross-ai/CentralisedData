        I rise to note the passing of one of the most inspirational women I have ever had the pleasure to know. Shirley McKerrow
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        was not a politician, but she was definitely a woman in politics. She was the first woman ever elected as president of a state division of what was then the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Country Party
        </a>
        when in 1976 she was elected president of the Victorian division. In 1981 she became the first woman in Australia to hold the position of president of any political party. It was around that time that I came to know her. I was an obnoxious teenager stuffing campaign envelopes and Shirley was a dignified, calm, intelligent woman who could absolutely hold her own in a room full of men who thought that they were big political strategists.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shirley was a formidable leader who never lost her grace and style. She was also so much more than just her political life. She was a committed and dedicated community member, serving on multiple committees and associations. She worked actively for her regional community in Sunbury and later Darwin, where she moved after her time as our federal president. She was also a wife and a loving mother to Dianne, Ian, Lachlan and Sally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shirley was my inspiration. She was without a doubt a shining example of commitment and dedication to our party, to her family and to her community. She will be sadly missed. My thoughts and prayers go out to her friends and family.
