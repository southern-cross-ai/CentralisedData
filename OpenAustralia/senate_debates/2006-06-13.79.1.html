        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present report No. 8 of 2006 on the proposed fit-out of new leased premises for Centrelink at Greenway,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        , and I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in
        <i>

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>

        The statement read as follows—

       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Proposed fit-out of New Leased Premises for Centrelink at Greenway, ACT
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report examines the proposed fit-out of new leased premises for Centrelink’s National Support Office at a complex currently under construction near the ACTs
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuggeranong_Town_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Tuggeranong Town Centre
        </a>
        . The estimated cost of the proposed fit-out works is $42.79 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Centrelink’s 3,200 National Support Office employees are currently accommodated in 11 buildings throughout the ACT. Several of these premises are 15 to 20 years old and cannot economically be adapted to meet Centrelink’s needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over time, the Department has expanded to occupy some 46, 000 square metres of leasehold accommodation in Canberra, with 12 of its 15 leased premises being located in Woden.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new National Support Office will consist of two buildings sharing a common basement, roof and enclosed central zone. The northern building will have four levels and the southern building will have five levels, including covered car parking at ground level.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In reviewing the proposal, the Committee questioned Centrelink about other short-listed sites and why these had been rejected. Centrelink explained that it had given careful consideration to a property located in the Tuggeranong Town Centre, and another situated in Woden. Both these were rejected, however, as neither was large enough to accommodate a 30,000 square metre building.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        was particularly impressed by the range of access equity measures proposed for inclusion in the new premises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Centrelink reported that the building would be designed in such a way as to allow persons with mobility concerns unimpeded access to all areas, and would incorporate such features as:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         roll-resistant floor coverings;
        </li>
        <li>
         hearing loops in meeting rooms;
        </li>
        <li>
         tactile indicators;
        </li>
        <li>
         full Braille signage;
        </li>
        <li>
         equal access toilets and showers on each floor; and
        </li>
        <li>
         large-winged or sensor taps.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee investigated a number of other building features such as car-parking arrangements, access to child-care facilities, fire-protection provisions and the configuration of office space to ensure that the new premises would provide an appropriate level of safety and amenity for occupants. Centrelink satisfied the Committee that it had considered these factors in its project design and that it would continue to consult with staff and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_and_Public_Sector_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Community and Public Sector Union
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Having received a submission from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greenhouse_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greenhouse Office
        </a>
        , the Committee also wished to ensure that the building and fit-out would meet the highest possible standards in terms of energy consumption and environmentally sustainable design. Centrelink responded that it intends to use separate digital metering of electricity, water, gas and diesel consumption to enable close monitoring of energy use. Under Centrelink’s new lease, the landlord will bear a financial penalty if agreed indoor temperature levels are not maintained. Centrelink was confident that this arrangement would ensure the preservation of indoor air quality and the sustainable use of temperature control and ventilation services.

        , having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the Committee recommends that proposed fit-out of new leased premises for Centrelink proceed at the estimated cost of $42.79 million.

        In closing, I wish to thank those who assisted with the inspection and public hearing, my Committee colleagues, and staff.
