        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Labor is deeply concerned about the Turkish military operation targeting Kurds in northern Syria and has called on Turkey to cease unilateral action. We are already seeing that the operation is further destabilising the region and worsening the humanitarian disaster in Syria and risks undermining progress against Daesh. Can the minister update the Senate on the situation in northern Syria and advise what action the Australian government has taken?

         I thank Senator Wong for her question. As the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate would appreciate, this is a very fast evolving and very dangerous situation. Both the Prime Minister and I have made it very clear in our statements that the Turkish military action has grave consequences for regional security. Amongst other things, it will significantly undermine the gains that have been made by the international coalition in our fight against Daesh and, without question, Daesh continues to be a serious threat to regional peace and security, despite its territorial defeat. It will certainly cause additional civilian suffering, it will lead to greater population displacement and it will further inhibit the access of international organisations to those who are in need of international humanitarian support.
        </p>
        <p>
         The shadow minister also asked a question in relation to Australia's engagement. Before the incursion actually commenced and as a clear response to the announcements being made by Turkey, I issued a statement on 8 October urging restraint by all parties to the conflict in Syria and calling for all involved to avoid escalatory actions and opportunistic actions that would cause further instability and add to humanitarian suffering. I directed the

         </a>
         to make Australia's views plain to the Turkish ambassador in Canberra and in Ankara. Last week, the Prime Minister spoke to French President Macron and, on the weekend, the Prime Minister and I both spoke with

         Pompeo to discuss the situation with Turkey and in Syria. Yesterday, I spoke to my counterpart, the Turkish foreign minister, in a detailed and wide-ranging telephone discussion, repeating Australia's concerns, urging restraint and indicating the severe impact that this would have on the regional security situation and the security situation more broadly.

           I thank the minister for her outline of what the government has done. Whilst the military action has been launched by Turkey, it has been enabled by the decision of the Trump administration to withdraw
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
            US
           </a>
           forces from northern Syria. I understand from her answer that representations have been made to the

            Secretary of State
           </a>
           . Could the minister advise what representations were made to the US about the impact of its decision to withdraw forces from northern Syria?

            I think it's very important to be clear about where responsibilities lie in relation to the impact of these military actions. Turkey is responsible for the decisions it has made in conducting this incursion. Turkey is totally accountable for the actions of its military forces and the militia groups it is employing. They are responsible for the humanitarian suffering they are causing through their military operations and they are accountable for the detention, custody and escape of any Daesh fighters. Our discussions with the United States concerned these issues and more, but it is not my habit, as you know and as the Senate knows, to go into the contents of those private discussions.

                 As I said in my remarks in my response to Senator Wong's first question, we are very concerned about the impact that this military action by Turkey will have on the fight and campaign against Daesh. We know that we have achieved a territorial defeat of Daesh, and that is broadly accepted, but we also know, and Australia most particularly recognises given the vulnerabilities in our own region, that Daesh is more than capable of large bursts of energy and activity and continuing terrorist and violent extremist activity not just in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
                  Middle East
                 </a>
                 but also allied with other extremist organisations in our region and more broadly. So any action that enables their activity, that enables that engagement, is of concern to Australia.
