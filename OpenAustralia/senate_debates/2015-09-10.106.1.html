        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. I refer to the deeply concerning evidence provided to the Senate select committee inquiry which investigated allegations of abuse at the Regional Processing Centre at Nauru. Will the government undertake a full audit and investigation of all allegations of sexual abuse, child abuse and other criminal allegations as recommended by the inquiry?

         I thank Senator Gallacher for his question in relation to what is a very serious topic. But I do advise the Senate that the department fully cooperated with the Senate Select Committee throughout its investigations, and it will now take note of the findings. I can confirm that the Australian government remains steadfast in its support of regional processing as an effective deterrent strategy to combat illegal maritime travel and stop the boats. Whilst there are many in this chamber who remain opposed to offshore protection, this government remains steadfastly in support of it. As I said, the department fully cooperated, and we are currently reviewing the findings.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Will the government introduce transparency measures, including a ministerial report to the Senate, on action taken in response to the criminal allegations at the Nauru processing centre as recommended by the inquiry?

           I just want to make it very, very clear that all reported allegations of sexual assault, serious assault et cetera are properly investigated by contracted service providers, reported to the department and referred to the appropriate Nauruan authorities for investigation where appropriate. The fact that you on that side do not like that does not mean that this is not the appropriate process to follow. The report itself also presumes that Australia has effective control of the Nauru Regional Processing Centre and is implicitly responsible for all matters of state in Nauru. It is the position of the Australia government that we do not have effective control of the centre.

                  Those on the other side fail to understand that there has been an inquiry into what occurred and that a report was provided to the government and the department. This, of course, is the Moss review. There were 19 recommendations, all of which were accepted. Since that time, the department has been working closely with the government of Nauru and the contracted service providers to respond to the review's recommendations.
