        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to former member Mr Andrew Robb and his appointment to the Chinese owned Landbridge Group less than seven months after stepping down as Minister for Trade and Investment. Given the Landbridge Group has cited Mr Robb's influence as a leading factor in his appointment, has the Prime Minister sought to clarify what role this new appointment will take and whether this represents a conflict with his previous role as a government minister?

         The short answer to your question is: no, it does not. Might I remind you,

         —I do not think you served in the parliament when Mr Robb was the Minister for Trade and Investment—that Mr Robb was an outstanding Minister for Trade and Investment and one of, if not, I daresay, the greatest ministers for trade Australia has ever seen and is widely acknowledged as having been so, including by some on your side of politics. It was Mr Robb, after all, who presided over the signing of not one, not two, but three historic free trade agreements with

          South Korea
         </a>
         , Japan and China—all of which eluded the previous Labor government, which pursued those agreements with no success over six years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Robb is now pursuing his postministerial career, and it is up to Mr Robb, just as it is up to all former ministers, to ensure that it is compliant with ministerial standards. I am completely satisfied that Mr Robb is a man of integrity, he is a man of honour, he was an exemplary minister and he is having an exemplary postministerial career.
        </p>
        <p>
         I might remind you, Senator McCarthy, that Mr Robb is not the first former minister to have had a successful postministerial career. Former Labor trade minister

             I refer to the Prime Minister's own statement of ministerial standards which prohibits former ministers lobbying, advocating or conducting business meetings with members of the government for an 18-month period after ceasing to be a minister. What action has the Prime Minister taken to assure himself that no meetings have taken place between Mr Robb and any member of the government?

               , I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question related to what action the Prime Minister has taken. So whatever the senator thinks about Mr Robb is really very interesting, but that is not the question. We did not ask about his integrity. We asked what action the Prime Minister is taking to satisfy himself that the statement of ministerial standards, which prohibits lobbying, has been complied with. They are the Prime Minister's standards. What action has he taken to ensure they have been complied with? It is a very simple question.

                   It is the same point. We are simply asking a question. The only person talking about 'besmirching' is this minister, this senator, this so-called leader. The question is: how is Mr Turnbull ensuring that there has been compliance with his own statement of ministerial standards? Why is that such a difficult question to answer?
