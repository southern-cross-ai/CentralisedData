        , my question is to the Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness, Senator Arbib. Can the minister update the Senate as to what the government is doing to help Australian families to access affordable housing and, in terms of new construction, how many new homes is the government investing in to help Australians and their families?

         I thank Senator Stephens for the question and for the opportunity to inform the house on the latest data of the Social Housing Initiative and housing affordability programs.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am extremely proud of the work that the Gillard government is doing in relation to affordable housing. Since 2009 this government has made the biggest ever investment in social and affordable housingâ€”almost $20 billion. The Social Housing Initiative, which many of the Liberal Party and National Party senators on the other side of the chamber voted against, is on track to deliver 19,600 social housing dwellings, with 16,500 dwellings now complete. Under the National Partnership Agreement on Social Housing, which is also on track, we will deliver another 1,900 social housing dwellings. That is 21,500 dwellings to help Australian families access affordable accommodation. This record investment means that 34,000 Australians and their families will have an affordable roof over their heads when these initiatives are completed.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can also inform the Senate that, according to the tenant data collected, as at the end of August 8,000 people who were homeless have been accommodated, 2,000
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         have been accommodated, almost 6,000 people with a disability have found a home, and approximately 850 people escaping family violence have found a place to call home. This was all achieved under programs that this federal Labor government has been delivering to support Australian families.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also point to a program that Minister Burke has recently rolled out and updated, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rental_Affordability_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          National Rental Affordability Scheme
         </a>
         , or

          NRAS
         </a>
         . When complete, this scheme will provide 50,000 rental dwellings. These are the programs that Labor is delivering.

           All up, the government is providing almost 80,000 homes for families. Of course, in this country we do have a challenge with homelessness, and it is important that people and families who are homeless have access not only to housing but also to services. Under the government's agreements with the states and territories we are investing $1.1 billion in over 180 new or expanded initiatives to help reduce homelessness through the national partnership agreement. Of these new or expanded initiatives, 26 will address homelessness amongst families and children.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Rent Connect program provides information, advice and referrals to assist families to secure a property in the private rental market. Already it has provided more than 70,000 instances of support to Australian families.

             I have raised the 80,000 figure that the government is providing, and we still have 3,500 social housing dwellings under construction. These are providing jobs to workers and will be providing roofs over the heads of many Australians who are in need.
            </p>
            <p>
             The question is related to the risks to these programs. We have the $70 billion black hole in the budget of those on the opposite side of the chamber because of the voodoo economics of people like
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
              Mr Hockey
             </a>
             and Mr Robb. They have already confirmed that it will be $70 billion, and we know where they are going to do. They are going to cut services, just as they did last time. They have a lot of form on housing, because the last time they were in government they cut $3.1 billion from housing programs. That $3.1 billion was taken away from Australian housing. When you look at the housing waiting lists in the states and territories at the moment, you can blame those Liberal Party senatorsâ€”
