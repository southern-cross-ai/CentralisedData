        Most pregnancy counselling services are not subject to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Practices_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Trade Practices Act
        </a>
        because they do not charge for the information they provide. This means they are not prohibited from engaging in misleading or deceptive advertising.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Transparent Advertising and Notification of Pregnancy Counselling Services Bill 2005 would make pregnancy counselling organisations subject to similar misleading and deceptive advertising laws as those organisations engaged in trade or commerce.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We would like a committee to examine the adequacy of the legislation in improving regulation of pregnancy counselling, and ensure the counselling provided by Government-funded pregnancy counselling services is objective, non-directive, and includes information on all three pregnancy options.
