       <p>
        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 360, standing in the name of Senator Keneally, relating to the establishment of a select committee on temporary migration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the request of Senator Keneally, I move the motion as amended:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) That the Senate notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) that Australia has the second-largest migrant workforce in the world;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that, according to Australian Population Research Institute, almost a fifth of the nation's cleaners, store packers, and food and hospitality workers are on temporary migrant visas, and the number of migrants on the visas has jumped from 1.8 million to 2.2 million in the past four years;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that due to their temporary status and threats of deportation, migrant workers are more often subject to exploitation, wage theft and even physical and sexual abuse; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) as the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Migration, Mr Wood, stated 'Organised crime and illegitimate labour hire companies are using this loophole to bring out illegal workers who are often vulnerable and open to exploitation. This represents an orchestrated scam that enables these criminal elements to exploit foreign workers in Australia until their claims are finalised'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) That a select committee, to be known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Select Committee
        </a>
        on Temporary Migration, be established to inquire into and report on the impact temporary migration has on the Australia's economy, wages and jobs, social cohesion and workplace rights and conditions, with particular reference to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) government policy settings, including their impact on the employment prospects and social cohesion of Australians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the impact of temporary skilled and unskilled migration on Australia's labour market;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) policy responses to challenges posed by temporary migration;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) whether permanent migration offers better long-term benefits for Australia's economy, Australian workers and social cohesion;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the impact of wage theft, breaches of workplace rights and conditions, modern slavery and human trafficking on temporary migrants; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) any related matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) That the committee present its final report on or before 2 December 2020.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        ; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) one nominated by minor party and independent senators.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) That:

       <p class="italic">
        (10) That the committee and any subcommittee have power to send for and examine persons and documents, to move from place to place, to sit in public or in private, notwithstanding any prorogation of the Parliament or dissolution of the House of Representatives, and have leave to report from time to time its proceedings and the evidence taken and such interim recommendations as it may deem fit.
