        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to the answer given by Mr David Tune, Secretary of the Department of Finance and Deregulation, that the 'expected sale of assets from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Future Fund
        </a>
        was included in the figure for the sale of non-financial assets', in the budget. As the net cashflows from investments in non-financial assets form part of the surplus in statement No. 9 of the budget's financial statements, is the minister able to tell us whether the sale of Future Fund assets will decrease, increase or in any way affect the government's $3.5 billion surplus forecast for 2012-13?

        <p>
         In relation to the reference to statement No. 9, if the senator does want to look at that he will see that there is, as has been the case under governments of both political persuasions, the reporting of cashflows from investments in non-financial assets and the net cashflows from such investments. He would also see that across the forward estimates, including in the 2012-13 year, to which he has referred, the net position of investments in non-financial assets is in fact a negative on the budget. If the assertion is that there is a negative net position but somehow that is not a negative net position because it is helping you in another way, what is being asserted simply does not make sense.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the quantum I make the point that this was traversed at estimates. There are a range of decisions, hundreds of decisions, that go into a budget bottom line. They include things such as the $22 billion worth of savings that the government took in the budget, which added to the some $83.6 billion, I think, in savings over previous budgets since Labor came to office.

           There is no point of order, Senator Joyce. The minister is answering the question and has 27 seconds remaining to add to the answer.

            I am not sure how much more relevant I can be. I have taken the senator through the budget papers. I have tried to explain it to him courteously. But the fact is that he is actually not interested in the answer, just like he has never, as part of the coalition's economic team previously, been interested in putting together costings which add up.

                    If you knew the answer, why did you ask the question? These figures are published annually, as the senator would be aware. I will take on notice the precise total cumulative change over the last number of years. I would make the point that, like most other funds, there was a global financial crisis, so obviously that would have been reflected in the returns on investment. In relation to the amount held in—

                        I think one thing we have established in this question time is that, clearly, Senator Cormann and Senator Joyce do not talk to each other, because I answered almost the entirety of that question in response to the first question from Senator Cormann. I have also put out a press release. Clearly, Senator Joyce does not like reading and he does not like facts to get in the way of a good story. He is wrong. We have made clear that we are not raiding the

                        , we are not withdrawing funds from the Future Fund and we have no intention of doing so. He should stop coming in here and making false assertions, because false assertions are not a substitute for political debate and they are certainly not a substitute for sensible economic policy. And let me tell you that, when it comes to sensible economic policy, that end of the chamber is a complete wasteland.
