        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. Can the minister outline to the Senate the importance of spreading the benefits of the mining boom to all corners of the economy. What is the role of tax cuts for small and large businesses in delivering these benefits?

         I thank the senator for his question. Like many in this place—but, unfortunately, not those on the other side—he understands the importance of spreading the benefits of the boom for all Australians. The government is moving to put in place a minerals resource rent tax, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
          MRRT
         </a>
         , with the intention of giving a boost to small business and a boost to the superannuation savings of working Australians. There is an absolute intention by this government to ensure that the benefits of the boom are spread widely. It was with some consternation that we found out today the Leader of the Opposition will be the first Liberal leader in living memory to vote against a tax cut for small business. Sadly, that is how

           put his view as to the party's position. I accept the Greens position; I do not agree with it, but I accept it. I accept that they do not believe in a lower company tax rate. But what is extraordinary is that the Liberal Party are lining up to vote with the Australian Greens to kill a company tax. Who would have thought that the

             Unlike those opposite, we are committed to delivering tax cuts to small business and to the broader economy. The Treasurer has released draft legislation today which will ensure that we can cut company tax to help Australian businesses right across the economy including those that are not in the fast lane and those that are facing challenges such as the high dollar. It is legislation that cuts the tax rate for all companies from 30 per cent to 29 per cent for 2013-14 and subsequent income years. And, of course, there will be a head start for small business with the rate applying from 1 July this year—that is, in less than four months time. We on this side understand that this will help small business grow. We understand that the cut in the corporate tax rate is important to increase productivity, to promote broad based economic growth and to encourage more investment and jobs across Australia. But what do we have on the other side? It is interesting. We have opposition yet again—

               If you do not cost your policies properly and you do not fund them properly you cannot deliver them properly—and this is the position in which the opposition find themselves. I feel some sympathy for the opposition backbench, because
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
                Mr Hockey

               and Mr Robb, and presumably Senator Cormann, have got themselves into a position where they cannot find enough cuts to make up the $70 billion black hole and so now they have to impose on their party room a vote with the

               to kill a company tax cut. That is what they have had to impose on their backbench. One wonders if people like Senator Sinodinos think this is a great idea—for the
