        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Can the minister confirm that, nearly two years after COVID-19 reached Australian shores, and with the emergence of a new variant of concern, not one new federal quarantine facility has yet opened its doors?

         I thank the senator for her question. Australia's decisions taken and led by the Prime Minister from 1 February last year to close our international borders have been a key feature of Australia's success in protecting Australians from COVID-19 and ensuring that we have saved lives—some estimated 30,000-plus lives, compared with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">

             Those border closures have served Australia well. The quarantine arrangements that have been associated with those border closures have, overwhelmingly, also worked effectively and served Australians well. In the vast majority of cases, hundreds of thousands of Australians have been able to move back into our country safely and securely. Part of that has been the crucial role that the

             ; it received a significant expansion to a capacity of 2,000 during this time frame.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to the work at the Howard Springs facility, work is underway on additional quarantine facilities in Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth following the encouragement and partnership agreements struck by state governments in each of those jurisdictions. The first of those is scheduled to see beds handed over to the Victorian government by the end of this year. That remains on track and remains the case to provide longer term capabilities to respond to COVID or other emergencies into the future.

                Australia's defences throughout COVID-19, as I said at the outset, have been incredibly strong. We have shown amazing resilience as a nation and great capacity to be able to minimise the loss of life and, whilst minimising the loss of life, to work ourselves into a position as a nation where we are now one of the most heavily vaccinated and most protected populations and nations across the planet and that is our key protection in relation to COVID-19.
               </p>
               <p>
                We are working on building these additional centres for national resilience. These centres will serve their purpose in continued response to COVID-19 but they will also serve a purpose in response to other future pandemics, natural disasters or emergency situations around the world. It is important in relation to the omicron variant that we keep a sense of perspective, as many infectious disease and public health experts have urged. Government is working through the evidence in relation to that.
