        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Senator Cash. Can the minister confirm that Qantas has received more than a billion dollars in taxpayer funded support since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, including hundreds of millions of dollars of JobKeeper wage subsidies?

         I thank Senator Sheldon for the question. What I can confirm is that we're in the middle of a global pandemic and that many industries across Australia have been hard hit. I do acknowledge that the aviation sector, in particular, has been hard hit. As a result of that, you are correct: the government has provided industries and employers with support, whether that's by way of JobKeeper or the plethora of other policies that we have put in place. Like you, Senator Sheldon, and like my colleagues on the government side of the chamber, we are saddened by any job losses as a result of the global pandemic, including those job losses that have recently been announced by Qantas. Without a doubt, it has been a tough year for the aviation sector. It has been a tough year and a long year. And, in particular, as you know, Senator Sheldon, because of the fact that our international borders remain closed and our domestic borders are only now really reopening up—and they will continue to reopen—only now are we seeing more flights in the air. But, Senator Sheldon, our government has taken extensive action, as you know, to support the aviation sector to the extent possible, bearing in mind the extent of the global pandemic. And in fact, Senator Sheldon, you would be aware that support to Australia's aviation industry now totals more than $2.7 billion. But, like any industry in Australia and like employers, you are right: we have, as a government, provided them with support.

           Despite receiving more than $1 billion in taxpayer support, Qantas has outsourced a further 2,000 jobs. Does the government support this decision by Qantas?

            Again, the government has been very clear from day one. Any job lost as a result of COVID-19 is an absolute tragedy, but, as you know, this is a commercial decision for Qantas, and Qantas are entitled to make those decisions. I have some statistics in relation to stand ups and stand downs. This actually shows the effect of the global pandemic on the aviation industry. But we're also seeing that, as borders reopen, aviation companies are able to bring, as you know, their staff back on—

                   Since March, the government has allowed Virgin to fall into administration while giving Rex millions of dollars in untied grants, enabling them to expand their roots. It has given some aviation companies access to JobKeeper while abandoning others—like Dnata workers—and it has sat back while Qantas has sacked a further 2,000 workers. What does the minister have to say to the Qantas workers who have lost their jobs and who are in the gallery and the building today?

                    As I have said, as the Prime Minister said, as my colleagues have said, any job lost as a result of COVID-19 is absolutely devastating. The aviation industry has been hard-hit as a result of COVID-19, and that is why the government has provided extensive support to the aviation sector after what, I acknowledge, has been a very long and a very tough and a very difficult year.
