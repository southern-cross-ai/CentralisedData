       <p class="italic">
        The cancellation of OPEL was a lost opportunity for Australian business and consumers, particularly in the bush. Almost 900,000 premises across rural and remote Australia were to have been delivered metro-equivalent services at metro-comparable prices. Many of those premises would have been receiving services now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, isn’t Optus right? And isn’t it the case that rural and regional Australia would have had much better broadband services under the OPEL contract than they have today or are likely to have for years to come under Labor’s flawed and much delayed

         I thank Senator Minchin for his ongoing interest in this issue. The evidence given last week by Optus reflected a view towards its project which was negotiated with the previous government. As has been discussed at length in this chamber and as has been discussed at length in Senate estimates—as Senator Minchin is aware—the contract with OPEL and the government was terminated on the basis that it ultimately did not provide the services that it offered. This was after rigorous examination. This was quite a clear situation. There is no question that the services could not be provided as contracted for.

           OPEL are perfectly able, if they dispute this, to take legal action, Senator Minchin. It has been nearly a year—in fact, it has been more than a year. We are in a situation where the government is systematically working its way through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
            National Broadband Network
           </a>
           process. Our ambition has always been to make an announcement at the end of March and we are consistently refusing to speculate on the outcome of that. Despite many opportunities, invitations and questions from not just Senator Minchin, but from Senator Birmingham and others, we will not be drawn on the conclusion and our announcement on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           . What I can say, though, is that Australians across Australia will be better off under Labor’s NBN plan than they would have been under the former government’s plan. Five capital cities get a superfast fibre network—that is what you were prepared to offer.

             The entire premise of that question is false, so I am not sure how one can be relevant to a question whose premise is false. But let me be absolutely clear about this: key issues at the centre of negotiations and discussions are the timing, scope and direction of the rollout. That is something that I will again decline the opportunity to speculate on. I am not going to undermine the Commonwealth’s negotiating position on this matter, as with any other matter. The good news is, Senator Minchin, we are only weeks away from an announcement.
