         Long Walk
        </a>
        from Melbourne to Canberra, advocating for a voice to parliament. Since his first walk in 2004, to combat racial discrimination, we've made meaningful strides including the apology to the stolen generations. This time, Mr Long used his walk to advocate we take the next steps together: recognition and practical action through the Voice. Can the minister explain how the Voice will empower Indigenous Australians in key areas like health, education and housing?

         or GALLAGHER (â€”) (): I thank Senator Urquhart for the question, and for the support she's providing in Tasmania for the campaign for a voice to our parliament and Constitutional recognition for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         Australians. Listening to the advice of the Voice will help inform decisions to direct funds where they will have the most impact and deliver the best outcomes in those key areas of Indigenous health, education, employment and housing. We are still seeing around an eight-year gap in life expectancy between Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people compared with other Australians. Nationally, 68.1 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people aged 20 to 24 years had attained year 12 or equivalent qualification compared to 90.7 per cent of non-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , and only 81.4 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are living in appropriately sized, not overcrowded, housing compared with 93.5 per cent of non-Indigenous Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we are doing now is not working and it is time for us to walk a different path together as a nation, to change the structure of how we make decisions that affect Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and then change the outcomes. That is what this referendum is about. It is about bringing the country together and working with each other to drive those better outcomes. As
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Long" rel="nofollow">
          Michael Long

         so powerfully said this morning in Canberra:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I don't want to be talking about closing the gap in another 20 years or 30 years. Let's do something about it, you know, and part of that is being able to advocate on issues that affect Indigenous people. We haven't got it right yet. It's unbelievable that in 2023 we haven't got this right.
        </p>
        <p>
         But on October 14 we have a chance to make this right. On referendum day, each one of us can take action to close the gap by voting yes for constitutional recognition through a voice to our nation's parliament.'

            . There is no doubt that we will make better decisions when we listen, and the outcomes are better when those directly affected can have a say. Listening to the advice of the Voice will help inform decisions about funding, where they will have the most impact and deliver better outcomes in those key areas.
           </p>
           <p>
            We know that ensuring Aboriginal and

             Torres Strait Islander
            </a>
            people have a say on the matters that affect communities will deliver better value for money. Governments from both sides have invested billions in programs that haven't delivered the outcomes or worked for local communities. A Voice will help us listen to locals and ensure that money is invested in those areas that will drive better outcomes. By incorporating the Voice into our decision-making processes, we're not only improving programs or policies but are fostering a more inclusive, respectful and United Australia.

               concluded his walk today, we were reminded we have a shared opportunity for a fresh start. By embracing the Voice, we are not just listening but we are acting and, in doing so, we are paving the way for a brighter, more harmonious future for everybody. We saw this in action this morning when representatives from across the political spectrum, including from members of the opposition, joined the Prime Minister and Michael Long in Canberra to walk for the Voice. We will see this spirit of togetherness in action on Sunday when across Australia anyone is able to join their local community walk and walk in support of an Indigenous Voice to Parliament.
              </p>
              <p>
               The reasons to vote yes are simple and compelling and really come down to those three main reasons about respect, about recognition and, finally, about delivering better outcomes for
