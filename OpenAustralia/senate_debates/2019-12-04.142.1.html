        (e) Australia is forecast to import more dairy products than it exports by 2023;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) four foreign-owned milk processors control an increasing proportion of milk production in Australia setting the price at the farm gate, and that during the period 2013 to 2017, these processors had revenues in Australia of over $160 billion but paid less than $160 million in income tax or a rate of less than 1%;

        (2) That the Senate requires the Minister for Agriculture to attend the Senate on Thursday, 5 December 2019, at 3:30pm, to provide an explanation of no more than 10 minutes of the Government's plan to save the dairy industry from long-term decline.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) At the conclusion of the explanation, any senator may move to take note of the explanation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

           do not agree with every aspect of this motion. We've been speaking to farmers across the country and we know from them that it's a complex issue and there are a range of views. Some farmers oppose re-regulation and don't want a price floor and are concerned about competition from

            New Zealand
           </a>
           . The Greens want to see an approach that addresses the varied needs of dairy farmers across the country rather than knee-jerk reactions to respond to a single subsector of the broader dairy industry. But we will support this motion because we don't want to see inaction. It's taken far too long for the coalition to address the price crash of 2016, and, as the motion correctly recognises, none of the recommendations of the
