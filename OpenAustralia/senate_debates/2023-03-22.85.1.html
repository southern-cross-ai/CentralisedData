        It has been a very tough time for the trans community. This weekend we saw a vile alliance of hate between transphobes, Neo-Nazis and other far-right extremists on the streets of Melbourne. Last night,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        's Mark Latham spoke at an anti-trans meeting in Sydney. That is disgusting on its own, but LGBTQIA+ activists peacefully protesting outside were violently attacked. This chamber has seen much hate-mongering targeting trans people from the likes of One Nation. They are expanding their catalogue of hate from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Asian Australians
        </a>
        and Muslims to the entire trans community. They are constantly searching for new targets to whip up a frenzy against. The bigotry towards trans people has become one of the defining elements of far-right extremism. This is abhorrent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I vehemently condemn these merchants of hate. Their hate reverberates around the community and causes tremendous harm. Transgender people are some of the most marginalised. Young transgender people face enormous stigma and are at much higher risk than their peers of serious mental health concerns, self-harm and suicide. The media outlets who in the last few years have platformed hate against trans people and allowed it to be spread should be ashamed. The politicians in this place who spew transphobic bigotry don't really belong here. Fascism, transphobia and racism are all part of the same arc of hate that must be destroyed.
       </p>
       <p>
        My solidarity is with the courageous LGBTQIA+ and antifascist protesters who have been fighting against a sickening level of prejudice and hate this week. Transphobia has no place in politics, in media or in society. There should be zero tolerance for this. We should be loud and proud about the rights of trans and gender diverse people. Trans rights are human rights.
