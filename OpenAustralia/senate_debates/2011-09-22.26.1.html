        I thank the Senate. In the circumstances, I indicate that what we were seeking to do was protect a lot of the not-for-profit sector organisations in Queensland. I also provide an invitation to Senator Furner to withdraw the accusations that he made during the adjournment debate about my motivation and that of the coalition in seeking the disallowance of this regulation, given that the government has now seen sense itself. The inappropriate motives that were attributed to us on this side are now shown to be without foundation. There was a genuine issue at stake here. To all those who joined with the coalition in achieving this outcome, I say thankyou. I also say thankyou to the minister for addressing the problem in the manner that he did.

         by leave—I think it will help if I elaborate on some of the background to this matter for the Senate. In 2009, the Queensland Industrial
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relations" rel="nofollow">
          Relations
         </a>
         Commission made a pay equity decision that increased wages for employees in the Queensland social and community services sector. The purpose of the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Amendment Regulations 2011 (No. 1) was to require Queensland social and community service employers, who received funding from the Queensland government following this decision and who have returned to the Queensland system in the absence of the Queensland referral of workplace relations powers to the Commonwealth, to pay employees in accordance with that decision. The Australian government agreed to this request from the Queensland government and made the regulation using a list of employers that was provided by the Queensland government, we understand, in consultation with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASU" rel="nofollow">
          ASU
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The government became aware of concerns of the Queensland social and community services sector about the accuracy of the list of employers and the ability of some employers to meet backpay requirements. After careful consideration, the government has acted on these concerns and will repeal the regulations before they commence on 1 October 2011. The government will commence a process to engage with representatives of Queensland social and community service providers, the Queensland government and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Services Union
         </a>
         over the next few weeks to clarify who are the employers required to pay employees in accordance with the Queensland decision and to determine the appropriate point in time from which those obligations should commence. To facilitate this, it is necessary that the current regulations be repealed and replaced. The government will repeal the regulations before they commence. Social and community service providers and employers in Queensland, however, should be aware that it is the government's intention to ensure that the current Queensland pay equity rates are paid to social and community service workers from 1 October 2011, as previously advised. This will be reflected in the replacement regulations.

           The Greens
          </a>
          have been on the record for a long time supporting the pay equity case for community sector workers, believing very strongly that those workers are an essential part of our community. They deliver absolutely essential services. We have been strongly supportive of that case. We are also strongly supportive of the not-for-profit sector in general. We are concerned about any unintended consequences for not-for-profit organisations. So we want to make sure there are no adverse consequences, while supporting pay equity for the workers, which we believe is essential. We are aware there are some problems with this regulation. The list, in particular, is of concern—the issues around which organisations have received funding from the state government. We are aware the state government has put in $414 million to help with that. So the issue is how to fix the situation, which I am convinced everybody knows and wants to get fixed.
         </p>
         <p>
          The key part of the announcement here is that workers will be paid as if this regulation took effect from 1 October. In other words, workers will not be disadvantaged by repealing this instrument and then fixing it. Workers will essentially be back paid from whenever this new instrument takes effect. Workers will receive back pay as if this regulation came into effect from 1 October. That is particularly important—in other words, workers are not being disadvantaged by some of the unfortunate errors that have occurred with this regulation.
