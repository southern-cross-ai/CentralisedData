        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Health_and_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
        </a>
        , which has found that health expenditure in 2012-13 grew at its lowest rate in 30 years. Does the minister agree with the president of the AMA, Associate Professor Brian Owler, that this 'makes a mockery of the government's claims that healthcare spending is out of control'?

         No, I do not agree with the comment by Professor Owler. Those opposite might not realise that the AIHW report is actually a snapshot in time. My understanding is that those figures were comparative to the previous financial year. It is a snapshot in time. What it does not take into account is the long-term pressure on our health system and the long-term pressure on our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
          MBS
         </a>
         . I have canvassed in this place before that it is unsustainable. Ten years ago the MBS was $8 billion. It is now $19 billion and it is projected to go to $34 billion. We are looking at health expenditure continuing to grow year on year at around five per cent across the forward estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, rather than respond to a set of figures—that is, a snapshot in time—this government is making the responsible decisions needed to ensure that we have a sustainable health system into the future. Unlike those opposite, this government is making no apology at all for making the appropriate decisions to ensure that we have a sustainable health system for the Australian people into the future.

          , I have a supplementary question. I refer again to Associate Professor Brian Owler, who says that these figures actually show that healthcare spending is certainly not out of control and that there is absolutely no need for the government to introduce a

           Professor Owler is entitled to his view. There is no doubt that he is entitled to his view. This government, however, has the view that we are going to make policy decisions based on evidence to ensure that we have a sustainable health system into the future. Without policy change, health spending is projected to increase to $110 billion by 2023-24. Indeed, it has increased 110 per cent in the last 10 years. Those are the sorts of figures this government is going to take into account to ensure that we have a sustainable health system into the future. Unlike the irresponsible decisions taken by the previous Labor government, we are going to ensure that the health system is sustainable.

             What I agree with is the fact that this government is taking the responsible decisions to ensure we have a sustainable health system into the future. I know I keep saying that, but clearly I need to keep indicating this to the chamber so that those opposite might start to listen. We have around 263 million free services currently being given. It is not sustainable. We are going to need to put in place the sensible decisions to ensure that sustainability. It is interesting that it was under the previous Labor government that we moved to a co-payment for the PBS. Clearly, those opposite, under the previous Labor government, realised that a co-payment was necessary for sustainability. This government is not going to make any apology for ensuring that we do the right thing by the Australian people and ensure a sustainable health system into the future.
