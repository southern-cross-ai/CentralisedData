        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Industry, Senator Ronaldson. Mindful of Australia's dismal laws in relation to dumping, labelling, intellectual property and 457 visas, can the minister outline how much the Australian government forecast for jobs in the Australian manufacturing sector will increase or decrease over the course of this financial year?

          Thank you,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
           Mr President
          </a>
          , and can I join the long queue of those congratulating you on your elevation to that status. I thank Senator Madigan for his question. I acknowledge his very longstanding interest in manufacturing not just in our home town but throughout the nation.
         </p>
         <p>
          I understand that under the former government some 140,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost since 2008—almost one in seven—which I know causes both of us great concern. The government is committed to setting in place the right infrastructure and economic conditions for manufacturing. It is a priority for the minister, as I know it will be a priority for you. In relation to the forecast for the financial year, I have been provided with the following advice from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Employment" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Employment
          </a>
          : a projection from 2013 to 2018 by industry indicates that employment in the manufacturing sector will decrease from 934,100 persons to 893,000 persons in 2018, reflecting global trends and a move from traditional industries. This is a decrease of 4.3 per cent over five years, or a decrease of 0.86 per cent per year. This would give us an estimated employment projection of approximately 917,000 in 2015. As the senator knows, we are undergoing a generational transition. Through you, Mr President, I will say to Senator Madigan that today, we have the opportunity to remove the millstone around the industry's neck, which of course is the carbon tax.

           . Mindful of the fact that there has been a decrease in the number of people working in manufacturing over the past five years—the figure you suggested was 140,000 jobs—can the minister outline whether the number of 457 visa holders working in the manufacturing sector has increased or decreased?

            , as you are aware, I do not think this question is necessarily in this portfolio area but if I can assist, I will, and if I need to take anything on notice, I will. I can confirm that there has been a decrease in the number of primary sub-class 457 visa holders in the manufacturing sector in Australia. The number of sub-class 457 visa holders working in the manufacturing sector as at 30 June 2014 was 6,891. This is a decrease of 152 persons compared with 30 June 2013, when there were 7,043 subclass 457 visa holders working in the manufacturing sector in Australia. Under the former Labor government, the subclass 457 program grew from around 68,400 primary visa holders at the end of June 2010 to more than 110,000 when they left office.

             graduates—whom they seemingly want to have a bigger debt to repay—will have jobs available in the manufacturing sector or indeed in any other sector?

              I do not accept the premise of part of the question, but I will put that to one side and respond in this way. One practical measure we intend to implement is the government's trade support loans, which is before the Senate as we speak. It is an investment of $1.9 billion and will support those who learn a trade in ways that are targeted, practical and job-ready. And I will say to Senator Madigan that I think that he, like me, would agree that there is a group of Australian young people who have had the opportunity to have a university education, but what about that group of Australian young men and women who want to do a trade—who want to contribute to this nation with a trade and those skills? They have been left behind, and this government is determined to overturn what the former government did. We are proud of our young men and women doing trades, and we will do all we can to support them.
