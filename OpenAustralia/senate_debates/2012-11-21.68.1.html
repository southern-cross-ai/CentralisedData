         . Unlike those opposite, the Gillard government are prepared to invest in the future of our country. We are in a situation where we are delivering services to people across Australia, nearly 30,000 as I have said a number of times. We are also delivering programs in the footprints of the National Broadband Network. We have had thousands of Australians who have been through these training programs, individual Australians, to give them the skills they need in the 21st century.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are running a program for small businesses where they will be trained and get one-on-one training after that. We have had hundreds and hundreds of businesses go through these programs since March when they commenced. Those opposite may like to sign up to some of these programs so they can actually get some education. These programs are vital for Australia to take advantage of the capacity that the National Broadband Network will be providing to people's homes. This is vital for small businesses across Australia who will finally get a level playing field like other businesses in major capital cities. Small businesses across Australia will now get cheap and affordable broadband—

           You would not know what backhaul was if it hit you on the head. You sat there for 11½ years and did nothing to help Tasmanians get broadband. Where was your previous government's backhaul plan? We have built $250 million worth of backhaul across this country.

             The Gillard government understands the potential of fast, affordable and, most importantly, ubiquitous broadband to transform the way that this country works. Launching Australia's first National Telework Week just last Monday, the Prime Minister committed to a target of 12 per cent of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">
              APS

             employees regularly teleworking by 2020. Telework not only improves productivity and saves infrastructure costs but also increases workforce participation.
            </p>
            <p>
             Independent research that we released last week found telework can significantly increase participation of people who are not in the labour force through disability, carer responsibilities or location. The research found that this teleworking can enable up to 25,000 equivalent new full-time jobs.

               I would like to be able to give a very full answer but, unfortunately, those opposite have no plans for Australia's economic future—none whatsoever. They cannot even agree on their lines. In August last year the member for Wentworth said that under his plan:

               … for the foreseeable future the

               would be Government owned.
              </p>
              <p>
               But just last week Mr Abbott said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               … not even the Chinese communists believe in a nationalised telecommunications monopoly such as the

              <p>
               Who is right: Mr Turnbull or Mr Abbott? They walk around telling the

               and others: 'We speak all the time. We have to clear each other's lines.' Mr Turnbull has spent all his time accepting the accounting standards for where the NBN is classified.

                Mr Hockey

               says it is all a fiddle and a rort. Mr Turnbull has blogged that the accounting for the NBN is correct.
