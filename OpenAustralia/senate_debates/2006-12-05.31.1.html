        My question is to Senator Campbell, Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I refer the minister to a Defence media release from 13 November 2006 about joint Australia-

        2G Seasprite helicopter on board? Is it not the case that New Zealand has had its Seasprite helicopters in service since 2001? Weren’t the 11 Seasprite helicopters ordered by Australia also supposed to have been delivered in 2001? Why is it, despite $1 billion of public money having been spent, that five years after the due date we are still waiting for a final decision as to whether the project will proceed or be dumped?

           No, there is not. I think a broader point needs to be made, and it is this: the

           does manage projects of national significance. The defence procurement is of an unparalleled size, cost, timescale, risk profile and level of technological complexity. These are very important questions. The federal Howard government has invested in a $28 billion boost to defence across the past decade. The examples of our defence procurement include an armed reconnaissance helicopter of $1.9 billion, of which expenditure in this current financial year is $262 million; the Anzac ship project of $5.372 billion, or $181 million in the current financial year; the

           of $1.245 billion; the airborne early warning and control procurement of $3.53 billion, with current expenditure of $339 million; the additional troop lift helicopter of $3.75 billion, of which we are spending $120 million this year; the strategic airlift capability, another $1 billion plus; the Armidale class patrol boat of $548 million; the ADF’s air refuelling—

              , I am making a point about defence procurement. The defence procurement program of the Commonwealth government is a substantial increase over and above what Senator Hogg’s Labor Party government spent. If the opposition are serious about specific defence procurement programs and if they want to take specific questions about specific projects in a range of—

                The Seasprite is one of in excess of 200 major defence contracts that this government has entered into because we care deeply about the defence of Australia. We have increased defence spending on Australia, as opposed to Labor, who ran it down. If they took it seriously, I would take them seriously.

                 . I ask the minister, even though he has not indicated that he will, to take my primary questions on notice and get answers. Whilst he is at it, why is it that nine years after the contract was signed Australia still does not have any mission-capable Seasprite helicopters? Hasn’t $1 billion in public money been spent on this project? Why has the government spent $1 billion on a project that has not delivered a single fully functional aircraft to defence?

                  Defence is spending $28 billion on improving Australia’s defence capability over a decade. I have just outlined a number of major defence procurement contracts. They are of unparalleled size, cost, timescale and risk profile. The defence of Australia is a serious issue and I am very happy to get the details that Senator Hogg requests.
