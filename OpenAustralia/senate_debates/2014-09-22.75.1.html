         Yes, I am able to do that. On 18 September, last week, officers from the

         executed 26 search warrants across a range of Sydney suburbs. Sixteen people were detained, two were charged, one on serious terrorism offences and the other on New South Wales firearms offences. As the investigation continues it is possible that more people may be charged. This operation, Operation Appleby, follows the investigation of a group of people located in Sydney whom, it will be alleged, had the intent to carry out attacks of violence on individuals here in Australia. Those being investigated have links to Australians currently fighting in Iraq and Syria, further demonstrating the threat posed to Australia's national security by those ongoing conflicts and participation in them by Australian fighters.
        </p>
        <p>
         This activity is about keeping our community safe. Law enforcement and security agencies have taken action to disrupt and prevent planning for acts of violence. That is why they moved when they did. Law enforcement and security agencies will continue to work tirelessly to investigate and mitigate any threats of harm to our community.
        </p>
        <p>
         The operations carried out last week demonstrate the terrorism threat we face is real. They also demonstrate the strong counter-terrorism capability we maintain. The public should be reassured that there is no need to be alarmed and should continue to go about their daily lives as normal. However, it is important that people remain vigilant and be mindful of the national security hotline 1800 123 400.

           In July, I introduced the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security" rel="nofollow">
            National Security
           </a>
           Legislation Amendment Bill to strengthen the ability of the Australian intelligence community to counter the threat of terrorism. The government expects to be able to pass this legislation through the parliament in this sitting fortnight and I hope we will have the cooperation of the opposition in facilitating that. I have had discussions with Mr Dreyfus, who has expressed a spirt of cooperation to me. This week I intend to introduce a second tranche of legislation to address the most pressing gap in our current counter-terrorism legislative frameworkâ€”that is, the threat posed by foreign fighters, which I addressed in response to the primary question. Additionally, later in the year I will be introducing further legislation to implement a mandatory data retention regime. It is critical that we continue to provide our intelligence and law enforcement agencies with the tools they need to detect, prevent and disrupt terror threats to Australia.

             I have consulted extensively with many community organisations and in particular with leaders of the Islamic community, and will continue to do so. I want to thank the leaders of the Islamic community in particular for their ongoing partnership and action in addressing this common threat. As a result of those consultations, I have learnt many things and I have appreciated their feedback to the draft legislation. In consequence of that consultation, the government has decided, following advice received from Islamic community leaders, to retain the sunset clauses in relation to preventative detention powers and control orders. They will be rolled over and reviewed for another 10 years but the sunset mechanism will be maintained. As well, this morning, following discussions with the Director-General of

             and the Prime Minister, I announced that, although it is not legally necessary to do so, legislation will be amended to include a specific prohibition against torture in any circumstances.
