        Earlier today I took on notice a question from Senator Barnett about the home insulation program. I have some information.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following discussions with stakeholders, Minister Garrett took the following action on 1 November to make changes to the home insulation program. The insulation rebate was reduced from $1,600 to $1,200 to drive greater efficiencies in the market and improved competition. Metal fasteners for foil insulation were banned. Mandatory installation of covers over down lights and other ceiling appliances was put in place. There was a target electrical safety inspection program for Queensland homes with foil insulation, as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commencing in December, the minister also committed to a name-and-shame list of businesses struck out from the program, the two-quote requirement, and a mandatory formal risk assessment requirement prior to work on any installation before any installer is allowed to start work. On 30 December, Minister Garrett again moved to tighten the program to improve safety by requiring every single installer going into ceilings to have a trade-specific competency, prior insulation industry experience or to have completed a registered or accredited training course.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, last week Minister Garrett again took action by closing the scheme once advice was received that the risks were ‘unacceptably high’, caused by ‘unscrupulous, sometimes illegal and shonky operators’.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also took on notice a question from Senator McGauran. I can confirm that with regard to meetings with departments, members of the OCG—the Office of the Coordinator General—were present and the former Coordinator General, Mike Mrdak.
