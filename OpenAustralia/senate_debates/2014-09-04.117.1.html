        , my question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion, representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the minister update the Senate on the government's plan for the development of strategic water infrastructure?

         , I know this is an issue in which Senator Canavan takes a great interest, having been intimately involved in the work of the coalition dams task force prior to the 2013 election, which has laid the groundwork for the creation of the Water Infrastructure Ministerial Working Group chaired by the Minister for Agriculture.

         This government is committed to ensuring that we execute a clear, pragmatic and concrete plan for action to build the strategic water infrastructure which will enable our nation to grow and prosper for generations to come. The right infrastructure in the right place will help boost our economy, meet the challenges of the future and manage our vital water resources responsibly. As we have outlined in the coalition's 2030 Vision for Developing

         prior to entering office, capturing these opportunities requires a federal government with a vision. I am pleased to report to this place—and for those on the other side—that this is in fact a government with that vision.

         Through the ministerial working group, Minister Joyce has recently provided the Prime Minister with a water infrastructure options paper. This options paper includes a list of water infrastructure projects for the government's consideration and canvasses options to accelerate strategic water infrastructure development right across Australia. There is a short list of some 30 projects that have been identified from over 100 sites. The paper has taken into consideration the work of the coalition before the last election and, more recently, in an extensive consultation with state and territory governments. The government will now consider recommendations within the options paper as part of the

           Australia needs sufficient water storage because of our highly variable rainfall and in order to underpin both our agricultural and urban needs. There is a fundamental need to build new water infrastructure in Australia. In 1980, Australia had 5.5 megalitres storage capacity per person in dams across the nation. That figure has now fallen to four megalitres per person. The reality is, if we do not build more capacity it will be about 2.5 megalitres per person by 2060. Building water infrastructure will be critical in unlocking the potential of many regional and rural areas. The inevitable economic development as a result of these initiatives can then build a critical mass needed by regional communities to enable the delivery of important services like health and education.

           government is committed to helping facilitate economic growth by building water storage capacity. And as Mr Joyce says: 'You do not have a dams task force if you are not going to build dams.'

              Northern Australia
             </a>
             white paper, states that unlocking the potential of Northern Australia will require government leadership that fosters private sector investment and ingenuity. New water infrastructure that is designed to build capacity is one of the six key policy areas outlined in the green paper to drive the growth of the north and help capitalise on our geophysical proximity, as we are close to two surging regions of global economic and population growth—the Asian region and the tropical region.
            </p>
            <p>
             Through the creation of the Water Infrastructure Ministerial Working Group, this government is proving its commitment to the future growth of the development of regional and rural Australia and the water needs of this nation in the future. This is a commitment which underpins our dedication to Australian agriculture as a key pillar of our economy and a fundamental tool in rebuilding our nation after six years of neglect under the previous government.
