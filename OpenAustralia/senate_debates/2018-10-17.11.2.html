        I want to go back to a question that I would have liked to ask last night but ran out of time. Could the minister confirm that there are 22 suspended provisions in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
         TPP
        </a>
        that relate to previous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        involvement and clarify the status of those provisions if the US rejoins the trade deal and what the process would be at that stage? Does it need to come back to parliament for ratification if a new member joins and new clauses are added to the TPP or are we de facto voting for the contingency that they may be reinstated if the US joins? What actually are we voting on today?

         Yes, as I confirmed several times yesterday, there are 22 suspended clauses. As I said several times yesterday as well, they could be reinvoked if the United States rejoins and all parties agree to that.

          I understand that's what you said, Minister, but I'm seeking more information than that. What is the process for a party like Australia to agree to (a) the inclusion of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
           US
          </a>
          in the deal and (b) the activation of those 22 clauses? Is it a process where the executive and the minister sign a document that says it is okay for the US to join and those clauses to be added, or does it come back to a sovereign parliament, like this chamber, for ratification?

           Thank you very much for that question, Senator Whish-Wilson. My understanding is JSCOT has already considered those clauses; however, if the United States does rejoin the process, all the other parties would then also need to agree to those 22 being reinstated. My understanding is that while JSCOT has already considered those, it would come back to JSCOT.

            So JSCOT has considered those clauses but they are not in this enabling legislation that we're passing todayâ€”at least they're not in there physically. But they are suspended clauses. JSCOT, as we discussed yesterday, Minister, is essentially a rubber stamp for the executive, which has already signed the deal. I won't say the same about the FADT inquiry process, because the opposition tends to control that. So if the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
             US
            </a>
            rejoins, the minister signs the re-activation of those 22 clauses, and then it goes to JSCOT. JSCOT presumably produces a report. Does that come back to parliament for ratification?

             Senator Whish-Wilson, we've been through this process several times. Again, I can keep giving you the same answer; however, I would point out, as Senator Carr has pointed out very clearly as well, that these are customs amendment bills. These are not a re-prosecution of something that has been addressed very extensively in the community. There have been 1,000 consultations. The parliament has had a look at it at least five times in committees. As you said yesterday, you have been through these issues many times over many years in many estimate processes. So if you would like to keep asking the same question over and over, you will keep getting the same response on these customs amendment bills.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I said, there are 22 clauses; they have been revoked; however, if the United States does come back in, those 22 have been examined and reported on by JSCOT. You and I both know well the process for treaties here in this parliament and also for consideration. But again, that is the process if the United States comes back in, but it would be an issue for Australian negotiators at the time. Of course, if there are any changes, it would come back to JSCOT. In terms of that, there is no more information I can provide at this time after having gone through it several times now.

After going to JSCOT, will it come back to parliament for ratification? That's what we're doing now, right? We are ratifying enabling legislation. Will there be separate enabling legislation for those 22 clauses? Will it come to parliament for ratification?

                <p>
                 Senator Whish-Wilson, you've asked the question. I will answer itâ€”again and again. It follows the exactly the same standard treaty processes. JSCOT has looked at the current 22 clauses that have now been revoked. Ifâ€”and again this is a hypotheticalâ€”the United States joins and all parties agree to proceed, then it would come back to JSCOT, but again it is hypothetical because, at that re-negotiation at some time in the future, the clauses could be amended, they could be updated, they could be changed. They would go through exactly the same standard treaty process that this has gone through in the first place.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'm not sure how much clearer I can be that this is aâ€”

                      I just want to add to what Senator Whish-Wilson is saying. I just want to point out to the minister that the name of this bill is the Customs Amendment (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership Implementation) Bill. This is the only opportunity for the parliament in its formal sense in the chamber to deal with the enabling of the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
                       TPP
                      </a>
                      , and so I would ask that you give substantial latitude and be very cooperative. We're not talking about a customs act; we're talking about the acts of parliament that are required to enable an agreement that has taken a long time to negotiate and has been controversial. To come in here and then try to narrow this down to,' This is just a customs act' is in some sense disingenuous. I just wanted to state that.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Following up from Senator Whish-Wilson's question so as not to create a hypothetical, would the actual terms, as they currently standâ€”and I understand you've been very helpful by saying it comes back to JSCOT and goes through the processâ€”require some enabling legislation for the treaty to enter into force notwithstanding it comes back to JSCOT? Is there some enabling legislation, not hypothetically, but with the current terms?

                      <p>
                       Senator Patrick, I'm very grateful for that somewhat patronising explanation of these bills. These are both very clearly customs tariff amendment bills and they are customs bill. I would noteâ€”as I've noted on multiple occasions now with Senator Whish-Wilsonâ€”that the arguments have mostly been in here, and we have spent several hours now on these same issues over and over again. These are issues that don't go to the substance of the bill.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       It is absolutely your right to keep trying to re-prosecute the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
                        TPP
                       </a>
                       -11 itself. There are other opportunities in estimates next week to go through these issues in more detail, which is probably the more appropriate forum, so that the Senate can get on with other business. However, the substantive question that you've just asked is a complete hypothetical because, as I've explained several times, it depends on: if this did come forward again, the United States joined and all parties agreed, they would have a look and reconsider these 22 clauses. If there are changes, they would come back through the process and go to JSCOT. If there was eventually legislation that came back here as part of those negotiations to change the agreements, of course it would come back through here because it would require the customs bills to be amended. But, again, I have nothing more to add to that because it is hypothetical and the normal parliamentary processes would apply.

                        in the chamber today. That's what the minister is telling us: 'No, nothing to see here. You can't have any influence over it, so I'm not going to answer questions or deal with it properly in this place. Go and deal with it later in Senate estimates after the bill has passed.' No, it's not good enough, Minister.

                        The Australian people have a right to have these questions answered before the chamber passes this legislation. It may be that the government feels very comfortable because the Labor Party has rolled over and backed in the TPP, so they've got the numbers. That does not mean that the public and the taxpayers deserve to be treated like mugs, and yet that is precisely what the government has tried to do throughout the three days of debate on this bill so far. Senator Whish-Wilson, Senator Patrick and I have all asked specifically what happens to these 22 clauses if the

                            US

                           . In my speech on the second reading, I talked a little bit about the failure of the Doha rounds and of multilateral trade deals leading towards 2006. When the TPP fell apart, the idea of a separate multilateral deal being led by the US in the Pacific region was initiated. It was supposed to be finished by 2012, but that was really when it actually started getting interesting, and here we are in 2018 with a version of it. But this was a US led deal. Obama put his signature on this and, of course, led it in the

                           . He was its biggest champion. And, of course, President Trump made an election commitment that if he got electedâ€”and let's be honest, most of us thought he wouldn't, but he didâ€”he would tear up the TPP, which he has done.

                          <p>
                           To ignore that this is not a US-driven and US led multilateral trade and investment deal and to say that it's hypothetical that the US might or might not rejoin this deal at some time in the future really is ignoring history. Add that to what Senator Hanson-Young just pointed out: there are suspended clauses in the trade dealâ€”how often do you have suspended clauses in a trade deal, especially a trade deal this size, that are sitting there, waiting?
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           May I just talk on some of the most egregious aspects of the original Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, especially in relation to things like intellectual property and monopoly pricing for medicines. Even the previous trade minister,
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Robb" rel="nofollow">
                            Andrew Robb
                           </a>
                           , took the US to task on the kinds of provisions they wanted to put in on the monopoly pricing of medicine. So those clauses are sitting there suspended, waiting to be re-engaged. It is an absolutely critical question to be asking the government at a point, here and now, when we're about to vote on the enabling legislation. Are we basically voting on a contingency for these to be automatically reactivated if the US rejoins the trade deal or, as the minister has pointed out, does it have to go through a process that ultimately involves a sovereign parliament? Remember, we were elected by the people of this country to make the laws and to scrutinise what the government does. That's what the Senate does. That's what we're doing here this morning, and it's extremely important.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Minister, your own government has stood up in here ad nauseam during question time for years talking about how big this deal isâ€”the biggest trade deal in history, the biggest multilateral trade deal, 40 per cent of our economy is covered by it et cetera. As I said, there are 29-plus-plus chapters in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement that literally cover every aspect of our life in this country. Just about every industry and every community is impacted by the TPP, and yet, as I pointed out last nightâ€”and I did lose my temper in hereâ€”you act as though you're insulted that we're asking questions. Considering the gravity of how important this bill is, how big this deal is and how it's taken 13 years to get to this pointâ€”it's extremely controversial, extremely complex and there are thousands of pieces of paper covering an incredible amount of detailâ€”I personally think we could be in here asking you questions for days on this, considering how much detail there is and how many unknowns there still are.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I think you've made it very clear, Minister, that this will come back to parliament if the US rejoins the TPP. I did hear you say in your last statement to Senator Patrick 'only if there's legislation'. I want to narrow that down. I'm being very specific with my questions here. Will it require legislation? I know they may change the clauses and there may be negotiations with our negotiators about the 22 suspended clauses but, if those clauses stand, will they require legislation to be put into any new form of the TPP with US involvement? Will that require coming back to parliament or are we voting on a contingency now for them to be automatically re-engaged, as they are if there are no changes?

Again I will reconfirmâ€”hopefully, for the last time because I've now gone through this several times and I don't think it could be any clearerâ€”that this process follows exactly the same treaty processes that the government has done for decades.

                              I'll explain it to you. If you don't understand why your question is a hypothetical, let me walk you through why it is a hypothetical built on a hypothetical built on a hypothetical. The first hypothetical is that the United States will re-engage. That is a hypothetical. Then it requires all 11 parties to agree that these provisions will be reactivated and then it requires another hypotheticalâ€”that we would agree to any changes negotiated in the process from there. Again, it is the standard processes we have gone through under the current

I cannot say it any clearer. What you are asking over and over again are hypothetical questions that cannot possibly be answered if and until all in this series of events arise.

                                    I'll take that interjection. This is an extremely important matter, Senator Carr. We're talking about supposedly the biggest trade and investment deal in this country's history. Just because you don't want the detailed answers to questions that we do! I won't let myself be distracted by that.

                                    is going to rejoin. I haven't asked you if they are going to change their 22 suspended clauses. They would be hypothetical questions. I have actually asked you what the process is if they do. That is not a hypothetical question. It is an absolutely critical question. I have asked you about the status of these clauses as they are now. Perhaps I will phrase it a different way, Minister. Why are there 22 suspended clauses in this legislation that relate to the US? Why do we have suspended clauses? Why haven't they been removed?

But, Minister, first, I'd like an answer to the question put by Senator Whish-Wilson. I asked a very similar question yesterday and did not get a response. Why are those suspended clauses there at all? Why have they not been deleted? Did Australia argue for them to be deleted? If not, why not?

                                                I want to bring the committee's attention to the Greens amendment that I moved a few minutes ago. This amendment deals with these most important issues that are lacking in the
                                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">

                                                </a>
                                                . As has been pointed out numerous times by me and my colleagues in second reading speeches and also through the committee stage today and yesterday, we are extremely concerned that
                                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDS" rel="nofollow">
                                                 ISDS

                                                provisions remain in the TPP. We also are worried, of course, about the failure to include proper protections for Australian workers through labour market testing.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                So this amendment says that, until these issues are dealt with, the TPP would not be able to come into effect. It is the bare minimum that should be required by this chamberâ€”the absolute bare minimum. We've just heard question after question after question that was put to the minister not being answered because of an even more concerning sign that there are 22 other clauses that are incredibly controversial, such as making cancer medication too expensive for cancer patients to access. That is the type of clause which has been simply left there on the side, ready to be activated at any point, and the minister is refusing to answer questions about why Australia allowed those clauses to stay in place. If the minister is going to continue to not answer those questions, we could at least get to fixing what should be the bare minimum for the TPP, and that is removing those ISDS provisions and putting in place some proper protections for Australian workers, which is what this Greens amendment on sheet 8529 does.
                                               </p>

                                                Interestingly, these two particular issuesâ€”ISDS provisions and the labour market testingâ€”are two things which we know the opposition say they are worried about, yet they are prepared to simply tick this TPP legislation through the chamber today without fixing them. There is a hollow promise that somehow, if Mr
                                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">

                                                were able to become Prime Minister, this would be magically dealt with. We know that that's not true. We know that the government of the day is not able to simply amend the TPP. We've heard the minister say that already today, that changes would need to be renegotiated across all parties. Australia would have to withdraw from the TPP before anything could be fixed. That's the truth. We've had that confirmed previously by the minister for trade. Here we have the Labor Party trying to wind up debate in this place today, shut down debate, because they're embarrassed that their own position is an absolute furphy. Their own position on this legislation is an absolute furphy. Why? Because they've got some in their party who think this shouldn't be a problem, that ISDS provisions are not a problem and that labour market testing is obviously not a problem, and they've got plenty of people inside their own camp who know that it is.

                                                This amendment put forward by the Greens would fix these things. We don't have to wait for Bill Shorten to become Prime Minister. We could fix it today. Of course, we're going to have Senator Carr jump up in a minute and be very angry at me for pointing this out. You watch. There will be bluster and fury. He's very good at thumping the desk when he is a bit grumpy about how things are going in this place. So I suspect that will happen, because the Labor Party have sold out Australian workers, because the Labor Party have rolled over to back in the TPP, to keep these insidious antidemocratic ISDS clauses in the TPP. They're lying to the Australian people by pretending that somehow it can be fixed if and when Bill Shorten becomes Prime Minister. It's a lie. It's a furphy. Not just the Australian union movement know it; but workers across the country know it too.

                                                I look forward to hearing the justification from the Labor opposition as to why they won't vote for this Greens amendment when it is part of their own party's national platform. I would like to also ask the minister, in light of this amendment, how the government is going to manage the chilling effect on regulation, given the existence of ISDS clauses in the TPP.

Of course, this is the party that has voted with the Liberal Party to undermine the entire environmental structures of this country. We could have had some decent environmental politics in this country; we could have had thatâ€”nearly 10 years nowâ€”if we had a party here that actually had some real principles and some real understanding of the way power is exercised in this country.

We know just how extremely opportunistic they are when it comes to the welfare of the Australian working people, because that's the history of the Australian Greens. As we well know, the Australian Greens are centred on the most wealthy people in this country now. They've got the best social conscience that money can buy. What would you expect from people who live the life? They're only too happy to tell everyone else, with great moral authority, that they know more about how to live the good life than anyone else does.

We have made it absolutely clear that this government has made a fundamental mistake in including these provisions in this agreement. We've made it very clear that this is a customs bill, that the treaty has been signed. And under the current procedures of this parliament, which we want to changeâ€”which we actually want to do something about, by getting a Labor government electedâ€”we want to be able to transform the way in which treaties are undertaken in this country. But we have to acknowledge this fact: that under the current legal framework the treaty has been signed by the government, and what we have before us is a tariff bill that talks about the provisions with which we can change the tariff arrangements themselves.

And we make no assumptions about that. I've heard the Greens talk here as if the election's been already held and already resolved. We don't make any assumptions about those questions. What we do say is that we will be highly competitive at the next election, whenever that is, and we say it should be held very, very soon, because this country simply can't afford to have this government continue in office. But what we will not do is act in an irresponsible manner that is contrary to the national interest.

We have a simple matter here, and I've made this point, but I guess there are some folks for whom you need to repeat things, because it takes a little while for it to sink in. In

You would provide the New Zealand cheesemakers with an advantage over Australian cheesemakers in this transitionary period. Do you want to put the Canadian and New Zealand beef farmers ahead of Australian beef farmers or workers, the people in those industries who are seeking to get access to the Japanese markets? Abattoirs are seeking to get access to the Japanese markets under these arrangements.

                                                  What the Labor Party says is pretty simple. This is a very flawed agreement. We acknowledge that. We are in the business of getting that fixed, but we won't do it at the expense of farmers, winemakers, cheesemakers, blue-collar workers, manufacturers or our universities. We want to see those people enter international markets on the same basis as their competitors in New Zealand and Canada. I would have thought that would be a pretty straightforward proposition.

                                                  So, when it comes to the question of why the Labor Party won't accept these irresponsible stunts that you're putting forward, I think it's very clear. There is no way the Labor Party is going to join with you in these stunts to undermine the living conditions of Australian workers in the manner which we've become all too accustomed to from the Greens. You think this will go unnoticed? You're making a bit of a mistake.

                                                     I want to get back to the question that I had for the minister that she still hasn't answered yet, but before I do I just want to say to Senator Carr: I know that you did stand up for workers in the automotive industry going back over a decade ago, when the tsunami of free trade was heading for this country, and I know that you personally have been involved with seeing thousands of workers and their families losing their jobs and their communities on the back of the free trade deals that this country has signed in the last 10 years. I know you're aware that there might be benefits to trade, but there are also costs. You're aware of that personally. What we're trying to do here today is minimise those costs.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                     The amendment that Senator Hanson-Young has put up does that up-front, but we know that if anything gets amended then the deal's off, which is really the irony of this whole situation. We're doing our job in here as senators, yet, because this deal is signed and sealed by the executive and by the government, often for political purposes, through a treaty process that's a couple of hundred years old and desperately needs to be upgraded, we can't actually amend this deal or make it better, because we would lose the whole thing.
                                                    </p>

                                                     Minister, it's extremely important that you answer my question from earlier, and I'll put it to you again. You haven't actually answered this bit. I'm asking about the process. It's not a hypothetical question. There are suspended clauses. I can't find any examples of where suspended clauses have appeared in any other trade deals, like they have in the

It's a critical question. Fine, legislation is required to change the customs duties and tariffsâ€”we're all aware of that. But, as they are, these are in there as suspended clauses. If they're not changed and the US is happy with them, will there be any kind of legislative process where a sovereign parliament, in a country like Australia, will get to ratify those clauses becoming part of the TPP, or are they de facto already part of the TPP? It is the most important question I can ask you here today. Unfortunately, I don't have more time; I could do this for days, but I really want to know the answer to this question.

Again, I cannot make it any simpler than I already have, but, hopefully for the last time, this will be very clear. We have the 22 clauses that have been suspended. Ifâ€”if!â€”the United States rejoins and if all 11 parties agree to what's already been agreed to in those clauses, it will come back to JSCOT, but then it would require, as I've had reconfirmed, custom amendment changes. And, as I've said previously, if that were the case, it would come back to parliament, as it has now. You can keep asking me the same question, Senator Whish-Wilson, but the answer will be the same. And, if you ask the same question again, I will refer you to

This is the Labor Party's own policy, but they're selling out their members, they're selling out the unions and they're selling out Australian workers. We know that, because they think it's so bad that if they were to come into government they'd try to fix it. The problem is they can't. Once the TPP is in, it is in. We've already had confirmation from the minister that, in order to fix any of this down the track, Australia would have to withdraw and renegotiate. And that is simply the truth of the matter. It doesn't matter how many times or how angry or how embarrassed the Labor Party are, that's the fact. They can make as many promises as possible to fix things, but they are hollow and they are lies. With that, I ask that the question be put on my amendment so that we can get on to debating the next sections.

So you are saying it goes to a tribunal, that it does not go to an Australian law court whatsoever. Can you tell me and the Australian people whether that tribunal will amount to only three people making the decisions?

Obviously, this panel has the ability to award significant damages against a sovereign state in the event that a corporation is successful. Are there any bounds on the compensation amount that might be awarded against a sovereign state, understanding that some claims have amounted to billions of dollars?

Senator Hanson, this might allay some of your concerns. This is equally important for Australian businesses engaging overseas. For example, Australian mining companies want ISDS provisions in any future Indonesian free trade agreement because they provide certainty for those businesses themselves. Again, I think it's important to remember that this is not just an issue for others; it is an issue for us. In fact, in the negotiations on the Indonesia-Australia free trade agreement, the Indonesian government said that they want to have the ISDS to provide foreign investors, including Australian investors, with greater certainty in terms of doing business in Indonesia.

You've clearly got a lot of background knowledge on these panels, so, if you would like to, it might assist the efficient business of the Senateâ€”rather than drip-feeding questions that we need to seek further information onâ€”to provide us with all of the questions up-front. We can take them on notice and seek further information from you to fill in the obviously already extensive knowledge base that you have in this area.

In the event that a corporation here in Australia feels that they have been, in some way, disadvantaged because of a change of public policy or a change of lawâ€”I just want to make it very clearâ€”I understand that they have the right to go to our courts to seek a remedy. This question does not relate to companies' rights to go to a court. It's clear under the ISDS provisions that a multinational corporation here in Australia can invoke ISDS provisions. My question is specifically related to an Australian company that feels that they need to be compensated in some way. Can an Australian company invoke an ISDS application in respect of a change of public policy, equal to what an international company can do?

While I appreciate your desire to go off into some discursive discussion about the treaty itself, I would suggest that these questions might be more suited to estimates next week, where you will have the minister at the table and also the department to talk more about and unpack the process itself and any policy underpinnings of that. You can keep asking these questions in this place, as is your right, but they are not relevant to the legislation at this point. If you would like to have some discursive policy debate and discussion, we can continue to do so, but it is not relevant to the bill at hand, and many of those issues have been dealt with in now over eight hours of debate and discussion on these two customs bills.

As I have said, again, in answer to your and Senator Patrick's questions, these are ad hoc panels that are established under the terms of the treaty itself. It is a complete hypothetical, because these panels don't exist and would be established under the terms of the treaty. There is no panel yet. Again, as I've said to Senator Patrick, we will take it on notice and provide some more information on the wording of the treaty itself, but at the moment it is a complete hypothetical, because one hasn't been established.

I think one of the misunderstandings implicit in your question is that this is not a standing panel or body, so it does not exist. It is a process that can be invoked, should it be needed and Australia and whatever other party were in agreement that this panel would be set up. At that point then they would go through a process of agreeing to and appointing panel members, but the panel does not yet exist; it is just a theoretical process. Again, if you like, we can provide you with chapter 9, the investment chapter. The process for this is clearly laid out in that chapter. That goes to the heart of Senator Patrick's questions as well. Senator Patrick, you're clearly, by the tone of your questions, very well aware of that chapter and the provisions within it. So, again, we can provide it to both of you, but it is publicly available information on how that process would be invoked if it were ever necessary. That's why it is a hypothetical, Senator Hansonâ€”because it is just something to be invoked should both parties agree in future.

Maybe I as a nonlawyer would not meet whatever the particular requirements are. In some sense, we're interested in the rules. My concern is we have a situation where, if it is in fact just a lawyer that makes the decision, we will have lawyers making decisions that could bind Australia to payments of billions of dollars. That's the concern that I'm raising.

That does come under the labour market testing provisions of the treaty, which again we can provide to you. Experience is very important. These labour market testing provisions are not new. They are already in a number of other treaties. I understand community concerns. This is certainly an issue that the unions are very vocal about. But, when you have a look at the facts, for the Japan, China and

So these are not new. The processes are the same, and, despite fears that this will lead to Australian workforces and workers being overrun, the evidence is simply not there.

Yes, I agree with you that they have. But the thing is, if you say it's not a problem, why put it into the treaty? If it goes on labour market testing and if we need the workers, then why was it necessary to put in the treaty, as with the Indonesian treaty and the China free trade agreement as well, that they could actually bring in 5,000 workers over a period of time? If it is based on labour market testing, why put any numbers in it at all?

This is not just an issue about workers coming into Australia. It is also important because we cannot request that or expect that of our own workers, for our own companies, if we don't have some reciprocal arrangements.

So Australia has committed to providing access for TPP-11 businesspersons to stay and work in Australia, but, again, they are quite defined categories. For contractual service suppliers it's one year, with a possibility of extension. For investors and independent executives it's up to two years. For intracorporate transferees, which is a fancy way of saying executives and senior managers, it's an initial four years, with a possibility of extension. For specialists it's a two-year stay, with the possibility of extension; and for installers and servicers it's up to three months. Spouses and dependants are granted entry to accompany executives and contractual service suppliers. So it is very specific, it is very limited and it is focused on business and executives and their spouses. It's not a free-for-all. It is very specific. And, as you can see, there are different time frames for different categories of business visas and engagements.

The whole customs tariff book is based on the customs tariff, because it is customs tariffs. But all it says isâ€”I'll pick one out, item No. 80: 2710.19.53, and it's got $0.412/L. It doesn't say anything about what it actually is. And then you've got here in tariffs, from 1 Januaryâ€”all free. It doesn't state what's free. It doesn't tell me anything, looking at this bookâ€”what is free. So, we've got pages and pages of items coming into Australia, no tariffsâ€”it's free. Where do I get the answer to this? What impact are these imports going to have on Australian producers, farmers and manufacturing industries in this nation? How much more industry and manufacturing are we going to destroy in this country by getting rid of tariffsâ€”the one thing that actually helped our businesses here to compete with countries that are paying only a few dollars a day to their workers?

I've got some specific information, because now I understand that you're talking about the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act. But what I would say is that there's a number of documents that can help you and your staff in relation to this. The first one is the explanatory memorandum, which does actually provide the detail, because the bill isâ€”as you say, it is a very technical amendment to the act itself. The explanatory memorandum does have that information.

The customs tariff amendment bill will make the following three major changes: first, it provides preferential rates of customs duty for all goods, excluding excise equivalent goods, that are determined to be originating within the new part of the act; second, it inserts new schedules to provide for excise equivalent rates of customs duty on certain alcohol, tobacco and fuel products and for phasing rates of customs duty in accordance with our treaty obligations; and, third, it amends certain concessional items in schedule 4 of the Customs Tariff Act to maintain customs duty rates in line with applicable concessional items. I would refer you to the explanatory memorandum, because that is the technical explanation of the technical bill that you're having a look at. What you're looking at is quite technical, because it is actually the wording to amend the act, whereas the explanatory memorandum explains it. I would also refer you to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee report on these bills, which goes into some detail about what the customs amendment and customs tariff amendment bills are all about.

It also ensures that there is proper transparency around how taxpayer funds are being spent in defending our sovereignty and our laws and regulations against multinationals. Given we now have a TPP agreement with locked-in ISDS provisions, it is absolutely essential that the Australian people know what this is costing us and what the impact is, and that transparency prevails. This is about ensuring that the government can't paper over what they've just agreed to; that the Labor Party, either in opposition or in government, can't pretend that this isn't having a chilling effect; and that taxpayer money being spent on it is accounted for, and sunlight is shone in places where, we know, both sides of this place would prefer it not to be.
                                                                                                 </p>

It just proves what a cuddly, convenient relationship we have now between the two parties in this place, with the Labor Party and the coalition selling out Australian democracy: selling out the rights of the Australian people to have laws and regulations that protect their health, protect the environment and look after their best interests. Meanwhile, Labor and the coalition are passing legislation that puts the interests of big multinational companies first. That's what they're more interested in doing. How can they shut down debate today? How can they make sure that power remains with the big corporates rather than with the Australian people?
                                                                                                 </p>

At the very least, the government of the day needs to be transparent about how much this is going to cost and what is on foot. It's a transparency measure. There should be nothing to be afraid of. But, of course, the proof will be in the pudding. We'll see the Labor Party and the coalition vote it down because they don't want the public to know just how bad this TPP deal really is.

In these trade debates, if you like to call them debatesâ€”in the spin around promoting free trade deals, which has happened since Mr Tony Abbot was elected in 2013 and we've seen an avalanche of bilateral trade deals; bilateral trade deals being trade deals between two countriesâ€”it is fascinating how the government will line up. They come in here at question time and quote their numbersâ€”and Senator Carr has just done it in his statement to the chamberâ€”about all the benefits that our exporters are going to receive when foreign countries allow increased access to their markets. But never in the debate do we talk about the costs of free trade deals. There are costs. Every economist acknowledges it. Those costs need to be weighed up in the debate, in the matter of public interest, against the benefits. That's how we assess whether a trade deal, or a trade investment deal like the

I can tell you that campaigns such as 'buy Australian', 'buy Australian beef' and 'buy Australian seafood' have triggered state-to-state dispute settlements in previous trade deals like

These trade deals make it extremely difficult for us to support local businesses or for governments to subsidise or provide assistance to local businesses and local industries. That's why we saw the loss of tens of thousands of Australian car workers. It has mainly been a slow decline, but it has been very rapid in the last five years as this Liberal government has signed an avalanche of free trade dealsâ€”mostly to get a headline and a press opportunity. I haven't seen any evidence that these deals have benefited our local exporters, but I can tell you that I hear all the time about how difficult it is for local farmers, producers and manufacturers to compete with cheap foreign products. That is what Senator Hanson asked. What access are we giving away and selling down the river? Who are we selling down the river?

In other words, we sold out our car industry to get increased access for our beef farmers. Let's just look at that example. If that's true, and I believe it was the case, who makes that decision? Who is the high, almighty arbiter of the fact that we are going to kill the car industry, its intellectual property and the decades of communities and workers who have grown up in those communities, as well as the ability to make our own cars and all the other ramifications that go with that? Who makes the decision that we sell out an entire industry and that we will trade that off against increased access for our beef farmers?
                                                                                                  </p>

That's because you end up stealing trade off other countries who you don't have bilateral deals with. I'm not going to give everyone in here a lecture on economics, but that's why, in theory, multilateral dealsâ€”like the deals we saw through the

These bilateral deals and these multilateral deals don't. It is a really important point when we're about to vote very soon on this massive sellout of Australian interestsâ€”and for what? We need to consider the costs. They need to be properly quantified. No-one wants to talk about it in the public debate. It's absolutely our role here in the Senate to bring balance to this debate and to raise these issues with you, Assistant Minister.

It was welcome when the environment chapter in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement was negotiated. The environment chapter is chapter 20. There's a section in there that relates to the protection of cetaceans. I just wanted to ask you, given the importance of protecting cetaceans under Australian law, what ability we will have in the use of the TPPâ€”presuming it's going to be ratified by this parliament very soonâ€”and how that chapter will enable us to stop Japanese whaling in the

How will we be able to use this environment chapter in the TPP to hold the Japanese government to account if they go down to our Southern Ocean and start slaughtering whales on an industrial, commercial scale? That is what their stated intention is. I'd like to know how we can actually use this chapter to stop that from happening.

You said that this will be ratified shortly. This is actually a treaty that was ratified back in March of this year, and these are two customs enabling bills. You just said it hasn't been ratified yet. Well, it has been ratified. That might perhaps explain the misdirected nature of some of these questions. Again, as you acknowledged, this is in chapter 20 of the treaty. You obviously have a copy of the treaty and of that chapter. These questions have absolutely no direct relevance to these two customs bills at all. So perhaps,

We have now spent nearly 10 hours on debate in this chamber on the same questions over and over againâ€”on questions which actually relate to a treaty that has been ratified and which are not relevant to the bills here today. Chair, if I could ask for your guidance.

I won't say you deliberately misled the chamber then, Minister, but what we're doing today is ratifying this in parliament. You've signed this deal. Your executive has ratified it, but parliament hasn't ratified it yet. That's exactly why we're here today. That's what I would say a vote on the legislation is. But it's an attempt to actually distract away from the critical issue about which I asked you, which, by the way, is a question that hasn't been answered. And I'm sure you'd expect me, as a Greens senator, to be asking this question.

I've been following it long enough to know that's the case. It was designed to bring in environment groups, as were the other chapters in there around slave labour and wildlife trade. There's a whole array of stuff in here. As I mentioned earlier, it covers just about every aspect of life in every country that's signing up to this, and it is part of what we are ratifying as a parliament. You are giving effect to the customs and tariff side of this. That's what actually makes this treaty come into effect. But it is all the same. So this is absolutely critical, and I ask you again: is there a binding clause in here? Is it the purpose of this environmental chapter that Australia can take action against the Japanese government if they go down into the

Again, I'll provide the same answers that I've provided over probably seven hours of questioning on the same issues. This is a treaty that has been signed. We are now dealing, before this chamber, with the customs bills to fully enable our agreements. In relation to the issues in chapter 20 that you're talking aboutâ€”the environmental considerationsâ€”the parliament has had ample opportunity to debate this. Over the course of the last two years, the provisions of the

I think there have been at least five parliamentary inquiries. There have been over a thousand consultations with 485 separate organisations, which is incredibly comprehensive. It is the most comprehensive engagement and parliamentary debate on any treaty that Australia has ever been party to.

You have already acknowledged that you have raised these issues in multiple estimates committees over multiple years, so it's not like you and the Greens have not had ample opportunity to get engaged and involved and to debate these issues. You have. We can sit here for the next several hoursâ€”I think it's taken 10 hours of the Senate's time alreadyâ€”and it's your right to keep us talking about the same things over and over again, but, ultimately, you are reprosecuting a treaty that was signed in March. These are customs amendment and customs tariff amendment bills. There is nothing that I have not repeated over and over again. If you keep asking the same questions, I will keep giving you the same answers, because the answers do not change, even if you do not like them.

We can vote against this enabling legislation, which would mean the whole thing falls apart. Minister, why would I want to prosecute the case in estimates next week, when the deal would have already been voted on and passed into law? Now is the opportunity for these issues to be raised. By the way, I actually haven't read the final text, because it has changed so many times. I was involved in this for the previous TPP. Senator Hanson-Young has done a fantastic job as our trade spokesperson since then. I am asking you now. I have looked at this and I'm looking at the detail right in front of me. I would like you and your advisers to tell me how this chapter will help us hold the Japanese government to account if they begin illegal commercial whaling in the

Considering there is a section on mammal and cetacean protection, do we have binding agreements in here? What action can we take? Is it a state-to-state process? What is the process that we can use? Or is this environmental chapter, essentially, just platitudes? Is there nothing in here that we can actually use to bind another country's actions around the protection of mammals like whales, which, as you know, are very important to the Australian people?

I think it would have been helpful to engage in this level of debate having actually read the document first. That said, I find it inconceivable that you don't understand that these are two separate processes. The treaty process is one arrangement, and there is nothing in that that precludes Australia from continuing its activities on the international stage in discussion with Japan. They are two separate processes. I'm sure you well know that.

That's my question: what in this chapter will allow the Australian governmentâ€”hopefullyâ€”to put pressure on the Japanese government to stop killing whales? Why even have a chapter that includes the protection of whales in a multilateral agreement if it's not going to actually work? A corporation or a government can sue another government for a breach of rules and regulations around economic factors when it affects their profits. Why even have a chapter in the TPP if we can't have binding agreements that have consequences on matters in relation to things like wildlife trade and the protection of cetaceans?

They are two separate processes. There is nothing in that that precludes us from doing what we are doing already or from taking any actions the Australian government wants to take in those fora. You can keep asking me the same question, but the answer will be the same. They are two separate processes and two completely separate issues, and there is nothing to preclude Australia from taking the action that we are already engaged in.

I will make comments on why I'm concerned about it. There was a free trade agreement with America signed by the Liberal Party in 2004 and ratified with support from the Labor Party. It came into effect in January 2005. Under that free trade agreement, from day one, Australia got rid of all its tariffs. America negotiated for its industries such as beef, horticulture and other areas to keep their tariffs on Australian exports into that country for between 11 and 18 years. That was for beef, horticulture, wine, steel, cotton and sheep. That was not a good deal for Australia. So it really concerns me when free trade agreements are signed off without being debated in this chamber and without the people of Australia being allowed to have a say in any of these treaties and agreements.
                                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                                <p>
                                                                                                                 I can understand why you are saying it's a good thingâ€”because we will be able to export our products to other countries around the worldâ€”and I'm sure a lot of people are very happy about that, especially in industry and the farming sector. My concern here is that in Australia we have a problem with multinationals paying their taxes. There are over 700 multinational companies in Australia that pay no tax at all. I hear the same old rhetoric from the government: 'We are addressing that and we are reining it in.' Under this free trade agreement, you are opening up the gates for multinational companies to come here, and they will be able to bring in their workers. My question to you is: if we are going to open it up to more multinational companies to come into Australia and work here, what is the government doing to ensure that they will pay their taxes here in Australia and not add to the over 700 companies already that pay no taxes in Australia, which costs the Australian taxpayer?

I think most of that was a comment rather than a question, but, in relation to paying tax, I think that is a perfect question for Senator Cormann in question time, because any companies operating here would be subject to exactly the same laws and enforcement on taxation and all other regulations. The issue you raise is one of enforcement under Australian law and is not directly relevant to this bill here today, but it is a good question, and I would encourage you to take that up with Minister Cormann.

It is clear, in respect of labour market testing, that there are about 450 professions that could be covered by the term 'contractual service supplier'. And I note that, for those contractual service suppliers, we don't have to have labour market testing. They can simply come to Australia under the agreement and take the role of an Australian worker without testing. What analysis did the government do in terms of the numbers of likely foreign workers that would come to this country without that testing?

The first one I'd like to address is that article that you were talking about. Again, I think there is a bit of danger in reading bits and pieces, so what I'd like to do, perhaps, is go through with you the risks of not ratifying quickly and wrap up some of those issues. In that context, analysis reveals Australian industries would be at immediate disadvantage if we fail to ratify the

Japan, Singapore and Mexico, as I've said previously in this place, have all ratified.

They have almost finished their own domestic processes. After ratification, New Zealand and Canada would receive an 11 per cent tariff cut for their fresh beef exports to Japan next year, giving them a tariff rate of 2.2 per cent, which is lower than our current preferential treatment under our free trade agreement with Japan. This is significant given the value of all our beef exports to Japan is over $2 billion a year. That would be giving New Zealand and Canada a significant preferential advantage over our own beef producers right here in Australia.
                                                                                                                   </p>

It is not only the beef industry. The New Zealand wine industry would gain an edge over our own domestic industry.

Again, that's a significant disadvantage to us potentially, because our wine exports to Canada were valued at nearly $200 million last financial year.
                                                                                                                   </p>

Under the Japanese free trade agreement the tariff rates on our cheddar cheese exports into Japan currently sit at nearly 30 per cent. On ratification of the TPP-11 New Zealand and Canada would have their tariff rates immediately cut to 27.9 per cent, obviously less than ours. Again, that gives them a competitive advantage over our dairy producers, because Australia's tariff rate would continue to remain at nearly 30 per cent.

Also, Australian exports of iron and steel to Vietnam are currently worth $146 million a year. If Australia is not amongst the first six countries in the TPP-11 and Vietnam is, then Australian iron ore and steel exporters will be at a significant disadvantage to their Japanese steelmaking competitorsâ€”

That is what will happen under these agreements. Again, if Senator Whish-Wilson had actually read this material, he would understand that that is the case and this is an issue that is directly relevant to these customs and customs tariff amendment bills here today. But that's not it; there is more, Senator Patrick, in terms of disadvantage for Australia. Australia would receive enhanced quota volumes for wheat and barley. Canada would receive an additional 40,000 tonnes of wheat exports into Japanâ€”again, a significant disadvantage for Australian farmers. Australia's exports of wheat and barley to Japan were worth over half a billion dollars last financial year. So, again, there will be tangible and specific disadvantages for a number of Australian industries if we are not in that first six. The

Australian wool exports to TPP-11 countries are valued at $35 million and growing.

Senator Patrick, again, the facts are very clear, and I welcome these questions on this issue because they are directly relevant to these bills and the consequence of not passing these bills.

But we shouldn't just talk about the positives; we also need to talk about the negativesâ€”and I think that's what we have been doing and trying to do. Minister, you indicated to Senator Whish-Wilson that the treaty has been ratified when in actual fact it hasn't.

It has been signed but it hasn't been ratifiedâ€”and I note that, in your answer, you conceded that. I just wanted to make that relatively clear. We support free trade. We're just trying to deal with the unintended consequencesâ€”or maybe the intended negative consequencesâ€”and just trying to understand the magnitude of that consequence in order to make an informed decision about whether we allow legislation that would bring this agreement into force. I was asking questions about labour market testing. We know that, under this agreement, there are up to 450 categories of workers who may come in from overseas to fulfil a particular role for a multinational corporation. In the analysis and deliberations that took place, was there any measurement, modelling or calculation done as to how many workers per annumâ€”assuming the treaty was being used effectively and benefits were flying on both sidesâ€”the government expects to come into the country as a result of this agreement?

To get some indication, if you go back and look at the three free trade agreementsâ€”with Japan,

While we cannot tell you a precise number, as you well knowâ€”because it is market drivenâ€”if you would like to go into the treaty policy analysis of cabinet, that is something you can ask the minister in estimates next week and have a much more discursive discussion, which is not relevant to these bills here today.

Surely the government, as they were going through the machinations of considering the terms of the bill, would have looked at this and said, 'What does that mean for Australia?' I don't necessarily expect them to be right, because, as you correctly say, they're market driven. But it is not so much a hypothetical as it is an issue of fact. During the deliberations, when the Australian government was working on this agreement, did it ever look at the numbers of workers that it thought might come in as a result of the treaty coming into force?

As you well know, those are questions about policy development and implementation that the parliament has had five opportunities that I'm aware of to ask and have answered, including in many Senate estimates, which I know you have been involved in. Again, you and I both know these are not questions for this session. If you want to keep asking about issues of policy that don't relate in any way to the substance of these customs bills, I can only keep providing the same answer: that is not relevant to this discussion, because, as you know, it is self-evident. No matter how calmly and nicely you ask these questions and pad them out, the answer is still the same, Senator Patrick: government considers these questions in the course of any treaty negotiation and process. The parliament has had ample opportunity over the last two years in this most debated, discussed and reviewed treaty process. If you want to ask questions about that process again in relation to these bills, I again suggest you raise them directly with the minister either in question time or, more appropriately, in estimates next week.

You must accept that they have quite significant consequences. It allows the treaty to come into force after six countries have ratified the treaty. Are you suggesting we shut down the committee stage just because we've had inquiries and Senate estimates? This is exactly what this stage of debate is aboutâ€”making sure we have the details we require to make a good decision. If you're suggesting I hold off until next week, are you in a position to state that you would recommit the bills to a vote after these questions were answered at estimates?

You impliedâ€”in fact, you didn't imply; you saidâ€”I was seeking to gag debate in any way. We've had nearly 10 hours in this chamber in the second reading debate and probably at least seven hours on these same issues over and over again, which have been asked and answered many times. Many of the questions are completely irrelevant to this bill. You can ask these questions, as is your right. All of your colleagues in this chamber, the government and the opposition are according you the courtesy of allowing you to filibuster on this bill. And we will keep answering the questions. As long as you keep asking the questions, we will keep answering them, but the answers will be no different. You well know that these issues that you're raising now are not issues in relation to this bill or issues for this chamber at this time. But, of course, we will accord you the respect of allowing you to keep doing what you're doing. We're here to answer your questions as they're relevant.

Your idea is that somehow we are filibustering and trying to waste the committee's time by asking really important questions about supposedly the biggest multilateral trade and investment deal this country has ever signed. It has taken 13 years to get to this point. It has been highly controversial and extremely complex, and we still don't feel like we've got any answers out of this. I think you need to take on board that, if you're hearing similar questions repeated by various senators, it is probably because you didn't answer them in the first place.

We respect those concerns. These amendments accommodate the Labor Party's announced intention to make sure that those provisions are removed, except that they provide a guarantee that is beyond Labor's control: if they are not elected next year, these sunset provisions will come into effect. That will, in effect, nullify our ratification and will keep their constituentsâ€”the unions and the hardworking Australians who vote for the Labor Partyâ€”happy. We would encourage Labor, in this instance, to support this.

Let's presume that the Labor Party were to form government next year and were to commence negotiations. If they felt that for some reason they weren't going to hit the deadline that was imposed by these amendments, I can then assure the Labor Party that we would be very open to a change. In good faith, they could come to usâ€”or Senator Griff and myself, at the very leastâ€”and we would perhaps support a change to give more time for the Labor Party to have either these cancerous provisions removed or the labour market testing restored. In that context, I urge the Labor Party to support these amendments that not only are consistent with their national platform but are consistent with the plan that Mr Shorten has announced and made a commitment to in respect to their constituents.
