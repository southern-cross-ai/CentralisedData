         Additional funding of AUD $15.79 million has been injected into the Capability Technology Demonstrator program, and re-phasing of the Priority Industry Capability Innovation Program to ensure grants allocations in the final year of the program can be met has required AUD $2.37 million to be re-phased beyond financial year 2018-19. Other minor adjustments total a reduction of AUD $1.05 million.
