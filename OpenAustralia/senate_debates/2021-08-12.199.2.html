        </a>
        and to COVID-19 misinformation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to commence my remarks by acknowledging the ripple of fear, shock and distress that's moving through this place here today as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        goes into lockdown. Lockdown has been miraculously avoided here, and now the anxiety that has gripped the Victorians for so many months and is now in its eighth week in New South Wales is coming on. We know how difficult this is. But we hear the problems of Australians being cast aside in the responses that we received from Minister Birmingham today. He will drop his voice and be very serious and sensible in his elocution of the government's continuing failing response. The Morrison-Joyce government has let this virus get away from us, and it is now running rampant right across the country—out in my great state of New South Wales and into very, very vulnerable communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's no wonder that the disapproval rating for the rollout is nearly at 60 per cent.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        —actually telling the truth—said: 'I can't think of a bigger black-and-white failure of public administration than this.' And he said that about his own colleagues with whom he shared a party room—the Liberal and National parties, who have been in government for eight years and who are supposedly great managers of the economy. People trusted them to do the right thing. And here we are at this juncture in this country; the place is literally ravaged with COVID-19 spreading at an extraordinary rate across the entire country. The virus has spread certainly to Dubbo and Walgett. That's nearly eight hours away from Sydney. I know it's not as far as some of the distances that are driven in Queensland and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        , but it's still a pretty big state. Walgett, Bathurst, Dubbo and the shires of Bogan, Bourke, Brewarrina, Coonamble, Gilgandra, Narromine and Warren are all now in lockdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        Do not forget that this experience of lockdown and this inaccessibility of vaccines were brought to you by the stars of the show, Mr Morrison and Mr Joyce. They're the two leaders who are responsible for the decision-making that has led us to this day. In New South Wales, 345 people were found to have acquired COVID in the last 24 hours. We know, just in the last two months, since this most recent outbreak, there have been 36 deaths, and 93 deaths from the current outbreak. We know that there is a huge toll on families, businesses and communities, and part of the reason we're in this situation is that the golden girl, Premier Berejiklian, was encouraged to hold out against going into lockdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've got Indigenous communities right across this state, including those in Dubbo, who are in a great deal of worry about being able to access services and get the vaccinations that they so desperately need. I was in Dubbo in the seat of Parkes earlier this year, and I met with the Aboriginal medical service. They're funded for four full-time
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s, but they've only got one. They can't roll out to the Aboriginal community. In Deniliquin, I met with the Deniliquin Health Action Group and Marion Magee, who has been there for 32 years as a general specialist. What are their concerns? Their concerns are health professional staffing and the ability to provide medical services to children. Access to medical services: that is the disaster and that is the context into which this failed government is actually embedding further and further problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those opposite might smile and think that this is some sort of a joke, but it isn't. My colleague on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        —the great Labor member—Emma McBride and I have been fighting to get a vaccination hub for the 350,000 people on the Central Coast. That's bigger than the population of the Northern Territory. What did the Liberal member Lucy Wicks say? She said: 'We don't need it; the GPs are enough.' Not good enough. What's happening on the Central Coast—with the ignoring of 350,000 people in one area and the failed delivery of leadership by the Liberal and National parties—is a warning to the people of Dubbo. I want to encourage the great work of Councillor Stephen Lawrence, the Mayor of Dubbo, for his great leadership and for his contribution to public debate this morning. I urge all Australians to stay safe, because, if you don't look after yourself, this government is not looking after you.

         I said yesterday it was like groundhog day, and here we go again. We know where this vaccine hesitancy is coming from, and it's certainly got nothing to do with supply. We know that there is supply throughout Australia for any Australian who wants it. We know that, day after day, including yesterday, the day before and the day before that, we have seen record days of vaccinations occurring. Over a quarter of a million Australians are being vaccinated every single day. There is no supply issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         But what we do know, when we look across some of the states, is that there's vaccine hesitancy. There's brand shopping. Why would that be, considering that the ATAGI advice is now that all of the vaccines—whatever vaccine you can access—are equally effective, equally safe and, equally, hundreds of thousands of times less likely to injure and kill you than COVID?
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite continue to persist with this absolute hyperbole around supply, but really what they're talking about is: 'We don't want to talk about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
          AstraZeneca
         </a>
         . We don't want to support Australian jobs. We don't want to support Australian manufacturing. We want to continue a fear and a smear campaign around vaccine brands.' It is just ludicrous! The current opposition leader can barely bring himself to even say the name. The fact is that he then raced out, as quickly as possible, to find a candidate for the seat of Higgins who has been actively out there suggesting people not get the AstraZeneca! This is against all health advice.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank goodness we have sensible commentators, like Dr Nick Coatsworth, who are encouraging Australians to get vaccinated and who know that the best vaccine for you is the one that is available. We are seeing Australians out in record numbers, getting their vaccination and ensuring that Australia can open up as soon as possible but also keeping Australians safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we enter into lockdown here in Canberra, I would like to acknowledge my colleagues who have all stayed put today, who understand that they need to be here to support the Canberrans as they go through this but also to ensure that parliament is able to continue to conduct itself as best as possible. But, as we stay here in Canberra and enter this lockdown, we know that those in Canberra and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         have done extremely well when it comes to their vaccination rates. In fact, they are getting very close to 30 per cent at full vaccination, and over 50 per cent have had one dose. But even more impressive are the vaccination rates in those vulnerable cohorts: we are looking at numbers in the 80 and 90 per cent range. So I think there can be some confidence, as the ACT goes into a seven-day sharp lockdown, because of the compliance that we are likely to see, because of the way that people will conduct themselves over the next seven days and because of the fact that the contact tracers are already working hard with the gentleman who has been affected to ensure that close contacts are identified as soon as possible. But the fact that there are significantly higher vaccination rates within the ACT means a significantly reduced chance of people contracting the virus and infecting others with it and it means people are significantly less likely to get majorly ill or find themselves in hospital or, worse still, on a ventilator or dying from the virus. We need to keep encouraging vaccination—we need to keep encouraging people to get out there.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am intrigued as to whether or not we will start to see another fear campaign—because we know you guys just can't stay away from them—and whether or not we're going to start to see a move away from the Pfizer and whether you're going to start encouraging people to just really be looking at the Moderna. We're spoilt for choice. You guys aren't going to know which way to go—how to scare Australians!

        </p>
        <p>
         It is absolutely shameful behaviour. It is time that it stopped. It is time that you started to get behind Australians, the Australian economy, to ensure that we can open up as soon as possible, and that is through vaccinations. It's not through brand shopping and it's not through creating vaccine hesitancy. It's through real information, factual information, not scare campaigns and not being out there confusing Australians who are trying to do the right thing.

          [by video link] A Kinsley gaffe is when a political figure accidentally tells the truth—some obvious truth that isn't supposed to be voiced. This morning we saw an example of such a gaffe. The Deputy Prime Minister really belled the cat, didn't he! When pressed on why he wouldn't be reining in Mr Christensen about his comments, Mr Joyce said this:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … I can assure you that when you've got a thin margin, don't start giving reasons for a by-election.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was a moment when the Deputy Prime Minister accidentally told the truth, revealing that he and the Prime Minister were always keeping an eye on their political interests, even when it involved a member of the government spreading dangerous disinformation about vaccines and lockdowns—the two public health tools that we have to fight the delta variant. Just to really prove that Mr Joyce meant what he said, the government then tried to use its numbers in the Senate today to protect Mr Christensen, Senator Canavan and Senator Rennick from being called out for their comments.
         </p>
         <p>
          Today, while the government was busy trying to protect its political interests, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
           ACT
          </a>
          joined
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          , Victoria and Queensland in lockdown. More than half of Australia's population is now under some form of COVID restrictions. While the risk of a by-election might be front of mind for Mr Joyce, I doubt that it is a concern for the millions of Australians who would just rather the Morrison government concentrated on doing its job. These are Australians who will lose their chance to say goodbye to a loved one. These are Australians whose children will be learning from home, without contact with anyone their own age, for months. These are Australians who will struggle financially because of the economic consequences of the delta wave, which this Prime Minister has overseen.
         </p>
         <p>
          We would not be in this position if the Prime Minister had just done his job. In Newcastle, in my home state of New South Wales, there is an outbreak in an aged-care facility, and only a third of the staff have received even one dose of the vaccine. These workers were meant to be fully vaccinated by Easter, under the Prime Minister's plan. New South Wales towns like Walgett, Bourke and Brewarrina have been put into lockdown, and these towns have large
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           First Nations
          </a>
          populations. Despite the Prime Minister promising that First Nations Australians would be a priority in the vaccine rollout, only 10 per cent have been vaccinated. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
           Northern Rivers
          </a>
          , where I grew up—Lismore, Bangalow, Byron, Casino—are locked down.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have been left dangerously exposed by this government's failure to effectively roll out sufficient volumes of the vaccine and to take responsibility for establishing an effective national quarantine system. Senator Hughes's disgraceful and dishonest contribution just now, unhappily, is typical of the government's response. It's always someone else's fault. It's the opposition's fault. It's the community's fault. It's the workers' fault. It's the Italians' fault, sometimes. It's ATAGI's fault. It's the Premier's fault. Perhaps today it's my fault, if you listen to Senator Hughes. But the truth is that it is the responsibility of this government. Those opposite are responsible for the vaccine rollout and they are responsible for hotel quarantine and for a national quarantine system.
         </p>
         <p>
          This government struggles to get the basics right. Official public health information for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CALD" rel="nofollow">
           CALD
          </a>
          communities is two months out of date. This outbreak is affecting communities in south-western Sydney, migrant communities who may not be confident reading official documentation in English. Despite this, the Arabic translation of the Department of Health's vaccination information doesn't mention that all adults in greater Sydney should get any vaccine that they can access.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australians are scared. They are scared for their livelihoods, worried about their families' health; they are wondering when they'll be able to leave the restrictions and the lockdowns behind them. Don't worry! Mr Joyce and Mr Morrison have got it in hand. As they made clear this morning, their No. 1 priority is doing whatever it takes to make sure there isn't a by-election.

           As we come to the end of two weeks in this place, while so much of our country is in lockdown, including here in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
            ACT
           </a>
           from later today, those on the other side continue to repeat the same questions and the same attacks every day. Senator Hughes's description of groundhog day couldn't be more appropriate. While they continue to spread lies and mistruths, our government is focused on getting on with the job of keeping Australians safe. While the opposition continues to undermine the rollout, we are getting on with that job and delivering record amounts of over 250,000 shots a day.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the last seven days over 1.4 million doses have been delivered; over 14.2 million doses have been delivered to date. In fact, since we arrived here in Canberra for this sitting period last week, over 190,000 doses have been delivered. We are getting on with the job. No-one is saying that there haven't been problems along the way, but it has now been turned around, and we are now back on track. Our numbers are comparable with the world's best rates of vaccination. With one million Pfizer doses arriving weekly, a plentiful supply of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
            AstraZeneca
           </a>
           and now Moderna approved for use in Australia, it will be great to see the weekly doses increasing over coming weeks. Twenty five million doses of Moderna have been secured, with the first million doses arriving next month. It is a safe, practical vaccine.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would like to acknowledge the hardworking frontline staff who are administering these vaccines. My sister is one of those. They are all working long hours, often under extreme pressure. They, along with all the other health professionals who have been at the forefront of the COVID outbreaks across the country, deserve our thanks. Their commitment to saving Australian lives, putting others before themselves, in what is often a thankless task, is incredible.
          </p>
          <p>
           The ramped-up rollout is just the start. Not only will the vaccination of Australians help save lives; it will also help us to relax restrictions as we progress through the four stages of the national plan. The current phase obviously is accelerating the vaccination rates and keeping lockdowns short and sharp if possible. The transition phase, when we get to 70 per cent, will see low-level restrictions and hopefully fewer lockdowns. By the time we get to the consolidation phase, with 80 per cent of adults vaccinated, hopefully we will only have targeted lockdowns—that's the plan—leading into the final phase, where we can open international borders with no lockdowns and boosters being regularly provided if needed.
          </p>

           As evidenced by the Doherty modelling, now that we've protected our more vulnerable elderly Australians it's possible to shift our focus to younger Australians. They now have access to more options in regard to vaccinations. It is wonderful to see young Australians turning up across the country to get vaccinated.

           Tasmania, my home state, is leading the way in vaccinations. We reached the milestone of 50 per cent vaccination last week. As part of Premier Gutwein's four-point Delta Shield plan announced yesterday, they will be boosting vaccination rates over the next weeks to achieve 60 per cent by September. That plan also includes increased fines; tighter border controls; strengthened testing, tracking and tracing; and a support package for businesses impacted by interstate lockdowns. They too are getting on with the job.

           I'd like to turn my attention now to earlier this year, when here in this place we debated legislation in relation to freedom of speech, particularly in the context of academic freedom of speech. I defend every single person's right to freedom of speech, particularly those of us elected to parliament to represent all Australians. Universities must be places that protect free speech even when things being said may be unpopular or challenging. The idea of academic freedom is vital to the continued development of our education. Our universities are critical institutions where ideas are developed, debated and challenged. So is our parliament.

           As we debated here earlier today, there are vastly differing views about coronavirus, the development of COVID-19 vaccines, the resulting impacts of the virus on border closures, restrictions around events and even how to wash our hands properly. Of course, some of the public debate around COVID we will agree with and, as discussed earlier today, some we wouldn't, but that is the very nature of free speech. We're all entitled to our opinion, but there's a line when it puts at risk public safety.
          </p>
          <p>
           I defend everyone's individual right to decide if they will be vaccinated or not. However, anyone who chooses not to should also respect the right of those who do and not vilify or harass those who do. I am fully vaccinated. Coming to that decision I considered all the commentary in the public arena; however, the overriding decision came down to wanting to protect my family, my community and myself from an insidious, life-threatening illness.

            [by video link] I rise to take note of Senator Birmingham's and Senator McKenzie's answers to questions. Senator Birmingham spent all his time covering the backs of members of his government when they espoused dodgy health advice. Maybe Senator Birmingham, in his answers to those questions, should start covering the backs of our mums and dads, our grandparents and our children and holding to account dodgy government members who are giving dodgy health advice.
           </p>
           <p>
            The failure by this government on a series of levels has been particularly gross. We have seen the grossness of it because of a lack of proper action when it comes to the vaccine rollout. I note that, in the comments of others taking note of answers by the government, not one senator on the government side defended the government's silence on their own dodgy government members giving dangerous advice. The question of freedom of speech is always a critical one, but you need to call out when it's dangerous advice and putting our community at risk—our families and the public.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quite clearly we've seen failure on a number of levels from this government—failure to hold dodgy members to account, failure to have adequate supply, failure to vaccinate and failure to quarantine. The failure on the vaccine front is important. I have my strong views. I have received

            </a>
            . I suggest many others should be doing the exact same thing. But clearly amongst the public, because of the government's misinformation and lack of an appropriate approach to this health issue, there is great disquiet right across our community.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Canavan also said that people are just thinking about a particular viewpoint and that's our job. That might be your job, Senator Canavan, but the job of government members who know the right health advice is to espouse it and hold you to account. One of Mr Morrison's own cabinet ministers Niki Savva talked about Mr Morrison's philosophy—'If you see a problem, throw money at it; if you see a problem, walk away from it; if you see a problem, duckshove to somebody else.' This dangerous disinformation being run by this government's own party room is just another problem that Mr Morrison is walking away from.

            Mr Christensen said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            When will the madness end? How many more freedoms will we lose due to fear of a virus which has a survivability rate of 997 out of a thousand? It's time we stopped spreading fear and acknowledged some facts. Masks do not work—fact … Lockdowns don't work—fact.
           </p>
           <p>
            Quite clearly the government are in complete disarray about how they deal with this. We've seen, particularly in the situation with Mr Christensen, the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Joyce, make it clear that he was not going to hold the government to account or hold those in the government to account if they were giving dodgy health advice. And why? Because of crass political opportunism—because of the fact that holding them to account means that they might blow back. Well, guess what: they're blowing back on the Australian community's health. They're blowing back on the outcomes that we need to make sure that we have a successful reopening of the economy and that the lockdowns can cease.
           </p>
           <p>
            It goes to a very important question. A regional doctor, Dr Clyde Ronan of Yarrawonga Medical Clinic, said that more and more patients were no-shows for vaccination bookings due to false ideas circulating in the community. He went on to say:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Everybody seems to be an expert at the moment … We're being saturated with information, and not all of the information is useful … Otherwise, you get people speaking outside of their expertise. You get people with no expertise at all, and they've all got an opinion.
           </p>
           <p>
            Well, quite clearly, vaccination hesitancy in this country is squarely at the feet of the misinformation and disinformation from the government's own members. It's incredibly important that they get their act together and that the government hold them to account.
           </p>
