         I would like to take this opportunity not only to acknowledge those senators who spoke last night—senators Hutchins, Hurley and Fielding—but also to acknowledge the contributions made to this parliament and chamber by all of the 12 retiring senators.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I would like to say a few words about those who are leaving, in particular my colleagues from the

         Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Hutchins" rel="nofollow">
          Steve Hutchins
         </a>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Firstly, to my good friend Steve Hutchins who I have had the pleasure of working with during the tough years of opposition and now in government.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I would like to congratulate you, Senator Hutchins, on your contribution not only to this parliament but to the wider Labor cause to which you are so dedicated.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In your first speech you mentioned that: 'We have failed to soften the impact of the enormous economic and social changes upon ordinary Australians, and more importantly, we have failed to recognise how tough people are doing it.'
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I think serving in this parliament, especially since forming government in 2007, you can walk away with pride knowing that you have helped to soften that impact on working families, especially during the global financial crisis.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I want to publicly acknowledge your long career with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Transport Workers Union

         While I am very sorry to be saying goodbye to you, Steve, I look forward to catching up with you in Melbourne.

          Michael Forshaw
         </a>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I turn to another friend and colleague Michael Forshaw who last week gave us ‘a fond farewell with few regrets and complaints’. After 17 years in the chamber, this is a remarkable achievement.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I know that you expressed regret about never serving on the front bench, except in opposition. Unfortunately, you were one of us who endured the long and hard years of opposition.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As Senator Evans said last week, you have made a tremendous contribution to the Labor cause both on the front bench and in committee work, especially as Chair of the Joint Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee of the parliament.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Committee work is often undervalued and I salute you for your hard work and commitment to such important and necessary committee work.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Prior to becoming a senator, replacing another great Labor man
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Richardson" rel="nofollow">
          Graham Richardson
         </a>

          Australian Workers Union

        <p class="italic">
         And of course on a personal note, as one of the Hoggarama or La Capana members, you will be greatly missed.

         Senator Kerry O’Brien
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         To Senator Kerry O’Brien, another long-serving senator, who endured the long years of opposition.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Kerry, I wish you every success in the future years. You have served your Tasmanian constituency well in this chamber since 1996.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I read in the

         that you believe your greatest achievements are the regional forestry agreement and forging agriculture policies as an opposition frontbencher. I congratulate you on these significant achievements.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I also want to acknowledge that, before entering parliament, Kerry was Secretary of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers' Union (Tasmanian Branch) and a member of the union's national executive.

         Dana Wortley is a valued member of the Senate Labor team and unfortunately missed out on the opportunity to serve once again in this chamber.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I too know the dangers of trying to be re-elected from the No. 3 position. It was a close battle and I know many feel it was unlucky that you only got one term.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Prior to entering parliament, Dana worked as a teacher and education officer as well as a journalist and education editor.
