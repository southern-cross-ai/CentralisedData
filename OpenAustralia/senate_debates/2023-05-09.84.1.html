         I thank Senator O'Neill for her ongoing interest in pushing down the cost of living, particularly for constituents in her great state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . The centrepiece of the budget we hand down tonight will be a $14.6 billion cost-of-living relief package that is calibrated in a way that doesn't add to inflation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our economic plan has three parts: relief, repair and restraint. I'll repeat that for Senator Birmingham's benefit: relief, repair and restraint. This includes cost-of-living relief where it's affordable and responsible, and it also focuses on the repairing of our supply chains. We need to show spending restraint to ensure we're getting genuine value for money from investments in our economy and our people so that we can clean up the mess left behind from that lot over there. We've carefully calibrated and designed this budget so that it takes pressure off the cost of living rather than adding to it. This will be a budget in the best Labor tradition. I'll repeat that. This will be a budget in the best Labor tradition, providing help for vulnerable Australians with cost-of-living pressures and having an eye on the future and responsible economic management. Our aim throughout, whether it is the cost-of-living package, our broader investment in energy and other efforts to grow the economy, is to make sure that this budget is part of the solution to high inflation and cost-of-living pressures, not adding to the problem. It is important that as a government we focus on every policy lever available to us to tackle the pressures that are affecting more Australians' ability to make ends meet.

              I'm trying to be doing that! I'm disappointed you don't think I am, Senator McKenzie! As a government, we have been delivering on our commitment to address cost-of-living relief. We're delivering cheaper medicines and cheaper child care. This will make a huge difference to the costs parents face in accessing quality care for their children. We've also announced a $64 million commitment for place based partnerships to tackle entrenched disadvantage. This will extend to the Stronger Places, Stronger People initiative in the existing 10 communities and will enhance shared decision-making and local solutions in six of these communities. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced changes to the parenting payment single budget measure that will lift eligibility for parents and children up to 14 years of age, and lift the value of the payment by $176—

                 I thank Senator O'Neill for her second supplementary question. This government will make substantial investments through the budget this year to provide cost-of-living relief, make meaningful improvements to services like Medicare, and make child care cheaper. For single parents, we know there are pockets of disadvantage and communities right around Australia where people continue to struggle to get ahead. These measures will provide structural household budget relief once legislated.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I remind the Senate we have also established an expert economic inclusion advisory committee and asked them to give us advice on boosting economic inclusion and tackling disadvantage. I acknowledge Senator Pocock's advocacy alongside the government in establishing this committee.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Addressing cost-of-living pressures is consistent with what Labor said we would do before the election—what Labor governments always do. When the Liberal-National governments talk about cost-of-living pressures, we know it has been tough because Australians are paying the price.
