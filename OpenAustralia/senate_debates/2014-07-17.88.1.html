        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to correspondence from Dr Fergus Whitehead, the chief executive officer of Adelaide Pathology Partners laboratory, on the $7
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        tax. Is Dr Whitehead correct when he says that the imposition of a $7 GP tax will result in added costs for pathology laboratories, given additional staff will be required to collect the tax in collection centres? Can the minister confirm that pathology laboratories will be required to send additional $7 accounts to patients?

         No, I cannot confirm that statement, because we will not be aware which clinicians will be charging a co-payment until the scheme starts. This government has been very clear in making sure that the Australian people know exactly why the changes to the budget took place. The changes to the budget took place because of the previous government's economic mismanagement. The budget mess that they left us meant that we had to make some tough decisions in the budget. It was under the previous finance minister that we saw net debt treble from $42 billion to $153 billion. Perhaps if the previous finance—

           . My point of order, surprisingly, is on direct relevance. The specific question is about the cost of the additional $7

I was very clear. I was also very clear in stating to the chamber exactly why the budget contained tough decisions. It was because—

                 . And, indeed, I answered it. We will not be able to determine what costs will be passed on until we determine whether or not a co-payment will be charged. It is very clear. I was indicating to the chamber that if it had not been for things like, under the previous finance minister, spending $34 million buying water from Tandou Station, which was supplementary water that actually does not exist except in a flood—it was the previous government's mismanagement that led to a tough budget.

                   In answer to the question, the fellow is entitled to his views—Dr Whitehead is entitled to his views. We have been very clear: there have been some changes to the budget when it comes to health. There has been a requirement for a co-payment—indeed, supported by the shadow Assistant Treasurer and initially supported by the previous leader of the Labor Party and previous Prime Minister

                   . So we have been very clear. We have made these decisions because it is this government that is going to ensure a sustainable health system. When we are looking at potentially spending $34 billion on the

                       I quote from the previous Prime Minister:

                      <p class="italic">
                       Is anyone seriously suggesting that, in the circumstance you're talking about, where there is the possibility of breast cancer, that is going to stop them going to the doctor? I mean, that is emotionalism being played at the lowest level.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       That is what we have seen from those opposite. This government has been very clear. The best thing we can do for this nation is ensure a sustainable health system into the future. That is what we are going to do, because it is this government that recognises the responsible decisions have to be made to ensure that sustainable health system.
