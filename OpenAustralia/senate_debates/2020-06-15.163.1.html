           The coal seam gas industry plays a vital role in contributing to regional communities. The Queensland experience is that landholders and the industry are successfully co-existing and are provided a range of mutual benefits. In total, more than $505 million has been paid to Queensland primary producers through land access agreements, with nearly $80 million paid in the last financial year alone. There are a range of insurance products that are available to landholders to cover potential public liability issues.

            The Greens

           have no interest in helping farmers. Their only concern is to destroy the gas industry and remove farmers' rights to undertake activities like land management.

                 opposes this motion. Fact: while it's true that one insurance company has withdrawn liability coverage for coal seam gas infrastructure on farmers' property, there are other insurance companies continuing to provide this service. Firstly, the core issue is farmers' rights, which Liberal-National and Labor state governments in Queensland have bypassed in their rush for gas royalties. These rights of farmers over their own property need to be restored. Secondly, gas companiesâ€”not farmersâ€”need to provide insurance for their infrastructure. Thirdly, state governments have responsibility for gas mining and effectively underwrite that liability. That is the incentive for state governments to get it right in regulations to protect our valuable natural environment. The issue of insurance is a state government responsibility, and we must oppose the Greens' relentless pursuit of centralisation and the destruction of states' rights, undermining our national Constitution. The federal government has no role in mandating insurance coverage on Queensland farms.
