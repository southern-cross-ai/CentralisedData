        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to a recent study of foreign investment in prime agricultural land jointly conducted by the Politecnico di Milano in Italy and the University of Virginia in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        . That study found that almost 10 per cent of Australia's prime agricultural land is now foreign owned, putting the rate of foreign ownership in Australia at the fifth highest in the world, behind only the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic" rel="nofollow">
         Democratic Republic
        </a>
        of the Congo, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sudan and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan" rel="nofollow">
         South Sudan
        </a>
        . Given these findings, will the government now admit its mistake of increasing the threshold for the Foreign Investment Review Board referral in 2009 from $100 million to more than $200 million? Isn't it time that the threshold was reduced so that at least some private foreign investment in Australian farms is reviewed by the government before it is approved?

         I have to say it is interesting that that question has been asked given that the Leader of the Opposition visited China and indicated that the opposition welcomed foreign investments. One wonders whether economic policy is being dictated by the National Party or by the Liberal Party. Maybe Senator Sinodinos or Senator Fifield might want to inform us.

               It says something about you, Senator. I am happy to make some comments about the framework associated with our foreign investment regime. As the senator should know, all foreign governments and their agencies and state-owned enterprises must notify the FIRB and receive an approval before making a direct investment in Australia, regardless of the value of investment. We also, as you would know, have announced that we will implement a national foreign ownership register for agricultural land following consultations with stakeholders, and the government has made that announcement. I understand that the government has released a discussion paper—

I am advised that the government has released a discussion paper on these matters, and the consultation period ended on 1 February—this month. This continues the government's reform process in this.

                   , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the tabling of the FIRB's 2011-12 annual report last Friday. That report showed that levels of foreign investment in agriculture since 2007 have averaged $2.5 billion per year compared to an average of just $274 million per year in the 10 years before 2007. Why has the government presided over such a large increase in foreign investment in Australian agriculture without taking any policy action to tighten the monitoring of foreign investment that occurs in our farming sector?

                    , I notice some Liberal Senators shaking their heads and I am unsurprised, because investment means jobs. If the National Party's new platform is that we do not want more jobs in regional Australia, why not fess up to it? Why not come down and have a chat to

First, that it is in Australia's national interest to continue to welcome foreign investment that creates jobs in this country. These are jobs for Australians; these are jobs which would not be here were it not for foreign investors. The second proposition is that you want a sound framework to assess that investment, which is why from the first dollar of every investment by a foreign government or a foreign state owned enterprise the national interest applies and there is an assessment process. In addition, as the Senate would know, there are monetary thresholds over which assessments in relation to—
