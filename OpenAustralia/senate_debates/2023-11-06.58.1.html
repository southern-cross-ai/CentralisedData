         State of Israel
        </a>
        is carpet-bombing Gaza, targeting civilians and committing war crimes for the world to see. So far, Israel has massacred almost 10,000 Palestinians. Gaza has become a graveyard for children. People are watching whole families being blown to bits. Hospitals, schools, mosques, homes and refugee camps have been reduced to rubble, and yet the Labor government continues to shield Israel from any accountability. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN

        General Assembly has overwhelmingly called for an immediate ceasefire as a resolution, which this government, shamefully, abstained from. Tens of thousands of people have marched across Australia and are calling for the Australian government to call for an immediate ceasefire. Will the Labor government commit to calling for an immediate ceasefire today?

         Before I call the minister, I'm going to ask for silence across the chamber. This is a very, very serious issue on which there are many perspectives. Everyone is entitled to their perspective and the minister is entitled to be heard in silence. Minister Farrell.

          I thank Senator Faruqi for her question. Of course we have all witnessed the devastating loss of innocent life in the

           Middle East

          . That of course started with the attack by Hamas on innocent civilians in Israel. As a government, we have affirmed Israel's right to defend itself after that horrific attack. We have also said—and the foreign minister reiterated it this weekend—that it also matters in the way in which Israel responds to this completely unjustified attack by Hamas.

          This means that Israel must observe international law and the rules of war. Nobody—

           Order! Minister Farrell, please resume your seat. I called for silence, and that message was intended for every single senator in this place—including you, Senator Shoebridge, and, I believe, you, Senator McKenzie. Minister, please continue.

            Nobody wants to see innocent lives lost in this terrible set of circumstances, and it matters that innocent civilians should not pay for the horrors perpetrated by Hamas. It also matters for Israel's own security, which faces grave risk if this conflict spreads, and I think we've already seen over the weekend the potential of it spreading in the north and in the east. The humanitarian situation in Gaza is dire, and human suffering is widespread. The Australian government has consistently called for the protection of civilian lives and safe, unimpeded and sustained—

              The coalition is morally bankrupt when it comes to Palestine, and Labor have shown themselves to be heartless, gutless, cowards. You are watching the massacre of thousands of Palestinians by Israel, and you are not condemning Israel. You refuse to call for an immediate ceasefire. Well, we are not going to sit here and watch you pat yourselves on the back for doing nothing. Weasel words are not going to stop war crimes. Today we bring the people's protest into parliament. Free, free Palestine!

                in the last month is a terrible set of circumstances. The unjustified, illegal attack on innocent Israeli citizens on 7 October was a terrible set of events, and of course we now see the consequences of that in Gaza and elsewhere in Palestine. I don't think any particular political party seeking to make hay out of this terrible situation is going to advance the position in Australia, whether it's the coalition trying to take political advantage of it or the Greens. The government has a sensible—
