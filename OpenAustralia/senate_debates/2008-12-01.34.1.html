        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this place, Senator Faulkner. Could the minister outline to the Senate the situation that has developed in Thailand and the reaction of the government to this situation and explain what the Australian government is doing to facilitate the travel arrangements for Australians trapped by the closure of the airports in Bangkok?

         I thank Senator Bishop for his interest and concern in relation to this matter. Over the weekend the government asked Qantas to operate special flights for Australians stranded in Bangkok who wanted to come home. Obviously we appreciate the fact that Qantas has agreed to assist Australians, and a Qantas Airbus will leave Phuket early tomorrow morning. The flight will carry around 300 passengers, both Qantas passengers and other Australians holding tickets from other carriers. I can inform the Senate that arrangements are continuing with Qantas on the possibility of a further flight. This is part of the considerable consular and logistic plan the government has in place to assist Australians during the unfolding political tensions in Thailand. It goes without saying that our primary concern is for Australians’ safety and welfare, both for those who want to leave Thailand and for those Australians who remain in Thailand itself.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can say that we are increasingly frustrated with the situation in Thailand and recognise that it is also very frustrating for the hundreds of stranded and, I think it is fair to say, distressed Australians. Our embassy in Bangkok has set up a call centre and has spoken to over 3,000 people so far to provide advice and to respond to the concerns and difficulties that Australian tourists are facing. We have deployed consular officials on the ground who are assisting Australians by helping those who need medical assistance, helping elderly passengers who have particular difficulties and assisting parents in distress with young children.

          , I ask a supplementary question. In his response the minister indicated some numbers but, given the numbers of Australians affected, can the minister indicate the volume of work being handled by consular officials trying to assist Australians trapped in Thailand?

           I can inform the Senate that the Australian ambassador and Australian diplomats have met and spoken with over 400 Australians at 15 hotels around Bangkok. The ambassador has personally put pressure on Thai Airways and the Thai tourism authority to get some Thai airlines flights out, and embassy officials continue to provide accommodation assistance for Australians. Suvarnabhumi international airport and

           domestic airport in Bangkok remain closed because of the ongoing demonstrations and political unrest. It is uncertain when these airports will reopen. I can also say that embassy officials are stationed on 24-hour duty at Thailand’s three operating airports, including at U-Tapao military airbase.

             The government is advising all Australians to keep themselves informed of developments, to remain in close contact with their airlines and travel operators, to follow any instructions issued by local authorities and to monitor our travel advice for any updates. I can advise the Senate in response to Senator Bishop’s supplementary question that the travel advice for Thailand has been reviewed and reissued. The overall level of the advice has not changed but we have upgraded the level of advice for Bangkok. We are now advising Australians to reconsider their need to travel to Bangkok at this time due to the continued closure of the main airports and, of course, the fact that there is very limited availability of flights. The situation does remain very uncertain, and I repeat that our uppermost concern is for the safety and welfare of Australians.
