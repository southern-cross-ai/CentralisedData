        Labor has a number of amendments that we want to propose to the bill. They are contained in sheet 8354. In relation to the amendments, we believe that there is insufficient evidence at this stage to show that the existing trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley are working.

        inquiry heard that the ORIMA evaluations of the trial are unreliable and no empirical judgements can be made on the basis of the information collected. In its own consultations, Labor heard mixed results with some participants in Ceduna and the East Kimberley trials finding the cashless debit card to be useful while others thought it had not made any improvement to their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the poor quality of the evaluation, Labor believes that the Ceduna and East Kimberley trials have not been running long enough to form solid conclusions about the success of the trials. Labor supported the initiation of trials in Ceduna and in the East Kimberley, and supports them continuing for a further year to allow more time to reliably determine whether they have been successful.

         The government amendment extends the trial of the cashless debit card to 30 June 2019. The amendments also specify that the trial will be limited to three sites—namely, the East Kimberley and the included communities, Ceduna and the surrounding regions, and the Goldfields. The bill retains the existing legislated limitations on trial parameters in relation to the number of sites, participant numbers and the duration of the cashless debit card trial.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the current legislation, trial sites are determined via legislative instrument. The bill removes this ability and specifically names the trial areas. Instead, the minister will be able to declare that specific parts of the trial areas are exempt from the cashless debit card. This provides the government with the flexibility to remove localities. This reflects that discussions with communities in the Goldfields region are ongoing and that requirements for communities already on the cashless debit card may change over time.
        </p>
        <p>
         We say that the change is needed. The government amendments to the bill will provide certainty for the communities currently engaged in the trial and/or the communities of the Goldfields which have asked the government to expand the cashless debit card to their community. Currently, the debit card trial is due to cease on 30 June this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         An independent evaluation of the existing
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
          CDC
         </a>
         trial sites was conducted by ORIMA Research in 2016-17. The evaluation found that the card had a considerable positive impact in both trial sites. Overall the research found that the CDC trial has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption and gambling on both trial sites and was also suggestive of a reduction in the use of illegal drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Continuing the cashless debit card in Ceduna and the East Kimberley will focus on sustaining these impacts in the longer term. If the current end date is not extended, the program must cease by 30 June 2018, which will risk undermining the positive outcomes already being experienced by these communities. Furthermore, the government has committed to expand the program to the Goldfields region. Failure to amend the legislation will prevent this. This expansion will help test the card in different settings.

            I will just go to each part of the amendment that you have before the Senate. We oppose this amendment. I said in the second reading debate and I've indicated earlier tonight that there is insufficient evidence at this stage to show that the existing trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley are working. That is an issue to start with, and that's why we would oppose any expansion of the trial. We don't support the expansion of the trial at this stage.
           </p>
           <p>
            We supported the initiation of trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley and support them continuing for a further year to allow more time to reliably determine whether they have been successful. The amendment I propose to move on this bill deals with that aspect.
           </p>
           <p>
            The second part of your amendment goes to defining the trial area. The current legislation in the bill doesn't define the trial area. This is currently done through a legislative instrument. This government amendment defines the trial areas as the Ceduna area, the East Kimberley area and the Goldfields area. We oppose this part of the amendment, and any move to expand the trial without sufficient evidence to demonstrate its success will be opposed. Labor requires a much more rigorous evaluation of the cashless debit card in the existing trial areas prior to any expansion.
           </p>
           <p>
            The trials are also of a significant cost. Labor understands that there is a current accrued cost of $25.5 million, or around $12,000 per participant. We also know that the government spent around $1.6 million on ORIMA Research to provide substandard evaluation, and the minister still won't reveal how much it will cost the taxpayers to expand the rollout of the card to the Goldfields area.
           </p>
           <p>
            Minister, before I go any further, can you confirm that there is an accrued cost of $25.5 million, or $12,000 per participant? Did the ORIMA research cost $1.6 million? Can you reveal how much it will cost taxpayers to expand the rollout of the card to the Goldfields area?

               I am advised that there is an initial up-front cost and there is no ongoing cost. The bulk of the cost of the program relates to up-front implementation, and these up-front costs include industry and community consultation, the card provider creating a new debit card and information technology system as well as the independent evaluation of the trial. Any future costs associated with the program, including expanding to additional sites, will be significantly lower per head than the amount estimated for the trial. I am instructed that it works out at $1,000 per head long term.

                Thanks. I'm still unclear. I'm not sure where the $1,000-per-head long-term figure you said comes from, so maybe you could explain that figure. I want to bring you back to the accrued cost to the present time. The advice I have is that that is $25.5 million. Maybe you could just deal with those two issues and advise how you achieve this figure of $1,000. How does that work out?

                  Thanks. So my understanding that the accrued cost of $25.5 million is correct. Can you now explain how it becomes $1,000 per participant and not the $12,000 that I am advised?

                   I am advised, Senator Cameron, that those are up-front costs for the set-up and that, of course, the long-term cost is reduced to $1,000 per person.

                    So, Minister, you're basically subtracting the $25.5 million up-front cost to achieve a $1,000-per-participant outcome. Is that correct?

                     I'm instructed that the figure of about $25 million is the bulk of the program and it is for up-front implementation, which is a normal practice with a new initiative. These up-front costs include the industry and community consultation, the card provider creating the new debit card and information technology system—which, of course, stays with the life of the program once it has been created—as well as the independent evaluation of the system. Clearly, any future costs associated with the program, even expanding to additional sites, will be significantly lower per head than the amount that was originally estimated for the trial.

                        We understand that the accrued cost is $25.5 million. I think that would include what you describe as up-front costs.

I am now advised that it will be $1,000 per person over the long term.

                                             You asked me a question about costs. I'm telling you that costs for operating additional sites are not for publication due to potential commercial sensitivities, because there are contracts and contractual obligations involved. I've explained to you that the cost of the four sites to 2020 is $1,000 per person. Those are my instructions. I can seek further instructions, but that's what I am instructed to put to the Senate.

                                              Okay. I'm just not sure I want to accept that as this stage. I might come back to that. So where we are up to, I think, is our opposition to the inclusion of the Goldfields. We take the view that any move to expand the trial without sufficient evidence will be opposed. We want a more rigorous evaluation. The trials are a significant cost, and you have confirmed what our estimate was: about $25.5 million or about $12,000 per participant. Has the government looked at spending that $12,000 per participant on providing more wraparound support, some advice on how to handle the government payments they receive and providing those who need it alcohol and drug support? Wouldn't that be a better spend than how you're looking to do this without proper evaluation?

In relation to the Goldfields communities, there will also be an additional $1 million in funding for wraparound services. So it's $1 million in Ceduna, $1.6 million in East Kimberley and $1 million in the Goldfields.

I am advised that if there are to be further sites, then that would require another bill to come before the parliament. It is protecting the parliamentary oversight, but it's a higher protection, if I can put it that way. Rather than being done by delegated legislation, where it would be a disallowable instrument, this is a situation where we would have to come back to the parliament, because it's actually legislated. We would have to come back to parliament if we wanted to go to further sites. Of course, that affords parliament the opportunity of scrutiny.

It really does give, if I can say this, a much firmer outline in relation to those areas. If it's done by legislative instrument, we're talking about a legislative instrument in relation to a part of that area, and, again, that legislative instrument is disallowable by parliament.

So those that do not know to apply for a new card still cannot use EFTPOS. Sorry, I've misled the Senate a little bit—it was not last week, it was the week before last.

Again, I'm given to understand by participants who have been trying to do this that you can't use BPAY, and you have to use the card as a credit card and hand over the number of your card to the merchant, rather than being able to transfer funds electronically. Is that still the case? And, if it is still the case, could you please articulate why that is the case?

The claim that's constantly made about this is that anybody on the card just operates it like a normal bank account—when, in fact, that's just not true.

I can't provide you with an answer on that one just at the moment, except to say that we are looking at other technological improvements and options in relation to it so that the credit card and giving the number of the credit card are not the only options.

At this point in time, I can't give you a precise time. I'm also advised it is commercial-in-confidence, but we will certainly take your comments on board, Senator Siewert. I'm sure you too will pursue this matter at estimates, and you can rest assured that I will be there with an answer in a couple of weeks time.

Does it relate to that, or is it something entirely separate?

We don't support the extension of the East Kimberley trial or the Ceduna trial. Contrary to the oft stated facts around reduction in drinking et cetera, that's not borne out by a proper read of the ORIMA wave 2 report. If you read the full report, even in there they can't gloss over the lack of information, the anecdotal approach and the flawed approach to the methodology. It's simply not borne out, so we won't support an extension to the two trial areas, and we certainly won't be supporting the expansion to a third trial site.

I think it's a bit rich, quite frankly, for them to say, 'Yes, we'll support another trial site; make it in Western Australia.' I've got deep concerns around that. I've got deep concerns that, although they've said there's not enough information to make a decision on the two existing trial sites, the minister just articulated that they've condemned over 3,000 income support recipients in the Goldfields to living on this flawed card with a method that's flawed.

We don't support the cashless welfare card. It's flawed policy. It ignores the words from the Prime Minister's own mouth that you do things with the community, not to the community. You can dress it up all you like and say that you've consulted. You haven't consulted with the people who are affected by this card. That is very, very clear, and it has been admitted in the evidence, so you can't deny it. Even a number of the leaders in the East Kimberley have withdrawn their support, as did a number of people who originally signed up in Ceduna once they realised what this was about and the impact it was having. In fact, I was talking to a participant from Ceduna again very recently and they said, 'One of the things it has managed to do is unite the Aboriginal and the non-Aboriginal communities a lot more than they used to be, because they don't support the cashless welfare card.' So it's achieved something there! But it's been at great grief, personal pain and discomfort to many people on the card. We won't be supporting these amendments.

Senator Siewert, the cashless debit card is implemented only in communities that support it. Support for the card is measured through extensive consultation with interested communities. So far, consultation has covered all relevant stakeholder groups, including potential program participants. The initial trials were designed and implemented in close consultation with community leaders. I'm advised that approximately 300 consultations were held in the Ceduna region and 110 in the East Kimberley prior to the initial rollout in early 2016. Those consulted included community members, Indigenous leaders, service providers, police, and local and state government agencies. Consultation is conducted on an ongoing basis in both Ceduna and the East Kimberley, and extensive consultation was undertaken prior to announcing the expansion of the card to the Goldfields. Between May and December 2017 in the Goldfields region over 300 consultations were held with over 86 organisations, and there were 10 public information sessions. Consultation will be ongoing in the Goldfields in preparation for implementation.

Firstly, in relation to the advice from Senator Rhiannon: we don't need your advice. If you've got good advice, could I advise you to keep it for Mr Bandt, who got the Greens into so much trouble this week. I don't know how anyone could have turned Senator Molan into a victim. So if you've got good advice then keep it for Mr Bandt, because he needs it more than we do.

He is also the National Party president. He operates as a lobbyist as well as being the National Party president. My view is that that breaches the lobbyist code.

It is a simple question and, given that you are saying it's got support and you are using the consultation as the reason to roll this out, I'm simply asking how many opposed it.

We won't canvass that at the moment, but I'm happy to hear you are not sitting on the same side as that council, given some of the allegations that have been raised. But in any case we will take that on notice. You want a breakdown of the 86. We'll give you the names, and we'll provide you with as much information as we can in relation to that.

Minister, I don't want to put you through the agony of going through 86 different groups. You said you would provide that; I'm happy to receive that advice. What I'm more interested in is how many opposed it. If you're not prepared to advise who opposed it and why they opposed it, can you explain why you're not prepared to do that?
                                                                                                                    </p>

There was obviously a discussion. I cannot provide you with the position—it was a public, open consultation, I'm advised, but I cannot tell you what the exact position of every one of those 86 organisations was. For me to do so would mean having to go to them and just saying, 'Okay, what is your position?' If that's what you want me to take on notice, I will take that on notice. I will see what I can do. But I cannot give you the information that you seek at this point in time without going back to each of those organisations.

For anyone that might be listening, the government can quickly provide us with the names of five groups that support the expansion of the card, but the minister can't or won't tell us about another 81 who opposed it. Maybe I can ask it another way. I'd like you to take on notice who opposed it and why they opposed it. Who conducted the consultations?

In its own consultations, Labor heard mixed results, with some participants in Ceduna and in the East Kimberley trials finding the cashless debit card to be useful, while others thought it had not made any improvements to their lives. In addition to the poor quality of the evaluation, Labor believe that the Ceduna and East Kimberley trials have not been running long enough to form solid conclusions about the success or otherwise of the trials. Labor supported the initiation of the trials in East Kimberley and supports them continuing for a further year to allow more time to reliably determine whether they have been successful. We require a more rigorous evaluation of the cashless debit card in the existing trial areas prior to any expansion.

We've heard tonight that it's around $25.5 million, or $12,000 per participant, and the response we got from the minister was that it would be even more expensive than that. We know that the government has spent $1.6 million for ORIMA Research to provide what we believe is substandard evaluation.

We do support the establishment of trials in East Kimberley and Ceduna on the basis that the communities wanted, and had consented to, the trial card. We consulted with communities in the proposed trial regions of Bundaberg and Goldfields, and, as well as the evidence presented in the Senate inquiry, it's clear there's been insufficient government consultation with these communities. The minister could provide us with the names of councils who supported the expansion but couldn't tell us the name of one group, among the 86 participants in the consultation, who had opposed the trial. It's not that no-one opposed the trial; it's that the minister didn't have that information and the advisers couldn't provide that information. The minister has taken that on notice, and I'll be pleased to get the result of that agreement to take those issues on notice and provide those details.

The minister had an opportunity to take us through how the consultation worked, who opposed the trial and the issues that were raised by those groups, among the 86 that participated, who opposed the trial, but we didn't get that. That's pretty typical of this government: they determine what they want to do and they just impose it on local communities. Then they offer a bauble or a small gift of something that the

It's pretty typical of NXT these days. They are another Liberal Party supporting the government in its endeavours to implement what we think is flawed legislation and to bringing flawed bills to this parliament. We believe there's insufficient evidence. We would require a more rigorous evaluation.

Labor, in its own consultations, heard the way in which the decisions made by the community body were not always clear and transparent.

The wraparound services are important. There is no point in putting these cards in without appropriate wraparound services. The minister could give me a figure on what wraparound services cost across the country, but, for the bill that's been brought here, we didn't get any specified idea of what the wraparound services were costing. We are seeking that the government specify the social support services to ensure trial participants get the alcohol rehabilitation, mental health and other support services they need. The funding allocated in the new services being delivered is not clear to trial participants. This amendment requires the information be made public.

The amendments put forward would prohibit the proposed expansion of the card and effectively restrict the proper implementation of a trial. While the government welcomes the opposition's support of the current sites and the extension of the trial time frame, we don't believe the opposition has considered what its amendments would mean for existing trial sites. The proposed opposition amendments with regard to provided services and community consultation will place an unnecessary and potentially harmful administrative burden on the department when it needs to respond to community requests.

There is a strong need for additional tools to address social harm in the Goldfields. WA

Alcohol-related hospitalisations and deaths were 25 per cent higher than the WA state average from 2007 to 2011. In a statement to the Senate inquiry into the bill in late 2017,

Between May and December 2017, over 300 consultations were held, with over 86 organisations and 10 public information sessions. Consultation is ongoing in the Goldfields in preparation for implementation. Momentum in the community for the trial has been considerable, with a number of working groups established in late 2017 to assist with implementation, planning and oversight. The expansion of the program demonstrates our commitment to provide a strong social welfare safety net reducing social harm in areas with high levels of welfare dependency and supporting vulnerable people, families and communities.

It would only make sense if there were a proper evaluation, but there has not been a proper evaluation even though the government spent $1.6 million. The evidence that we had was that the evaluation was flawed. That was the clear evidence in the Senate inquiry. So, what we are trying to do here is create a new trial end date of 30 June 2019 for both Ceduna and East Kimberley so that a proper evaluation can be made. We accept that some people are saying they want this to continue, but in our consultations in both Ceduna and East Kimberley there were many saying that this should not continue and they are opposed to it. So, our amendment creates a new trial end date; it limits the trials to only two discrete trial areas in the current locations; it opposes the removal of the limit to 10,000 participants; it specifies how people in the trial areas who are on the cashless debit card can have the proportion of their income payments on the card reduced; and it specifies the social support services that are to be delivered as part of the trial.

So, this is a sensible range of amendments that continues the existing trial for a period of 12 months; it limits the trials to the two areas; it opposes the removal of the limit to 10,000 participants; it specifies the proportion of income support payments on the cards that can be reduced; and it specifies the social support services that are to be delivered as part of the trial. We think these are sensible amendments and we would certainly hope that the crossbench and

They can't give us that. They can give us the names of the consultation, but can't tell us who opposed the card being introduced. So, there hasn't been an open, fair and reasonable approach on this from the government. The government, in my view, is determined to push this cashless welfare card out even wider than what is proposed in this bill. Labor will never support a national rollout of the cashless debit card. We will support it only where local communities support it. Because the minister is unable or unwilling to tell us who opposed the card and the reasons for the opposition, our estimate through our consultations is that the amendments that are before the Senate tonight are the appropriate amendments to give a balanced approach to this and to make sure that proper consultation takes place in the future.

The evaluation also found that there are areas that we can improve on, and as we roll out the CDC in the Goldfields and Bundaberg and

Of those who said they were using illegal drugs before the trial started, 48 per cent reported using illegal drugs less since the card's introduction, up from 28 per cent at wave 1. Of those participants who said they gambled before the trial started, 48 per cent reported gambling less, from 32 per cent at wave 1. Of those parents surveyed, 40 per cent reported being able to better care for their children since being on the CDC, and 39 per cent reported being more involved in their children's homework and school. In addition, the evaluation found widespread positive spillover benefits from the card, including 45 per cent of participants reporting being able to save more money than before being a trial participant, up from 31 per cent at wave 1, and 23 per cent of participants indicating they spent 11 hours or more per week trying to get a job or paid work.

Overall, the evaluation has shown a decrease in these behaviours between the wave 1 report and the wave 2 report. It also found that 'most stakeholders, community leaders and merchants did not perceive these practices to be pervasive or widespread'.

These restrictions ensure that those receiving welfare payments and their children will have money available for life's essentials. For people who already spend their money responsibly, the cashless debit card has very little impact.

For example, people do not participate in the program if they have a payment nominee, if they are students living outside the trial area for study or if CDC participation would seriously risk their mental, physical or emotional wellbeing. Risks are assessed on a case-by-case basis. It is important that the department is provided with the flexibility and discretion to apply exemptions where necessary. Accordingly, the government will be voting against the amendments proposed by the opposition.

The change from three to two discrete so-called trial sites and the legislative instrument about 'an agreement of a kind mentioned in paragraph (2)(a)', at part 5, are something that we would support just to see that this legislation was improved slightly.
                                                                                                                                       </p>

So we will very strongly be voting no on the third reading, regardless of these amendments, because we don't support the card.

Labor believes that, given that the government seems to have crossbench support—for what reason, I don't know—these amendments will make it, as Senator Siewert says, a modicum better. And we appreciate your support for that, to make it better.

I think what is clear is that this government would roll this out nationally if it could. This is the type of overbearing position that this government adopts when it comes to some of our most disadvantaged people in the community. Many people in the community live on an income that many of us could not ever contemplate living on, and they do it better than most of us ever could. They look after their families, they look after the health of the family, they look after the education of the family, and they do that on an income that is tiny. To say to them, 'You must have this cashless debit card,' is the height of arrogance from this government.

You know, it is just bizarre that, while we're in the chamber debating this bill, no-one of the advisers and the minister can tell us who opposed the card and why they opposed the card—these are important issues. So we oppose the national rollout. We oppose a rollout in any individual community without a proper evidence based approach, and that has not been done, even where it's being rolled out now. We take the view that the ORIMA evaluation was flawed; that was the evidence that came to the Senate inquiry. And, on that basis, the amendments that we put—given that it looks like

We think the amendments will take some of the sharp edges off. The process that we would have in government would be proper consultation that is understood by the community and the public generally, not the secret approach that's been adopted by the government, and not setting out to force this onto people who, quite clearly, can handle their finances no matter how difficult it is on social security payments in this country.

I think that's appropriate. I understand their opposition to the bill. We would, hopefully, have some of the crossbench listen to the debate, take into account the incapacity of the government to answer some basic questions on the rollout of this card, and adopt a process in the future that is transparent and fair.

We take the view that the crossbench should support this because it's a good middle position between what the government's proposing and complete opposition to this bill. It provides a number of amendments that would have softened the bill, but you've voted against that. Now's the opportunity for you to actually reconsider and support a proposition that means a good middle ground on this bill.
