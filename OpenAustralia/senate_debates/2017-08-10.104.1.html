        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Yesterday, the minister delivered on the centrepiece of his energy policy: a cup of tea with energy executives. Can the minister confirm that the energy executives used the cup of tea to urge the Prime Minister to finally make a decision on a clean energy target?

         Look, Senator Carr, I know that you regard a serious meeting with industry leaders called by the Prime Minister to address an important national issue with flippancy, but we don't. We do not regard this as an unimportant issue; we regard it as a very important issue.

           I will take that interjection, Senator Wong. What we have in fact done is—together, by the way, with state Labor governments—through
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
            COAG
           </a>
           , commission a comprehensive review by Australia's chief scientist, Professor Alan Finkel, into the future of energy policy. We have already adopted 49 of the 50 recommendations of the Finkel report and will shortly be announcing our response to the one outstanding recommendation. Secondly, through you,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
            Mr President
           </a>
           , Senator Carr, what the government has done has been to engage directly with industry: first, with the gas industry to very, very good effect; and now with the electricity retailers. And, far from having a cup of tea with them, Senator Carr, what the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Environment and Energy, the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister discussed with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           s yesterday was ways in which they can make the market much more transparent for consumers in particular by enabling consumers to be better informed as to how they can move their arrangements for their electricity bills onto the lowest-cost basis possible. The transparency of electricity pricing is an important part of the problem, and for you, Senator Carr, to regard this as having nothing more than a cup of tea is not, with respect, a flippancy the Australian people will respect.

The government, as I told one of your colleagues in answer to a question yesterday, is carefully considering the matter—it's a matter under discussion at the moment—and the response to Professor Finkel's recommendation about a clean energy target will be the subject of an announcement in the near future.

                Labor have indicated that we are willing to work in a bipartisan fashion to end the policy uncertainty that is costing Australian energy consumers.

                 Well, might I remind you, Senator Carr, that it was the Prime Minister who commissioned the Finkel review through the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
                  COAG
                 </a>
                 process. It was the Prime Minister who is giving effect to the recommendations of the Finkel review. It was the Prime Minister who summoned the gas company executives to Canberra to ensure that the availability of gas on the domestic market was appropriate, given the capacity of gas exporters to export gas and to use export licences as a vehicle or as a tool to ensure downward pressure on energy prices within the domestic market. And it was the Prime Minister who yesterday summoned the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                  CEO
                 </a>
                 s of the energy retailers, as I have explained, not for a cup of tea but for a serious discussion—a serious discussion—about how their billing practices can be made more transparent to energy consumers. That is the sort of decisive action that this government has taken and is taking.
