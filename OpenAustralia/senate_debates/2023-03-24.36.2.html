          During a motion to suspend standing orders to bring on for debate a private senators' bill entitled Criminal Code Amendment (Prohibition of Nazi Symbols) Bill 2023, Senator Watt interjected. As he pointed directly towards me, he said words that I will not repeat and that no other person should repeat. They were abhorrent and offensive.
         </p>
         <p>
          Since I was first elected in 2013, I do not recall in this chamber or the other chamber a more distasteful statement. The precise words uttered by Senator Watt will be seared into my memory for a very long time. Any attempt to distort and recharacterise his interjection only compounds the damage. The only words Senator Watt should be saying are, 'I unconditionally apologise.'
         </p>
         <p>
          The parliament provides members and senators with enormous privileges, including the right to speak freely under parliamentary privilege. However, with that right comes significant responsibility. Our workplace must be safe in all respects. Words can cause enormous harm. I acknowledge and thank my colleagues, who have provided me with support. I also acknowledge and thank the President for calling me to check on my welfare and to advise that I may wish to contact the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, which I have now done. Thank you.

             The events of this week have been challenging for many in and out of this placeâ€”most of all, for vulnerable people who have faced persecution merely for being who they are. For the clarity of all senators, this morning, in response to Senator Birmingham moving the suspension motion, I asked Liberals why they were not condemning their own senators who are texting Victorian Liberal leader Mr Pesutto to support Victorian MP Moira Deeming, who recently stood with neo-Nazis. It was consistent with my view that as senators we are all accountable to each other for our actions.
            </p>
            <p>
             I did not intend to upset Senator Henderson, and that's why I withdrew my remarks, as did Senator Cash, when she withdrew remarks that she made against me. We all want this place to be a safe and respectful workplace. None of us wants to see our colleagues in distress. It is my hope that as senators we can come together against hateful and divisive rhetoric and engage in respectful debate.
