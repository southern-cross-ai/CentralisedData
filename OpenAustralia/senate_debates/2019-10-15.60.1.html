        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Minister Birmingham. Do you believe that our young people who don't want to go to uni and who like learning with their hands—like me—have access to high-quality, modern facilities and training equipment?

         I thank Senator Lambie for her question and her interest in this area. The answer, in general, to her question is: yes. Choice is important for Australian students, school leavers and others, in terms of their educational opportunities. It is important to ensure we have the skills mix that we need for our economy, and it's important that both the higher education sector and the vocational education and training sector are responsive to the employment opportunities of students—what jobs they will be able to secure when they leave and that those sectors are training people accordingly for those jobs of the future. Certainly, in terms of our higher education reforms—performance funding for universities—we have sought to better gear funding and university behaviour to ensure that they enrol students in courses that have the greatest potential for employment success.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the agreements we have with states and territories around vocational education and training, we provide funding directly to the states and territories for the administration and support of vocational, education and training systems. Again, Minister Cash, now in the skills and vocational education area, works to make sure that states and territories are more responsive in the utilisation of that funding, so that students enrolled in those vocational education courses—be they apprenticeships or other areas of vocational training—are actually enrolled in courses that have the greatest job prospects for the future and that every dollar of Commonwealth funding that flows, such as the $162.8 million dollars provided to Tasmania over five years through the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development, is targeted to support skills development in the areas that have the greatest economic need and the greatest employment prospects for those young Australians.

           That's great, Minister. It seems like you and I are on the same page. I find it very interesting because I recently visited a few

           s. Would you be surprised to learn, and do you think it's appropriate, that the students in our TAFEs are, in some cases, learning their trades on equipment that was manufactured during the Cold War?

            , I'll make a few points in relation to Senator Lambie's comment and assertion. In some instances, equipment may well last a long period of time, but, where necessary, modern equipment should be available for modern skills and training needs.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

            s are not run by the Australian government; they are run by the states and territories. That's why, as a federal government, we provide significant funding to the states and territories. In addition to the $3 billion we spend annually, we're investing some $585 million in significant reforms in the vocational and educational and training sector. Whilst not directly funding TAFEs, that money is there for utilisation by states and territories to ensure that students have access to courses they need, and that those TAFEs or other training providers, are delivering modern courses befitting the training that people need for the future.

               As an aside, I'm always disappointed when a reference to anything in the Soviet era is made in this chamber when Senator Kim Carr is not present—it's a missed opportunity. However, in all seriousness, because it's a serious question that Senator Lambie asks, the federal government is not in the business of directly funding those institutions. Our business is in funding the states and territories, who own the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
                TAFE

               s, who operate the TAFEs and who set the policies around enrolment in the TAFEs, and in making sure that those states and territories are held to account for investing in the skills needs that Australians want to pursue.
              </p>
              <p>
               I know that Senator Cash, in negotiating with the states and territories, has a laser-like focus on ensuring that they are looking at spending every single dollar on the things that will give training with optimal employment outcomes for young Australians, whether that's investing in the equipment, investing in the types of subsidies that are delivered to those students, making sure they get the skills—
