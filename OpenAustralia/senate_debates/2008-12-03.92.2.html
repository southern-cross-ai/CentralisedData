        At the request of Senator Ludwig, I move:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         That the following operate as temporary orders from the first sitting day in 2009 until the conclusion of the 2009 sittings:
         <dl>
          <dt>
           (1)
          </dt>
          <dd>
           Adjournment debate on Tuesdays
          </dd>
          <dt>
          </dt>
          <dd>
           On the question for the adjournment of the Senate on Tuesday, a senator who has spoken once subject to the time limit of 10 minutes may speak again for not more than 10 minutes if no other senator who has not already spoken once wishes to speak, provided that a senator may by leave speak for not more than 20 minutes on one occasion.
          </dd>
          <dt>
           (2)
          </dt>
          <dd>
           Divisions on Thursday
          </dd>
          <dt>
          </dt>
          <dd>
           If a division is called for on Thursday after 4.30 pm, the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned until the next day of sitting at a time fixed by the Senate.
          </dd>
          <dt>
           (3)
          </dt>
          <dd>
           Substitute members of committees
          </dd>
          <dt>
          </dt>
          <dd>
           If a member of a committee appointed under standing order 25 is unable to attend a meeting of the committee, that member may in writing to the chair of the committee appoint a participating member to act as a substitute member of the committee at that meeting. If the member is incapacitated or unavailable, a letter to the chair of a committee appointing a participating member to act as a substitute member of the committee may be signed on behalf of the member by the leader of the party or group on whose nomination the member was appointed to the committee.

         <p>
          by leave—This is a temporary order that has been put in place at about this time every year for the last couple of years. There are three parts to it. The first part is to reintroduce for next year the adjournment debate on Tuesdays, where there has been agreement—and it tends to work around the chamber—so that we can have an open-ended adjournment where possible on Tuesday nights which allows senators to speak for 10 minutes and then for 20 minutes on one occasion. The second part of it relates to Thursday nights, where there are no divisions and no quorums after 4.30 pm on a Thursday, except at times like tomorrow. That has been in place for some time to allow the Senate to work through for those people who want to—I will not go there. The third part is the substitution of members on committees. That has been there to allow substitution, to ensure that under standing order 25 we can deal with committee appointments and those where there is substitution of members. I am sure, Senator Brown, with those few words, it all floods back!
