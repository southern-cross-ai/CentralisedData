        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Cormann. Today, the member for Leichhardt called for Mr Morrison to extend JobKeeper, saying, 'There is a very strong argument, and the figures that were released today show you how important it is, that we continue to have this support within our community.' Will Mr Morrison give this support to communities in

         I thank Senator Green for that question. Our government has made responsible decisions right from the outset of this crisis. We have made decisions to save lives and to save livelihoods, and we will continue to make those decisions; we will continue to make responsible decisions moving forward.

         would be well aware of the Treasury review that has been well and truly publicly canvassed. Once the findings and recommendations of that review are received, the government will be making further responsible decisions. I can reassure the people of North Queensland that our government is very, very focused on their best interests. Of course, the most important thing the people of North Queensland would like to see right now is the removal of the state border restrictions so that the planes can start flying again and so that tourists can go to North Queensland again. If you were interested in the best interests of the people of North Queensland, you would be calling on Premier Palaszczuk to remove the state border restrictions.

           A survey of 2,300 Australian company directors found that 81 per cent would prefer to see a cautious phasing out of stimulus policies, such as JobKeeper, rather than a rapid wind-down. Why is the government refusing to give Australian businesses confidence that JobKeeper will continue past September where needed?

               has said that Australia is leading the developed world when it comes to economic recovery in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The OECD has also predicted a bounce back in economic growth in Australia in 2021. The OECD has also outlined that the comparative position of the Australian economy is materially better than the position of economies in many other parts of the world. We'll continue to make the decisions that are required, including decisions to minimise the risk of a second wave of infections, because it is so important to protect people's health and it is also so important to protect our economy and to protect jobs.
