        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, Senator Nash. Probationary licence holders are tragically overrepresented in our road trauma statistics.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Keys" rel="nofollow">
         The Keys
        </a>
        2 Drive learner driver program was designed to save lives amongst Australia's youngest and most vulnerable drivers. Keys 2 Drive has so far provided more than 200,000 free lessons to both young Australian drivers and their parents or guardians and is helping reduce the rate of death and injury on our roads. Is the minister aware that no government funding to the Keys 2 Drive program is allocated beyond 30 June 2016?

         I thank the senator for his question and for some advance notice of it. Indeed the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport is very well aware of this program as am I, and indeed the senator is correct in identifying that the current funding does cease on 30 June this year. However, we are currently considering the future of that funding in the context of the budget process.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would note that when the coalition came to government in 2013, we extended the funding to Keys 2 Drive at that point, recognising the importance of that program. I think all of us in this place on both sides of the chamber would recognise how important it is that we do as much as we can across the country, not just as parliamentarians but as parents and as family members, to ensure that our young people are as safe as possible in their vehicles. We will be looking at this in the context of the budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do acknowledge the senator's very real interest in this and reflect also that the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport has been well and truly on the record indicating his very real concern around road safety issues. Indeed, he had been doing that for some time prior to taking up his ministerial responsibilities.

          to conduct research which highlights that the Key 2 Drive program participants are 28 per cent less likely than non-trained drivers to be involved in a car crash in the first six months as a p-plater. Is the government aware of these findings or the associated savings that will result from the reduction in road trauma?

           The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport is aware of the report from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">
            AAA
           </a>
           as is the government more broadly. The findings are of great interest to the government while we are looking at future arrangements when it comes to the Keys 2 Drive program. The minister, as I understand it, has been working very closely with stakeholders and will of course be talking to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Automobile_Association" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Automobile Association
           </a>
           about that report. I can only reiterate that this issue of safety for our young people on the roads is one that is absolutely paramount for this government.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a mother, having had two young boys go through the process of getting their licence, I think we all, as I indicated before in this chamber, want to ensure that our young people are as safe as they possibly can be on our roads.

            , I ask a final supplementary question. Given the fact that the Keys 2 Drive learner driver program has proven to be so effective in reducing road crashes and injuries amongst participants, will the government commit to the Keys 2 Drive learner program beyond June 30?

             I am sure the senator would be well aware that I cannot commit to government funding at this point in time today. When it comes to the budget processes, I think everybody around this chamber would be very well aware that I was not going to do this. But what I can commit to the senator is that the government will very thoroughly review this particular program.

               I will take the senator's interjection of we 'will have a look at it'. We will do more than 'have a look at it', which is something those on the other side historically might have done. We will, in a thorough detailed manner, deliberate over the future of this program, recognising of course that the government has as paramount the need to take decisions that will ensure the safety of our young people on our roads.
