        Madam Acting Deputy President Allman-Payne, I'm pleased to talk about an issue close to both our hearts: regional manufacturing in regional Queensland. The Albanese Labor government sees a future in Australian manufacturing. Our government sees a future for manufacturing in regional Australia. That is as clear as day when you look at our commitment of $150 million for the Cairns Marine Precinct. This investment in addition to the Queensland government's own $150 million commitment will go towards a much-needed once-in-a-generation facility in Cairns.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cairns Marine Precinct project will create good, secure, local jobs. It will create more opportunities for local businesses. And it will help Cairns remain a world leader in marine manufacturing, maintenance and repair. The Cairns Marine Precinct project will help Cairns continue to be a key strategic player in the defence of our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is investments like this that make sense for our government—investments that give back to communities, that ensure workers have secure jobs they can build their futures on. And it was investment like this that those opposite turned their nose up at.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Leichhardt is in staunch opposition to this commitment. Despite widespread community support when we announced this funding his response on whether he would match it was, 'No. In a word absolutely no.' It's not a surprise—not from the

        . They dared Holden to leave and they did. They slashed R&amp;D support to manufacturing. They shut the doors on thousands of apprentices and trainees. They sent trainees overseas. It was Labor that brought them home. They have never met a manufacturing job that they wouldn't casualise. You can't count on the LNP to back manufacturing, but you can count on a Labor government, because we know just how important it is to make things right here at home.
