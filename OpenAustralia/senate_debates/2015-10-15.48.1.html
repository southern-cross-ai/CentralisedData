          Yesterday, Australia lost a great Queenslander and a great Australian in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Bender" rel="nofollow">
           George Bender
          </a>
          . My thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to George's family and the Chinchilla community at this difficult time. I promise to ensure George's death was not in vain and that everyone across the country understands the damage and destruction
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSG" rel="nofollow">
           CSG
          </a>
          mining is doing to the people of Queensland. George was a brave, courageous, big-hearted cotton farmer in Chinchilla who fought for 10 years to stop CSG miners from entering his land to mine. All his bores had dried up because CSG mining in nearby areas had depleted the underground water, and contaminated water was all that was left. If this was not enough, the mining companies then wanted to mine on George's land.
         </p>
         <p>
          Queenslanders have no right to say no to miners coming onto their land to mine CSG. They are left to fend for themselves against the greed and the might of mining companies. Please help me stop the scourge of CSG mining in Queensland and restore the rights of our people to stop the needless loss of human life and the devastation caused by CSG mining.
