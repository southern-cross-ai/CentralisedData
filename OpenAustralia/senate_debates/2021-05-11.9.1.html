        I table, for the information of the Senate, a revised ministry list. I seek leave to have the document incorporated into

        are shown in bold type. As a general rule, there is one department in each portfolio. However, there can be two departments in one portfolio. The title of a department does not necessarily reflect the title of a Minister in all cases. Ministers are sworn to administer the portfolio in which they are listed under the 'Minister' column and may also be sworn to administer other portfolios in which they are not listed.

        by leave—I advise the Senate that the updated ministry list reflects the updated ministry announced by the Prime Minister on 30 March 2021. Updated representing arrangements are outlined in the ministry list. I seek leave to make a statement regarding ministerial absences.

In Senator Payne's absence today, I will represent the Minister for Foreign Affairs; the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment; the Minister Assisting the Minister for Trade and Investment; the Minister for Defence; the Minister for Defence Industry; the Minister for Veterans' Affairs; and the Minister for Defence Personnel.
