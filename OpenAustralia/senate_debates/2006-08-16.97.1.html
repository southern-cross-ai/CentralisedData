        On behalf of Senator Troeth and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present report No. 12 of 2006, entitled
        <inline font-style="italic">
         Tactical unmanned aerial vehicle facilities project,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
          Gallipoli Barracks
         </a>
         , Enoggera, Queensland
        </inline>
        . I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The statement read as followsâ€”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report examines the proposed works which will support the introduction of the new Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (TUAV) and the establishment of the 20th Surveillance and Tactical Acquisition Regiment at Gallipoli Barracks, Enoggera, Queensland. The estimated cost of the proposed works is $17.45 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence is acquiring the TUAV system to enhance the reconnaissance and surveillance capabilities of deployed land forces. The capability is planned for introduction into service in 2008. Twelve TUAVs, comprising two troops of four air-vehicles each and four spare air-vehicles, will be accommodated in the facilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 20th Surveillance and Tactical Acquisition (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STA" rel="nofollow">
         STA
        </a>
        ) Regiment will be established to operate the TUAVs at Gallipoli Barracks. This Regiment will include both the existing 131st STA Battery, a new 132nd Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Battery and a Combat Service Support Battery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The TUAVs will not be flown from Gallipoli Barracks, but will use existing Defence training areas, such as the Shoalwater Bay Training Area. A flight simulator will be amongst the facilities provided at Enoggera and will be where most of the flight training of operators will be undertaken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed scope for the project will involve:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the construction of three new purpose-built buildings and the refurbishment of one existing building to support the introduction and operation of the new TUAV;
        </li>
        <li>
         the refurbishment of eleven existing buildings and construction of one new building to support the establishment of the 20th STA Regiment, including the existing 131st STA Battery; and
        </li>
        <li>
         the refurbishment and extension of ten existing facilities to support the 25th/49th Battalion Royal Queensland Regiment.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The 20th STA Regiment and the 25th/49th Battalion Royal Queensland Regiment will effectively swap facilities as part of this project. This was shown to be a far more cost effective solution than construction of new facilities on a Greenfield site.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One building is proposed for demolition at the site, a steel portal frame structure containing no hazardous materials. However Defence has discovered some asbestos is the existing 131st STA Battery area and a specialist company has been engaged by Defence to report on how to best contain and remove it and to certify that the area is asbestos free.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence submitted that the newly constructed facilities would include a range of practical environmentally sustainable design initiatives to minimise and measure water and energy consumption. However, as much of the project involves the refurbishment of existing buildings, Defence anticipated that implementing these initiatives in refurbished buildings involved a capital expense that would not be recouped in reduced operating costs for the life of the building.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence will provide space in the facility for use by the Prime TUAV Equipment Contractor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Boeing Australia
        </a>
        . Under its contract, Boeing will provide the installations and be responsible for the fit-out of these areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Office accommodation provided by the project will be designed for maximum flexibility, allowing for future internal churn or change in operational requirements at minimal cost.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the Committee recommends that the Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Facilities Project proceed at the estimated cost of $17.45 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In closing, I wish to thank those who assisted with the inspection and public hearing, my Committee colleagues, and staff.

       <p class="italic">
        I commend the Report to the Senate.
