        My question is to Senator Vanstone, the Minister for Immigration and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        . Does the minister recall her media statement on 1 May 2006 where she announced an increase in the minimum salary for foreign temporary skilled workers? Can the minister confirm the relevant regulations provide for a minimum gross salary of $41,850 per annum but fail to specify a minimum hourly rate? Can the minister also confirm that there is nothing in these regulations to prevent employers from forcing temporary workers to work unreasonable hours in order to earn that minimum salary? Can the minister now provide a guarantee that no 457 visa holders are being forced to work more than 38 ordinary hours per week in order to reach the minimum salary level specified in the regulations?

         Thank you for the question, Senator. As I have explained in this place on a number of occasions, there is a requirement that anyone who comes in on one of these visas is employed under Australian industrial law and is paid a minimum salary of $41,850 or thereabouts, except in regional areas where they may have—and I think this is from regulations that have just gone through this morning—a discount on that of 10 per cent. It is my view that, if someone were working exorbitant hours to earn that—and, as I said before, it is a fair day’s work for a fair day’s pay—the immigration department would regard that as a breach of the conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         I say two further things. If you have any evidence—and we have made this offer to the unions—of any worker being exploited in Australia, you should take that to the appropriate authorities. If that worker is here on a temporary basis, one of the authorities you might care to give the information to is the immigration department. We would be happy to make any investigation in relation to any claims that you bring forward.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Isn’t it the case that there is nothing to stop employers from forcing foreign temporary workers to work unreasonable hours at less than the minimum hourly wage? Does the minister believe that such employers are in breach of the government’s workplace laws? If they are, can the minister also indicate whether she plans to do anything to close this outrageous loophole and when?

             Senator, what I have said to you is that, if you have any evidence of this, come forward and give us the information of a factory that you allege is engaging in this type of behaviour. I have given you a commitment and, if you come forward with that information, that matter will be very promptly investigated. That is what I have told you. Will you give us the information? I will look forward to having your phone call after question time.
