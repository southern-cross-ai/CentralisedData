         The government will be supporting the amendments. The amendments represent longstanding Labor policy and we appreciate the Greens' assistance, and eagerness, in working with us on delivering our policy commitment to tax transparency.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendments remove grandfathering arrangements that exempt certain large proprietary companies from submitting audited annual reports to ASIC. There is no clear economic or policy reason for continuing this exemption. The amendments will remove the exemption, improving transparency and removing an information asymmetry between exempt proprietary companies and their competitors who were not grandfathered. Removal of this was recommended by the Senate Economics References Committee in 2015 and in subsequent reports in 2016 and 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
         We believe there was no clear economic or policy reason for continuing this exemption in 2015, when senators from the Greens political party, I'm advised, voted against the exact same amendments, as moved by Senator Ricky Muir. We appreciate that, in this case, the Greens have decided to change their position and vote in accordance with this amendment. The government, unlike our predecessors, will always stand up for greater transparency and accountability.

           H () (): In regard to Senator McKim's amendments on sheets 1596 and 1597, the opposition won't be supporting these amendments. Specifically, in regard to the amendments on 1596, as I said, the opposition will not be supporting the Greens amendments. The effect of these amendments is to increase red tape on Australian owned companies. By lowering the thresholds, these amendments will equalise the reporting obligations of foreign owned entities and Australian owned entities. The opposition supports reducing red tape and the regulatory burden on Australian companies to support a prosperous and productive economy. For these reasons, as I said, the opposition opposes those amendments.
          </p>
          <p>
           In regard to the amendments on sheet 1597, again, the opposition will not be supporting the Greens amendments. The effect of these amendments is to increase the red tape and compliance burden in the economy. It further removes regulatory certainty for a limited class of companies and constrains the ability of ASIC to make instruments to implement its regulatory decisions. The opposition supports reducing red tape and the regulatory burden on Australian companies to support a prosperous and productive Australian economy. Again, for these reasons, the opposition will oppose the amendments on sheet 1597.

            I didn't speak to the amendments on sheet 1596, because I understand they have been moved together, but I would just put on the record that the government will also support the amendments on sheet 1596. The amendments align with the government's multinational tax transparency election commitments. Transparency is a key factor underpinning the integrity of the tax system. These amendments are a targeted and balanced tax transparency initiative and will provide enhanced public scrutiny on corporate information, which will help to change how corporates view their tax obligations.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would also just say, in conclusion, that it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge former senator Rex Patrick and his support for amendments like this; in fact, I think he moved them to every Treasury law amendment bill under the previous government! So I'm sure that he will be very pleased to see this amendment pass, and I acknowledge the efforts he took to try and put these arrangements in place.
