        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Wong. Thirty thousand Ukrainians are killed or wounded every month in the counteroffensive against the Russian invasion. The wounded are generally driven to the hospital, often in the back of an ordinary car or truck—a delay of hours which medical experts say significantly increases the chances of death or permanent disability. That's why the Ukrainian government needs helicopters for aeromedical evacuation and has asked Australia to donate the Taipans which we've retired. The narrative of the Albanese government that the Taipan fleet is beyond repair was demonstrated to be inaccurate by photos published last week which show the majority of the fleet in hangars in Townsville, largely intact and subsequently confirmed as being airworthy. Minister, why is the government so intent on digging a hole and burying these airworthy helicopters, rather than helping to save Ukrainian lives?

         I respect Senator Fawcett's involvement and engagement during the time in which he served the nation and also his service on the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Joint Committee. I know with what great sincerity he means that question. He would know that we have had bipartisan support for Ukraine since Russia's illegal and immoral invasion. He would know that in opposition the Labor Party supported the then government's position on Ukraine and that in government we have continued to provide support to Ukraine, including the training of personnel. I think I've said in this chamber that possibly one of the most moving visits I have made has been to the location in the United Kingdom where Ukrainian troops are being trained by Australians and by British and other defence forces. You meet people who were postal workers and farmers and clerks, who are prepared to die for their country. So we share his concern about this.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm advised in relation to the Taipans that the Taipan has been managed as a project of concern by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Defence
         </a>
         since 2011. The senator would know of the tragic crash which saw the loss of Australian lives in July and the fact that the government announced in September 2023 that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRH" rel="nofollow">
          MRH
         </a>
         -90 would not return to flying operations. I'm advised that Defence received a request from the ambassador of Ukraine and that, by this date, the helicopters had already been subject to extensive disassembly. This decision has been communicated to the ambassador.

           Minister, I and the Ukrainian government appreciate the support of both sides of the chamber. But the reality is Ukraine first expressed an interest in using the Taipans—for casualty evacuation—during a meeting that I held with them at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
            NATO
           </a>
           conference in October last year, and I made sure your government was advised of that interest before I even left Copenhagen to return to Australia. Minister, why didn't the Albanese government even bother to pick up the phone to consult the Ukrainians before deciding on a plan to just dig a hole and bury the helicopters?

            As I understand it, on all occasions in relation to these matters the government has acted on the basis of advice from Defence. The advice I have is that the advice from Defence was clear that this was not the right platform for Ukraine, and Defence and the government made decisions on that basis.

              Minister, I think the Ukrainians are well placed to decide what platform will keep their soldiers alive. And, Minister, now that the government has a formal request from Ukraine and it has been established that a number of the helicopters remain airworthy in Townsville, will the Albanese government reverse its decision and denote the aircraft, even in their current state, to allow Ukraine to work with its
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
               NATO

              partners, who continue to safely operate the same type of helicopter, to establish an aeromedical capability to save the lives of their people?

               In relation to this issue, we will continue to take advice from Defence about the best way forward in relation to this platform. But, also, I would make the broader point that the government continues to keep under review the nature and breadth of the assistance to Ukraine.

               Before I ask that further questions be placed on notice, I wonder if the Senate would indulge me. I'm pleased to inform the Senate that present in the gallery today are a number of journalists from across South-East Asia who are visiting Australia ahead of the
