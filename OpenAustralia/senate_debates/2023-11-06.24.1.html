        Many in the chamber will have heard about yesterday's tragedy at the Daylesford Royal Hotel. I'd like to join the Prime Minister, local member
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_King" rel="nofollow">

        and all who have expressed their condolences to the families and the Daylesford community. I know our thoughts here in the Senate, too, are first and foremost with the families and friends of those who lost their lives—including children—with those who are injured and with the entire community. Many Australians will be shocked and saddened by what happened overnight. It was a tragedy that occurred right in the heart of town, in what should have been a moment of joy—a time when the community was together for Victoria's long weekend and a time when families were celebrating and enjoying each other's company. Instead, tragedy has irrevocably changed the lives of many families, friends and community members. I want to thank our brave first responders, including the

        , the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance_Victoria" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who were on the scene as always. Your commitment to serving our communities during some of our darkest moments is nothing short of exceptional. I also want to thank those community members who, without hesitation, offered their assistance before the first responders could arrive. You have shown us the best of Australia and deserve our deep gratitude. Words often feel inadequate in tragedies like these, but it's important that we do come together. Daylesford is a small, warm-hearted, close-knit community, and this tragedy will have a profound impact. Families are in grief. Communities are in pain. And I know all Australians across the country send you strength and support today and will do so in the days to come.
