        </a>
        and very recently promoted Manager of Government Business in the Senate, and as this is my first question to him in that new promoted role I would like to congratulate him on his promotion. I refer the minister to the comments of Mr Dominic Greco, head of the Convenience and Mixed Business Association who is reported in last weekend's

        </i>
        as saying, 'Right now small business feels extremely neglected,' and noting the minister's interest in business. Given that the Rudd-Gillard government has had four ministers for small business in less than five years—and with the announcement yester­day of this minister's imminent resignation, which we are all terribly disappointed about, it brings the total to five in less than five years—when will the government gets its act together and provide a consistent and stable policy foundation for the 2.7 million small businesses in Australia?

         I thank Senator Joyce for the question. It is great to see finally the Liberal Party or the National Party here asking a question on small business, actually coming to the Senate chamber and asking a question about policy, and I am very happy to answer it. Yesterday I outlined some of the work that Labor is doing on small business. The stimulus package was all about small business and all those tradesmen and tradeswomen, those jobs on those construction sites, all the multiplier effects to those other small businesses—the takeaway shops, the petrol stations, the supermarkets—and guess what: Senator Joyce voted against it. He voted against the stimulus package. Is it a surprise that the National Party voted against small business? No, it is not. Is it a surprise that every Liberal Party senator came in and voted against small business? No, it is not. This is the modern coalition. The coalition that used to be so committed to small business has walked away from small business. Not only did they oppose the stimulus package but also they have opposed tax cuts for small business. Let us just get this straight.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
          The Liberal Party

         and the National Party oppose tax cuts for small business that will come out of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
          MRRT
         </a>
         , the minerals resource rent tax, on 1 July this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         If Senator Joyce has any commitment to small business, he will come into this chamber, he will support the minerals resource rent tax and he will provide a tax cut for small business; otherwise, anything he says on small business has no credibility whatsoever. The Liberal Party and the National Party have walked away from their traditional constituency. They have no idea anymore what it takes to run a small business. They have no idea what it takes in terms of cash flow. The accelerated depreciation allowance will provide assets for small businesses up to a $6,500 write-off. Guess what—the Liberals are voting against it.

          , for a man with such passion it is such a shame to see him go. For my supplementary question, I refer the minister to the fact that most small businesses would not benefit from the government's planned cut in the company tax rate, given that most of them are not companies. How much of the government's $10.6 billion that it expects to raise from the mining tax over the forward estimates will be spent to assist small businesses, and will this be limited to only incorporated small businesses?

            Please let me answer this because they want the answer. There are 720,000 businesses that are incorporated in this country and they will benefit from the tax cut. But, at the same time as that, every business will benefit from the depreciation allowance; every business will benefit from the assets that they undertake.

            will benefit from a tripling of the tax threshold. They will get the tax cut as well.

             So recently promoted, so passionate, yet leaving—it is such a shame. As a further supplementary question, I refer to the fact that over the past year more than 10,000 small businesses have collapsed, an increase of over nine per cent from the previous year. The carbon tax will place increased pressure on small businesses this year in an already tough economic environment. How much of the government's $9 billion in industry assistance allocated under its clean energy package will specifically go to small businesses?

              If the National Party and the Liberal Party want to do something for small business, then they should vote to give them a tax cut. It is amazing that the modern Liberal Party are opposing tax cuts for small business.
