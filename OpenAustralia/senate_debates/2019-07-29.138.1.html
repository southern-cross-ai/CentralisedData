          When the inquiry into

           PFAS
          </a>
          contamination handed down its report in this parliament about seven months ago I did urge the government to take concrete action and not leave communities hanging for many months. It is really disappointing that they have not swiftly responded to the recommendations of the report, which are really so important to so many people. This is an extremely serious issue that affects thousands of people across the country, including in my home state of

          base.
         </p>
         <p>
          PFAS contamination has caused significant mental, emotional and financial stress for people, and it's simply not fair for the government to not make its responses to the recommendations clear as soon as possible. The government shouldn't string people along. There is a need to show them the respect that they deserve. They really have waited long enough.

             and the German government have found high levels of PFAS are toxic for reproduction and development of the human fetus, with probable links to serious conditions, including testicular and kidney cancer. PFAS contamination has been found at

            <p>
             The foam can seep deep into groundwater, forming a plume that moves beyond the source and into surrounding houses and farms. Residents can be contaminated from drinking the water, coming into contact with the soil or eating food grown or raised in their own soil in these so-called red zones. Residents around some of these bases have elevated levels of PFAS in their blood. The residents are living a nightmare, not just worrying about their own health and the health of their kids but trapped in houses that they can't sell. I support Senator Faruqi's motion and call on the government to maintain its promise to the people of Oakey, to release this report and to get on with fixing the mess.
