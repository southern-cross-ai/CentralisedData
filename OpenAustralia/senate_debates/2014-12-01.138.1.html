         by leave—I move:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         That the Senate take note of the document.
        </p>
        <p>
         From the outset, I thank the minister for tabling the interim reports—at least I hope that is what you have tabled, Minister—of the National Mental Health Commission's inquiry into the provision of mental health services in our country. But it is disappointing that the only way that the community has been able to read these reports is through the order of production of documents that was passed by the Senate last week on my motion. I have repeatedly requested that the interim reports of this important inquiry be published, along with the submissions—not the individual submissions from consumers, but the submissions from organisations, states and territories where approval has been sought and given.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Mental Health Commission is a well regarded organisation. It was established by the former government and while it has not been there for a very long time, it has done some really important work to ensure that there is a voice and a place for a voice for people living with mental illness in our country. It has been tasked with this important inquiry. The National Mental Health Commission has a reputation for being inclusive, of being able to consult openly and honestly not only with people who are living with mental illness but also with the mental health service sector and states and territories. So it has been somewhat troubling that this review has been undertaken in quite a secretive manner.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have said before, and I will say it again today: I do not criticise the government for undertaking this review—it is reasonable for an incoming government to take stock of a policy area, and this government has done so when it comes to mental health—but it has been disappointing that an opportunity for an open, transparent dialogue about mental health policies, programs and services has not been grasped. We have an opportunity in this country to do the right thing in terms of services, policies and programs for people living with mental health. It is a difficult and complex policy area—I do not shy away from that—but the way we will get to a position where we have the right policy settings is being able to include and have people, particularly people living with mental illness but also service providers, travelling along the road together. This is the only way we will find the answer to the appropriate policy settings for mental health services in the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         I certainly hope that this does not end up a demarcation dispute between states and territories and the Commonwealth about who is responsible for which bit of mental health. There does need to be clarity in what we do. The former government's road map for mental health services and the big investment we made in government must not be dissipated. We must not take our foot off the pedal when it comes to mental health services in our country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minister Birmingham, I am unsure what you have tabled today. I understand it is the first interim report and the second interim report—and, if you could nod, that would be fantastic. If that is what has been tabled today, I will also be requesting the government to table the report that was promised to be handed to government last Friday, at the end of November. Everyone in this policy game needs to know what everyone else is saying so we can have an open and honest conversation about what we should do to provide services for people living with mental illness.
        </p>
        <p>
         If that report has not been tabled today, I will use the structures of the Senate, if required, to ensure that the third report, the final report, of the commission's inquiry into mental health services in the country be tabled and be tabled in a timely way. Given that the government received that report only last Friday, I do not expect it to be tabled today—it would be lovely if it were. But in good time I expect the government to publish the final report of the inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
         In conclusion, I thank the government for adhering to the Senate's order for the production of documents. We might have to use this method in the future to ensure transparency of this government.
