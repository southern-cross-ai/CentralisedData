        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Competitiveness and the Minister for Defence, Senator Bob Carr. I refer the minister to my unanswered questions of 1 November regarding the government's cancellation of its long-intended purchase of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea

        's

        </a>
        17 self-propelled howitzer.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I refer to the minister's assurance about his 'cordial' conversation with Korean foreign minister Kim when I asked whether the government's decision would have diplomatic, trade or commercial fallout for Australia, given the Korean government's closeness to its defence industry. Are free trade agreement negotiations with South Korea now stalled because the capricious cancellation of this purchase prompted Korea to increase its insistence on the inclusion in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
         FTA
        </a>
        of investor-state dispute resolution clauses to mitigate against exactly this sort of sovereign risk? Will the minister answer the parts of my question that he took notice on 1 November?

         I am very grateful for the question because I did deceive the house when I gave that answer about the impact of this cancellation. I referred to one conversation I had with foreign minister Kim of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          South Korea
         </a>
         . I mentioned that in that cordial conversation, held only days before I answered the question in the Senate, he had not raised the question of this contract. It was not as full and, I confess, as honest an answer as I might have given. I neglected—

         Was that an interjection? I neglected to draw the attention of the Senate to no fewer than four other conversations with the foreign minister of South Korea where the matter had not been raised with him. One of them was when he came here to Canberra, three or four months ago I would say, for bilateral discussions. The matter did not figure in those discussions.

          , I rise on a point of order, on relevance. I asked the minister about the investor-state dispute resolution clauses, which he is yet to refer to in his answer. I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the question and have him respond appropriately.

            The point about investor-state dispute resolution is that it is only one of several issues to be resolved. Other outstanding issues include, for example, the terms of access for Australian agricultural product. Should that be disregarded? Should we not persist in talking about terms of access for agricultural products? Is that the view of the National Party, that this should not be a concern of the Australian government? On the contrary; it is the view of the Australian trade minister that that should be pursued.

             17 self-propelled howitzer project, is it no surprise that the Koreans are insisting on the inclusion of the investor-state dispute resolution clauses in the free trade agreement to protect their industries from the sovereign risk of dealing with the Australian government? Is this derailment of the free trade agreement negotiations now jeopardising Australia's $770 million beef export market to Korea?

                 When all allowances are made that this is the end of the parliamentary session, it has been an exhausting week, the questions have been used and misused and it has been a tactical disaster for those opposite for two or three sitting weeks—a tactical disaster—and that we know that oppositions get to the bottom of the barrel towards the last sitting days, I cannot help the honourable senator. I have no idea whether Mr

                        . The minister was quite reasonably responding to the nature of what was an absolutely ridiculous question talking about parliamentary friendship associations in relation to
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
                         South Korea

                        , and any suggested role of Mr Thomson is absolutely ludicrous. Unfortunately, Senator Macdonald shows again, as have other senators in the last couple of days in this end of session, that they simply cannot hear what is occurring in the chamber.
