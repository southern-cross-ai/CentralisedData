        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Aged Care, Senator Farrell. It was reported this week that a further 16 residential aged-care facilities have been forced to close over the last four months. This means that at least 47 aged-care facilities have shut down since September last year as a result of the rigid requirements for staffing that your government has imposed on the sector amid a serious workforce crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, how many more aged-care facilities have to close down with residents forced out of their homes before the Albanese government takes action to support the sector, including by expanding the exemption criteria for these staffing requirements?

         I thank Senator Ruston for her question. I start by completely rejecting the proposition that you're suggesting that this government is not doing anything in respect of aged care. Like so many issues that this government inherited from the previous government—and Senator Colbeck is looking very sad over there because you'll remember all of this, Senator Colbeck, the neglect. What was the one word that we remembered from your period in government? It's the word 'neglect' in this space. We are putting dignity and respect at the centre of aged care for both residents and workers.

                   Minister, research has found that Australia is facing a shortfall of 16,000 registered nurses and 25,000 allied health workers in the aged-care sector by 2033. This comes at a time when your government has brought forward additional requirements for aged-care staffing. Can you guarantee that no more aged-care homes will be forced to close as a result of your government's actions?

                     I thank Senator Ruston for her first supplementary question. You have got a cheek, Senator Ruston, for asking that question. When did these shortages start? They started under your government, and, like so many things that we've inherited from the former government, we are left with the problem of fixing it up. One way we can fix this problem is by increasing the status of work in this very important area.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     How have we done that? Well, we've said to the workers in this industry, 'We're going to give you a wage rise.' Hopefully, that will start the process of restoring the status of workers in this industry and giving them a fair deal.

                       It's also been reported this week that significant challenges faced by the sector under your government have resulted in an overall reduction in aged-care beds of 325 over the last four months. This is happening at a time when demand for aged care is expected to increase, with the minister herself consistently warning that the boomers are coming. Minister, can you guarantee that aged-care places will not continue to decrease under your government?

                         Senator McKenzie, I can't be the only boomer in this room. Surely there must be some other boomers still around the place. But this government is not just looking after boomers in aged care. We're going to be a government for so long that we'll even be looking after the Gen Zs and the millennials, and we are going to restore this industry. On that note, I would request that further questions be put on the
