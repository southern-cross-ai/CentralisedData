        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the recommendation on page 4 of Report 2/2006 of the Committee of Senators’ Interests be adopted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report of the Senators’ Interests Committee on its review of arrangements for registration of senators’ interests was presented out of sitting on 6 April 2006. It represents the culmination of some intense work by the committee, starting with our decision last year to survey our colleagues about the system for registering interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the comments and responses of our colleagues, the committee has revised the forms for registering senators’ interests. Most of the changes are minor and cosmetic, but the committee’s intention was to make it as easy as possible for senators to comply with their obligations under the resolutions. There are more examples and more guidance provided on the forms themselves. We have also reviewed the explanatory notes and clarified one or two matters raised with the committee in recent times. For example, in relation to self-managed superannuation funds, the notes make it clear that shareholdings by such entities are included as registrable interests where the senator or their spouse or partner is able to exercise control over the right to vote or dispose of those shares. The committee has also published the administrative procedures for the maintenance of the register, which I draw to senators’ attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The main issue considered by the committee, however, was whether we should recommend an amendment to the resolutions to take into account the issue raised with the committee by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Procedure Committee
        </a>
        and also alluded to in the survey—namely, whether the time for notifying alterations of interests should be increased from 28 days to make it easier for senators whose interests involve regular share trading to comply fully with the resolutions. As senators will know, there have been some problems experienced in this area in recent times. After much deliberation, the committee has recommended extending the time frame for notifying all alterations, not just share trading, by one week from 28 to 35 days. This is the subject of the motion I have moved this afternoon.
       </p>
       <p>
        In moving this motion, it is not my intention that the Senate should vote today on whether to adopt the committee’s recommendation. At the end of my contribution I intend to seek leave to continue my remarks so that this matter will remain on the

        </i>
        until the next occasion on which the Senate considers orders of the day relating to committee reports and government responses on a Thursday afternoon. Depending on the demands of the Senate program, this may occur in June or it may not occur until the spring sittings. The new forms and the revised explanatory notes have taken effect already. The time frame change is subject to the approval of the Senate. I urge all senators to read the report and keep copies handy for reference. All the information is also readily available on the committee’s website. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
