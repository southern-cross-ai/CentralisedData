        I seek leave to make a clarification in relation to an answer I gave in question time today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        In question time today I indicated to an opposition senator that the limitation for the minimum salary level for 457 visas being based on a 38-hour week had gone to the Governor-General yesterday. I gave that advice on the basis of an email that was received in my office at 1.26 pm today. It is every minister’s dream—or I should say ‘nightmare’—to get subsequent advice during question time! Anyway, that is what happened.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were 457 visa regulations that went to Exco yesterday. I know that because I was there. That is how I know that Dr Marie Bashir is the acting Governor-General. However, those regulations do not relate to the 38-hour week basis being made crystal clear. That will be done by a
        <i>
         Gazette
        </i>
        notice, which is in my office. The regulations that went to the Governor-General yesterday are a further indication—and I might take the opportunity of indicating what they are about—in relation to the minimum salary level to make sure that the maximum number of people can get advantage from the increase. I regret misadvising the Senate.
