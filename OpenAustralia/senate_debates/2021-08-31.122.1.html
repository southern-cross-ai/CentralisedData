        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is the Australian Government (the Government) Response to the Joint Select Committee's (the Committee) report on Road Safety — Improving Road Safety in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 31 July 2020 the Committee released its interim report, noting that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, further time was required to consider evidence gathered during hearings and from submissions. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Report" rel="nofollow">
         Final Report
        </a>
        was published on 30 October 2020 and contains 22 recommendations to improve road safety.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has a responsibility, collectively with state and territory governments, for the strategic direction and implementation of national road safety policy and actions. The Government has a guiding and influencing role in road safety and established the Office of Road Safety (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ORS" rel="nofollow">
         ORS
        </a>
        ) in July 2019, with the aim of improving coordination and leadership across all levels of government. While many of the levers for road safety are controlled by the states and territories, the Government is responsible for developing the National Road Safety Strategy with all states and territories and supporting its implementation; funding infrastructure investment aimed at delivering road safety outcomes; and regulating first imports of vehicles into the country. The National Road Safety Strategy 2021-30 (Strategy) and its Action Plan for 2021-2025 are expected to be released in the coming months, subject to jurisdictional approval processes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        State and territory Ministers agreed in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August" rel="nofollow">
         August
        </a>
        2019, through the former Transport and Infrastructure Council (Council), that the new Strategy would position Australia towards a 'Vision Zero' Target, with no person being killed or seriously injured from a road crash, by 2050.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Council also agreed in order to be successful in reducing road trauma over the decade, the Strategy must reach beyond traditional transport solutions and that road safety can no longer be viewed solely as a transport issue. To achieve this, Council agreed to adopt a social model approach to extend road safety opportunities into other sectors such as health and social services, law enforcement, education, justice, planning and industry, all of which will underpin the Action Plans supporting the new Strategy. A social model approach will allow the Strategy to reach beyond the areas that have traditionally coordinated road safety outcomes and foster a shift in road safety culture across Australian society to promote road safety as everyone's responsibility.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of the Committee's recommendations relate to areas where implementation and delivery is primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments. Where the Government has a national coordination role in delivering road safety outcomes, these are outlined in this response.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government response addresses the Committee's 22 recommendations in the Final Report.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        List of Recommendations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee supports the findings of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRSS" rel="nofollow">
          NRSS
         </a>
         Inquiry Report which
        </i>
        <i>
         recommended
        </i>
        <i>
         that the Australian government commit more funding to road safety.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports an increase of funding by all governments towards improving road safety, as recommended by the Inquiry into the National Road Safety Strategy 2011-20
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (NRSS Inquiry). This was agreed in principle by Council in November 2019. In response the Government has since made significant funding commitments that will deliver road safety outcomes in major cities and regional and remote areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Improving road safety to help Australia move towards zero fatalities and serious injuries on our roads by 2050 is a top priority of the Government and a key objective of the 10-year $110 billion land transport infrastructure program. The program is providing life-saving upgrades to roads and highways, including key freight routes, and safer and more efficient heavy vehicle operations. Investment in land transport infrastructure as well as targeted road safety packages are supporting the delivery of the Government's commitment to road safety.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of the 2020-21 Budget the Government committed significant additional funding to improve road safety, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        An additional $1 billion to continue road safety upgrades through the Road Safety Program in 2022­2023 was announced in the 2021-22 Budget. In addition to the Road Safety Program and Data Hub initiative, the Government funds a total of $77.7 million over four years of non-infrastructure road safety projects/programs. In June 2020, announced the $500 million Targeted Road Safety Works Program to deliver smaller but critical projects to improve road safety and bolster the resilience of local road networks in every state and territory.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee recommends the Australian Government work with the states and territories to develop a plan and timeline for the harmonisation of data, including definitions, relating to casualty crashes, road safety ratings, and speeding across the ne
        </i>
        <i>
         twork. Such data should be published regularly.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports the harmonisation of road safety data, including developing consistent definitions and the regular publishing of data.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While consistent national data is available for road crash deaths, there is currently no national data source to report on the agreed national measure of serious injury. The Government and jurisdictions are pursuing a national project linking hospital and crash data to develop a consistent national source of serious injury data to allow measurement of progress against agreed serious injury targets in the new Strategy. To further support consistent data, the Government is investing $5.5 million over four years to establish a National Road Safety Data Hub, providing transparent monitoring and evaluation of road safety policies and investments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further, state and territory governments have also agreed, as part of the new National Partnership Agreement on Land Transport Infrastructure Projects (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NPA" rel="nofollow">
         NPA
        </a>
        ), on a greater focus on data sharing between jurisdictions for project data including on-road safety. State and territory governments when seeking Commonwealth funding are expected to outline safety benefits in their project proposal reporting templates, including the average annual number of avoided crashes, number of avoided serious injuries, and number of avoided fatalities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        State and territory governments are also required to report key data to the Government as a condition of receiving funding through the $3 billion Road Safety Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee recommends that the Australian Government review its
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_Program" rel="nofollow">
          Black Spot Program
         </a>
         funding conditions and site eligibility, with a view to making it more effective in proactively detecting and treating deficiencies i
        </i>
        <i>
         n road infrastructure.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Black Spot Program is already able to fund projects that treat road lengths in addition to 'spot' locations, and up to 30 per cent of program funds are available for investment in proactive projects where there is an assessed risk that fatal and serious crashes are likely to occur. Additionally, the Black Spot Program allows the Minister to consider proactive/Road Safety Audit proposals above the 30 per cent threshold if recommended by the Black Spot Consultative Panel in the relevant state or territory. These panels are established in each jurisdiction to review project proposals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Notes" rel="nofollow">
         The Notes
        </a>
        on Administration for Land Transport Infrastructure Projects — which guide the administration of the Infrastructure Investment Program — were amended in August 2019 to expand the types of risk assessments accepted for proactive nominations, including the Australian Road Assessment Program (AusRAP) and the Australian National Risk Assessment Model (ANRAM).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ORS will work with all governments to better communicate the proactive aspect built into the Black Spot Program to ensure a better understanding of the opportunities provided for within the Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the $3 billion Road Safety Program will make a significant contribution to proactively detecting and treating deficiencies in road infrastructure. State and territory governments are required to report key data to the Government as a condition of funding through the Program, which will assist in assessing road safety outcomes of the investment and identifying further areas for improvement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee recommends that the
        </i>
        <i>
         Australian Government increase funding to the Black Spot Program and increase the percentage allocated to regional and remote
        </i>
        <i>
         areas.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation, and highlights the additional funding recently announced with provisions in place to increase the percentage allocated to regional and remote areas where necessary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has committed $110 billion for land transport infrastructure investment over the next ten years. In the 2019-20 Budget the Government committed $2.2 billion for the Local and State Government Road Safety Package, which provided additional funding for roads programs. This funding included an additional $50 million per year for the Black Spot Program, bringing the funding for the Program to $110 million per year. The Government's total commitment for the Black Spot Program from 2013-14 to 2024-25 is $1.2 billion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A greater proportion of funding for regional and remote areas may be approved should such funding levels be recommended by the Black Spot Consultative Panels.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee recommends that the Australian Government works with states and territories and local government to ensure that all existing road safety programs are designed to implement Safe System principles across al
        </i>
        <i>
         l government policy areas, including health and education.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports implementing Safe System principles through existing road safety programs in coordination with state and territory governments. This was agreed upon by Council in November 2019 in response to the NRSS Inquiry (2018) recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Council agreed to adopt a social model approach underpinning the Action Plans that will support the Strategy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NPA supports delivery of infrastructure projects and sets out how the different levels of government will work together to deliver infrastructure projects for the benefit and wellbeing of Australians. Well-designed land transport infrastructure, including improved transport safety, is essential for Australia's productivity and economic development to support prosperous and liveable communities. The NPA enshrines road safety as a key, shared objective of the Government and state governments. The NPA ensures new road infrastructure projects give regard to the Safe System principles, which also underpin the Strategy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ORS was established to improve leadership and coordination across all levels of government to reduce deaths and serious injuries on the roads. Using a social model approach, ORS is engaging Australian Government portfolios beyond the areas that have traditionally coordinated road safety outcomes to become key enablers of change and advocates for road safety, facilitated through the Commonwealth Inter-Departmental Committee on Road Safety.

        The Department of Health and ORS are also working closely together in the preparation of the National Road Safety Strategy, the National Injury Prevention Strategy and other initiatives to further align targets and cross-Government work on road safety issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The committee recommends that the commonwealth works with states and territories to ensure that funding avenues are identified that specifically support local councils to attract and reta
        </i>
        <i>
         in the relevant skills and expertise required for development of all aspects of road safety policy, infrastructure and maintenance.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports in-principle this recommendation noting there are constitutional limitations for direct funding by the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As owners of an extensive road network, local governments are responsible for the road safety performance of roads under their control and authority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The responsibility for development of all aspects of road safety policy, infrastructure and maintenance is shared by state, territory and Federal governments. State and territory governments are responsible for implementation of the Local Government Acts as well as supporting - through Austroads and other mechanisms - the delivery of training to assist in the development of road safety risk assessments and local government road safety network plans. As local governments have no status within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Constitution
        </a>
        , funding from the Government is often provided through grants such as the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRCI" rel="nofollow">
         LRCI
        </a>
        ) or directed through state and territory governments who often provide assistance through their road safety manager responsibilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently over 600 major Government funded road infrastructure projects are in planning, underway, or under construction, many of which will deliver road safety benefits. Work is being undertaken by all levels of government to deliver these projects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The $500 million Targeted Road Safety Works package, announced in June 2020, is delivering smaller but critical projects to improve road safety and is bolstering the resilience of local road networks in every state and territory.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, in May 2020 the Government announced the LRCI Program providing $500 million to support local councils to deliver priority local road and community infrastructure projects in the 2020-21 financial year. Through the 2020-21 Budget, the Government committed an additional $1 billion to this program for works to continue in 2021-22, and a further $1 billion to continue road safety upgrades through the Road Safety Program in 2022-2023 was announced in the 2021-22 Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2018, the Government committed $2.55 million to the Australian Road Research Board (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARRB" rel="nofollow">
         ARRB
        </a>
        ) to assist local governments to better understand, and deliver on, their road asset and maintenance requirements. Completed in June 2020, the funding delivered updates to three operational manuals for sealed and unsealed roads and bridge structures and a new manual focused on road base materials. The program also delivered specialised optics devices which is enabling local road managers to assess the condition of road infrastructure to enable better performance assessment and optimise maintenance activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2019-20 budget, the Australian Government allocated $8 million over two years to the Strategic Local Government Asset Assessment Project (SLGAAP), which is administered by the National Heavy Vehicle Regulator (NVHR) on behalf of the Australian Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The SLGAAP assists local government road managers across Australia to undertake capacity assessments of bridges and culverts on key heavy vehicle routes to help them better understand the safe operating limits of road infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The NHVR has so far delivered more than 230 asset assessments across twelve local governments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Due to the successes of the pilot program, the Australian Government announced in the 2021-22 budget an additional $12.1 million over three years for SLGAAP. Strong participant interest has seen more than 90 local governments register approximately 900 assets across the nation to be assessed over the next three years.
       </p>

The Government notes this recommendation may result in an additional requirement for learners and significantly increase the cost of licensing, becoming a further barrier to those already disadvantaged in obtaining a licence.
