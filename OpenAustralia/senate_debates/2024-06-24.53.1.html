          And I hear the interjections on that side about why that's a bad idea. They really don't learn, do they? That you want to come in here and talk about cheaper energy bills after you have opposed energy price relief is really galling to Australians. You can't pretend that you care about cost of living if you're not prepared to back in the policies that are about dealing with people's cost-of-living pressures. That's the reality.
         </p>
         <p>
          From the experts it is clear that renewables are the cheapest form of new energy, far cheaper than the nuclear fantasy that you are adopting—an expensive plan which will ensure more delays, less supply in the interim and higher costs for Australians. That's what it means.
         </p>
         <p>
          What I would say to those opposite is that you trashed the energy system as a consequence of 22 policies in government, where 24 out of 28—

             Thank you, Senator Duniam. I am happy to draw the minister back to the question, but I will also remind senators that, if you interject, the senator—whoever is answering—is entitled to take those interjections, and there were lots of interjections, which Minister Wong also addressed, which she's entitled to do.

              As I said, there's a $300 energy bill rebate to every household and additional energy relief to small businesses. But I would say this: what we know is that under those opposite 24 out of 28 coal-fired power stations announced closures. How many people sought to enter the system? Almost zilch, if any. Do you know why? It was because your division and your inaction and your internal fights and your anti-renewables obsession made sure that the market had no certainty. It had no certainty, and—do you know what?—you're still at it.

                 I'll take the interjection from Senator Ruston, who says, 'They'll just use taxpayers' money to subsidise bills,' because she's still opposed to the bill relief. It's amazing, isn't it? They just don't learn. You're prepared to spend billions of dollars on nuclear over 20 years, but you don't want working Australians to get cost relief on their bills. What sorts of priorities does the Liberal Party have? What has happened to the Liberal Party?

                  The Liberal Party
                 </a>
                 is the party that wants to subsidise an expensive technology which will deliver in 20 years but wants to fight tooth and nail against giving $300 to Australian families and Australian households. It says something about your priorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We on this side are very clear. We will ensure that we continue to transform this system in accordance with the best advice and not engage in the ideological wars that you are engaged in that increase costs for Australians.
