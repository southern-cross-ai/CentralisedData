        I rise to speak about an amazing organisation from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        called Reach Her. I had the absolute pleasure of meeting with Maryann Tsai, the founder. Reach Her is an incredible organisation. It's a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        social enterprise based in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         South Perth
        </a>
        that seeks to support and empower women from diverse backgrounds to improve their confidence and wellbeing and helps to create a sense of belonging by helping them gain entry to employment through education and training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Talking to Maryann about her motivation, I learned about her family's immigration story. She witnessed her parents struggle with language barriers and finding stable and secure work. It is a story shared by my family. My father faced struggles at work, including discrimination and mistreatment, and I saw that experience reflected in the lives of many workers during my time as a union organiser.
       </p>
       <p>
        This experience can be compounded by other factors, including gender, and that's why the work of Reach Her is so important. Reach Her offers connection, collaboration and support for women. The education and training programs provide a safe environment for women to build their confidence and skills. There are projects that give women real-life experience, and workshops on business training and wellbeing. One example is the hospitality program Reach Her operates, through the store espresso cafeâ€”a commercial kitchen and cafe facility that educates, upskills and provides work experience and employment opportunities. When it comes to the safety of women, their financial wellbeing is an important factor. We know that financial abuse is too common.
       </p>
       <p>
        The work of Reach Her is important to help empower women, and it is great to see it happening in WA. I want to thank Maryann Tsai for meeting with me and sharing her story and for the amazing work she's doing.
