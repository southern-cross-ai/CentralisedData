        I rise this evening to pay tribute to Clifford Hocking AM, who passed away on Monday, 12 June. He was a shining light in the development of artistic culture in Australia, and his life was devoted to nurturing and supporting Australian and international talent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clifford Henry Hocking was born in Melbourne on 9 February 1932 to Olive and Fred Hocking. The youngest of five boys, he grew up in Eaglemont and, from an early age, showed an avid interest in music and books. He spent his early working life at the ABC, then travelled to Europe, Lebanon and India, returning home to set up a record store, Thomas’s, in Exhibition Street, Melbourne, which he ran until 1961. Back in London, he met up with a young Australian actor who was finishing a

        </a>
        run of
        <i>
         Oliver!
        </i>
        and wondering what to do next. Hocking suggested a one-man show back in Australia. Between 1962 and 1969,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Humphries" rel="nofollow">
         Barry Humphries
        </a>
        performed his first one-man shows in three national tours under Clifford Hocking’s management.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1965, Clifford joined forces with business partner David Vigo and, in the words of Michael Shmith of the
        <i>
         Age
        </i>
        , ‘redefined concert presentations and repertoire in Australia’. Over the next 40 years, under the Hocking-Vigo banner, audiences were presented with more than 160 tours of musical groups and more than 40 theatrical productions in 10 different countries. The list of artists is very impressive. It included the

        In 1990, he was made a member of the Order of Australia, in 1991 he was awarded the first Kenneth Myer Medallion for the

        We will never know the full extent of Clifford Hocking’s contribution. To quote again from the tribute in the
        <i>
         Age
        </i>
        , Clifford was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … such a part of the city’s cultural life that people are finding it hard to believe that he has left the stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        …         …           …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was inspirational to at least three generations of arts practitioners.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clifford Hocking was a man with the courage of his convictions, an extraordinary breadth of knowledge, strong business acumen and the profound and intuitive ability to tap into the human spirit and its potential. He was known for having the best address book in the business. He will also be remembered for his towering intellect, his devastating wit, his inspirational prose, his larger than life personality, his insatiable curiosity, and the love of all the good things in life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Forty-five years of extraordinary artistic discoveries is a record simply unparalled in the arts scene in Australia. We bid farewell to one of the finest and possibly the last of the great international impresarios. This is indeed a great loss to the arts community. My daughter, Nathalie Kemp, worked with him for a period of time and was a great admirer of his work. I am sure that all senators join with me in marking the moment in remembering Clifford Hocking.
