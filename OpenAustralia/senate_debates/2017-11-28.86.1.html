        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. The minister yesterday told the Senate that 'flirting with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        is poison for my side of politics'. Why then did the Prime Minister fail to follow former Prime Minister Howard's lead and prevent the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        from preferencing One Nation in 49 seats at Saturday's election?

          Point of order: I know Senator Brandis is very upset about the result, but my question related to preferences and the decision of his party to preference

           On the point of order, I can't direct the minister how to answer the question. I remind him, as Senator Wong just did, of the question itself. The minister has a minute and 14 seconds remaining.

            Senator Wong, for someone who is in government in Queensland today through
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
             One Nation
            </a>
            preferences, I think you are the last person to be asking that question. In particular, as I pointed out to you yesterday, Senator Wong, it's all very well what your public position may have been, but what the position of your booth workers was throughout Queensland was to whisper into the ears of voters, 'Put the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
             LNP
            </a>
            last; vote One Nation before you vote LNP.' That's what they said.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to preferences, no deals were done. No deals were done between the LNP and the One Nation party. They shouldn't have been and they weren't. In relation to the events of 1998, which you appear to be referencing, Senator Wong, I was a member of the Liberal Party executive in 1998, and I can tell you that the historical observation you've made is inaccurate.

               Well, Senator Wong, no, he does not. And as you perfectly well know if you had seen his observations yesterdayâ€”which, of course, you didâ€”he is of the opposite view. He is of the opposite view. And, Senator Wong, I think it shames you, if I may say so. I think it really shames you, Senator Wong, that you would make that insinuation against the Prime Minister, of all people, whose views on this matter could not be more clear.
