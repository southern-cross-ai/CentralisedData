         In one word, and then I will explain why, the answer very simply is no. Let me explain to you the laws of physics.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFC" rel="nofollow">
          HFC
         </a>
         is like wireless in a pipe. The more people who switch on and use HFC cable at the same time the slower the dedicated speeds become. Let us pretend you have a 100 meg speed connection. Unfortunately, with HFC, the words that must always be used because the law requires it are ‘up to 100 meg’. Let us be very clear about this. ‘Up to’ means that as soon as two of you switch it on your speed starts to slow, if three of you switch it on your speed starts to slow more and if a whole street switches it on the speed really starts to slow. With a piece of fibre it is very simple: it is a dedicated connection which has no interference or impact if the person in the next house or the next street turns it on.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other thing about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOCSIS" rel="nofollow">
          DOCSIS
         </a>
         3.0 upgrade of the HFC cable is that it has been configured at 100 megs down and two up. This cannot match a piece of fibre which can have a significantly greater degree of symmetry when it comes to uploads and downloads. So the very simple answer, Senator Macdonald, is no, it cannot, and Telstra themselves, as has been revealed in the agreement, are bringing their broadband customers off the HFC network and across onto the fibre network because ultimately they know that they cannot compete with a dedicated piece of fibre in the same street. That is why this deal is a win-win. It is a win for Telstra shareholders and a win for the broader Australian community because it will take us into the leading edge of world technology capacity, and that is why this deal should be supported by those opposite. It particularly should be supported by those in the bottom corner down there in the National Party, because they are turning their backs on their own voters. They are condemning their—

          , I ask a supplementary question. I note that the minister’s advice is contrary to that given to the Senate select committee on that subject, but I ask the minister why it is that in the deal—mind you, I emphasise that it is a non-binding deal—Telstra is forbidden to have infrastructure which can compete with the

           <p>
            There are so many incorrect assertions in that question that it is hard to know where to start, but let me be very clear about this. Firstly, there is no conflicting evidence with testimony to the Senate select committee, because let me quote to you the chief technology officer for Telstra, Hugh Bradlow, who said that fibre to the home ‘is the end game’. That is Telstra’s chief technology officer and he said it many times. I will take his testimony over your assertions any day of the week, Senator Macdonald.
           </p>
           <p>
            As for some of the other assertions, they are nonsensical. Some of them are so nonsensical that I do not know where to start with an answer. But this is a deal that is, as I said, a win-win. This is a deal that creates a wholesale market and a retail market, because those opposite cannot get away from the fact that they privatised a vertically integrated monopoly—

                  . It is always the case of the Greens coming to aid their allies in the Labor Party. Does this prove that Mr Rudd drove negotiations for an early and expensive deal to try to offset, and even influence, the next bad Newspoll—the political win that Senator Conroy actually spoke about in his answer to the first question today, demonstrating that clearly this is all about politics and not about a decent national broadband network?

                     again go back to the editorial in today’s
                     <i>
                      Age
                     </i>
                     , which states that the deal means an end to a flawed model of combined wholesale and retail operations that stultified our telco market for years. And on the point that you made about us rushing this at the end, in November, December, January, February, March and April I have been saying that we had to conclude this by the end of June. Well, guess what? It is the end of June.

                      You can check my public statements for the last six months. I have been saying the end of June. I would love to say that I pay that much attention to when the
                      <i>
                       Australian
                      </i>
                      is going to conduct a Newspoll—and I have seen some commentary about the
                      <i>
                       Australian
                      </i>
                      ’s view of its own self-importance that the whole world revolves around the
                      <i>
                       Australian
                      </i>
                      Newspoll—but what I said in November, December, January, February and March is that we would be finished at the end of June. I really assure you that I had no idea on which weekend Newspoll was conducting its polls.
