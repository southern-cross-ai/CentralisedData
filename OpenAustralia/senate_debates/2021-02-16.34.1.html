        My question is to Senator Birmingham, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to Brittany Higgins's allegations of rape in this building almost two years ago. I asked you yesterday whether the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         Sex Discrimination Commissioner
        </a>
        would be tasked with a culture review of parliament, but you didn't answer me. The Prime Minister this morning announced that a Liberal MP will undertake a culture review and that the deputy secretary of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        &amp;C will undertake a review of the handling of Brittany's complaint. Given the secrecy with which previous reviews have been undertaken by PM&amp;C, will the Prime Minister guarantee that the findings of these reviews will be made public? How can women have confidence that change will flow from two internal reviews when the culture of silencing is part of the problem?

         I thank Senator Waters for her question. It's essential in matters such as this that the support provided to employees, members of parliament or any other individual in this building is support that is timely, is effective and is ongoing or enduring wherever necessary. It's important that, in ensuring that we can provide such support to individuals, everyone has confidence in the processes, support and systems that are available to them. That's why the Prime Minister has asked in particular the Deputy Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to assist and advise on how those processes can work to support people.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is my full expectation that, in relation to the conduct of that work, Ms Foster, the deputy secretary, will engage with Kate Jenkins, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
          Sex Discrimination Commissioner
         </a>
         and author of the report
         <i>
          Respect@Work: national inquiry into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces
         </i>
         . I also note that in the other place the Prime Minister has indicated a willingness and openness to working with party leaders across the parliament in relation to how these processes can be strengthened, including the type of work that Ms Foster will undertake and any additional assistance or work alongside her that will be necessary.

           I note the Prime Minister's previous empathy training. Will the Prime Minister now undertake training to become aware of the victim blaming implicit in his statement about Brittany 'being found in a vulnerable situation', as opposed to men's bad behaviour causing that situation, and training to understand the sexist underpinnings of his statement that he had to think of his daughters when thinking about how Brittany's rape case should have been handled?

            Well, respect is crucial at all points of considering these matters. Ultimately, respect in this particular case and for Brittany, her wishes and the support that she needs is the most important factor. The government, through the minister, as indicated, sought to provide that support for Brittany. It is with deep regret and deeply distressing that, despite those efforts, including Minister Reynolds facilitating discussions with the police and the offer of assistance through the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Finance
            </a>
            , that support was not adequate. We have to address that and rectify those issues. That's what the processes that will be undertaken will seek to do: to ensure that, whilst we will continue to offer whatever support to Brittany and to the police investigation, also in the future we make sure that staff can have greater confidence in the support that is available to them and utilise it.

               I imagine that the robustness of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
                Department of Finance
               </a>
               procedures that are available at present will absolutely be part of investigations and discussions than ensue in relation to these matters and, where gaps exist in terms of the confidence that staff have in utilising those processes, options will then be on the table to fill those gaps. The government is not seeking to rule out options in that regard. The most important thing is that the support is there for individuals like Brittany so they feel empowered to make the best decisions for themselves and feel supported, empowered and respected through the decision-making processes that they wish to make. Clearly, the systems need to be in place to support individuals who feel that way, and we want to make sure that the systems are enhanced to achieve that outcome.
