        Greens pressure and the incredible work of animal activists and the community, who picked up their phones and called the minister, have worked. We can breathe a sigh of relief for now. The department has finally rejected an application for the animals that have been stranded on

        for over a month to be re-exported. This dangerous journey through a conflict zone should never have been approved. Even after this ship of misery was turned back, it took the government far too long to take any action while the animals suffered and died on the stranded vessel. This is animal torture. Now the 16,000 sheep and cattle on MV

        , who are suffering in the scorching heat, must all be taken off this ship.
       </p>
       <p>
        But let's not forget that the craven live export industry continues to shape government policy. As animals suffered and died on one stranded ship, the department approved yet another live export voyage to travel through the very same conflict zone, carrying 60,000 animals. It's been over 100 days since Labor received advice from the phase-out panel, but we have seen no progress at all. All the while there is the continued approval of ships and the suffering and torture of animals. Animals are sentient beings. They are not cargo to be offered up as fodder for profits. Animals deserve a life free of suffering, not to be sacrificed on ships as a cost of business. Labor must urgently legislate an end date and start the phase-out right now. Sheep cannot wait for the next term of government. They can barely wait another day.
