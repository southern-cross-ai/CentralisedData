        said during her visit to Australia in November 2013 that the rule of law 'must be tempered by mercy' in cases of asylum seeker children born in Australia. Will the government commit to ensuring that the babies of asylum seekers who are born on Australian soil are given the legal right to apply for protection and citizenship and are not deported to offshore detention centres?

         I thank Senator Madigan for the question. The government considers that children of unauthorised maritime arrivals are already included within the existing definition of an 'unauthorised maritime arrival' within the Migration Act. Section 5AA of the Migration Act defines an unauthorised maritime arrival, and section 10 of the act provides that a non-citizen child born in a migration zone is taken to have entered Australia when he or she is born. If the parents of the child do not hold visas at the time of the child's birth, the child will not hold a visa at the time of the its birth because the children of unauthorised maritime arrivals enter the migration zone without a visa. When they are born as unlawful citizens, they are taken to have entered the migration zone by sea and are unauthorised maritime arrivals. I can also confirm that on 15 October 2014 the Federal Circuit Court handed down a judgement in this matter. The court found that a child born to parents who are unauthorised maritime arrivals is also an unauthorised maritime arrival.

           I thank Senator Madigan for his supplementary question. The government treats all asylum seekers with compassion and in accordance with our international obligations. The government feels that the most compassionate action is to get all the proven children of refugees out of detention. I would reiterate the point that Minister Morrison made to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Human Rights Commission
           </a>
           inquiry. He stated as follows:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The aim of the Abbott Government is to return detention centres to the position left by the

            Howard Government

           , where there were no â€¦ children in detention at all who had arrived by boat.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           None whatsoever. I'm sure we would all welcome seeing that again and I know I certainly would.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Madigan, I would make the point that recent policy changes by this government have seen a decrease in the number of children in detention.

               I thank Senator Madigan for his second supplementary question. Senator Madigan, I respectfully reject the premise of your question. The point that Minister Morrison has made is that he would like to see children out of detention facilities at Christmas time. I certainly believe that that is what we on this side of the chamber want. The only bargaining going on here is by those on the other side.
