        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. Yesterday the Attorney-General failed to either rule out or confirm whether the federal Liberal-National government had a deal or understanding with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        Liberal government that the Commonwealth would not contest the Western Australian legislation. The Prime Minister, in the other place, twice refused to rule out or confirm whether such a deal or understanding existed. Will the Attorney-General please tell the Senate yes or no—was there any such deal or understanding between the governments or any of their representatives?

           The point of order is on relevance. We did not ask what the Attorney's opinion as to the nature of the letters was, which is the aspect of the statement to which he is referring. Senator Sterle, as is his wont, asked a very direct question: will the Attorney-General tell the Senate yes or no—was there any such deal or understanding between the governments or any of their representatives? We did not ask about the letters. We know what he said in his statement. He tries to avoid answering the question by referencing the letters—we are not referencing the letters at all; we are asking him to tell the Senate was there was a deal or understanding or not.

            On my left! A point of order has been raised and I have been asked to rule on it. At this stage I am listening to the Attorney-General's answer. The Attorney-General has indicated, in my view, that by inference there was no such deal. But I will allow the Attorney-General to continue answering the question.

             , the way I try to approach these questions, Senator Sterle, is to develop premises to a conclusion but for your sake I will state the conclusion first and then explain the premises: no there was not—not in my opinion and not to my knowledge. I do not believe there was a deal, I have no knowledge of a deal. The only evidence I have seen does not support the proposition that there was a deal.

                No, I do not, Senator Sterle. In answer to Senator Macdonald's question, I reflected on the years when I used to practice at the bar and I tell you what that taught me, Senator Sterle, because I largely practised in commercial matters: it is the most common thing in the world for two people to have a discussion and both of them, honestly and in good faith, to take a different recollection away from that discussion. Just because the documents do not support or evidence a deal does not mean that Dr Nahan is being dishonest—
