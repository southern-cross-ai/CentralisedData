        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, Regional Development and

         Local Government

        , Minister Watt. The cost of living is top of mind for regional Australians, with energy affordability one of their key concerns. The Australian energy market operator has said that renewables are the lowest-cost way to supply electricity to homes and businesses throughout Australia's transition to a net zero economy. How will the Albanese Labor government's clean, cheap and reliable energy plan benefit regional Australians?

          It was a very good question, arguably the best all day. On 1 July—in only six days time—we're taking $300 off the power bills of every regional household around Australia. Some of them are starting to smile for the first time today—we know you like that! In two decades, in contrast, Mr Dutton will serve up to regional Australians the most expensive form of energy there is with zero relief in the meantime.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our reliable renewables plan is the only plan supported by experts to deliver the clean, cheap, reliable and resilient energy system that regional Australians deserve, and it's the only energy plan that is delivering jobs for regional Australians right now. Under Labor, we've had a 25 per cent increase in renewables in the national grid, we've had record investment in batteries and storage, we've had more than 50 renewable projects greenlit—enough to power three million homes—and we've had more than 330,000 rooftop solar installations last year alone, and many of these have been in regional Australia. That's because renewables are the cheapest form of energy, and getting more renewables into our system is the key to bringing regional power prices down. That is something that regional Australians already understand.

          Only a few weeks ago, I was in Armidale in the electorate of anti-renewables zealot Mr Barnaby Joyce, and there I met with the local mayor, Mr Sam Coupland, who said that local farmers were increasingly putting wind turbines on their properties to shore up their businesses during times of drought. Mayor Coupland has also said the construction phase for renewables will likely last many years and provide a significant boost to the local economy. Former

          president Mr Brent Finlay is another who is said to host more than a dozen turbines on his property in south-west Queensland, and he says this is a region that has been heavily impacted by drought and there's very little chance to diversify. This is a chance to diversify and spread—

              That sounds like a very sensible plan. At the May budget, the government outlined its plan for a future made in Australia, creating jobs and economic opportunities across the country. Why is the Albanese government's rollout of renewable energy so important to securing jobs in the regions?

               Thank you, Senator Stewart—another cracker of a question. We know that the world's climate emergency is regional Australia's jobs opportunity. Jobs and Skills Australia has found Australia will need 32,000 more electricians between now and 2030, and 85,000 more to 2050. In the 38 critical clean energy occupations we need 240,000 jobs by 2030, and the renewable energy rollout is already creating jobs in regional Australia. For example, in my home state of Queensland, the town of Gladstone is cementing its spot as a world leader when it comes to creating new, clean-economy manufacturing jobs in hydrogen and renewable energy.
              </p>
              <p>
               But renewables are also vital to keeping existing jobs in towns like Gladstone. Earlier this year, global resources giant

                Rio Tinto
               </a>
               signed Australia's largest renewable power purchase agreement to supply its Gladstone operations in Queensland. Its

               </a>
               said, 'We now have a pathway to provide the competitive firmed power our Gladstone plants need.' Renewables are the key to keeping our regions strong.

                 After a decade of failed energy policies under those opposite—Liberals and Nationals—regional Australians want reliable and resilient energy sources today. Why is investment in renewable energy sources the right path for powering regional Australia, and what are the main risks to securing clean, cheap and reliable energy for the regions?

                  Thank you, Senator Stewart. Renewables are cheap, clean and provide a valuable source of income for regional Australians, but, of course, the biggest risk to this income source is the coalition's risky nuclear gamble led by the new advocate of Soviet-style policies, Mr Dutton. That's right. 'Proletariat Pete' is not content with chasing away the thousands of jobs being created in our regions through cheap renewable energy—

                        I withdraw. They won't tell regional Australians how much they will pay to build their nuclear reactors, how much nuclear power will add to their bills, how much nuclear waste there will be or where it will go and just how many reactors there will be in regional Australian communities. Nuclear is the most expensive form of energy. All that means is higher taxes and higher bills for regions.
