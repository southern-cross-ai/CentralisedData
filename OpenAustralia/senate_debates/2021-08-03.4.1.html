        Unfortunately I have to once again inform the Senate of revised arrangements for the chamber and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        due to the COVID-19 outbreaks across the country.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Speaker" rel="nofollow">
         The Speaker
        </a>
        is making a similar statement to the House. As senators would be aware, the Speaker and I issued a statement last Monday on temporary changes to building operations at Parliament House based on the COVID-19 situations in Queensland and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        , travel restrictions and designated hotspot areas. I will not restate all the details, but these are significant changes to the operation of parliament and requirements of those in the building, and I appreciate the understanding of senators and staff in implementing and respecting these. I urge all senators and staff to constantly refresh themselves with the measures we have instituted. They have been imposed for the safety of allâ€”in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        , where we meet, and in our home communities, when we return. They are designed to allow the parliament to meet and fulfil its essential role but to do so safely. They also represent the first time we have gone substantially over and above the general requirements in place in the ACT.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, with the delta variant of COVID-19 in the community, the use of masks is particularly important. Building occupants, including senators, should wear masks in all common areas and wherever else possible when doing so does not directly impede their work. I would also like to remind senators that, to reduce the risk of the transmission of COVID-19, everyone is also requested to maintain appropriate hand and respiratory hygiene, minimise gatherings with other building occupants and ensure physical distance is maintained throughout the building. All senators and staff must abide by ACT Health directions. If any building occupant has spent time in a nominated Queensland local government area on or after 21 July, you must isolate until receiving a negative test and follow the ACT stay-at-home directions, including those relating to mask wearing, work and movement. Physical distance requirements in the chamber and other meeting rooms are again in place.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I cannot stress enough how important it is that, with the COVID-19 situation evolving so rapidly around Australia, those who have travelled here regularly check the exposure locations from their home jurisdictions or any areas you have been in, at least over the last 14 days. Senators and staff will be informed of any change regarding arrangements at Parliament House, and the Department of Parliamentary Services will continue to provide regular updates regarding appropriate health measures via information circulars. I thank senators for their understanding, and I particularly thank Commonwealth and ACT health officials, who we have worked very closely with over the last few weeks to bring this parliament together.
