        My question is to Senator Payne, representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. On my frequent trips to regional and rural

        s to talk to vets. Recently, I did a Q&amp;A with 50 veterans in Ballarat and heard some horror stories—not what happened overseas but what happened after they got home. I told them they had to regard the

        as the enemy, because they treat you as the enemy. Senator, are you aware of a story on the
        <i>
         7.30
        </i>
        program last night that claimed DVA deliberately deleted an incapacity policy for self-employed vets so that they could deny the compensation claim of veteran Martin Rollins? Has the Minister ordered an investigation into the disgusting treatment of the veteran who had to retire as a paratrooper after damaging his spine?

         I thank Senator Hinch for his question. I understand that in relation to a number of the claims made on the
         <i>
          7.30
         </i>
         program last night—I did not see the item myself but I am aware of it—that some of the claims are not entirely accurate. The minister will, obviously, undertake to investigate the claims that have been made and determine which are and which are not accurate. There was an independent investigation made in relation to some of the issues raised which I am advised, at the time, did not find any evidence of impropriety on behalf of the staff. But certainly Veterans' Affairs has acknowledged that some aspects of its client service in that matter could have been managed better. We have, as a government, acknowledged that over time as well. A number of Veterans' Affairs ministers, and I certainly since 2015, have been endeavouring to assist in transition matters in particular, as you would be aware, Senator Hinch, from your interest in this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         As part of the independent investigation there were concerns identified in relation to the written responses to correspondence, for example, that said they could certainly have been improved, they could have been more timely and they could have been more sympathetic. A great deal of work has been done within the organisation and within the staff in the organisation to address those sorts of issues and also to address the issues that arise out of the delays with processing claims, and that is a matter which the government has pursued.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that the

         itself denies the specific allegation that it removed or cancelled policies to deny veterans their lawful entitlements, and that was one of the aspects which was raised in the program. The particular section of the incapacity handbook that was referred to in the
         <i>
          7.30
         </i>
         program reflected a policy statement about the treatment of self-employed veterans at a point in time—

            DVA
           </a>
           engaged three external law firms, the Government Solicitor and a forensic accountant to fight Martin Rollins' claim? How much did it cost the taxpayer to persecute and destroy the quality of life of a man whose only crime was that he served his country?

            I'm not aware of the cost to the taxpayer. I will take that part of the question on notice. I don't understand that there was an intention to persecute an individual in any way and certainly not to disrespect the service that a veteran has given to Australia and to the
