         I thank Senator Antic for his question and congratulate him on his first question to the chamber. I welcome him to the Senate and note that, perhaps, unlike some others, Senator Antic is happy to come into this question time and ask questions about policies and about issues that matter to Australians in terms of job creation for Australians, in terms of business growth for Australians and in terms of the types of opportunities that are important to keeping our economy strong and to keeping Australians safe and secure economically. Indeed, the trade policies of this government have been central to providing those types of enhanced opportunities to Australians right around the country, especially in our home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . It is wonderful, as always, to have a new Liberal senator here from the state of South Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our trade policies have seen successive agreements sealed and delivered. They stand in stark contrast to the record of those opposite, who were unable to commence and conclude trade agreements when they were in office. Our government has been able to get on with it: agreements with China, with Japan, with Korea and with the 10 economies of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Indeed, there was our pursuit of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACER" rel="nofollow">
          PACER
         </a>
         Plus Agreement and our agreements with Indonesia, with Peru and with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
          Hong Kong
         </a>
         . All of these agreements have enhanced the opportunity for Australia's businesses to be able to export more, to be able to grow and, ultimately, to be able to contribute to the record levels of jobs growth that we've seen in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is no coincidence that the trade growth and the expanded market access that the Liberal-National government has delivered for Australia's farmers and Australia's businesses has helped to fuel an increase in the number of businesses who export, an increase in the volume of exports, an increase in the value of exports from Australia and, ultimately, more job opportunities for Australians. It's those job opportunities that are central, and that's why we are going to continue to work to expand those opportunities for Australia's exporters.

            A critical industry in our great state of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            is the wine industry.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
             South Australian
            </a>
            wines, I'm sure, are enjoyed by nearly every member of this chamber—indeed, I would hope, by every member. I know Senator Farrell has a strong and abiding interest in the South Australian wine industry—one that we share.
           </p>
           <p>
            Australia's exports of wine to key trading nations such as China, Korea and Japan continue to grow. Export data from Wine Australia shows that Australian wine exports to China reached a record high of $1.2 billion during the 2018-19 financial year, increasing by some seven per cent in value. Australia now exports more wine by value to China than any other nation around the world. This is a proud accomplishment for Australia's great winemaking industry. They've been able to do that in part because of the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which has seen Australian wine exports to China grow by more than 180 per cent since coming into force, creating massive opportunities for businesses.

               They create the opportunity for Australia's businesses and exporters to land their goods, their services and their products in markets at a more competitive rate than their competitors. That is the key thing here: to be able to get into the market with the least amount of cost impost or barriers for those exporters. That's why we continue to pursue new market opportunities. That's what we'll be doing in the negotiations for the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement. It's what we'll be doing in our negotiations with the European Union.
