        I rise this evening mindful that the Gifford family are actually watching this tribute to their beautiful mum Judy, and I'm very pleased to be joined in the chamber by Senator Tim Ayres, who through family is related to the Gifford family and who, like me, was privileged to be at Judy's funeral on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        in the last weeks. I seek to take this opportunity in the federal parliament of Australia, in the house of the Senate, to pay tribute to the wonderful life and legacy of the beautiful Judy Gifford
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Green Point
        </a>
        , in my old electorate of Robertson on the beautiful Central Coast. Judy was a dear friend, a remarkable and incredible achiever as a volunteer, a brilliant and engaging leader and organiser, and, very happily, a Labor true believer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judith Ann Gifford was born to Bill and Lorraine Rogers at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford Hospital
        </a>
        in 1942 and grew up in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Frederick" rel="nofollow">
         Point Frederick
        </a>
        , during a very a different time, on the Central Coast. She grew up in a fibro house on the shores of beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caroline_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Caroline Bay
        </a>
        , from which her father would often take her out fishing for crabs and other treats from the water.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judy was a brilliant student as a child and developed a lifelong love of education, which manifested in her great achievement as a graduate from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford High School
        </a>
        , where she achieved the status of dux of the college, and she did what all brilliant students at that time did, which was study to become a teacher. She eventually became a French and Latin teacher in rural
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . It was there, down in the Riverina, that she met and married John, universally known as 'Giffo', a fellow teacher and cricket tragic, and a good of friend of Judy's cherished brother Derek. John and Judy went on to have three daughters—Alison, Bronwen and Helen—during their life together in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It was following the birth of her first daughter that Judy came upon was to become a livelong passion. That was the role of a breastfeeding advocate. After seeing an advertisement for nursing mothers, which was to become the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Breastfeeding_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Breastfeeding Association
        </a>
        , she joined and soon made herself indispensable, organising another nine branches in the Riverina and making a name for herself through her constant letter-writing and agitation. People learnt very quickly not to get between Judy and a goal that she set out to achieve. She soon came to national notice and served in many different capacities, including as the national president, honorary secretary, a board director and editor of
        <i>
         Essence
        </i>
        , the magazine for the Breastfeeding Association.
       </p>
       <p>
        After moving to the Central Coast following a long-awaited departmental transfer for Giffo, Judy became a vibrant part of the Central Coast social fabric, continuing her leadership role with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA" rel="nofollow">
         ABA
        </a>
        as treasurer of the Erina branch right up until her illness in recent years. Judy was also a Labor Party stalwart, a constant presence at branch meetings and a tremendous source of support to me and to other Labor candidates on the Central Coast for many, many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was awarded the OAM in 2013 for her services to breastfeeding. She probably deserved a few more OAMs for her services to the community in so many ways.
       </p>
       <p>
        At her funeral, a beautiful woman was sitting beside me and spoke about how she had been in despair and had wondered how she was going to manage the breastfeeding challenges with her young child. As soon as she met Judy, a lifelong friendship was formed. People spoke on the day of Judy's funeral about how remarkably supportive, encouraging and enabling she was. What a wonderful woman, a remarkable woman—an unforgettable presence in the lives of all she touched—she was. Judy Gifford has been honoured by the ABA by inaugurating the Judy Gifford Impact Award. Judy had a strong hand in writing the criteria for it, so we know it will go to a really good person! I was actually very privileged to see Judy the night before she passed—to hold her hand and chat a while. She remained remarkable until the end.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judy is survived by her husband, John; by her daughters, Alison, Bronwyn and Helen; and by her nine grandchildren. I pray that her memory is a blessing and that her life and legacy remain an inspiration to all those who knew this truly remarkable woman.
