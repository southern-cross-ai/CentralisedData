        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. Official documents obtained under freedom-of-information requests show that the South Australian Minister for Trade and Investment's office approached your office to secure a meeting with local business Citadel Secure and that a meeting was agreed to by your chief of staff. Minister, have you or anyone from your office had meetings with Citadel Secure and/or any of its clients? If so, who attended these meetings and when did they occur?

         Senator Liddle, I am very disappointed that you have asked this question, days out from an important by-election in South Australia, where the people of Dunstan are going to have to choose a replacement for the former Premier. This is grubby. This is really, really grubby.

             No. This gets grubbier and grubbier. The absolute answer to this is no. This is not the way I behave in this job. I have tried to lift the standards in this place, and the standards I expect of everybody else I apply to myself. These questions are below you. Senator, this is my advice: don't get involved in this grubby activity that is going on in the

              My question was not about seeking your advice. Can you advise the Senate what role Ms Cressida O'Hanlon—then Labor Party staffer, now Labor Party candidate, an associate director of Citadel Secure—played in seeking or securing access to your office? Have you or anyone in your office had any engagement with Ms O'Hanlon regarding Citadel Secure? And was the answer to all of those questions 'no'?

                I would ask you to take advice from the Clerk as to whether or not a question about a candidate in a state by-election is actually relevant to the minister's portfolio. It really does bell the cat that the opposition is now, days out from a state by-election, seeking to ask a direct personal question about an individual—an individual they were happy to name and were happy to [inaudible] in this place. I would ask you to seek the advice of the Clerk.

They were relying upon freedom of information documents which indicate that a meeting with this company had been agreed to by his chief of staff. It is entirely in order for senators to ask ministers questions about meetings they undertake and engagements they may or may not have with individuals seeking or advocating for those meetings or for funding.

                     Thank you, Senator Birmingham. I will seek the advice of the Clerk. I am advised that the question is in order. Given that the statements have been made, it is also an opportunity for the minister to respond to those statements. Minister Farrell.

                      be very, very clear—absolutely crystal clear—that there has been no contact between my office and anybody associated with Citadel Secure, including the very fine candidate for the Labor Party in the seat of Dunstan. I reiterate that these are grubby tactics. They are tactics that you're prepared to use, Senator Liddle, under parliamentary privilege. If you're so confident that something wrong has occurred, make these statements outside of this place. Make them so that Cressida O'Hanlon can defend herself in defamation proceedings, because absolutely nothing you say is true. Say it outside of parliament. If you think this is right, say it outside of parliament.
