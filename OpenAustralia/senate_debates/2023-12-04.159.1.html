        , Senator Watt. Last week, we had the extraordinary spectacle of the Queensland Deputy Premier travelling all the way down here with a delegation of mayors to demand that the government restore funding for Brisbane's Olympics infrastructure, budgeted by the former coalition government. On Saturday, the former chairman of the

         Senator Canavan, thank you for the question because it gives me an opportunity to point out that the coalition government, while making promises about funding of infrastructure for the 2032

          Olympic Games

         , did not commit or provide in the budget one single cent. The last time I looked at building construction costs, you don't really get a stadium for zero cents, you don't get a road for zero cents, you don't get a rail line for zero cents or for zero dollars—and that's exactly the amount that was committed by the former coalition government and that has, of course, been improved upon by the Albanese Labor government.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why the budget we handed down this year, the 2023-24 budget, actually delivers real funding, not just promises, on the Australian government's funding commitment towards the 2032 Games. Over the forward estimates $504 million has been firmly committed in the budget papers—not just promises—towards the Brisbane Arena project, and $512 million towards the 16 new and upgraded venues across South-East Queensland, which is a total of $1.076 billion. In total, the Albanese government—

            I'm not sure I'd call it 'a simple one'; there was a fair bit of preamble in there. But I will draw the minister to that part of your question, Senator Canavan.

            </p>
            <p>
             that is actually prepared to deliver real funding for the Olympics infrastructure rather than the hollow promises that we had from the former coalition government.

            <p>
             As I say, in total the Albanese government is delivering $2.5 billion for the Brisbane Arena development and up to $935 million for the minor venues program. This is real funding, not just promises.

                 <p>
                  The only thing that put any Queensland infrastructure projects at risk was the fact that the former coalition government did not budget for those projects, did not have business plans for those projects, did not have a single dollar in the budget and didn't have the skills and the labour needed to deliver those projects. That is why we have had to do the hard work that the coalition government was never prepared to do, to actually work out in this inflationary environment which projects can be delivered and which ones need to be paused for a period of time.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In the process we have followed through on funding for almost all the projects that were previously committed to by the former government, but there are some that need a business case to be prepared before they can be delivered. Senator Canavan, I haven't seen you out there clapping the federal government for delivering the funding that was needed for the cost increase to the Rockhampton Ring Road; I have seen you doing a lot of campaigning in scaring people that the funding wasn't there, but now that it actually is there you haven't said a thing. Get out there and get on board!
