        Tonight I rise to acknowledge our 2021 Australian of the Year, Grace Tame, and also recognise her fellow 2021 Tasmanian Australian of the Year award winners:

        </a>
        , Toby Thorpe and Edna Pennicott. The Australian of the Year awards celebrate the achievements and contributions of eminent Australians. These four Tasmanians are worthy representatives of my home state and important role models. It is an honour to be able to share their accomplishments with you tonight.
       </p>
       <p>
        In taking up her title as Australian of the Year, Grace Tame became the first Tasmanian to hold this honour. A dedicated advocate for survivors of sexual assault, Grace came to national attention via the Let Her Speak campaign when she applied to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Supreme Court
        </a>
        for the right to identify herself as a sexual abuse survivor. She became the first Tasmanian woman to do this and has since used this platform to push for legal reform and raise public awareness about the impact of sexual violence. It takes incredible courage to tell anyone that you were groomed and raped by your 58-year-old maths teacher from the age of 15, but Grace reported that abuse to police and ensured her abuser was brought to justice. Under Tasmania's sexual assault victim gag laws, Grace was unable to legally speak about her experience publicly, even though her abuser and the media could. So she pushed for that to change. Since then, Grace has told her story over and over again in advocating for others who survived sexual abuse, particularly those abused in institutional settings. As a result of the Let Her Speak campaign and Grace Tame's legal case, the Tasmanian government last year amended section 194K of the Evidence Act 2001 to allow victims the right to speak publicly. When accepting her award in Canberra last week, Grace said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Well hear me nowâ€”using my voice against a growing chorus of voices that will not be silenced.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through one brave act after another, Grace Tame has gone from being silenced by her abuser and the law, and known by the ultimate anonymous moniker of

        during legal proceedings, to being recognised as the 2021 Australian of the Year. Congratulations, Grace.

        Brian Williams is the Tasmanian Senior Australian of the Year, winning this title for his more than 50 years of tireless service to Scouts. Under his leadership, Blackmans Bay Scout Group has become one of the largest and most successful groups in the state, with Brian mentoring thousands of young people in this time. Taking this a step further, Brian has trained and supported more than 100 Venturer Scout leaders since 1983. He also organised the first

        Tasmania's Young Australian of the Year, Toby Thorpe, advocates for youth empowerment and climate action. Toby's leadership in this space helped

        founder Edna Pennicott was named the Tasmanian Local Hero. Kingborough Helping Hands provide care packages of food and other essential items to people in the local area facing financial hardship. Edna collects the goods to make up the packages herself and personally delivers many of them. She also runs the after-hours mobile van service that provides hot food and support to people sleeping rough. She recently won the inaugural Aurora Energy Lifetime Achievement Award in recognition of her 40 years of dedicated service to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Grace, Brian, Toby and Edna, Tasmania has outstanding ambassadors to share our community's message with a wider audience. Each of these four Tasmanians has worked for years to challenge attitudes and advocate for others, and I know Tasmanians are proud of and grateful for the services they each provide. Nominations are now open for the 2022

        . I encourage everyone in this place or listening around the country to identify an inspiring Australian who deserves to be recognised for their efforts, and then take that next step and nominate them.
