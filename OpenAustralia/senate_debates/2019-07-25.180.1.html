        My question is to the Minister for Youth and Sport. Will the minister update the Senate on the government's commitment to the South-East Queensland bid for the 2032
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ? What are the risks if the Queensland state government delays its decision to back the bid?

         I thank Senator Scarr for his question. I understand his obvious interest in the very exciting bid for the 2032 Olympics that's been proposed, particularly, by the South-East Queensland mayors and the opportunities that the bid will bring to South-East Queensland. There's enthusiasm for the bid from the Prime Minister, and Mr Ted O'Brien has been appointed as the Prime Minister's representative to push the bid forward.
        </p>
        <p>
         We were delighted to see the Queensland government finally coming on board with some action for participation in the process to bid for the 2032 Olympics. I must say though that they were somewhat lacklustre.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         government put $10 million on the table to support this bid during the election campaign. That was welcomed by the mayors of South-East Queensland and, of course, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Olympic_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Olympic Committee
         </a>
         . The process has been, I think, very well set up for Australia to be in a very strong position to be successful in its bid. The Queensland government have, effectively, offered some in-kind assistance, but they need to get on board properly. They need to join the Australian government. They need to join the Australian Olympic Committee. They need to join the community of South-East Queensland in being actively supportive of this bid, but they are not. They are putting a very slow time frame on their economic impact survey, which needs to be completed quickly. They're saying they'll do it next year. It should be done this year. We face the possibility of losing the very exciting window that we have to be a leading nation bidding for the 2032 Olympics and losing all of the advantages that would bring to this country. I certainly urge the Queensland government to actively get on board.

           In addition to backing the South-East Queensland bid for the Olympics, how is the government supporting sports organisations who look to bring international sporting events to Australia?

            —the opposition demonstrate their complete ignorance of the situation that exists around the opportunities to bid and perhaps that's why the Queensland government is so slow—we've put almost $20 million on the table to bid for other opportunities for global sporting events to come to this country. We're backing the Football Federation's bid for the 2023

               Thanks to Senator Scarr for the supplementary. It demonstrates the importance of these events and what the industry of sport can bring to the Australian economy. Currently in Australia the sports industry employs a workforce of more than 220,000 people. It's responsible for spending more than $12 billion through sport and sport infrastructure each year. That's why this is so serious. Securing major international sporting events, such as the Olympics, not only inspires the next generation of athletes in this country but also strengthens Australia's sports industry. It strengthens those numbers that I've just talked about. Our government is also committed to the development of the sports industry growth plan. We announced that as part of our 2030 sports plan, which was presented by Senator McKenzie last year. We have a very, very strong commitment to the sports sector in this country and to the employment that goes with it.
