         I thank Senator Minchin for his question. The global recession has led to the biggest downgrades in budget revenues in living memory, wiping around $210 billion from the budget. These downgrades are responsible for around two-thirds of the deterioration in the budget position since the last budget. In the current environment the only responsible course of action is to borrow to finance the temporary deficit. The alternative, significant spending cuts or tax increases, would result in a deeper and longer downturn and much higher unemployment. Even after accounting for revenue downgrades, the government’s balance sheet remains among the strongest in the world. Our projected levels of net debt are lower than any of the major advanced economies. Net debt is projected to peak at 13.8 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         in 2013-14. This compares to an estimated 80 per cent of GDP for the 25 largest advanced economies collectively. Let us be clear: the government has a clear strategy that will begin returning the budget to surplus—

I refer to the fact that the Treasurer did not have the courage to confess to the Australian people in his budget speech last night what the total deficit and debt is in the Rudd government budget. Given that the Treasurer will not tell us, will the Minister representing the Treasurer in the Senate, Senator Conroy, summon the courage to level with the Australian people and tell them exactly what the debt and deficit is in this budget?

           The net debt deficits over the forward estimates, to save your lazy shadow Treasurer the trouble, are $32.1 billion or 2.7 per cent of

This budget has a strategy. This budget has a strategy to pay down debt as the economy recovers.

            , I ask the minister a further supplementary question: given these massive deficits which he has just confirmed and the record spending of an extra $220 million a day since the government was elected, does this not prove that Labor has lost control of the nation’s finances?

             What a bunch of frauds on the other side, and the frauds could not even manage to get through the morning before they were exposed, because when asked on
             <i>
              Sunrise
             </i>
             how much debt he would support and how big a deficit he would support

              Mr Hockey

            <p class="italic">
             Our deficit would be smaller. I’ll give you a figure as a starting point. At least $25 billion.
            </p>
            <p>
             That was at 8.09 am. By 8.27 am the Leader of the Opposition on
             <i>
              Sunrise
             </i>
             , when asked the same question, said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             If we were in government today revenues would be higher, spending would be lower; therefore, debt would be much lower and the deficit would be much lower.
            </p>
            <p>
             He is asked, ‘But you can’t say what figure?’ and he says:

                 I thank Senator Moore for her question. This is very much a nation-building budget, a budget focused on roads, rail, ports and clean energy. The government has taken hard decisions to stimulate the economy, support jobs and best position Australians to take full advantage of a global recovery. The budget keeps stimulus and investment flowing to support the economy in these tough times and locks in the savings that will get us back into surplus when the tough times have passed. This budget is the third component of our stimulus strategy, which we know is working. The first component was payments to support jobs, the second was construction of shovel-ready schools and homes throughout the nation and now the third is stimulus through big infrastructure projects.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As a government there are no easy answers when you are tackling the biggest revenue downgrades ever confronted by an Australian government. The biggest global recession since the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
                  Great Depression
                 </a>
                 has dragged Australia into recession, pushing up unemployment and wiping more than $200 billion off revenues. The choices we have taken in this budget will not jeopardise our recovery and they will see us return to surplus in 2015-16. Everyone has been asked to do their bit, especially those that have done well and can afford to contribute a bit more during these tough times. Not only are there savings but there are long-term structural reforms that will help put the budget back on a sustainable path—not just spend in the good years, but put it on a sustainable path. The Commonwealth Treasury says 200,000 Australians would be out of work if not for this stimulus and budget. We think this is a budget for the times, a budget that will stimulate jobs in our economy and prepare us for the future as well.

                  , I ask a supplementary question. Could the minister give further detail of how the budget provides a fair go for pensioners? What additional weekly payments will go to pensioners, what is the estimate of how many pensioners in Australia will receive those benefits and how are those increases backed up by the recent Harmer review?

                    The opposition may not support the increase for pensioners but we think it is one of the main positive features of this budget. Couples will receive an increase of $10.14 per week—major reform to assist Australian pensioners—and 3.3 million aged pensioners, disability pensioners, carers, wife pensioners and veteran income support recipients will benefit from increases in those pensions. In 12 years of Liberal government they did not get anything. We have moved to fix the problem with the base rate of the pensions to ensure pensioners have a decent standard of living. These reforms will improve the adequacy of the pension system, make it simpler and secure its sustainability into the future. We think all Australians should welcome these changes.

                     , I ask a further supplementary question. Could the minister also explain to the Senate how in particular this budget will benefit carers and veterans? What additional payments will carers and veterans receive and how many carers and veterans are estimated to benefit from those increases?

                      Carers and veterans will also benefit from the significant increase in recurrent pension spending. The government recognises the selfless contribution made by carers every day. Around 140,000 carers who receive the carer payment or a related income support payment will receive the pension increases announced in the budget and around 500,000 carers across Australia will receive a new permanent carer supplement. The new annual carer supplement will also provide around 450,000 recipients of carer allowance with $600 for each person they care for. Flowing on from the Harmer review of pensions, the government has allocated $1.1 billion over four years to provide extra financial support in the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio. Over 320,000 service pensioners and war widows will benefit from the pension changes. These are the most significant reforms to the pension since it was introduced 100 years ago.

                        The budget’s central task is nation building for recovery. It is a budget all about supporting jobs today by building the infrastructure Australia needs for tomorrow. It is a budget that shows up to 210,000 Australians would be out of work if those opposite had their way—210,000 Australians would be out of work if not for our stimulus and the nation building that we have engaged in. There is no way for those opposite to escape it. You would condemn 210,000 more Australians to being out of work if your policies were being pursued, and shame on you for that! All we have seen from the Liberal Party is their typical opportunism—

We know that, with this minister, fibre is not connected to the node, but could I invite him to address the question that was actually asked, and that relates to whether or not two-thirds of the $188 billion is extra spending by the government since the last election. I would ask, Mr President, that you ask him to direct his comments to the question that was actually asked, not the one that he wished was asked.

                          , on the point of order: Senator Conroy has been relevant to the question and, if we want to use the phrase, ‘directly relevant to the question that has been asked’. Senator Conroy has more than a minute left to answer the question in relation to the budget which was delivered last night by Mr Swan. The question went to both facts and figures in relation to the budget, and Senator Conroy is on point in answering that question. He is providing sufficient information and still has a minute to go to provide additional information in respect of the question asked. I submit there is no point of order in respect of the matter raised by Senator Abetz.

I note that those asking questions from the opposition have been heard in respectful silence. I note that the minister has hardly been able to get a word in edgeways and, finally, I note, and ask you to rule on the fact, that I would not have taken this point of order except that, during the first sentence in answer to the primary question asked, Senator Abetz loudly interjected across the chamber, ‘Answer the question.’ I would respectfully suggest to you, Mr President, that the opposition have been most disorderly while Senator Conroy has been on his feet.

                              Those opposite seek to avoid their responsibilities in this chamber. They seek to avoid a genuine debate about the budget. They try to pretend they are asking questions about the budget and you are not in a situation,

Since the first stimulus payment announced in October, almost 70c in every dollar has gone to infrastructure. Those opposite are guilty of their typical opportunism and their typical negativity. They continue to walk both sides of the street. Let us be clear to those opposite: this morning, the shadow Treasurer nominated $25 billion worth of savings by less spending. On Thursday night the Leader of the Opposition has to deliver to that challenge.
