        , Senator Gallagher. It has been reported in the media today that the government will pursue treaty and truth-telling despite the failure of the Voice referendum. At a time when the nation needs healing, the grave fear of many Australians is that a treaty process would lead to further division and come at the expense of better outcomes on the ground. Rather than more division or symbolism, will you accept the offer of bipartisanship and agree to an audit of all spending on Indigenous programs to ensure that the money spent at every level goes to where it is needed the most and practically helps to close the gap?

         I thank Senator Liddle for the question. I think all of us in this chamber always look for working together and reaching across party divides and political divides to find and reach agreement. That's been the position of the Prime Minister from the beginning, particularly in relation to the referendum that we just had.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the question about an audit of programs—there were a number of areas that Senator Liddle went to—there was an audit by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
          ANAO
         </a>
         that was just handed down in May this year, looking particularly at programs being run through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIAA" rel="nofollow">
          NIAA
         </a>
         . I note seven recommendations, all of which the NIAA accepted. It covered a period of time when those opposite were in government, and it showed that there were a number of areas in relation to noncompliance and fraud prevention and things like that with respect to the programs that were funded and needed improvements, to which the NIAA has committed and which the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         will be seeing through. So there has been quite a significant piece of work done. I think the ANAO's reputation and expertise in this area mean they are the pre-eminent body to do that work. That work has been done, and we will make sure that those recommendations are implemented. Of course, we will continue to listen to and work with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         organisations as they roll out programs, because there is an agreement across the country that focusing on practical outcomes and improving outcomes for First Nations Australians are a priority.

           While the Albanese Labor government was distracted by its failed referendum, the only practical policy action it took in Indigenous affairs was actually to abolish the cashless debit card and expose Indigenous communities, including women, children and old people, to further abuse, neglect and violence. How much worse are alcohol abuse, drug abuse, violence and assault getting in the communities where Labor abolished the cashless debit card?

            I don't accept the assertions that are being put forward in that question, and I completely reject the allegations of distraction. If those opposite were being genuine—and actually understood or watched what went on in the past year since we came to government—they would acknowledge that we inherited a number of programs in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             First Nations
            </a>
            portfolio that had no ongoing funding at all. We fixed all that. Not only did we fix that and address that but also we invested more money in areas that needed further investment. This has been led in partnership with states and territories, including the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Territory
            </a>
            , to make sure we get the better outcomes that we are after. Importantly, we're working hand in hand with community organisations on the ground. We are listening to them about what works. That is what we are doing.

               I thank Senator Liddle for the supplementary. I don't accept the costings that she outlined in relation to the referendum. I point out that back in the day when it was bipartisan there was an allocation made in the budget by the former government—almost half of that, from memory, nearly in the order of $200 million—for constitutional recognition. In that fact, the funding we provided to the

                  Senator Liddle, I remind you that there was also a statement about the dollars spent in the referendum. The minister has answered that part of the question, as she is entitled to. It wasn't a direct question on the school. There was a preamble there, and the minister is being relevant.
