        is home to a vibrant and diverse African community, and every year we celebrate a year of all things African and Australian. This year Africa Down Under, which is held annually in Perth, was held. It's the largest African mining event held outside of the African continent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week the 21st conference was held after two years of COVID disruptions and it was the best yet. I had the privilege of joining over a thousand delegates to hear from over 60 presenters and view 70 exhibitions. In total, 355 international delegates participated from 14 African mining nations, including 15 government ministers as well as their heads of mission from Canberra.

        senator, I understand the strategic importance of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean_Rim" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        nations, including, of course, those across Africa, not just in their importance geostrategically but also in the rich cultural, social and economic benefits we provide mutually.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pleasingly, this year's program had strong representation from companies developing projects in the battery and technology metals sector. Few here, and probably across Western Australia, know that there are more than 120
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASX" rel="nofollow">
         ASX
        </a>
        listed companies actively operating or developing over 222 projects across 32 African nations, and 68 per cent of those are based in Perth, more specifically in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         West Perth
        </a>
        . These companies are involved in projects across 21 commodities, and more than 40 of the projects are focused on gold, but there is considerable interest from Western Australian companies also investing in battery metals such as cobalt, copper, graphite, lithium and nickel.
