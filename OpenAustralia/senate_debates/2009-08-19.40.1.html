        Yesterday, Senator Birmingham asked a question of me. I seek leave to table some additional information in response to that question.

        Leave granted.

        Question Without Notice (Sen Birmingham) —On Farm Water Efficiency Expenditure
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yesterday Senator Birmingham raised a number of matters regarding on-farm irrigation efficiency expenditure over the last 12 months to which I said I would respond.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A key component of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        ’s $12.9 billion Water for the Future initiative is our plan to reform the Basin by taking action on over-allocation, declining river health and the emerging impacts of climate change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our plan to help Basin communities meet these challenges has three main elements: extensive investment in more efficient irrigation systems; purchasing water from willing sellers to return to our rivers and wetlands; and a new Basin Plan that will set new scientifically-based, sustainable limits on water use.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Investment in irrigation efficiency is being delivered through the 10 year, $5.8 billion Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure Program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudd_Government" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        has invested in a range of projects under this program, including $98 million of the Government’s $99 million commitment towards the Wimmera Mallee pipeline in Victoria, $2.1 million towards the $400 million Menindee Lakes project, and $28.4 million of the Government’s $120 million commitment towards water supply pipelines to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        ’s Lower Lakes communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of last year’s Intergovernmental Agreement on Basin reform, the Australian Government committed $3.7 billion to Murray-Darling Basin States for priority projects, primarily directed to modernising irrigation delivery infrastructure and on-farm water use efficiency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some of these state priority projects include specific on-farm efficiency components, including $300 million for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        on-farm water efficiency projects, and $115 million for Queensland on-farm efficiency projects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of the NSW State Priority Project, applications opened in June this year under the $650 million NSW Private Irrigation Infrastructure Operators program. Proponents are able to include an on-farm irrigation efficiency component in their project proposals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the scale and scope of all Basin state priority infrastructure projects, good planning is an essential pre-requisite and this takes time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That’s why the Australian Government has already spent more than $4.25 million to date on both irrigation

        assessments and irrigation Modernisation Planning grants. These grants are intended to assist in the development of plans to upgrade regional irrigation systems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Overall I am keen see further progress on Basin State Priority irrigation project proposals.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        stands ready to invest as soon as project business cases have been submitted and subjected to due diligence assessment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following-on from my announcement last year of the Australian Government’s On-farm Pilot program, I approved $5.6 million in funding for three successful projects earlier this year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Lachlan Catchment Management Authority and Border Rivers-Gwydir Catchment Management Authority have signed funding agreements for two of these projects, and work is now proceeding. The first payments for these projects will be made shortly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A funding agreement for the third project, developed by Murray Irrigation Limited, is expected to be signed soon.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, the development of these projects has paved the way for the $300 million On-Farm Irrigation Efficiency Program which I announced in May as part of the 2009-10 Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Running over four years, this $300M program is focused on the Lachlan and southern connected system of the Murray-Darling Basin.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After a period of close consultation with irrigation stakeholders over June and July of this year, I expect to be able to open the first funding round soon.
