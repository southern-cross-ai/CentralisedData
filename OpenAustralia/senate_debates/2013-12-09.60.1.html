        My question is to Senator Ronaldson, the Minister representing the Minister for Industry. I refer to the government's repeated statements that any further funding for the auto manufacturing industry would be determined after the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        inquiry into Australia's auto industry hands down its findings. I also refer to the Prime Minister's comments on Friday that there is not going to be any extra money for the car industry and his confirmation that there was going to be a $500 million cut from the auto industry. Given the inconsistencies between these two statements, what is the government's position?

         The first thing I would say is that honourable senators and those listening today should reflect on what the first question was in this chamber. The first question was about politics—not a question in relation to the future of the car industry but a political question. Senator Carr through Senator Wong started off today talking about the last four days. The last four days have been about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         playing politics. Have we heard from Senator Carr or Senator Wong in her first question one word about the industry people who survive on the car industry and others? Not one word.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will make it quite clear where the government is in relation to the car industry. Then I will talk about what Senator Carr did when he was the industry minister, and that is a very long diatribe. I will say this: the government has made it quite clear that we believe in a stable and sustainable motor car industry. Holden themselves have made it quite clear that they agree with our plan for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         timetable. You know, Senator Carr, as I know that there will be an interim report before Christmas. There will be a final report before the end of March. Unlike the Australian Labor Party and unlike Senator Carr, we are running a no-surprises government, and the car industry knows full well—

                 Again I say to the chamber that Senator Carr had the opportunity to address the issue of the car industry today. He has chosen to play cheap politics, probably a bit like the cheap politics he played in relation to the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBT" rel="nofollow">
                  FBT
                 </a>
                 : no consultation. The former industry minister actually lumbered the automotive industry with a tax that he did not even discuss with them—not one bit of conversation with them. That was going to destroy the automotive industry. It took the coalition to reverse it, it will take the coalition to remove the carbon tax, it will take the coalition to remove the mining tax and we will lift the cost impost off the automotive industry and manufacturing generally.
