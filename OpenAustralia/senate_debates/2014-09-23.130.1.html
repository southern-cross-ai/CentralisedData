        Bullying is a scourge and we all have a role to play. Firstly, we can ensure that we ourselves do not engage in it personally. Secondly, we need to express our disapproval in no uncertain terms to those who engage in this unacceptable practice. Thirdly, we can offer comfort, support and succour to those who are the victims of bullying.

        In recent times I had reinforced to me the potential consequences of bullying when I was presented with a 49,000-strong petition calling for law reform in this area. The petition was tabled and presented earlier today. The petition was presented to me on Saturday, 6 September, by Chloe Fergusson's sister, Cassie Whitehill. The presentation occurred at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackmans_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Blackmans Bay

        beach, my local beach, where I grew up, learnt to swim and still go running from time to time. It is a great community asset.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chloe Fergusson, too, enjoyed Blackmans Bay beach. She no longer can, because she is no longer with us—the result of what is suspected to be suicide, which occurred just over one year ago, as a result of sustained bullying. The close group which presented me with the petition represents the charm of my home state of Tasmania. One of the group is a friend of a child of mine; another was in the wedding party of a brother of mine. The point I seek to make is that Chloe was part of a close-knit community where people know each other. Despite this, a year or so ago it appears she took her life. A coroner's inquest is still to be held. However, it appears—and the facts as outlined to me are—that, at first, unknown to her family, Chloe's life was being undermined by a steady dark encroachment at her high school, where she began to be subjected to sustained and systemic bullying. Her family became aware of the problem, and made numerous representations to the school and sought counselling. In the end, it was decided that Chloe should change schools. Despite this family support, in the words of her family: 'Chloe was living a secret nightmare.' On 10 September last year, Chloe stepped off her school bus and was met by a group of girls who set about attacking her, punching her and ridiculing her. Chloe did not fight back. One of her attackers recorded the ambush on her mobile phone and then put a message on Facebook inviting others to see the footage. Two days later, unable to cope with this private pain and not knowing where to turn, Chloe appears to have made the heartbreaking decision to take her own life. She was 15.

        Stories of school bullying are not new. We have witnessed many examples of the impact of savage words, especially on young people at school or starting out in the workplace. But the advent of social media over the last 20 years has meant that the significant effect of bullying in the classroom or the playground can be compounded many times in magnitude because of the almost instantaneous publishing and reach of bullying images and wounding comments. This cyberbullying is a real threat to the social fabric of our society and a threat that has a particular impact on young and vulnerable Australians, especially the sending of hateful text messages or the posting of malicious comments. This is a real and present danger to the health and wellbeing of young Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community outpouring at the loss of Chloe has been reassuring and heart-warming for her family and friends. As a community, we all need to be more alert to ensure that our support is provided earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been a privilege to be asked to present the petition which was tabled earlier today, as has been the interaction with Chloe's family and friends.
       </p>

        Bullying needs to be opposed in all its forms. And remember: that starts with you and me. But government does have a role, and that is why the parliamentary secretary for communications, the Hon.

        , on 17 September, just recently, announced that the government was preparing legislation to establish a children's e-safety commissioner to enhance online safety for children. I commend the government on this initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        I salute Cassie Whitehill and her supporters for their determination to make a difference—a difference for good. Chloe's voice has been, and will be, heard.
