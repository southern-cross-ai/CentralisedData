        As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Parkinson's it was my pleasure to host, along with Senator Askew, the National Summit to End Parkinson's disease last night at

        . Parkinson's disease is now the fastest growing neurological disorder globally. Over 200,000 Australians are currently living with Parkinson's, with this number expected to double by 2040. Currently, there is no cure nor any way to slow it down. There is also no nationally coordinated strategy to tackle this disease—that is to say, until now, with the formation of the National Parkinson's Alliance, launched at last night's summit. For the first time, thanks to the efforts of the National Parkinson's Alliance, we now have a memorandum of understanding between all the states for a comprehensive and collaborative national plan on tackling Parkinson's disease. The significance of this to sufferers of Parkinson's and their loved ones cannot be underestimated. Until now, patients have been subjected to a postcode lottery when it comes to accessing services and support. As we heard last night, even accessing basic information on where to go after being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease has sadly, in many cases, been totally lacking.

        In congratulating the new alliance on their achievements so far, I must acknowledge my fellow Tasmanian Dr Harley Stanton, whose own inspirational journey after being diagnosed with Parkinson's ultimately led to the creation of this new national alliance. Over 80 people attended the summit, including clinicians, researchers, politicians and people living with Parkinson's disease as well the patron of the alliance, the Governor-General, His Excellency General the Hon. David Hurley

        Last night's summit was a demonstration of unity, commitment and determination to take serious national action on not only improving the lives of patients and their families but one day ending Parkinson's—
