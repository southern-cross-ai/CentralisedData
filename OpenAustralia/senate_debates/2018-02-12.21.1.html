        This is another example of the coalition not consulting and not understanding what the real issues for the community are. This is a government so enmeshed in its own internal problems that it never gets to a stage where it properly consults with a community or the general community. This is a government that really doesn't get it. The bill that's before the Senate is about trying to push the government's paternalistic approach eventually onto every Indigenous community in the country. What we are saying is that, if there are those in a community—the majority of the community—that want to deal with the cashless welfare card, that is one thing, but to simply push along with what is not a clear outcome in relation to this cashless welfare card when there is still a wide diversity of opinion in Indigenous communities on this card is another thing, and the government should take note of the concerns that are being put there.

        We support genuine community-driven initiatives to tackle drug and alcohol abuse. I want to make it clear that we do not support a national rollout of the cashless debit card. I heard Senator Hanson earlier in the debate—always bringing the debate to the lowest point, always pushing a divisive approach—

          can whinge all they like, but they know that whenever there is a divisive issue Senator Hanson will be at that divisive point. She'll be out there pushing division. She'll be out there pushing this society to break apart. That's exactly what they are doing.

          I won't take any interjections from this rabble of a government across here, who do not understand what it's like ever to battle. There's nobody battling in this community more than
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
           Indigenous Australians
          </a>
          . This lot over here—the privileged group, the Nationals and the Liberals, the hoi polloi of Australian society—don't understand what it's like to battle in this country. They don't understand what it's like to have to battle to put food on the table. That's why they cut penalty rates. That's why they want to give $65 billion to the big end of town. And that's why Senator Hanson trails in their wake with all of the division, all of the nonsense that she goes on with; that's what she does. So she's just another vote for the Liberals and Nationals in this place. She may as well join the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
           Liberal National Party
          </a>
          and be honest with people about what she's doing. Just be honest for once with the communities in Queensland and the regional communities across this country that One Nation are no more than another lapdog like the National Party to the Liberal Party, doing the Liberal Party's bidding.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is a government that is so off the mark that it's now in a position where it won't take steps to look after the community; it wants to cut penalty rates. Remember, it was Senator Hanson who, right at the start, was in there advocating for penalty rates cuts until she was forced into a different position, because the people whom she claims she stands up for depend on penalty rates. The Indigenous communities are entitled to have a position where they can make their own way forward, where they are properly consulted on this card. What we say is that you just cannot roll over—
