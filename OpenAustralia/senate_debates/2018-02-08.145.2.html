        During question time on Tuesday, I agreed to seek advice from the Minister for Health on whether he'd held certain discussion with his state counterparts. I also agreed to seek advice in relation to Senator Brown's question with respect to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and Tasmania, which I have done. I've been advised that there have been no formal discussions between the minister and his state counterparts in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . Commonwealth payments to the states and territories through activity based funding for public hospitals are not affected by changes in the methodology adopted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Grants_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Grants Commission
        </a>
        in making recommendations on the distribution of GST revenue. Further questions relating to the GST should actually be directed to the Treasurer or his representative in his place.
       </p>

        The Turnbull government is continuing to provide record funding to state and territory public hospitals under the national health agreement.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        support for state and territory public hospitals has grown from $13.3 billion in 2012-13 under the former Labor government to $22.7 billion in 2020-21 under the Turnbull government. The Commonwealth funding for public hospital services in Tasmania has increased from $299 million to $441.6 million in 2021, a 47.7 per cent increase over that period. In South Australia, the Commonwealth funding for public hospital services has grown from $1 billion in 2013 to $1.5 billion in 2021, or a 47 per cent increase over this period. Any assertion that there were any cuts is an absolute fallacy.
