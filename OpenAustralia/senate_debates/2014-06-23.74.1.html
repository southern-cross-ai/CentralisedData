         ): I thank Senator Boswell for that question. As his long and distinguished Senate career draws to an end, I would like on behalf of all Australia's veterans to thank Senator Boswell for his longstanding interests in their concerns. I am pleased to get another question from our side in relation to veterans' affairs. This is the second one in five sitting days. I note that there has not been a question from the opposition since 27 March this year—85 days and 33 Labor questions, not one in relation to veterans' affairs, which shows exactly where their priorities lie.

         At the last election, in our policy—and we were the only major party to have a policy; the

          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         did not—we made it quite clear that the mental health challenges of veterans and their families would be part of our four-pillar policy. And since coming to government we have indeed started implementing those programs. On 11 June in Adelaide I announced the largest and most comprehensive study into the needs of contemporary veterans and their families ever undertaken.

With the increased operational deployment of the ADF over more than a decade and the draw-down of

            <p>
             I thank Senator Boswell for his final supplementary question. We view veterans' mental health as absolutely fundamental to where this nation is heading. We believe that early intervention is the key to helping these young men and women and their families. The Australian government is currently spending $166 million per annum, uncapped, on the mental health needs of our serving men and women and ex-serving men and women. Quite frankly, this nation cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of the past. What was done to those men returning from Vietnam so long ago now this nation simply cannot do to the young men and women returning from recent conflicts. We are determined to address their needs.
