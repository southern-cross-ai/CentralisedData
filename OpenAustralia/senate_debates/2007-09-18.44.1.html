        My question is addressed to Senator Coonan, the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is the minister aware that 14 September this year was the 60th anniversary of the first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        peacekeeping mission? Is the minister aware of reports that Australia now ranks 67th in the world in terms of our commitment of troops to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        missions? Can the minister outline how the government can justify committing some 1,575 troops to Iraq among the approximately 160,000 coalition troops there and yet is not willing to commit troops to Darfur, where the presence of professional Australian troops could make a significant difference?

         I thank Senator Stott Despoja for her question. No, I was certainly not aware of the statistic that Senator Stott Despoja mentioned in her question. She does in fact refer specifically to the situation in Darfur. I have to say that of course Australia welcomes the

          UNAMID

         —to take over responsibility for peacekeeping in Darfur from the African Union mission in Sudan by 31 December 2007. Australia has also welcomed the Security Council’s authorisation for UNAMID to use force to protect civilians and humanitarian workers and to support the implementation of the Darfur peace agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is encouraged by recent UN-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AU" rel="nofollow">
          AU
         </a>
         discussions with Darfuri rebel groups and by the prospect of negotiations between these groups and the government of Sudan. Australia recognises of course that there are substantial obstacles to a settlement. Australia has made and will continue to make significant efforts to relieve the crisis in Darfur. Since mid-2004 we have provided more than $71 million in humanitarian aid to Sudan and almost $11 million to address the spillover effects in neighbouring countries. Australia certainly has offered to provide doctors and nurses to assist the UN with this peacekeeping force. So, Senator Stott Despoja, obviously aid and efforts in peacekeeping can take different forms. Australia is very willing to step up to the plate in tragic situations such as those that we have seen in Darfur to well and truly do our bit. If there is some further information that Minister Downer can give me to add to my answer then I will most certainly convey it to Senator Stott Despoja.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer and certainly acknowledge the aid provided by our government to Sudan, but I ask the minister to get more information about why the government will not commit ADF personnel not to Sudan generally—I understand that it is slightly different in southern Sudan—but to Darfur specifically? Why will Australia not provide peacekeeping troops as part of that

          mission that we have welcomed so strongly? Given our proud reputation in contributing to peacekeeping missions—something like 73 deployments to 64 countries since the first mission—how does the minister explain our decline in contributions? In fewer than 10 years, from 1999 to this year, we have gone from seventh in the world to 67th. Can the minister explain that decline in contributions?

           I thank Senator Stott Despoja for the supplementary question. I reiterate the fact that Australia takes very seriously our role in stepping up to the plate with assistance. Just to continue with the case that I was previously engaged in about Sudan, I note that—apart from our $71 million in humanitarian aid since mid-2004, with almost $11 million to address the spillover effects on neighbouring countries—we have also provided 15 specialist ADF personnel to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            United Nations
           </a>
           mission in Sudan that was established in March 2005 to support the implementation of a north and south comprehensive peace agreement. We have a very proud record of sending our

            AFP

           officers on peacekeeping efforts. We sent them to Cyprus, just to mention one mission. We have been involved in over 40 missions in past years. Mr

           police recently. I will get some further information for Senator Stott Despoja, but I do not think the thrust of her question is supported. Australia steps up to the plate and takes seriously our responsibilities in those particular situations.
