         Vodafone Australia
        </a>
        in March 2012? Is the Prime Minister aware that in June 2012, during Mr Morrow's tenure as CEO, Vodafone Australia uncovered the illegal hacking of a journalist's phone records and texts and identified that it was a criminal breach of the

        to investigate this criminal act and that KPMG then produced a report for Vodafone confirming the criminal act took place?

         I am advised that the Prime Minister was aware of claims that a Vodafone employee accessed the phone records of a Fairfax reporter. The

          Telecommunications Act

          Privacy Act
         </a>
         1988 provide strong protections prohibiting unauthorised access to a person's telecommunications information. It is also an offence under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 for anyone to access stored communications without a warrant. This includes the content of text messages.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is understood that Vodafone has issued a statement about the matter, advising that it commissioned an independent investigation. It is also understood that it reported the matter to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police

           As to the exact time, I will see if the Prime Minister has any information to assist the honourable senator. In relation to what
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
            ACMA
           </a>
           did or did not do, that is a matter for ACMA, which I understand is an independent authority. In relation to Mr Morrow, Mr Morrow has given his evidence and, unless Senator Conroy is suggesting that that evidence is somehow false, that evidence should remain and be accepted. We know that Senator Conroy has the capacity to besmirch people's reputation at Senate estimates and in the processes of the parliament. What I would say to the honourable senator is that, unless he has evidence to the contrary, the answer of Mr Morrow should stand.

             The providing of an answer saying, 'I can't recall' about matters that occurred some years ago should not come as any surprise to Senator Conroy. As I understand, he watched Mr Shorten's performance at the royal commission very closely, and the answer 'I can't recall' I think slipped out of a certain person's mouth on a fairly regular basis. So, if that is to be condemned, I would invite the honourable senator to condemn Mr Shorten's performance at the royal commission. But, of course, as is always the wont of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
