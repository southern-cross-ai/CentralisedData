         I thank the senator for his question. The Prime Minister has raised a number of issues with regard to our regional processing initiatives. Those discussions are progressing. As both the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship and the Prime Minister have made clear, this is a process that will require careful consideration and careful negotiation on a regional basis.

               These are sensitive questions. It does not serve the opposition well to suggest that these things can be dealt with in this sort of glib fashion. There have been discussions with a number of regional governments and those discussions remain the province of those ministers until such time as they are able to report fully to the parliament.

Given that Ms Gillard was given the prime ministerial mantle because the previous Prime Minister had lost direction, can the Senate be advised of the main points of difference between Mr Rudd’s and Ms Gillard’s plans for controlling our borders?

                 The discussions that the Prime Minister has had confirm a strong commitment to regional action to address people-smuggling and the readiness of various governments within this region to work with Australia on the development of a regional set of arrangements. The discussions through the G20, and other conversations, have indicated that the regional solution to the problem of irregular migration is being appropriately discussed in private with those governments to achieve the policy outcomes that I would have thought the opposition would be subscribing to as well.

                 , for instance, has indicated that there is value in the regional approach. Other regional leaders have also indicated their support for the initiative.
