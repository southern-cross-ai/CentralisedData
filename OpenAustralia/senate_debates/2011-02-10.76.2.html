         say that we are very pleased by the strong interest shown by the opposition in the Health and Hospitals Fund. Can I also say that the area across all of the health and hospital funding is one that we do take seriously; it is an area where we have health reform going on. Of course, the opposition, during their time in government, would be familiar with what they called their hospital and health reform, because what it did was rip $1 billion out of the health system. What this government has been doing is addressing that by delivering a massive reform to the health system, which was never done by the previous health minister in the Howard government. We are delivering the My Hospital website. We are increasing hospital funding by 50 per cent and delivering 70,000 more elective surgery operations. That is what this government is doing in relation to health and hospital reform. We have agreed to new boundaries for local hospital networks that have removed the old area health services in

          Of course the opposition do not want to hear what our hospital reform agenda is. Why? Because they have no alternative health and hospital reform plan. The only plan the opposition had was to remove $1 billion from the health system. What this government is addressing is the deficit that they left in the health and hospital area. We are addressing it by providing—

This government looks forward to further discussions with the states over the coming days. It is about providing extra funding for hospitals but it will be contingent upon improvements being made, including—

                    , I rise on a point of order. The minister was asked for two quantities: the number of doctors and nurses and the amount of money that had been wasted. He has not addressed either of those issues.

                     , I rise on the point of order. Senator Ludwig was in the middle of a sentence on doctors specifically. For Senator Brandis wasting the Senate’s time, yet again, with a frivolous point of order, I think he should be sat down and the standing orders pointed out to him about repetition. If only he would have just listened; Senator Ludwig was in the middle of a sentence about doctors.

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. That obviously does not include ‘Dr Rudd’ in his little white coat. Given that the Prime Minister has declared 2011 the year of delivery and decision, how many more decisions will be made not to deliver promised programs?

They continue to simply undermine the necessity for us to continue our reform agenda. When you look over the last three years, you see that we have provided training conditional—
