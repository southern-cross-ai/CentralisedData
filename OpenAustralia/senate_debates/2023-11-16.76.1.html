        I am rising to read out a contribution from one of my constituents as part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Voice
        </a>
        in Parliament Week:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am Amelie. I'm 10 years old and live in the electorate of Canberra in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        . How would I make a change for future generations? First, I need to tell you about the Murray-Darling Basin. The Murray-Darling Basin is a drainage basin, incorporating six of Australia's seven largest rivers, and covers an area through Queensland,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , Victoria,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and the ACT. It's very important to the survival of unique flora and fauna and to agriculture.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many farms are sucking in water from the Murray-Darling Basin, like almond farms and cotton farms. They are using too much water, and a lot of fish are dying from a decrease in oxygen in the water that is being taken by blue-green algae that hasn't been cleaned up. I have concerns that the Murray-Darling Basin is going to dry up, and all the fish will die. Blue-green algae is also killing the basin. Blue-green algae can only live in warm places like the Murray-Darling Basin, but it is getting cold and when it gets too cold, the algae will begin to die and suck in more oxygen to attempt to survive.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Again, I ask: how could you make a change for the future generations? Well, I would start with removing the dead algae, filtering in more water and to stop using too much water from the river system. I would like to make a change for the better. I know I can do something that may not sound like much, but here are some tips: re-use plastic, show care to the environment and spread the news that you can help so many people. Everybody can help this situation, and I mean everyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to Amelie for that contribution and for having that permanently in the
        <i>

        now. I think the Youth Voice in Parliament Week is a great initiative, and I was really proud to read out Amelie's words today.
