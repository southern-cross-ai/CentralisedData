        There are nearly 29,000 people in Australia living with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
         HIV
        </a>
        . Thanks to treatment advances, it is now a treatable chronic illness, but there are still people in Australia going without treatment and, potentially, transmitting HIV. In 2019, some 3,000 people were unaware they were HIV positive. But every day there are unsung heroes making a remarkable difference to supporting people with HIV and preventing its transmission—behind the scenes in healthcare support services, in positive communities, and undertaking research and education—and there are countless allies helping to educate people and break down stigma.

        are joining forces to launch, this week, the 2021 Community Champions campaign. A champion could be someone who works in research, care, support, advocacy or policy—and I know many of these people. It could be someone in a rural or remote community, a much-loved ally, a work colleague, a parent or a partner. There are people doing amazing things in this space. Champions' stories are going to be brought to life through this campaign and launched at an event on 25 November, ahead of World

       <p>
        We know the ongoing investment in HIV treatment and prevention can save billions of dollars and can save lives. That is why it is so important to bring to light the important work that's being done by so many in our community. I commend NAPWHA and Gilead Sciences for launching this campaign.
