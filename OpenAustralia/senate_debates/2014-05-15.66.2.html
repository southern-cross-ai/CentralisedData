        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to the centrepiece of the budget, an $80 billion cut to hospitals and schools, and to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise that there would be no cuts to health and no cuts to education. I also refer to

        Premier Mike Baird, who said the funding cuts are 'a kick in the guts'. Is Premier Baird right?

         I am absolutely delighted to be able to talk about the centrepiece of the federal budget, because, unlike as Senator Wong would seek to portray it, the centrepiece of the federal budget is, as Senator Nash outlined in question time yesterday, the medical research foundation—a historic centrepiece position for this government. It is something that will look after future generations for many, many years to come. This is the sort of future planning that the Australian people elected the coalition to undertake. I am delighted to talk about the centrepiece because part and parcel of that centrepiece—and it is emblematic of our budgeting—is that, with this centrepiece, we are looking to the future. We are looking to the future to ensure—

            I was asked about the centrepiece of the budget, and, as is the wont of the Labor opposition, they could not help themselves but misrepresent that which the centrepiece of the budget actually is. So I am correcting the Leader of the Opposition in this place and advising her as to what the actual centrepiece is. But I can understand the Premier of

                I can indicate that I am not aware of what Premier Newman said, but what I do know is that Premier Newman faced a very similar situation to the situation that we now face in Canberra: a profligate Labor government that thought they could just borrow and borrow and borrow as though there were no tomorrow. Premier Newman in Queensland had to take very tough but responsible decisions to get their budget back on track. Similarly, we are seeking to do so in Canberra, and it stands to reason that people that had been given promises that clearly could not be fulfilled will feel disappointed. We as a government understand that. We acknowledge that. But at the end of the day we have to ensure that our government and budgeting are on a sustainable basis.

                  I am not going to get into the semantics as to whether something is a tax rise, whether it is a levy. What I can accept and what I will accept it is that a greater burden will be placed on the Australian people to repay the damage occasioned by the

                    I am in fact acknowledging that what Mr Howard said is very appropriate in the circumstances, because what I have said to those opposite is, 'I will not play the semantics.' I have been here 20 years. Some people say tax rise; some people say levy; some people say surcharge. I accept that there will be an extra burden on the Australian people. We regret that, but we have to do it to repay the debt from Labor.
