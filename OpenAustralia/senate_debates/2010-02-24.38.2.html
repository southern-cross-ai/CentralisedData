        , my question is to Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister’s statement yesterday that he takes ‘full responsibility for the implementation of government programs’, including the failed Home Insulation Program. Will the minister ask the Prime Minister when each of the Prime Minister, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery, were first informed about the risks in the home insulation program and report back to the Senate.

           Well, I will take on notice the questions the senator asks and seek replies. But, as I said, as I understand it both the Prime Minister and Minister Garrett have answered questions in the House of Representatives regarding these matters. And Senator Arbib has been questioned about these matters in the Senate. Obviously, if the opposition are interested in Senator Arbib’s knowledge of these matters, not only have they previously taken them up but they have the opportunity to take them up today with him. That is what question time is about. I do not quite understand why Senator Abetz would ask me what knowledge Senator Arbib had about matters.
          </p>
          <p>
           Clearly, this is a cunning tactic from the tactics committee that escapes me! In any event, I am happy to take on notice the question that Senator Abetz asks. As I said, I think those answers have already been given in the House of Representatives and the Senate, but I will certainly take them on notice.

            , I have a supplementary question. I refer to the Prime Minister’s statement yesterday that he takes full responsibility for the implementation of government programs including the failed Home Insulation Program. Can the minister tell the Senate what actions the Prime Minister has taken in the exercise of that responsibility, and what steps the Prime Minister has taken to hold the minister for the environment to account for his gross mismanagement of the Home Insulation Program?

             Senator Abetz obviously has a desire to stand as a candidate for the House of Representatives in Tasmania! If he wishes to question the Prime Minister about such issues he should get himself a seat in the House of Representatives. I would welcome him nominating because I think that would be to the great advantage of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Labor Party
             </a>
             . But we have had the Prime Minister and Mr Garrett explaining to the Australian public and to the Australian parliament all the issues related to these schemes and the consequential events. They have been available and accountable to the parliament and to the Australian public. They are, at this very moment, in the House of Representatives answering questions, no doubt, from the opposition. That is the forum in which the sort of question Senator Abetz poses ought to be answered.

              , I rise to ask a further supplementary question. I refer to the Prime Minister’s statement yesterday that he takes full responsibility for the implementation of government programs, including the failed Home Insulation Program. Is it a fact that the Prime Minister has done nothing to hold the minister for the environment to account for his gross mismanagement of the Home Insulation Program, and is that not just further proof that the Prime Minister is all talk and no action?

               I think the Australian public listening to this question time will also be at a loss as to what Senator Abetz is thinking he is doing. The Prime Minister and Mr Garrett are available, at this very moment, to answer questions from the opposition about the actions they have taken in relation to these matters. They have repeatedly answered questions about these matters in the House of Representatives, which is the appropriate forum. We welcome that scrutiny, and we have made ourselves accountable.
              </p>
              <p>
               Senator Arbib has been accountable in this chamber. Mr Rudd and Mr Garrett have been accountable in the House of Representatives. That is as it should be under our democratic system of government. Those answers are available to the opposition when they question those ministers in the relevant chambers. So, certainly, when I can help the senator I will but, as I said, I have no idea what the senator thinks he is doing in—
