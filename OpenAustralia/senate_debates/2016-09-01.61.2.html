        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. Can the minister advise the Senate when he or his office first became aware of allegations of abuse at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre?

          I repeat my request as to when, because I do not think the minister gave an approximate date in that answer. I also ask a supplementary question. I refer to the minister's statement the day after the

          report on abuse at the Don Dale Youth Detention Centre:

           The statement is correct. But I think I should perhaps enlarge on that. I was making a statement in the context of the difference between what I had seen the night before on the

           report and everything else that had been on both the public record and, in fact, in both the reports that were provided to the

           government. One was in stark contrast to the other, and I was reflecting on 'I wish we had all known what was really happening,' not what was either reported in the media or, in fact, was in the reports that had been provided to the Northern Territory government. I am sure I would share that with many others.

             Despite falsely asserting that the minister did not know about abuse at Don Dale, can the minister confirm, first, that the

              Thank you for the question. I can confirm—and you have answered the first part of the question for me—it was during the release of those reports and the media in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
               Northern Territory
              </a>
              that I first came to understand about those events. The circumstances under which I received information are—I received no briefing at the time. I said the briefing I should receive was one that all ministers receive. It is a briefing we sign for. We actually say, 'Yes, I've received it.' It would have been a comprehensive briefing. The option you are saying as the other thing is that we had some information in a question time pack. It was exactly the same information—an issue du jour, what is in the media of the day. I can confirm it was exactly the same in the media of the day. You are trying to conflate two types of briefs. One is a brief I know I get. The other is a reflection of the media of the day, and that is what I received in my question time brief at the time. A briefing pack that I should have—
