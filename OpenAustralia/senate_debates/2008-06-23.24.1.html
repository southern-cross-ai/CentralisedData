         The government has made it very clear that it is our intention to move quickly to transform the Australian vehicle industry. We are facing an acute challenge in ensuring that this country is able to respond to the questions of climate change. The previous government chose to ignore these pressures. The previous government chose, for 11 years, to stick its head in the sand and to deny that climate change was an important issue. In fact, I remember that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Leader of the Government in the Senate
         </a>
         at the time indicated on numerous occasions his pride at being a climate change sceptic. Of course, he is now the

          Leader of the Opposition in the Senate

         , and I wonder whether he still holds those views. I wonder whether or not there has been a transformation in his attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is the case that the Australian government has made it very clear to the entire industry that our intention is to move quickly. We established the Bracks review to ensure that the broadest possible consultations are had with the Australian auto industry. As I recently indicated, I have had advanced discussions with the major manufacturers—and many of them are the most significant component manufacturers in Australia and internationally—about the prospects of ensuring that new investments are placed quickly so that we can move to have new vehicles on Australian roads and to do so by 2010. I want to emphasise the point that these will be Australian made cars produced by Australian workers with the most advanced technologies that are available in the automotive industry at the moment, because it seems to be a point that is neglected by the opposition. I am confident that by 2010 Australian made cars will feature low emissions and fuel efficient technologies such as hybrid vehicles, diesel engines, active fuel management, direct injection engines made in Australia, enhanced biofuel capabilities, dual petrol-

         vehicles and LPG-only vehicles. That is all in Australian made vehicles.

            I have indicated to the Senate that I have had extensive consultations right across the industry about moving quickly to actually improve the green credentials of the Australian automotive industry. I have moved quickly to ensure that we keep manufacturing in Australia. I have moved quickly, in consultation and partnership with the Australian auto industry, to meet the challenges that are confronted by the industry in the immediate period. As a consequence of those conversations, I am confident we will see a rapid transformation of the Australian industry, and I ask the simple question: where does the opposition stand on these issues? Where do you stand on these questions? Why do you have such a visceral hatred for the Australian automotive industry? Why is it that you have such contempt for the future prospects of an industry that actually employs 66,000 Australians, an industry that is prepared and willing to meet the challenges that it is facing and to work with government to produce a rapid transformation of that industry? I am absolutely confident that that challenge will be met and I look forward to the opposition changing its attitude to this industry as it begins to understand how serious the challenges are.

             , I ask a supplementary question. The minister’s answer has confirmed what Ford and Holden have confirmed: that the first time they were made aware of access to the green car fund was when they read in the newspaper about the donation, or gift if you like, of $35 million to Toyota—simply a prop up for the Prime Minister’s trip to Japan.

               Minister, does this not confirm that that $35 million gift to Toyota was nothing more than a prop up to the Prime Minister’s trip to Japan? It was simply a photo opportunity, a last-minute, on-the-run policy that had nothing to do with involving the whole of the car industry in future industry planning and good environmental policy.

                The negotiations with Toyota, as has been stated publicly, have been progressing since December last year. So rather than being a deal done quickly, as the senator suggests, this is a proposition that has been canvassed and negotiated since December last year. In fact, it was one of the highest priorities of the government to see that these conversations took place. The 10,000 hybrids to be produced in Australia will be a significant addition to the capacity of this country to manufacture green cars and will provide an enormous boost to the capacity of Australian industry to take part in the international automotive industry. We are one of the few countries—
