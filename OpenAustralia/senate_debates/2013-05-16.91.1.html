       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Collectively these events demonstrate and emphasise the need for a strong, effective and properly resourced offshore petroleum regulatory regime to safeguard human health and safety and the Australian marine environment.

       <p class="italic">
        The bill amends the act by introducing continuing penalties, infringement notices, adverse publicity orders and injunctions .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These tools will enable the regulator to select and apply an appropriate and proportionate regulatory response, depending upon the nature and relative seriousness of the breach that has occurred given the overall set of circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This range of graduated enforcement tools supplement, but do not replace, existing criminal penalties.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Provisions of the bill also strengthen and clarify the application of the 'polluter pays' principle in the act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the event there is an escape of petroleum as a result of operations within a title area, operators will be required to stop, contain, control and clean up the spill, as well as remediate the environment and carry out appropriate environmental monitoring.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the event that the titleholder fails to comply with these requirements following a spill, the 'polluter pays' provisions will also enable the regulator (NOPSEMA or the Commonwealth Minister) to recover from the titleholder the costs incurred by them carrying out remediation activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While recognising that titleholders are operating within the Commonwealth's exclusive jurisdiction, the Australian Government recognises that, should an incident occur, there may be potentially serious environmental consequences in adjacent State and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        jurisdictions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Acknowledging this risk, this bill also provides a statutory course of action for State and Northern Territory governments to recoup the costs, from the responsible titleholder, of cleaning up the escaped petroleum and remediating the damage to the environment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill clarifies existing insurance provisions, ensuring that it is compulsory for a titleholder to maintain sufficient financial assurance to meet any expenses or liabilities arising in connection with work done under the title following an escape of petroleum and also with other extraordinary regulatory costs they might incur. Financial assurance is required to deal with extraordinary costs, expenses and liabilities that a titleholder might not have the capacity to meet. It is not expected to cover ordinary expenses of a titleholder in meeting ordinary operating costs, such as the costs of compliance with title conditions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The polluter pays and financial assurance amendments collectively implement and address the matters raised in Recommendations 95 and 96 of the Report of the Montara Commission of Inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, the bill implements a number of miscellaneous technical and minor policy measures, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        This current set of amendments makes further strides towards addressing issues identified as arising from the Montara incident in August 2009 and underscores the Government's commitment to the maintenance and continuing improvement of a strong, effective framework for the regulation of offshore petroleum activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend the bill to the Senate.

         The opposition supports this legislation as part of the process of ensuring that Australian and global communities are confident in the operation of offshore petroleum assets, particularly in the oil and gas industry—a very important part of the Australian economy. Our gas exports at present come almost entirely from offshore petroleum in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , with some also from offshore petroleum in the waters north of Darwin. It has involved the introduction of the latest technology in the world, that of a floating
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
          LNG
         </a>
         plant located aboard a ship which is larger than an aircraft carrier. It is imperative that Australia moves into the next phase of offshore petroleum production, liquids, condensate and oil, and also gas for the LNG plants to supply the Asian markets in particular. This legislation will ensure that those operations are done safely in an environmentally sustainable way.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendments introduce a number of important provisions, which are supported by the opposition. We believe the offshore oil and gas industry can operate in the manner which allows it to grow without exposing either the workers or the environment to unnecessary risks. We need to have the right legislation to ensure correct and safe operation, but the onus must be on the industry to go above and beyond the requirements of the legislation to do everything it can to ensure that the safety of its workers and the protection of the environment are paramount. Accordingly, I commend the bill to the Senate.
