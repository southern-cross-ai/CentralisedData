        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. I refer to evidence in estimates that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Employment" rel="nofollow">

        with a foreign crew and set sail the following day. I also refer to evidence that the minister and her office were informed in advance. Once informed, what action did the minister take to defend Australian jobs on the MV

         I thank Senator Sterle for the question. If Senator Sterle was listening to the evidence at estimates, he would know that it is always the case in these types of disputes that the department is made aware of them. But in terms of what occurred on the

         In relation to the issue of Australian jobs, I see that Senator Sterle, a great defender of the actions of the

             </a>
             members working on that ship were in breach of orders made by the Fair Work Commission. Those orders had been challenged in the Federal Court, and the Federal Court had referred them back to the Fair Work Commission. So, Senator Sterle, you and those on that side of the chamber may come in here and defend the unlawful actions of the MUA, but I will not.
            </p>
            <p>
             I will tell you what I will defend. I will defend the small business owners in Portland who did not get business because the MUA held the ship hostage. I will stand here and defend them. More than 2,000 people are employed directly and indirectly by the aluminium smelter in Portland. Those jobs have been saved because of the actions of Alcoa. I will not come in here and defend unlawful action by the most militant union in Australia. It held a ship hostage and almost destroyed the jobs of small business owners in the town of Portland.

                     , I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. I refer you to the statement that you made at the commencement of this session's sittings where you made some comments about ministers' relevance to the question. Today you have done as you said you would in that statement, and that is to remind the minister of the question. There was only one question. It was on whether or not the minister or her office were aware that guards would be present and whether she supports the use of security guards to forcibly remove Australian workers. So a rant about the

I am not asking for a rant against any union. It is either a yes or a no, Mr President. With the greatest of respect, she is not being relevant to the question.
