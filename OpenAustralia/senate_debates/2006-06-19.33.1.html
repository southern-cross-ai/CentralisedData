        My question is to the Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro. I understand that the minister recently visited the United States. Would the minister inform the Senate about the purpose of his visit and the outcome of any discussions with key stakeholders in relation to issues of ageing and aged care policy?

         I thank Senator Humphries for his question and for his continuing strong interest and involvement in aged care issues. I have just returned from the United States, where I was able to share information and views with key stakeholders on ageing policy and the aged care system. Additionally, I was privileged to attend, in Washington

         I can report to the Senate that during my trip to the United States I had a large number of very useful meetings regarding ageing matters. In Austin, Texas, I met with the adviser to Governor Perry on ageing issues, the Texas Land Commissioner, who is responsible for the administration of the Texas veterans homes, and Mr Pat Kennedy, a director of the Holiday Retirement Corporation. I also met with the Texas Secretary and Deputy Secretary of State. In

                   It is appropriate for me to report at this stage that I have returned from that trip convinced that, while there are some things we can do differently in Australia, overall by comparison to the United States we are doing well on a number of important fronts. Firstly, the key policy makers that I met with were most envious of the fact that the Australian government has been able, by taking difficult decisions and exercising fiscal discipline, to eliminate all of the $96 billion of public sector debt bequeathed to this nation under, in part,

The government’s approach of increasing the availability of community care so that people have the option of staying in their own home to receive care close to their friends and communities was strongly supported by the

                      , I raise a point of order. The opposition’s behaviour during the answer to that question was completely unacceptable and completely unruly. There are only three question times to go; you would think they could manage to maintain some order during the last week.

                       , on the point of order: senators are getting frustrated by ministers misusing question time. Quite frankly, if the minister wants to embarrass himself and bring back the photos and tell people what a wonderful time he had, he should do that at the government senators’ cup-of-tea time rather than now and abuse the process of the Senate.

                        Order! There is no point of order. A point of order was raised during the answering of that question which went to relevance and I ruled that the minister was relevant because he was asked that question. I would ask the Senate to come to order.
