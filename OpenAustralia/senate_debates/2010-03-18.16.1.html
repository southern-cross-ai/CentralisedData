        I move:

       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.

        I seek leave to table the explanatory memorandum to the bill and have the second reading speech incorporated in

        The speech read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Now, more than ever, the state of the Murray-Darling Basin is the most pressing environmental and social crisis this nation faces.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For more than a century, state and federal governments have treated this river like some kind of magic pudding.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They have over-allocated the river time and time again, and my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        has paid the heaviest price.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We’re the ones being asked to watch the Lower Lakes die.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our irrigators are the ones who are suffering the most.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And all of us are the ones facing the very real prospect of not having enough water for critical human needs within a decade.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And I must say, the response to this current crisis by the state and federal governments has been nothing short of underwhelming.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Council" rel="nofollow">
         The Council
        </a>
        of Australian Governments agreement on the Murray-Darling Basin has so many holes in it, if it was a boat it would sink.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have said on numerous occasions that I believe only a federal take-over will achieve the once in a hundred years fundamental reform of the river system that is so desperately needed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need one river system with one set of rules. And only a true national take-over can achieve that.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, in the absence of a full federal takeover, this Bill gives the Murray-Darling Basin Authority the power to manage the water resources of the Basin as a single system during periods of extreme crisis, in situations where there is significant rainfall in areas of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This would mean that one single Authority will be able to make decisions as and when required in the overall, national and best interest of the Murray-Darling Basin, rather than relying on the individual and, perhaps at times, selfish, interests of each state and territory coming into play.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There have been two occasions in recent months in Queensland, where floods and heavy rain have resulted in overflowing rivers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Each year, wild weather events around the country continue to take place—flooding in the north while there’s drought in the south.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There’s no doubt we are seeing the effects of climate change, and given the dire situation our Lakes are facing, it only makes sense to send these waters south.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I was pleased that, earlier this year,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales

        recently reached an agreement with South Australia to divert 148 gigalitres to South Australia, just enough to save
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Alexandrina" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Alexandrina
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Albert" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Albert
        </a>
        for at least another year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While this generosity is appreciated, it seems like South Australia is constantly being left to beg for water from the eastern states.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under this Bill, in events of significant rainfall in areas of Australia and during periods of extreme crisis, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will take full responsibility for the management of water resources.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have consulted the experts on this issue in developing this Bill and at this time I would like to take a moment to thank Professor Mike Young from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         University of Adelaide
        </a>
        for his time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Based on science, the definition of an extreme crisis under this Bill is considered to be:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When the level of water in lake Alexandrina is continuously less than +0.0
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Height_Datum" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Height Datum
        </a>
        (sea level) for more than 3 consecutive months; and,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When allocations to high security water entitlement holders in any irrigation district have been below 20 percent for more than 2 consecutive years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the lakes are below sea level then quite simply no water can flow to the Coorong.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under this Bill, when these levels or periods are reached, the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will be able to address the crisis from a national perspective but to ensure the Lower Lakes survive, including by making the groundwater and surface water allocation decisions necessary for system maintenance and to maintain river heights at a minimum level; for the environment; for salinity management and for water uses and holders and water access entitlements or water access rights.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will also empower the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to share, manage and allocate Basin water resources, make allocations to entitlement holders and allow the diversion of water from flood-affected states or where there is significant rainfall.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reason the Murray-Darling Basin Authority would have these powers is because, as a national body, it will act in the interest of all states and territories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, we have states and territories, each with vested interests making decisions about the Murray-Darling in the interest of their own states.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But what is needed in the long term is a full federal takeover—one concentrated authority—to make decisions about the Murray-Darling in the best interest of the river and of the nation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I understand this Bill is an interim measure as we await the Basin Plan’s release next year but we cannot wait until next year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe it’s a vital measure to give our rivers a fighting chance—and it’s needed now.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
