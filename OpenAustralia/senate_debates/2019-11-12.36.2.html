         I thank Senator McGrath for his most important question. Today all of our thoughts and prayers are with those in Queensland and

          New South Wales
         </a>
         who are dealing with the threat, and also now the consequences, of these catastrophic bushfires. Already they've endured days and long nights of anxiety and disruption, not knowing where the fires will strike next.
        </p>
        <p>
         Firstly, I pay tribute to our amazing emergency services workers who are battling these fires in extraordinary and almost unimaginable circumstances, but I particularly thank our ADF personnel who are supporting the firefighting efforts. Royal
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Air Force

         737 and C-130 aircraft have already transported firefighters and their equipment from Canberra, Adelaide and Hobart to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
          Port Macquarie
         </a>
         , an area of high and immediate need. Singleton and Lismore Defence bases in New South Wales are already also providing accommodation and catering to firefighters from the Victorian Country Fire Authority. Today and tomorrow,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_and_Navy" rel="nofollow">

         helicopters will also support firefighter movements, air observers and civilian rescuers as requested.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday, I asked the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of the Defence Force
         </a>
         to give an order to all military base commanders, making clear that they have the authority to use local Defence assets and resources to respond to any local contingencies. Defence is also postured to provide further airlift and is prepared to provide assistance in areas such as aerial fire reconnaissance, logistical support and also engineering on request. It is important to remember that our ADF members are not trained firefighters, but they are doing everything that they can to help the community in these current catastrophic circumstances.

            As Minister for Defence at this time of unprecedented fire threat, I'm focused on ensuring that the ADF is ready to provide additional support for the nation's frontline first responders. Our first call is always to our regular forces and the capabilities that they bring with them, but work is also now underway to scope the availability and also the readiness of our highly capable Reserve forces across all three services. ADF reservists are already regularly employed for emergency disaster assistance and disaster recovery under voluntary 'call for' arrangements, as they are called. Our Reserve emergency support forces already have 120-person capacity in Brisbane and also 130-person capacity in Sydney to provide transport, logistics and other requested support.

               In addition to the 'call for' activities that we now have underway, I'm also working with Defence to work through how we can provide further response to larger, more severe and also more protracted natural disasters beyond, as I've said, the 'call for' arrangements. A broader response can include a compulsory call-out of Reserves if the situation requires. Reserve forces can be called out by the Governor-General in accordance with section 28 of the Defence Act. This mechanism has never been used. Defence is working through every aspect of such a call-out at the moment to ensure that we are prepared if required. Defence will continue tasking discrete elements of the
