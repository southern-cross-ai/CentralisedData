       <p>
        There are amendments that have been circulated in my name to the Customs Amendment (Product Specific Rule Modernisation) Bill 2019. I will be brief in speaking to these amendments. I did ventilate Labor's reason for moving these amendments in my second reading speech. As several speakers have noted in this debate, the effect of this legislation would be to take what is currently a disallowable instrument by the parliament and make that decision about rules of origin and product specific rules a decision of some bureaucrat. It would take away the oversight of this parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are talking about free trade. It must be fair trade. The community must have confidence that its parliament and its representatives have the opportunity to ensure it is fair trade. Not maybe once every five years and not possibly through an inquiry that you might get up through a committee; in fact, we must have the ongoing right to ensure that the free trade agreements and the rules that govern them remain the province of this chamber, this parliament, to disallow if necessary.
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of Labor's amendment today is to reinsert the parliament's right to disallow certain rules under this legislation. As Senator Lambie just said in her speech, any time the government—this government in particular—says it is just making some technical changes, we really shouldn't worry ourselves about it, it'll be streamlined and all so much better, we need to be alert to the fact that they are taking away the oversight of this parliament. The effect of the amendment that has been circulated is to reinsert that oversight by members of this parliament. So I ask members—particularly those who have expressed a view that the parliament should retain that oversight function—to support the amendment.
       </p>
       <p>
        By leave—I move the amendments circulated in my name together:

         My questions are brief and there are a number of them. Minister, is it true that in 2018 nine of Australia's 15 free trade agreements were amended by the Customs Amendment (Product Specific Rule Modernisation) Act 2018 and that this bill simply modifies the remaining six free trade agreements?

           Minister, based upon the comments of Senator Carr and Senator Ayres—because we listened to them and we went back and did some more research—did the 2018 bill pass with the support of the opposition?

            Yes, I can confirm that the identical bill passed with the support of Labor. In fact, Senator Carr himself spoke in support of this same legislation two years ago for other free trade agreements. In fact, I think his words were that it was a 'simple administrative process'.

                         There are a couple of questions resident in that. Despite the assertions of those opposite here in the chamber today, there, of course, still is parliamentary scrutiny of this bill through JSCOT—that has not changed. Again, this bill is exactly the same as the bill that this chamber passed in 2018.

                             I'm not quite sure a personal opinion is appropriate for me to answer. However, what I can say is that two years ago, the Labor Party, including Senator Carr, strongly supported these exact same measures for these

                             s subject to this bill, as they did two years ago for those other countries FTAs. So it is hard to see that there is anything else but playing some very base politics in this today, because they were supported two years ago.

                              This is my final question. In 2018 apparently Senator Carr spoke on the first bill. In his comments he said that it should be non-controversial, according to

                               opposes free trade agreements, because we don't believe they're fair trade. I'm pleased to see Senator Keneally now using our label. We want fair trade. Having said that, and having made that very clear this morning, I again say that we will support this, because it doesn't have any material impact. All it does is reduce the burden to companies, employers and jobs in this country, and it reduces the bureaucracy and the cost to the taxpayers. That is why we are supporting this. We will continue to oppose free trade agreements, but we will make whatever we have better in any way we can.

                                In fact I've got the comments from Senator Carr—again, completely contradictory to what he said two years ago. This is what Senator Carr said two years ago about the identical bill for the other set of free trade agreements. In the Senate debate on the 2018 bill, Senator Carr argued that the bill should have been introduced as non-controversial legislation, given its minor administrative effect. In fact, he said this: 'These are minor amendments ensuring consistency between our legislation and the various texts of the agreements.' I will leave it to other members of this chamber to make their conclusions about his position now.

                                    The answer is very clear: this is not a new measure. We did this two years ago with the support of the opposition, who said it was uncontroversial. It was a simple administrative matter. And this bill here today is doing the exact same thing for another tranche of Australia's free trade agreements, to bring them into alignment with the ones that we, again, in this chamber agreed to in 2018.

                                      Thank you for that question. There are two parts to my answer. The first is that my advice is that these regulations have never been disallowed in this chamber, which I understand is why those opposite and the governments two years ago agreed that this was an administrative process. But in terms of the parliament's ability to scrutinise future changes to

                                      s, does this make any change? No, it does not. The bill removes the need to replicate technical changes to the

                                          The situation here is very simple. It's a lesson that all senators should take note of. If the facts change, what do you do? You change your mind. That's been the custom and practise of good political operators for time immemorial. It's all very well for you to quote from the
                                          <i>
                                           Hansard
                                          </i>
                                          . I'm quite capable of changing my mind if I have the facts. The facts are these: We now have a situation in this parliament where we pass something like 2,000 bills a year; 50 per cent of them are carried with measures that contain instruments for delegated legislation. Of those in recent times, 20 per cent of all the legislation we've been carrying has a non-disallowable instrument built into it. We ourselves are taking away our rights to examine legislation.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          I've been on the front bench of this parliament for some 23 years. In this parliament, I've had the privilege of serving on other committees. As a consequence of that, I've had the opportunity to look at the detail in which this legislative practice has grown, instrumentally, under governments of all descriptions, where we've turned over our responsibilities to the Public Service, and we should not allow that to continue. That's the fundamental principle that this amendment proposes: that we address our responsibilities. If there's a problem, we have the chance to fix it. It is no more complicated than that, Senator Roberts, you great expert on international trade. It's no more complicated than our capacity to say, 'Sorry, Mr Bureaucrat, you've got it wrong.'
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          What I can also tell you is that, in those 23 years of service on the front bench, repeatedly I understood how free trade agreements could be abused—particularly the rules of origin and the capacity of various companies and various countries to shift goods around the globe. We should not allow these measures to be shifted off to some minor consideration by a parliamentary committee without the resources, by members of parliament without the resources, to deal with these questions properly. JSCOT is not an appropriate vehicle for parliamentary scrutiny. It is a joke. It is a joke to suggest that anything other than a rubber stamp measure is going to be applied.
                                         </p>
                                         <p>
                                          Our job as members of parliament is to ensure the protection of the interests of the Australian people. We have been abrogating that responsibility by allowing so much of the legislation that goes through this parliament—and I'll hazard a guess, Senator Roberts—unread. We find the circumstances when we examine the facts: 50 per cent of it is allowing delegated legislation to be sent off by unelected, faceless bureaucrats, and to 20 per cent of that we have denied ourselves the chance to say, 'No, that's not right.'

                                          This amendment simply says that the proposal this government is trying to impose on us now—to take away the right that is there now—should not be taken away. You say, 'Oh, it's never been used.' Well, that's no excuse to take it away. How ridiculous! That's the sort of mentality that
