        [by video link] My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Minister, the Prime Minister has provided his very clear support for organisations to introduce requirements for mandatory vaccination for their staff. What message does the government have for workers who object to mandatory vaccination?

         , at the outset, emphasise that the government has said all along that vaccination is a voluntary program, that we are not mandating it—aside from certain very high-risk health areas where, while it is still not Commonwealth legislation doing so, we have worked with states and territories in mandating vaccination, such as in relation to health- or aged-care workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is correct that Australia's workplace relations laws do allow for businesses to put in place arrangements that are reasonable in the circumstances for the protection of people that they work alongside of or, indeed, customers that they may work with. It is for businesses to make an assessment in relation to that reasonableness test, and some have chosen to do so in relation to the COVID-19 vaccine—as is their right under existing workplace arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do encourage all Australians to get vaccinated. In doing so, I want to thank and acknowledge the millions of Australians who have done so to date, driving total vaccinations administered in Australia to in excess of 17.1 million doses. That has ensured that we now have nearly 53 per cent of all eligible Australians over the age of 16 having had a first dose. Indeed, of the first age cohort to be eligible for the vaccine, the over 70s, we have now seen more than 85 per cent of them have a first dose and more than 57 per cent of them are fully vaccinated. Of those over 50, more than 75 per cent of them have had the first dose. These are very encouraging numbers, and I continue to urge Australians to make a booking, to get out there, to do the thing that can best save them, their loved ones, their families and their work mates, and that is to get vaccinated.

            to speak for themselves, although I gather they have highlighted that within a food manufacturing workplace such as theirs, with a production line such as theirs—their staff work in close proximity to one another—there are issues they have worked through with their workforce. Engagement and consultation with their workforce is a matter for them, and the advice they seek and the analysis they undertake as to whether they meet the reasonableness test that applies to being able to put such a requirement in place is a matter for them. That's something that Australian businesses had available to them prior to COVID-19, with such reasonable health decisions being a part of workplace arrangements, and it's something that continues. Obviously there needs to be provisions to enable those who have genuine medical or other reasons not to be vaccinated, and I understand such businesses who are making these decisions are applying those arrangements.

              [by video link] In light of your response to that, Minister, and given the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister's strong support for organisations mandating compulsory vaccination in a wide variety of circumstances, will the Prime Minister require Liberal and National Party candidates in the next election to be vaccinated? And will the Prime Minister require disendorsement of members and senators who are not vaccinated?

               [by video link] As I said at the outset, vaccination is a voluntary program. As I have emphasised in both previous answers, there are provisions within Australia's laws that existed prior to the pandemic that enable businesses to put in place reasonable practices to ensure the health and safety of co-workers, customers and others that people engage with. I make it very clear: I urge every single member of the coalition and every single member of the parliament to get vaccinated, just as I do every single Australian. I have done so; my wife has done so; my parents, my family and others have done so; and I would encourage all to do so. I would expect any member of the government to do so and would encourage their constituents to do so in a way that helps to continue to build those numbers which we have seen grow so remarkably in recent times that we are now vaccinating, in the space of a week, a city the entire size of Adelaide.
