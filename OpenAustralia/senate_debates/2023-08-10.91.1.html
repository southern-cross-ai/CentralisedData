        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. This week is National Homelessness Week, which is putting the spotlight on the need for social housing as a long-term solution. Many homelessness service providers have spoken about the challenges facing Australians who are without safe and secure accommodation. Can the minister explain what actions the Albanese government is taking to improve housing outcomes for Australians at risk of homelessness, both now and into the future?

         I'm very pleased to take that question from Senator Grogan, who is someone who has worked for Australians who are struggling for so much of her life, both in the trade union movement and in the social services sector, and who I know has such a personal commitment to improving housing and ending homelessness in this country. Her commitment is shared by other members of our government.
        </p>
        <p>
         We want to ensure every Australian has a roof over their heads. We know that far too many Australians are facing homelessness. I commend the work of the housing minister and I commend the work of all those across governments, across civil society and across businesses and charities who are working together to end homelessness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Access to housing is central to Labor's values. From the Prime Minister—who, as we know, grew up in social housing—to every member of the caucus, we understand how important housing is. It is disappointing that the decade of inaction by those opposite has left this country in the position it has when it comes to safe and affordable homes. We were elected with a plan to help turn this tide, and a key part of the housing agenda is the development of a National Housing and Homelessness Plan. Following the launch of the issues paper this week, public and stakeholders are invited to share their experiences and their expertise. By working together, we can ensure the plan will set out a shared national vision and strategy for how we can, together, better support those in need. We want to hear from as many people and organisations as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         I welcome comments like those from the Property Council who said: 'The federal government are leaning into the challenge.' I welcome comments from the Liberal government in Tasmania, who said: 'We welcome the National Housing and Homelessness Plan issues paper, released today to mark the start of Homelessness Week.'
        </p>
        <p>
         We are committed to improving outcomes for Australians facing homelessness.

           It's great to hear that the Housing and Homelessness Plan is out for consultation so that people can have their say about this critical issue. Yesterday, the Prime Minister said that there'd been very positive and constructive discussions with the states and territories to boost housing supply. Can the minister explain what further actions the Albanese government is taking to improve housing outcomes for Australians?

            As Senator Grogan would be aware, we are pursuing a comprehensive set of measures to improve the availability of housing in this country. This includes an investment of $2 billion in social housing, reintroducing the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund and providing more than half a billion dollars of investment in social and rental homes through the National Housing Infrastructure Facility.

             If I
            </a>
            can go back to the $2 billion that I referenced earlier, the Social Housing Accelerator payment is a payment to the state and territory governments. It will create thousands of rental homes for Australians on social housing waiting lists. Next week the Prime Minister will be meeting with first ministers to have positive and constructive discussions. Our priority for this meeting is very clear. It's about increasing housing supply and housing affordability across this country. National cabinet will be considering ways to improve planning and to improve renters' rights. After a wasted decade, we don't want to waste a day.

              I thank the minister. It certainly sounds like some progress is finally being made. Can the minister provide an update on the crisis and transitional accommodation support that the Albanese government's ambitious housing reform agenda will provide and also advise the Senate about any risks there may be to the government's plan?

               We know that the housing crisis that we have and that Australians are struggling with is a consequence of those opposite neglecting this area of policy and, in particular, neglecting those most in need. I would invite the opposition to put people before politics, not politics before people. We would invite them to stop playing games with the Housing Australia Future Fund.
              </p>
              <p>
               In its first five years this fund will deliver 20,000 social housing properties, 4,000 properties for women and children fleeing domestic violence and older women who are at risk of homelessness. It will provide a $100 million dollars for crisis and transitional housing for women and children, and $30 million to build more housing for veterans experiencing or at risk of homelessness. So we're talking about families fleeing domestic violence, we're talking about older women who are at risk of homelessness, we're talking about crisis housing and we're talking about housing for veterans. We would say to the opposition that you should put people before politics.
