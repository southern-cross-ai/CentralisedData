        I was absolutely delighted to attend once again the Malayalee Association of Queensland's Sangamam festival, which was held to celebrate Easter, Vishu and Eid. I'd like to congratulate Sudha Nair, who is the President of the Malayalee Association of Queensland Inc and her all-female organising committee for the wonderful work they did in bringing the event together. As I said, it celebrates Easter, Vishu and Eid. There were performances from both Indian performers and people of non-Indian heritage. It really did bring the community together. One of the great highlights was the wonderful performance of all the masters of ceremony, the emcees. I'd like to specifically congratulate the emcees, Pooja Suna Sasi, who is a university student, and also the other three, who were school students: Sophie Sunil, Vaidehi Shiju Sankar and Daya Anoop Sudhi.

        just say that Daya was absolutely superb. Here is a young girl who is in primary school; she did impersonations, she did accents and she was absolutely terrificâ€”a star in the making. Congratulations to everyone involved in that very, very successful event.

        The second event I'd like to speak to is an

        service at the Cityhope Church at Ripley under the leadership of their founding pastor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Edwards" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and senior pastor Ryan Germain. That was held on Sunday 14 April 2024. It included an interview with Mr Matt Anderson
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PSM" rel="nofollow">
         PSM
        </a>
        , who's the director of the

        </a>
        and Brigadier Aaron Hassell. Those interviews were conducted by the founding pastor, Mark Edwards
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . They were thoughtful, considered, full of humour and an absolute reflection of Mark Edwards's character. He's the one who provided leadership to the church in 1998 when it acquired land at Ripley. They built that church in what has become one of the fastest-growing areas in Queensland. It is an absolute blessing that that church is in Ripley in one of the fastest-growing areas in Queensland, and serves the community so well. It is a blessing for the community, helping victims of domestic violence, helping people in need through their food bank and doing all the other things the church does to help its community. Once again, thank you so much to everyone at Cityhope Church Ripley, including founding Pastor Mark Edwards OAM and also senior Pastor Ryan Germain.

        Lastly, I'd like to thank my friends in the Queensland Serbian community for hosting the Serbian celebrations in Queensland for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         St George's Day
        </a>
        . What a festival it was. I'd like to particularly thank the president, Aleksandar 'Sasha' Mladenovic, for putting on such a great event.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank Zac Popov, who's the president of St George Willawong Football Club. It was absolutely superb. You can't go past an event where you're given a shot of plum brandy, some bread and some salt when you first arrive. It was absolutely terrific. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President McGrath, that you would have enjoyed it immensely. It would have been an appropriate continuation, perhaps, of your birthday celebrations, which I know actually increased the
