        , I'm going to talk about my great-grandmother, Nan Edna Brown, a beloved elder who gave dignity to others, a Gunditjmara elder born in Hamilton, Victoria, in 1916. Nan was raised by her parents,

        and Mary-Anne nee Lovett McClennan, on Framlingham Aboriginal Reserve, where they used to round us up.

Nan helped her daughter establish the first Aboriginal health service in Victoria. Nan also helped Aunty Iris Lovett-Gardiner establish the first Aboriginal Community Elders Service in Victoria. Nan Edna was also the 1986
