He is the person who refuses to actually act as a leader and deal with Senator Macdonald and then seeks to let him off the leash every now and then.

                       , I, like everyone, have sat here and watched the bad behaviour of Senator Macdonald day after day. And it is even worse when he tries to verbal the Leader of the Opposition and when he continually interjects on every woman Labor senator who stands in this place. His behaviour has been appalling, his behaviour should not be tolerated, andâ€”with the greatest respect, Mr President, you should do something about it because they have got no control over him.

I think if we end it on that note, on the last question of the year, I will call Senator Macdonald to ask his question.

                            for this important question. The North Australia development white paper is a clear demonstration of this government's commitment to regional Australia. It is also recognition of the great benefits to the national economy that will be achieved by developing the North, and the implementation of commitments made by the North Australian white paper is gaining momentum every day. In recent weeks, nearly $600 million in development programming has commenced. Firstly, the $75 million North Australia cooperative research centre, or CRC, that was brought into existence with the appointment of Councillor John Wharton, the Mayor of Richmond Shire as the interim chair.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The CRC will partner universities, research centres, Commonwealth authorities and private sector interests to devise innovative strategies for developing new and exciting North Australian industries as well as protecting those industries from risks and challenges. Most recently we have seen the launch of the government's $500 million National Water Infrastructure Development Fund, $200 million of which is earmarked for North Australia for feasibility studies and capital expenditure in water infrastructure. These exciting developments come on the back of the recently-commenced jewel in the crown of northern development. This is the $5 billion

                            Infrastructure Facility. This facility will enable the private sector and state and territory governments to get large-scale legacy infrastructure projects across the line by providing concessional loans. In addition, we are going to maximise the opportunities for communities to benefit from the increased employment and commercial development that will come from this wave of investment in the Northâ€”especially for the significant Indigenous population that resides in many remote communities across the North. These great steps forward, that may otherwise not have occurred, can now proceed in Northern Australia.

The fund will support a range of activities relating to water infrastructure, including water resource assessments, feasibility studies and capital works. The Department of Agriculture and
