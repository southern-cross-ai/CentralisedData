         I thank Senator Cash for the question. I will remind the Senate that the High Court ruled that indefinite detention is unconstitutional. That upended two decades of legal precedent and bipartisan policy, and that ruling is now the law of the land. I hope that Senator Cash would agree that no parliament and no minister is above the law. That goes to the first part of Senator Cash's preamble about how it has come to pass that immigration detainees have been released into the community withâ€”

              I am explaining how it has come to pass that detainees were released into the community. In relation to the specific matter that Senator Cash raises, we are aware of that case. We will not comment on individual cases. It's before the courts, and we will not risk prejudicing court proceedings. We will do everything in our power, as we have been doing, to deport individuals who have no right to be in the country and to keep the community safe. This is a matter the government takes incredibly seriously. Our law enforcement agenciesâ€”the

               AFP

              , the state and territory police forcesâ€”are working together, and they are doing an extraordinary job. When there is a matter, whether it be a breach of a visa condition or an individual is arrested, then we will manage that as well.

How can they have been continuously monitored if this individual was able to commit the further sexual offences he has now been charged with?
