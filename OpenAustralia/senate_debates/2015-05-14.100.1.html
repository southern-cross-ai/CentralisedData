        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash, representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Can the minister outline to the Senate how the budget creates jobs, boosts growth and secures opportunities for Australians through investment in infrastructure?

         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question. This government is delivering on its commitment to build the infrastructure of the 21st century, and, in doing this, we will support economic growth, we will create jobs, we will link businesses to markets and we are delivering on our infrastructure growth package.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last year, senators will recall, this government made a record investment of $50 billion in infrastructure. This was a record investment for any Australian government, and we are improving road and rail linkages in every state. In this year's budget, we have further boosted our funding for infrastructure. We have started work on 19 new major projects in 2014, and another 55 projects will now commence in 2015. A total of 382 projects across five states and territories have already been announced for 2015-16, with further announcements to be made in the coming weeks.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is building better infrastructure more quickly and, unlike those opposite, at less cost to the Australian taxpayer. How are we doing this? Through new financing and delivery arrangements for some of Australia's biggest projects, like WestConnex and NorthConnex in Sydney, and the Perth Freight Link in my home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Our $5 billion Asset Recycling Initiative is propelling state and territory governments to invest billions into new city-transforming infrastructure projects like the second harbour rail crossing in Sydney and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_Metro" rel="nofollow">
          Capital Metro
         </a>
         light rail project in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         . Of course, as you already heard from our finance minister, this year in our budget the government will establish a $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility that will be available for major infrastructure projects like ports, railways, pipelines and electricity generation. We are also investing heavily, Senator McKenzie, in our regions.

           Thank you very, very much, Senator McKenzie. Well, in Victoria, what do we have? $12.5 million will be allocated under round 1 of the Bridges Renewal Program, with $7.6 million going to local governments. Victoria will also receive $35.7 million under the National Highway Upgrade Program, including for works on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Western Highway

           , the

           .
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition, 19 projects have received funding through the National Stronger Regions Fund. This program will provide $45 million over two years to fund small projects in local communities.
          </p>
          <p>
           There is no doubt, based on this government's record infrastructure spend last year of $50 billion and our further commitment to investing in infrastructure in Australia, that this is a budget that will deliver for all Australians, and it will create jobs and it will boost our economy, but, most of all, it is an opportunity for all.

             Unfortunately, I can, and that of course is: the Victorian Labor Premier, followed by his minions in the Victorian Labor government. What did the Commonwealth do for Victoria? We gave Victoria $1.5 billion of Commonwealth money to build the East West Link. And instead, what did the Victorian Labor government do? Well, they are not building the East West Link; we know that! But they have kept the $1.5 billion that was given to them, and guess what? They have got a surplus budget, created by holding onto the $1.5 billion given to them under a memorandum of understanding which specifically stated that they had to build the East West Link. In typical Labor style—they have no shame at all—they have gone to the people of Victoria and said, 'We have a budget surplus,' but what they have not told the people of Victoria is that they have been robbed of the opportunity for the East West Link.
