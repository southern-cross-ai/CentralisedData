        The Imported Food Control Amendment (Country of Origin) Bill repeals and replaces the definition of 'national standard' in the Imported Food Control Act. The former minister stated in his introduction speech that the bill is an important and final step in implementing country-of-origin reforms. It's minor but significant and will ensure authorised officers can continue to enforce the country-of-origin labelling requirements for imported foods. We support this legislation. It's important to note that country-of-origin labelling was born out of the hepatitis A outbreak in 2015 that was caused allegedly by frozen berries. Food-borne illnesses are serious and have major consequences when outbreaks occur. In 2010 it was estimated that there were 4.1 million episodes of gastrointestinal food-borne illnesses in Australia and only six deaths.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that Mr Joyce said in February this year that there should be better country-of-origin labelling. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'We should have proper country of origin labelling.'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'Maybe other countries are not as concerned about food safety as we are.'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Joyce urged Australians to seek out locally made products.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'Buy Australian and save yourself a pain in the guts.'
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to say he should have checked his facts, because the packages relating to the suspected contaminated frozen berries were clearly labelled with the country of origin. But in this case I commend the bill to the Senate.
