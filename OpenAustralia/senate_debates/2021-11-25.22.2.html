            The opposition doesn't have a problem with the amendment the government has moved on the Autonomous Sanctions Amendment (Thematic Sanctions) Bill 2021, but we do have an issue in respect of the Religious Discrimination Bill 2021. Our preference would be that this matter go before a joint select committee, but I am advised I cannot move an amendment to that effect in this part of the program. We do believe that on a bill like this, on an issue that has attracted interest from a number of different stakeholders, it would be good if the parliament dealt with this across both chambers, with people from both chambers being able to participate in that inquiry. That would be our preference.
           </p>
           <p>
            I'm reading the room that perhaps the government has the numbers for this, but a reporting date of 1 February really doesn't show any genuine interest at all in having a genuine inquiry into this report or the ability for stakeholders to participate in an inquiry like that. It's essentially saying, 'Yes, we will conduct an inquiry, but it will be held only over the Christmas holidays, after a year like this.'
           </p>
           <p>
            I think it shows a lack of seriousness from the government about dealing with this in a way that brings people together, which is our preference. We notice from the way the government has chosen to conduct the discussions around the preparation of this bill that they haven't reached across the chambers to other parties in this place. They haven't invited people to the table to assist with the drafting and we didn't have a copy of it until it was released publicly, and that was after three or four days of media speculation and briefing out to the media about what was in it and what wasn't in it. I think that from our point of view there's a lack of genuineness from the government about dealing with this in a way that's in the national interest as opposed to some political interests. The reporting date—seriously—also supports my view on that: 1 February really isn't long enough for a suitable inquiry into this matter.

             I'd like to say a few words on this matter, since I am the deputy chair of the committee and there has been no consultation with the committee—none!
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm not known as a person who does not commit fully to my job. I believe that my record throughout this last year of the pandemic has been equal to anyone's in terms of my attendance. This committee has a very heavy workload and we have, I believe, fulfilled it conscientiously and not sought to duck our responsibilities to this chamber. Now we're being told, without consultation, that irrespective of what we're doing at the moment we can do this bill over the Christmas break.
            </p>
            <p>
             It would seem that everyone else in this place, in this building, is entitled to spend some time with their families and is entitled to enjoy some respite from the hurly-burly of this place apart from the members of this committee, who haven't been spoken to. If anyone were to suggest that this was a simple matter, that this was legislation that can be dismissed with the papers, they would be sorely mistaken. Given that the government has taken the better part of three years, and many attempts, to get it into some sort of shape, I would have thought that they would at least have the courtesy of talking to the people who are now expected to actually undertake the parliamentary review of it on behalf of the chamber.

             No, I haven't started on that! In the last two days that the documents have been available there has been a flurry of information being provided concerned with this bill. That's because it's not just a question of the rights of the religious it's also a question of the secular community, and we're discovering that there are different points of view about that. And what would we expect if we're going to start to prioritise human rights—if we're going to say that some people have rights at the expense of others? Of course there's going to be a major dispute about that! Do those opposite think they can just sweep that under the carpet—just slide that away over the Christmas holidays and that no-one will notice? Well, think again!
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a gross abuse of this chamber and of the processes of this chamber to try to pull a swiftie like this. I expect nothing less, I suppose, in some sense, that a controversial matter like this has taken so long to resolve within the Liberal Party or the National Party. And yet they expect us all to sign up to it. That's not going to happen! There has to be a proper process to allow people in this community to have a view about things and express them properly. And we have to have time for members of this committee to be able to make an assessment of those views and report back to this chamber in a proper manner.
            </p>
            <p>
             They're saying 1 February: they're treating this parliament with contempt to suggest that that's going to be an adequate time to examine the complexity of this issue. In my own state, there are going to be views expressed about whether or not these matters are in fact legal. I have read numerous reports in the press today as to whether or not this matter should be subject to a High Court challenge. There are varying views within religious communities about these matters. But the government expect us to just tick and flick a matter of this importance over the Christmas holidays?
            </p>
            <p>
             That is the contempt at the heart of this—the contempt for everybody in this place. Those who think there's a quick, easy settlement here are buying themselves so much trouble that they don't begin to imagine and that couldn't begin to be fixed by a sleazy, slimy little arrangement like this. That's what it is.

              This is outrageous. Here is a piece of legislation, the Religious Discrimination (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2021, that has been in the making for years and that we know, from having just seen it in the last day, is actually going to increase discrimination, not reduce discrimination. Yet the government is trying to quickly get it out of the way, to try to pretend that that's not the case. It is so disrespectful to the whole Australian community, who have an interest in this legislation, because it is complex legislation. On one hand the Prime Minister is saying it's going to bring us all together and it's going to protect people of faith, and on the other hand, when you read this legislation, you see that it is actually going to increase discrimination, allowing people to make offensive statements and get away with it.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is legislation that is a massive overreach—overriding all the state and territory antidiscrimination legislation. It's going to allow further discrimination in schools. Whereas the Prime Minister was promising that he was going to reduce discrimination in schools and not allow students to be expelled because of their sexuality or their gender identity, this legislation is actually going to consolidate that position. It is going to give schools more ability—it's going to encourage them—to use the provisions in this legislation to expel students and sack teachers on the basis of their gender identity or their sexuality.
             </p>
             <p>
              This in itself is bad enough, but we know that's this government's agenda. Okay, so that's the government's agenda, and they're putting it on the table. They believe in it; we don't, but they believe in it. But let's have the committee inquiry, which is what we do in this Senate, to be able to thrash this out, to be able to get all the views of the community, of the many stakeholders. And that's not just
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
               LGBTIQ
              </a>
              stakeholders. It's also people with disability. It's women. It's people of minority faiths. All these people want to have a say, because they are affected by this legislation.
             </p>
             <p>
              This legislation allows people to make offensive statements against people with disabilities. It allows people in the street to come up to people and say, 'Your disability is a punishment from God.' This legislation will allow people to make offensive statements against women, to tell them they should be subject to the will of their husband. It allows people to make an offensive statement against single parents—to say that having children out of wedlock is simple. This legislation allows people to make offensive statements against same-sex couples—for a lesbian to have a colleague continually say to her, 'I'm going to pray to find you a husband.'
             </p>
             <p>
              This is the sort of thing this legislation does. So, at the very least, we need to have a decent inquiry to make this clear, to thrash this out. Yet we have a government that, a minute before we are due to consider this issue, has the gall to table an amendment saying that we're going to have an inquiry that is going to be completed by the end of January. How disrespectful to all those members of the Australian community who want to have a say! If we're going to have an inquiry that reports by the end of January, any hearings for this inquiry would have to be at the beginning of January, when people are on their summer holidays. It is outrageous; it is absolutely outrageous and just so disrespectful. But it is typical of this government, who have got it into their heads that this is the direction they want to go—to ride roughshod over the interests of the vast majority of Australians, who actually want to see legislation that decreases discrimination.
             </p>
             <p>
              People want to see a country where everybody is able to live their lives free of discrimination. They do not want to see legislation that is going to increase discrimination against women, against people with disabilities or against LGBTIQ Australians. So absolutely the Greens will be opposing this. We had hoped, through the selection of bills process last night, that we'd reached agreement to defer a decision on the committee and the reporting date until next week, to give us a bit more time to talk through these things sensibly. But, no, at the last minute, just before midnight, we had this disrespectful amendment from the government. I have moved an amendment to the selection of bills report to say that—

               We should reflect on the comments of Senator Carr regarding the burden this reporting date will place on people who wish to submit to the committee. It will also burden the members of the committee themselves. We should not forget the secretariat as well, who will have to work all the way through what is traditionally a rest time for everyone in this place. I don't want to prejudge anything, but this is a bill that is like a can of worms. We're going to have to take the worms out, straighten them up and put them back in some order. It really will take a lot of effort because of the differing opinions that will be coming in through the submissions and that are already are in the minds of senators.
              </p>
              <p>
               It would make a lot of sense to defer this reporting date; at least until some time in March would be wise. I speak for myself and I'm pretty confident I have a feel of the crossbench on this. Senator Lambie may speak for herself, but I was also part of the organisation for the other crossbencher. If an inquiry isn't done properly, I certainly won't be voting for a bill. I can see that Senator Lambie is indicating that as well. You will roll the dice. Why not go to March and let everyone have a proper inquiry?

                Senator Rice has circulated an amendment to the motion currently before the chair. I'm going to move that amendment, but I want to seek leave to amend the date in that amendment.

                  There seems to be general agreement right across the Senate that these bills should have a Senate inquiry. I think everyone has that position. What we are discussing now and what we're asking the Senate to consider is a genuine inquiry. These are complicated pieces of legislation. They will have a significant impact, if they pass, on the lives of a large number of Australians, in particular people living with disabilities in Australia and our

                  + community. ut it is not just those folk. A large section of the Australian community and Australian society will have their lives meaningfully impacted by these bills. We should not be making significant changes to the antidiscrimination framework that exists in this country without thoroughly exploring the issues raised by these bills—not a quick and dirty inquiry, as the government is suggesting, but a proper Senate inquiry where these complicated issues can get the airing that they deserve. We believe that a reporting date of 21 March would strike that balance.

                   This legislation has been subject to numerous rounds of public consultation. It is not legislation that hasn't been seen previously. The vast majority of this legislation has been well-versed with the different stakeholders. With the introduction of these bills the government did make clear that we also viewed the further consultative processes of a Senate inquiry to be a very important part of adding value to those consultation processes that have been undertaken. That is why we have sought, on the day of the introduction of this legislation to the parliament, to in good faith ensure it is referred for inquiry, consistent with that commitment to continue to undertake consultation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I've heard comments around the chamber in relation to the timing and duration of the inquiry. I understand that the Christmas period does involve, of course, the holiday season for many Australians, but I do note that there are 9½ weeks between now and 1 February.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Senator Carr does protest a little too much. Others have made thoughtful contributions—
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I will be, Senator Lambie. Fear not.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   But thanks for the gratuitous advice. There are 9½ weeks in this regard.

                   s of course are able to make their own recommendations and determinations through that process, including in relation to additional time if the committee itself so determines. It is also the case that the government want to get the advice and the feedback from the Senate committee process in a manner that can enable consideration of this legislation by this parliament, so we have sought to act on the very day of its introduction to the parliament to provide for that referral in the conventional way.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Senator Carr, you know full well that the vast majority of bills are referred without talking to the committee beforehand. You've been here so long that you know that well and truly to be the case.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It's a fact, Senator Carr.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I can only imagine what Senator Carr would have called it had the government not supported the referral to a committee. We are supporting the referral to a committee. We are putting forward that referral in the conventional way of sending it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. It's the standard process for consideration of legislation. We're doing so and providing a 9½-week reporting period for that committee. Of course, as I indicated before, members of that committee, in terms of their consideration of all aspects of this, are at liberty to make their reports to the Senate not only obviously on the substance of the bills but also in relation to further time if they deem it to be necessary in working through such matters. But the government does wish the parliament to ideally hear the committee's views and the feedback from the committee prior to consideration of these bills to enable sufficient time for the bills to be considered by this parliament.
