       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The delay in the Australian Government’s response to the Committee’s Report is a result of a number of ongoing developments up until recently, in relation to NRAS, in particular the passage of legislation through state Parliaments and the commencement of the NRAS on

        1 July 2010. National registration is now in force for practitioners in ten health professions. The professions currently regulated under NRAS are chiropractic, dental practice, medicine, nursing and midwifery, optometry, osteopathy, pharmacy, physiotherapy, podiatry and psychology. More than 529,000 health practitioners across these ten different health professions are now registered under the National Scheme. A further four professions are scheduled to enter NRAS on 1 July 2012, namely Aboriginal and

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 26 March 2008, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) to implement NRAS by 1 July 2010 to align the previously disparate state and territory registration schemes for health practitioners. The intended benefits of NRAS include mobility for health practitioners, consistent standards for registration and professional conduct across Australia, administrative efficiency, and transparency through a national public register of health practitioners.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The legislative framework for NRAS is an applied laws model, with Queensland as the lead state. On 25 November 2008, Queensland introduced the Health Practitioner Regulation (Administrative Arrangements) National Law Act 2008, which established the structure and functions of the NRAS, and received
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Assent
        </a>
        in Queensland. On 12 June 2009, the Ministerial Council released the exposure draft of the second stage of legislation for the Scheme, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Bill 2009 (Bill B) for a five week public consultation period, to 17 July 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 29 October 2009, Bill B was passed in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Parliament
        </a>
        . On 3 November 2009, the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law Act 2009, known as the National Law, received Royal Assent in Queensland. Under the applied laws model, each jurisdiction enacted separate pieces of legislation (commonly referred to as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_C" rel="nofollow">
         Bill C
        </a>
        ) adopting the National Law, and thereby achieving the Scheme’s objectives. All states and territories, with the exception of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , passed legislation to adopt and apply the National Law as a law from 1 July 2010. Western Australia passed its corresponding legislation on 18 August 2010 and subsequently joined NRAS on 18 October 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All matters raised by the Committee were considered in the context of the passage of the Queensland legislation and during the development of the Commonwealth’s Bill. However, the Commonwealth was not required to move legislation to introduce the National Scheme because under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Constitution
        </a>
        the power to regulate health practitioners resides with the states and territories, not with the Commonwealth.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        introduced a Bill on 24 February 2010 (Bill C) to make consequential and transitional amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to streamline Medicare processes and align the Commonwealth legislation with the National Law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth’s Health Practitioner Regulation (Consequential Amendments) Act 2010 received Royal Assent on 30 March 2010. The amendments to the Commonwealth legislation (and associated regulations) will commence on a date to be proclaimed, once data processes and systems used by both the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        are fully aligned. Until that time, existing arrangements will continue to apply.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the commencement of NRAS on 1 July 2011, there were a number of transitional issues, particularly around access and registration processes within AHPRA, during the transition to the new Scheme. In response to these concerns, Health Ministers agreed at their meeting of 17 February 2011 to provide additional support and expertise to assist AHPRA in managing its registration function, to introduce additional monitoring of AHPRA, and a requirement for AHPRA to provide regular reports to future meetings of Health Ministers.

       <p class="italic">
        In 2008, as a part of the Prime Minister's inaugural National Security Statement, the Australian Government recognised serious and organised crime as a national security threat and a growing national challenge. In response, the Australian Government launched the Organised Crime Strategic Framework in 2009 which establishes a comprehensive and coordinated response to target organised crime wherever it exists—including at the border.

        The Australian Government's approach to border control and law enforcement at airports and seaports is a multi-layered and cooperative effort between Commonwealth, and State and Territory agencies, as well as partnership with the aviation and maritime sectors.

Key functions include preventing and intercepting illegal movements of people and goods (such as illicit drugs and firearms) across the Australian border.

This is achieved through the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 (ATSA), the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 (MTOFSA), and associated regulations. The approach to preventive security embodied within the ATSA and the MTOFSA focuses on the protection of transport assets and those who use them.

         The ACC
        </a>
        , as the national criminal intelligence agency, plays an important role in supporting the law enforcement community and the broader government, including at Australia's airports and seaports. This includes the provision of a range of strategic, tactical and operational intelligence products which provide partner agencies with the context to understand serious and organised criminal threats to Australia. In undertaking this role, the ACC utilises its national criminal intelligence holdings, coercive powers and a national legislative and organisational framework that facilitates cooperation on a range of operational outcomes.

        2. Response to Recommendations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.1. Expanding the Scope of transport security legislation
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the scope of the Aviation Transport Security Act 2004 and the Maritime Transport and Offshore Facilities Security Act 2003 be widened to include serious and organised crime in addition to terrorist activity and unlawful interference.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework states that industry “has a key role in understanding its environment and identifying potential opportunities for organised crime exploitation”. The Government's approach to organised and serious crime is based on “preventative partnerships” between government and industry participants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATSA and MTOFSA, administered by the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, are designed to provide a national regulatory framework for the aviation, maritime, and offshore oil and gas sectors. They require industry participants to prepare transport security plans and implement risk based preventive security measures aimed at facilitating transport by reducing the risk of unlawful interference with transport systems under their control. Any amendments to the ATSA and MTOFSA have always been developed in a way that minimises the impact on industry, in line with the Government's objective of achieving an efficient, sustainable, competitive and secure transport system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noting the above, it is proposed that the Attorney-General's Department, in close consultation with the Department of Infrastructure and Transport, establish an aviation and maritime industry forum to examine options for organised and serious crime prevention at Australian airports and seaports in partnership with industry. This will include examining legislative change options, such as the potential to enhance powers under the Customs Act 1901, in the context of working with industry to address serious and organised crime in the aviation and maritime border environments. This would be informed by ACC risk assessments relevant to organised and serious crime in Australia's airports and seaports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.2. Law enforcement on airports and seaports
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that security at major airports be undertaken by a suitably trained government security force.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not agreed
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This matter was considered by Government in December 2009 as part of Flight Path to the Future: National Aviation Policy White Paper. This document confirmed that the current industry led and government regulated model provides an “effective, efficient and sustainable security service, notwithstanding evolving threats, increased security requirements, and increases in domestic and international aviation traffic”.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A more centralised model was not supported on the grounds that a government agency screening model would be overly prescriptive, more expensive and less efficient than current arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government continues to work with industry to improve the current system through improved industry guidance, enhanced technology and better training.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that joint maritime taskforces, mirroring the functions of the Joint Aviation Investigation Teams and Joint Aviation Intelligence Groups in the maritime sector be established in every state and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . These taskforces should include officers of the Australian Federal Police, state or territory police, the

         Australian Customs and Border Protection Service
        </a>
        and the Australian Crime Commission.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The objective of this recommendation is already being achieved at Australian ports through existing cooperative arrangements between the specified agencies to address security and criminality at the waterfront. Customs and Border Protection has also established a Maritime Intervention Strategy to help detect, deter and disrupt criminal activity and to improve its presence in the port environments through a range of law enforcement functions, targeted operations and campaigns.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, joint multi-agency taskforces are established as needed to deliver targeted operational responses against identified criminal threats. Due to the unique nature of the maritime environment and need for law enforcement responses to be flexible and responsive to direct intelligence, the more rigid model employed in the aviation environment through the Joint Aviation Investigation Teams and Joint Aviation Intelligence Groups is not supported.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the Commonwealth will continue to consider whether there are other options to strengthen existing arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends the formation of a Commonwealth maritime crime taskforce that would act as a national Australian Federal Police led “flying squad”, responding to specific intelligence and also conducting randomised audits of maritime and seaport security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not agreed
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation largely reflects existing AFP practices in relation to law enforcement and investigations in the maritime environment. These activities also involve a range of Commonwealth, State and Territory agencies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, a role for AFP in conducting audits of maritime security is not supported as the AFP does not have sufficient expertise in this area.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Attorney-General's Department conduct a review of current information sharing arrangements between law enforcement agencies and private organisations in the aviation and maritime sectors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        AGD will lead this review in consultation with the AFP, ACC and Customs and Border Protection.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is consistent with the Organised Crime Strategic Framework's objectives of strengthening information sharing between law enforcement agencies and working more closely with industry. There is a range of existing partnerships and information sharing practices between law enforcement agencies and with the private sector that the Commonwealth will continue to explore opportunities to improve. This will include additional opportunities for enhanced intelligence sharing between law enforcement agencies and the private sector where appropriate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.3. Identity confirmation for domestic passengers
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991 be amended so as to create a new offence of deliberately travelling under a false identity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agreed
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A specific offence of intentionally travelling under a false identity would provide a further tool for combating terrorism and organised crime in the aviation environment. AGD will work with the AFP and DIT to develop an appropriate offence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 7
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that it be made a legal requirement to provide photo identification confirming passenger identity immediately prior to boarding an aircraft.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not agreed
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The recommendation as specified is not supported, particularly the requirement for all passengers to provide photographic identification.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government acknowledges the need to strike the right balance between facilitating passenger travel at airports and minimising the risk of serious and organised criminal activity. Industry stakeholders have also expressed concerns that an approach such as the one recommended may lead to delays in passenger facilitation (especially at large airports that are close to reaching capacity) and additional costs to industry and the travelling public.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will utilise the aviation industry forum to be established by AGD to examine options for serious and organised crime prevention to further consider the benefit, and the impact on industry and the public, of creating an obligation for individuals of concern to provide appropriate identification prior to boarding an aircraft. Under current arrangements, it would be ineffective and impractical for such activities to be conducted by airport check-in staff who are not trained to recognise fraudulent documents and have no law enforcement powers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is also not feasible for a government official, acting as government security officer, to conduct identity checks of all passengers on domestic aircraft services as there is not sufficient capacity to staff each boarding gate in order to conduct identification confirmation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.4. Access, information sharing and customs issues
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 8
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government review the technical and administrative requirements necessary to facilitate the effective sharing of information between airlines and air cargo agents and law enforcement agencies and the Australian Crime Commission Fusion Centre for the purpose of enhancing aviation security and law enforcement activities. The review should include research into technical requirements for such a scheme, the costs involved and any relevant statutory or other barrier to the sharing of such information. The findings of the review should be reported to the

       <p class="italic">
        The AGD will lead this review in consultation with the AFP, ACC, and Customs and Border Protection.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This recommendation is consistent with the Organised Crime Strategic Framework's objective to continue to strengthen information sharing between law enforcement agencies and working more closely with industry. This work will complement the review to be conducted in response to recommendation 5 on information sharing arrangements between law enforcement agencies and private organisations in the aviation and maritime sectors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth will consider options for reporting the findings of the review. As the review may contain operational sensitivities that cannot be made public, it may not be possible to report the full findings of the review to Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 9
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Australian Government provide further resources to support an increased presence for currency and illicit drug detection canine units at Australian airports.

       <p class="italic">
        Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth considers that current levels of currency and illicit drug detection canine units are sufficient.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AFP is undertaking a review of whether there is need for additional canine units in the future. The AFP will also review the terminating “Firearms and Explosive Detector Dogs” Budget measure and together with Customs and Border Protection will consider whether additional resources for currency and illicit drug detection canine unit are needed.

        The DIT will assess current preventive security settings to ensure that appropriate outcomes are being met at all security regulated seaports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The current approach in relation to seaport security is that the preventive security measures at facilities (including access control arrangements) should be commensurate to the security risk particular to the facility. A prospective “one size fits all” approach would incur unnecessary costs for industry that may not be commensurate with local security risk circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While face to MSIC checks are required at some higher risk facilities, in areas of lower risk, other security approaches, such as electronic swipe access coupled with random inspection and controls may be appropriate.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 11
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends the development of a system that enables the confidential movement and examination of containers that increases the likelihood that trusted insiders involved in serious or organised crime are not alerted to law enforcement agency interest in a container.

        In consultation with relevant stakeholders, Customs and Border Protection has developed the CCTV Strategic Outlook 2020, a strategy to guide future investment in CCTV at the border. The strategy has been developed in recognition of increasing interest from stakeholders in obtaining access to high quality visual information and the need to update existing CCTV technology that is approaching obsolescence. This strategy has been endorsed by the Border Management Group which comprises a range of Commonwealth partner agencies.
