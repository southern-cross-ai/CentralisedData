        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has said that she is ‘going to be transparent on any agreements entered into, and I will be’. In light of that promise, will the minister now tell us whether the Prime Minister has met with Senator Bob Brown, as prescribed in the Greens-Labor agreement made on 1 September? If so, what was agreed?

         The Prime Minister has indicated that she intends to lead this country in a way that provides transparency about government and about how government operates, and I think our record in the first term in relation to freedom of information and other such matters establishes our credentials in that regard.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of meetings between the Prime Minister and Senator Brown, other than walking down to the end of the chamber and asking Senator Brown, I have not got a recent list of times that Senator Brown and the Prime Minister have spoken. I am sure that if you asked Senator Brown, he would help you in that regard. But certainly the Prime Minister did indicate that she would be meeting with Senator Brown, and I am sure that has occurred. I had a meeting with him myself the other day; he is a very pleasant bloke to have a chat to. We had a good chat. That is part of the normal process of government. I want to have a chat with the Nationals about a couple of education issues as well and I am looking forward to having a chat to Senator Joyce. There are a couple of things that I think we will be able to work on. That is part of the normal way of operating in this place, Senator Abetz. Even you and I have a private conversation on occasions.
        </p>
        <p>
         But you know that when you have a private conversation with me it is private, and when I have a private conversation with you your record so far has been to keep it private as well. I would expect that people would appreciate that to operate in this place people have private conversations, and those will continue to occur. In terms of any major public policy and issues that arise, no doubt both Senator Brown and the Prime Minister will comment on them in due course. But it is quite commonplace for people to have private conversations, and I am sure that will continue among all senators and parliamentarians.

          , I ask a supplementary question. That is a very strange definition of ‘transparency’. Under the Labor-Greens agreement, what legislation and what policies were agreed to between the Prime Minister and Senator Brown? What Greens proposals, and how many, have now been submitted for costings by the Prime Minister in accordance with the agreement? To which other ministers and senior public servants has the Leader of the Greens been given unfettered access in accordance with the agreement?

           I suppose the first point to make is that the agreement or arrangements entered into between the government and the Greens and the arrangements entered into between the government and minor and Independent senators have been the subject of press conferences by all those parties, and the nature of those agreements and the breadth of them have been made public at press conferences which have been very well attended. Also, the broad documents, as I understand, have been largely made publicly available. It seems to me,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
            Mr President
           </a>
           , that those parts of the question asked by Senator Abetz are obvious to everyone. They have been the subject of public discussion and the subject of press conferences held by the parties. So those matters are all on the public record.

            , I have a further supplementary question. Clearly they are not. Will the minister advise the Senate what other agreements, arrangements or understandings have been made between the Labor government and the Greens alliance partners after and beyond 1 September when their basic agreement was made public?

             The Prime Minister made clear the basis of arrangements entered into with the Greens and the minors and Independents in a very public way. She has spoken about that and has been available to speak about it in the media since that time. We are now in the process of trying to make this parliament work. We will be working with all parties to advance the government’s legislative agenda and we will be looking for support around the chamber, both here and in the House of Representatives, to advance the government’s election commitments and our legislative agenda. I look forward to Senator Abetz and the opposition supporting us in much of that agenda, particularly as we look to drive our process of improving productivity, driving economic reform and improving skills and education in this country. The opposition will have the opportunity to support the government in those important objectives.
