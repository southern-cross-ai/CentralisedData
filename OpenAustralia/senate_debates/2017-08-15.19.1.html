             It is probably best for Senator Sterle not to open his mouth and confirm people's views.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
              Mr President
             </a>
             , following a review of Defence support to anti-domestic-terrorism arrangements initiated last year, the government has made a number of changes that will facilitate Defence working with federal, state and territory police in the event of a terrorist incident. Clearly, state and territory police forces remain the best first response to terrorist incidents immediately after an attack starts. However, it is the case that Defence can offer more support to states and territories to enhance their capabilities and increase their understanding of Defence's unique capabilities to ensure a comprehensive response to potential terrorist attacks.
            </p>
            <p>
             Under the changes, Defence will offer states specialised training for law enforcement teams. Defence will also offer states placement of ADF officers within law enforcement agencies to assist with liaison and strengthen the call-out provisions in the Defence Act. These changes will ensure that Defence is better able to support states and territories in preparing for terrorist incidents. They will enable a more comprehensive ADF response to a terrorist incident if required, and they will improve information flows between the ADF and police during an incident.
            </p>
            <p>
             Together, these measures will further develop our nation's ability to respond to terrorism as well as to improve the effectiveness of Defence's contribution to domestic counterterrorism arrangements. As we have, unfortunately, seen in recent weeks—and I note the vital work of our security agencies in disrupting a plot to bring down a passenger aircraft in this country—we can't have a 'set and forget' approach to national security. We must stay ahead of the evolving terrorist threat, which is exactly what the changes we have made will work to ensure.

                The main role for Defence is of course conducting counterterrorism operations offshore. The ADF continues to make very significant contributions to countering terrorism in the

                 Middle East
                </a>
                and in Afghanistan. Following the liberation of Mosul last month, the ADF continues to conduct operations in Iraq to defeat Daesh, which has now lost more than 70 per cent of the territory it once held. The move to liberate Talifah is expected by September as planning is completed.
               </p>
               <p>
                Australia remains strongly committed to the coalition and will continue to support Iraq and its security forces to ensure this brutal terrorist organisation is defeated and not able to spread its toxic ideology. In Afghanistan, the ADF continues to train, advise and assist the

                in their fight against the Taliban. It is in our long-term interests as a nation to ensure that terrorism is defeated at its source and safe havens are denied.

                  <p>
                   Further to my previous response: as Daesh is defeated in Iraq and Syria, the terrorist threat in our region is growing because terrorist fighters seek to return to the Indo-Pacific. So we recognise that effective cooperation is vital to defeat that threat. The ADF has an extensive program of counterterrorism engagement and capacity-building activities with our regional partners, including Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines.

                   We are also a strong contributor, through Defence, to the regional frameworks in our region that foster cooperation on counterterrorism and other shared challenges. Australia will continue to work closely with our regional partners and allies to help to counter the terrorist threat. Indeed, in the next week, I look forward to the opportunity to visit Singapore, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam to consult with my counterparts and to focus on those key regional relationships.
