          Could the minister inform the chamber as to the current size of the oil slick? On 29 August it was around 3,000 square kilometres. On 30 August it was 6,000 square kilometres.

            figures, on 30 August the size of the slick was 6,000 square kilometres. Could the minister please inform us as to the current size of the slick? Also, could the minister inform us as to where the minister for the environment got his figure for the amount of oil spilling into the environment of 300 to 400 barrels per day?

             I thank Senator Siewert for her question. In relation to the first issue, which was the size of the slick, the brief with which I have been provided indicates that as of 2 September the oil slick is some 70 nautical miles by 20 nautical miles in size, with approximately 25 per cent of the area covered in patches of oil and sheen. Obviously this is a deeply concerning incident. The lead agency, as the senator is probably aware, is the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Maritime Safety Authority
             </a>
             . However, obviously this has involved other government agencies, including the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment" rel="nofollow">
              Department of the Environment
             </a>
             , Water, Heritage and the Arts. I am also advised that the department of the environment is working closely with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSA" rel="nofollow">
              AMSA
             </a>
             and relevant Commonwealth and state agencies to ensure appropriate measures are in place to respond to any impact on wildlife from the spill.
            </p>
            <p>
             The senator is probably aware that emergency response measures have been in place since the uncontrolled release began on 21 August. It is a matter clearly of great concern to many people and also of great concern to the minister for the environment. For this reason and others, obviously, the department has been fully engaged in responding to the unfolding environmental threat. I can also advise that Minister Garrett has personally flown over the site to consider the extent of the spill firsthand and spoken personally with officers working to monitor and respond to it. Clearly this is an issue of great concern.
            </p>
            <p>
             The senator also asked about where the minister got information regarding the number of barrels, I think. I do not appear to have that information, so I will pass that on to the minister for the environment and see if I can provide an answer.

              , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for her answer and thank her for taking the issue around how many barrels of oil are entering the environment per day on notice, seeing that the company has not said publicly how much is entering the environment. Could she also perhaps give us the government’s best estimate of the amount of oil that will be entering the environment during the period of this leak, which is up to eight weeks, according to the company?

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. I am also concerned about the impact of this spill on the wildlife and the 12 endangered and vulnerable species that the company lists as present in the area. Could the government inform the Senate as to what processes have been put in place to protect these species and can they guarantee that none of these species will be impacted by this spill?
