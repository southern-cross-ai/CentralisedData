         Chair, with your indulgence, Senator Sherry did say earlier to Senator Ludwig if he kept talking he might talk himself out of support for a particular proposition. On this occasion, Senator Ludwig has in fact talked himself into gaining some support. I should indicate that, on the basis of the advice we have received items (2) and (3) are now supported by the opposition as well.

          On that basis, I propose to put first of all those government am-e-ndments on which I understand there is not agreement.

             As I said earlier, the issue of outworkers is a difficult one. Obviously the outworkers have a case. I was thinking about the amount of power that would be given under this legislation and I have to say that Senator Marshall made some sense in his plea. Rechecking my conscience, I think that erring on the side of looking out for those workers is the right thing to do. I apologise for wasting the time of the chamber for four or five minutes, but I appreciate the plea that Senator Marshall made.

              Like Senator Fielding, I thought very hard about what I would do during that amendment because I too, particularly during my experience as previous Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, had dealings with the outworkers during the last round of industrial relations legislation. I would suggest to the government that, when the legislation goes back to the House of Representatives, they look at arming the ombudsman with more power to deal with some of the endemic problems within the outworker industry. We on this side see the amendment that has just been voted on as probably giving too much power to the union in that sense. But we would like to strengthen the role of the ombudsman. I suggest something along the lines of a flying squad or something within the ombudsman’s office to specifically deal with the problem of low-paid non-English-speaking background workers who are paid a very low rate of wages and who do not necessarily belong to the union. I think the coalition would be able to view this, without speaking for anyone but myself, more favourably. I hope that can be looked at.

               may, I want to acknowledge Senator Troeth’s excellent record in this area. As I indicated, the opposition were considering these matters on balance. As we were discussing these matters, a number of issues were explained to us further, which allowed us to be more supportive of some of these government amendments. Given the vote of the committee that has just taken place, the notice of amendment that I gave of course needs to be withdrawn because it would be inconsistent with that vote. I can indicate that the coalition has no difficulty with the rest of the amendments and supports the next raft.

                 must be satisfied that the making of a determination is by consent of the bargaining representatives and that such consent was reached by genuine agreement.
                </p>

                <p class="italic">
                 and (d)    the bargaining representatives have genuinely agreed to seek a workplace determination;
                </p>
                <p>
                 The opposition is understanding of what may well occur in the vote on this matter. We still want to indicate that we believe that if these provisions in relation to arbitration are to be part of the framework then the issue of what genuine agreement means should be identified. We are suggesting that Fair Work Australia must be satisfied that the making of a determination is in fact by consent of the bargaining representatives and that such consent was reached by genuine agreement. The government went to the last election saying that there would be no forced agreements placed on parties. Indeed, on 30 May Ms Gillard said to the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
                  National Press Club
                 </a>
                 :
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 Our policy clearly states that no one will be forced to sign up to an agreement where they do not agree to the terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What the government has now done is to go back on that promise.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Another promise was made in Forward with Fairness that good faith bargaining would not require bargaining participants to make concessions or sign up to an agreement where they did not agree to the terms. The legislation now before us, however, allows Fair Work Australia to make a determination in matters where it is asserted that good faith bargaining has not taken place. We say that the provisions in relation to good faith bargaining are in fact putting in compulsory arbitration through the back door. We also say very clearly to the government that if it is to abide by its promise not to force anybody to sign up to an agreement where they do not agree to the terms then there should be no difficulty with their acceding to our amendment. That amendment makes it very clear that there has to be genuine agreement and that Fair Work Australia must be satisfied that the making of a determination is by consent of the bargaining representatives and that such consent was reached by genuine agreement and was not foisted upon them. It is a matter of whether the government is willing to abide by the promises and undertakings that it provided. So what we propose is to retain the new provisions but ensure that compulsory arbitration is only available where the bargaining representatives genuinely consent to such a determination being made.

                  In his opening comments, Senator Abetz articulated his thought that he was not going to get much support for this amendment. He is right: he is not. We oppose these amendments. We believe that last resort arbitration is essential for a fair bargaining system. In fact, as people would pick up from both my speech in the second reading debate and some of the amendments we have put, we believe that this bill has gone too far in taking out arbitration. We think that it should be going in the opposite direction to the one which the coalition wants to take. We will be strenuously opposing these two amendments.

                   On behalf of the government, I indicate that we are opposed to these amendments. What the opposition seeks to do is impose an additional requirement that special low-paid workplace determinations can only be made where all bargaining representatives agree fundamentally. That undermines the whole concept of the provisions here. These determinations are for the purpose of allowing Fair Work Australia to resolve a deadlock in bargaining where the parties are genuinely unable to reach agreement. The threshold high jump for this is already very high. It can only be made where strict criteria are met. They include the terms and conditions of employers to be covered by the determination, a substantially equivalent safety net, that making a determination will promote future bargaining and productivity and efficiency in enterprise, and that it is in the public interest to make the determination. This, in a very small number of cases, allows Fair Work Australia to resolve a situation where there has not been bargaining in good faith and gives effect to the intention of this stream—to provide some protection for those particularly low-paid workers to get some justice in terms of their wages and conditions. So it is a very important part of the legislation. Certainly, it is one of the pieces of the legislation that I am personally most committed to. It is fortuitous that Senator Ludwig wanted a break when this clause was being considered because I am very pleased to be associated with the government’s position on this particular area. I think it is very important that the opposition amendments be defeated because they would undermine fundamentally what is a very important initiative as part of this legislation.

                    Quickly summing up, I understand what Senator Siewert said but, having listened to a homily about how the government had an absolute mandate, had a right and should be supported in bringing in policies for which it stood at the last election in relation to a previous matter, I remind the chamber that this was the cast-iron guarantee given under Labor’s policy:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    Our policy clearly states that no one will be forced to sign up to an agreement where they do not agree to the terms.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is a complete breach of faith with the Australian people and with what was promised. The government, at that time in opposition, promised this so as to clothe themselves in the economic conservative apparel that they were trying to clothe themselves in. Of course, now that the election is over, they are trying to rip it off as quickly as possible. The problem for Ms Gillard and the government is that these words are actually recorded. I note, with interest, that the minister does not deny the words that I quoted out of Forward with Fairness and does not deny that she made those promises. What we say is that negotiating an agreement is about trying to find areas on which you can agree. If you cannot agree on something, then you should not be forced under law to have someone else impose an agreement on you—especially in these circumstances, where there is the strong safety net of the National Employment Standards that has been created by the bill. What this is doing is introducing compulsory arbitration in circumstances where Labor gave a cast-iron guarantee not to introduce such a regime.

                   <p>
                    We will not be pursuing opposition amendment (16). I move opposition amendment (17) on sheet 5739:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    (17)  Clause 134, page 132 (after line 13), after paragraph (1)(d), insert:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    (da)    the requirement not to disadvantage employees; and
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    (db)    the requirement not to increase costs for employers.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is a very simple amendment and it will put the acid on the government. Ms Gillard made the promise to the Australian people that award modernisation would not disadvantage any employee. She also said to the Australian people—another one of these cast-iron guarantees that somehow have rusted away since 27 November—that there would be no increased costs for employers under award modernisation. They were the two solemn promises. We want to test and see whether the government is going to be true to its word and support the words of Ms Gillard or whether it is going to vote against her words and the promise that she made to the Australian people. Quite frankly, it was a promise that she must have known she could not keep. It was an impossible proposition to put to the Australian people. I personally believe that Ms Gillard knew that what she was saying was undeliverable, but I am willing to be corrected. The way that I will be corrected is when the government says, ‘Yes, Ms Gillard’s promise is deliverable and we will vote for these amendments.’ Somehow, by weaving some sort of industrial magic, we can have award modernisation which does not disadvantage any employees and does not increase costs for employers. In those circumstances, I am sure it is very easy for Labor to support the amendment and indicate that it has full support and faith in Ms Gillard’s comments to the Australian people before the last election.

                     is required by the award modernisation request of the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations to take into account the intention that modern awards not increase costs for employers or disadvantage employees. This enacts the commitment that, indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister has made. The transitional and consequential bill which was introduced yesterday provides for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to continue and to complete the award modernisation process. We are indeed, Senator Abetz, dealing with the award modernisation process here rather than the ongoing basis for modern awards, which is our difficulty with your amendment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The Australian Industrial Relations Commission is required to comply with the award modernisation request and to take into account the intention that modern awards not increase costs for employers or disadvantage employees. The appropriate stage for these considerations is the process being undertaken by the commission in making modern awards. These considerations are of primary importance when rationalising a large number of instruments, both federal awards and notional agreements preserving state awards. Modern awards will commence on 1 January 2010. The commission will have completed making modern awards by that time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Although the bill does not prescribe the opposition’s proposed objective, the bill provides a modern awards objective which is balanced, comprehensive and appropriate. The modern awards objective was considered by both employer and employee representatives as part of the considered process of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations for the
                     <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R4016" rel="nofollow">
                      Fair Work Bill 2008
                     </a>
                     . The modern awards objective appropriately includes considerations to ensure both employees and employers benefit from a safety net which is fair and relevant. Indeed, as I highlighted, the request to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission meets the Deputy Prime Minister’s commitment which you are seeking to deal with in this matter.

                         There are a couple of appropriate opportunities to ask that question. Firstly, the

                         can be asked that question at estimates, and I am sure, if you have not already done so, you will do that. The other answer in part, of course, is annual reports. The Industrial Relations Commission is an independent commission. It will deal with the costs of how it operates, and it will work within its budget.

                                I had gone through what this government has done, unlike what the opposition did in relation to

                                , unlike what the opposition did in respect of their position, because of course they did no modelling. We on this side provided a regulatory analysis. It went through significant issues, such as the regulatory impact. It not only went through the consultation that went forward but also included the proposals plus an outline, together with a range of information that is available about modern awards and the provisions within them, plus the impact analysis of those. I could take you to page xxix as part of that. This government has done a significant amount of work to deal with the broad issues surrounding this bill, including the regulatory impact. I think I gave a more fulsome answer when this debate began. If the advisers are happy to dig back and find what I said earlier, I can continue with that or we can get on with the amendments. I am in your hands.

                                 Minister, I am happy to move on to my next question. In the face of employer concerns about increased costs to be caused by the award modernisation provisions and in the face of concerns being expressed by both the business community and the worker community about the potential for job losses to flow from the award modernisation provisions, I would have thought that the government might have thought that a regulatory impact statement is hardly an independent assessment and is hardly an independent economic modelling of the costs to be experienced by business, the costs to be experienced by the workforce and the costs to be experienced by the country from the award modernisation provisions. Minister, where does the Fair Work Bill legislate the government’s stated intent of some 12 months ago that modern awards would not disadvantage employees?

It is late in the evening, whichever way you want to look at it, but on the substantive question that is being asked the issue of award modernisation is contained within the minister’s direction, which is available, which I am sure you have read and which I am sure that you have gone through with a fine tooth comb—as you would. You probably already know the answer that I have already given to that question. The adviser is looking for the request itself. We can certainly make it available. It is on the public record, as I understand it.

                                     Minister, it was to that request of the President of the Industrial Relations Commission that I referred in asking: where does the Fair Work Bill legislate that request, given that that request is a statement of intent and given that that request stated the government’s intention but did not legislate it? Some 12 months ago that request stated the government’s intention that award modernisation not disadvantage employees. Where does the Fair Work Bill legislate that intention?

                                      If you think about it, the request is under section 576C(1), so this is part of the legislative program. If you look at what the document says, you see that it is the award modernisation consolidated version, and the objects of that does set it out. I will go to the issue that you refer to. It is set out at 2(c), which says that the creation of modern awards is not intended to disadvantage employees. It is contained in what I will call, in shorthand, the direction by the minister. I think it is plain. Quite frankly, I am sure you already knew that answer too.

Where does the Fair Work Bill legislate the government’s statement of intent, made some 12 months ago through the minister’s request of the Industrial Relations Commission, that modern awards not increase employers’ costs?

                                           understand from the minister’s response that there is no provision in the Fair Work Bill that legislates the government’s 12-month-old promise that award modernisation not increase employers’ costs? I take it that there are no provisions in the Fair Work Bill that legislate that promise. Is that right?

                                            No. The Fair Work Bill provides for the request. The request provides for what I have set out, which is that the creation of modern awards is not intended to—and the relevant provision is (c)—disadvantage employees. I am sure that you are familiar with how legislation works, but to be simple you could compare it to a situation akin to a regulation made under an act. I am sure you are familiar with those terms.

                                             confirm, please, that the Fair Work Bill does not legislate to stop award modernisation increasing costs to employers. A statement of intent is all very well, Minister, and honourably made, I am sure. Where does the Fair Work Bill prevent award modernisation from increasing an employer’s costs? Or has the government decided that a statement of intent suffices? Those are my two questions.

                                              I will go back to the primary position, which I am sure you understand, and it has probably been articulated to you before today. The government’s intention is clear. It is set out in the request under the existing section 576C to the Industrial Relations Commission, as it is now, in (1), (2) and (3), right through, dealing with a whole range of issues. Not only is the aim of the award modernisation process to create a comprehensive set of modern awards as set out in section 576A of the act but in addition it must be simple to understand and easy to apply and must reduce the regulatory burden on businesses. There is a range of other provisions, including:
                                             </p>
                                             <dl>
                                              <dt>
                                               (c)
                                              </dt>
                                              <dd>
                                               must be economically sustainable, and promote flexible modern work practices and the efficient and productive performance of work; and
                                              </dd>
                                             </dl>

                                             </p>
                                             <dl>
                                              <dt>
                                               (e)
                                              </dt>
                                              <dd>
                                               must result in a certain, stable and sustainable modern award system for Australia.
                                              </dd>

                                              It also deals with the creation of modern awards. It is not intended to—and we have dealt with this one—(c) disadvantage employees or (d) increase costs for employers. It deals with the performance of functions by the commission in section 3 and a range of other provisions, including consultation. It says:
                                             </p>

                                                  What we have said, and we have said it continually, is that there is a request under section 576C(1), award modernisation. It sets out perfectly logically what the minister must seek to do in an award modernisation request. It is to be read in conjunction with part 10A of the act. It deals with objects. It deals with the creation of modern awards, which is not intended to disadvantage employees or increase costs for employers. For all intents and purposes, it is very plain about what it sets out to do. That exists now under the current workplace relations legislation and it will continue to exist under the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009.

Are there any provisions in the transitional bill that prevents modernising awards from increasing costs for employers?

                                                      We are now using the committee stage of the Fair Work Bill to start talking about the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill. Be that as it may, the bill continues the framework which I outlined. I have outlined it a number of times. I am happy to outline it again if you are unsure of the process—that is, that this award modernisation request was made under 576C(1). The award modernisation request, which comes under that section, sets out that the creation of modern awards is not intended to disadvantage employees or increase costs for employers and it will continue under the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009.

If that bill will protect employees in the application of a modern award, why does the government consider it appropriate to have provisions legislating one part of its 12-month-old promise—that is, to not disadvantage employees—yet not also see fit to legislate in the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill the other part of its 12-month-old promise, which is to ‘not increase costs for employers’ through modern awards?

                                                         Minister, if you legislated 12 months ago in respect of not disadvantaging employees as well, then why does the government see fit to legislate the same half of its promise in a bill introduced in the House of Representatives yesterday but not see fit to do the same for the other half of the promise, which is to not increase costs for employers—which, of course, if not achieved, will fail to protect employees in any event? The business community are saying that this process will increase their costs and will cost jobs for employees. So, Minister, why the necessity, in the view of the government, to legislate 50 per cent of the promise made 12 months ago but not the other 50 per cent?

The request was made under the existing workplace relations legislation, under section 576C(1), and it continues under the transitional provisions. So the transitional provisions have now been tabled and it will continue under that. It was important to get the commission working on getting modern awards in place. I am sure we all agree with that. It is about ensuring that modern awards can be dealt with, because what we also did very early in the piece was remove

That is what you did, and you did it not once but many, many times. I do not want to go and rustle up your old bones and have a look at them, but you should own them and recognise they are your bones, not ours.

I am sure you have read part 3, ‘Avoiding reductions in take-home pay’, dealing with the part 10A award modernisation process. It says:

                                                             Minister, doesn’t that answer acknowledge that modern awards will effectively be permitted to be the operative or immediate reason for increasing employers’ costs? There is little other conclusion from that answer and from your earlier answers about the lack of any provision to the contrary in the Fair Work Bill.

It is not something that necessarily flows from one to the next. It is not a reasoned argument, I would put. The position I have outlined is the correct position. There are award modernisation processes in place and the Industrial Relations Commission is dealing with that. The consequential provisions deal with, in part, the effect of award modernisation in terms of employees, particularly part 10A, as I outlined. The issue at the heart of this is that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has put in place an award modernisation request to be read in conjunction with part 10A of the Workplace Relations Act. It deals with the circumstances that I have outlined this morning and says:
                                                             </p>

Whilst the transition bill allows for the phasing in of minimum wages in modern awards on application by an employer who can prove to Fair Work Australia that such measures are necessary to ensure the ongoing viability of their business, the Deputy Prime Minister indicated in her speech to parliament some 12 months ago when introducing the transition to Forward with Fairness legislation that Fair Work Australia, currently the Industrial Relations Commission, can put in place arrangements to phase in differences between old awards and modernised awards over five years. She said:
                                                              </p>

There is not even any room for seeking relief from Fair Work Australia if jobs are threatened without there also being a threat to the viability of the business. No; the only way you get a phase-in period, to sit and stew in, is if you can show that modern awards are the sole reason, the operative reason, for the lack of viability of the business in the longer term.

However you cut it, a modern award can increase an employer’s costs. Minister, you have provided the employer community with no reassurance about the transition bill, which does by your own say-so impact on this bill—because in your answers you have talked about a statement of intent and aim of the minister. Your promises some 12 months ago under the Workplace Relations Act are impacted upon by the transition bill that was introduced yesterday that inextricably relates to and underpins this Fair Work Bill. The answers given by you this morning in this place can only lead us to conclude that a modern award can increase employers’ costs and in so doing can, on the say-so of the business community, cost employees their jobs.
                                                              </p>

                                                               So, despite the transition bill having some provisions that the government says might allow Fair Work Australia to make take-home pay orders to protect employees’ pay, the business community is clearly saying that, because of the probability that award modernisation will increase their business costs, that is going to cost employees their jobs. That is hardly protecting employees. As Brad Norington says, it is ‘a ticking time bomb for Gillard and the government’. Minister, is there any reassurance that you can provide to the business community and their workers that award modernisation will not increase costs and will not cost jobs?

I am not persuaded that those sitting with him in the Liberal Party are not still wedded to it and would not like it to be brought forward and continued with. But we will check that later on today, I suspect. What I can say is that the idea of including transitional arrangements in modern awards was foreshadowed and is continuing. If you look back at the Liberals’ record in relation to this, they had award rationalisation as part of their process but never took it on. This government has set forward a system to ensure that modern awards will be in place. That is what this government has done, unlike the Liberals, who did not have the ability to pursue the rationalisation of awards as they claimed they were doing. What this government has done through a ministerial request is to ensure that the commission will undertake this work.

Whenever he does not have arguments he takes a little excursion to the graveyard to kick around a corpse. But that does not obviate the need for him to explain to this parliament why Ms Gillard made the promise that he now clearly does not support and will not be voting for. It was a silly promise to have made in the first place, I agree. But what we are doing here is testing Labor. I think we will know by their votes—and I can indicate that we are happy to do it on the voices. But we will be listening to hear whether there are any voices from the Labor side saying no, because those voices that say no will be repudiating Ms Gillard’s promise to the Australian people before the last—

                                                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">

                                                                      </a>

We have held a very strong position on this issue through our industrial relations policy. We certainly went to the election with that policy.
                                                                     </p>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                      I also articulated during my speech in the second reading debate our concerns about the fact that industrial relations policy in Australia has moved away from conciliation and arbitration and the fact that the bill lacked an independent dispute resolution process. So the Greens are moving these amendments in order to do two things. One is to explicitly provide Fair Work Australia with the power to deal with disputes over the application of the National Employment Standards modern award terms or terms of the enterprise agreement. The amendments also explicitly provide Fair Work Australia with broad powers, including arbitration powers, in resolving these and other disputes. Applications to Fair Work Australia would be able to be made by an employee or employer or by an employee or employer organisation.
                                                                     </p>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                      We do not believe consent arbitration works, in particular for those employees that are unable to exert enough pressure to ensure arbitration in agreed dispute resolution clauses. This is fundamentally about fairness, and the fairness of this bill is severely undermined by the absence of effective dispute resolution processes. It is a little bit of a mockery to call it the Fair Work Bill when there is not an effective dispute resolution process. As I said, the Greens went to the election with a very strong policy on dispute resolution. We have said it from day one. We believe that this policy should have had independent dispute resolution processes in the bill to enact the name of the bill and to ensure that Australian workers have full access to a truly fair industrial relations system.

The government moved amendments to make clear that the terms of the National Employment Standards can be replicated in an enterprise agreement. Where those terms are replicated they will operate as terms of the agreement, and disputes about those terms can be dealt with by the FWA under the dispute settlement terms of the agreement. I can add further to that, but I think that succinctly puts our position.

We are revisiting an issue here that we raised during discussions on the transition to Forward with Fairness legislation last year. We propose that Fair Work Australia should be able to include in awards exceptional matters.
                                                                        </p>

                                                                         The limiting of award matters is another hangover, we believe, from the Howard years. We believe there should be more flexibility in the content of modern awards and the government should leave it to Fair Work Australia, with input from stakeholders, to ensure an appropriate and relevant safety net. We have a related concern that the bill makes unlawful terms in awards relating to right of entry. I know we have been dealing with right of entry through the evening. Apart from the confusion that may exist from the fact that other terms related to unions may require unions to enter premises—for example, to attend inductions or meet employees under a dispute resolution clause—we see no justification for awards to be banned from including better right-of-entry provisions if that is what the practice is or if it is appropriate in a particular industry or occupation.
                                                                        </p>
                                                                        <p>
                                                                         In terms of item 12 we have particular concern about the modern award system and its ability to adjust to changing workplaces, both in relation to content and coverage. We seek a clarification of clause 143 that emerging industries or occupations will be able to be covered by modern awards—that is, that Fair Work Australia will be able to make new awards or extend coverage of current awards to such industries. Our amendment merely seeks to clarify and make explicit that that is the case. These concerns, as I said earlier, were issues that we raised at the time that we were discussing the Workplace Relations Amendment (Transition to Forward with Fairness) Bill 2008 last year. We expressed concerns at the time about some of the provisions of the award modernisation process and we have just had a long discussion about it. I appreciate that. But we are concerned about some of the rights and conditions that are being lost through the award modernisation process and believe that these amendments enhance the award modernisation process.

                                                                          In relation to amendment (10), the government does not intend to expand the 10 allowable award matters. Expanding the allowable matters in modern awards to include exceptional matters could compromise the simplicity of modern awards. In relation to amendment (11), we accept the principle. The idea that awards can cover emerging areas of activity is reflected in the award modernisation request. However, the amendment is, we would submit, unnecessary. There is nothing in clause 143 that prevents awards covering such employees, and as the amendment itself recognises that, with the phrase ‘to avoid doubt’, I assume you already understand that 143 covers the section.
                                                                         </p>

The right of entry is properly provided for by a dedicated part of the Fair Work Bill, and modern awards and the National Employment Standards are a minimum safety net of terms and conditions of employment.

Coming from WA, where pre Work Choices AWAs were used more widely than in the rest of the country, I know that, despite the need for them to meet a no disadvantage test against the award, they were still used to undercut the take-home pay and conditions of vulnerable employees. We are concerned that this may happen with individual flexible arrangements.

We also acknowledge that IFAs could be used effectively in, for example, allowing more family-friendly conditions. However, we are still concerned, as are many others—and I will get to that in a minute—that they have the potential to undermine award conditions and collective agreements and be used to exploit more vulnerable workers.
                                                                           </p>

We propose there should not be mandatory terms in awards or agreements. Rather, it should be at the discretion of FWA whether such clauses are appropriate for each modern award, and it should be up to the parties to an enterprise agreement whether and to what extent such clauses are appropriate. There may be industries or occupations where such arrangements are not appropriate—for example, occupations that have 24-hour rosters and provide essential services, such as firefighting. In these circumstances, it should be up to the parties or FWA as to whether such clauses should be included in an award or an agreement.
                                                                           </p>

Amendments (16) to (19) in relation to IFAs relate to our concerns about transparency. As currently provided for in this bill, IFAs are written and signed and then nothing happens to them unless a breach is taken to court. We appreciate the government not wanting to replicate the bureaucratic nightmare of AWAs being checked by a government authority, but the problem we have is that we will not know how they are being used, who is using them and in what circumstances.

I have moved amendments to this effect. Dr Buchanan argued for the need for greater transparency, submitting:

                                                                           </p>

What the government has committed to—because I think I can foresee the vote already—is that a review of the use of IFAs will be undertaken. We appreciate the government’s commitment to that. However, we do think it would be better to fix up the potential problem before it starts rather than waiting for problems—when the horse has bolted—before looking at whether conditions and entitlements have been undermined and then having to put in place a remedy to address that issue. We commend these amendments to the chamber.

We support collective and good faith bargaining provisions. Our key concerns go to the content of agreements and the restrictions on the level at which good faith bargaining can occur. As has been made clear, the Greens believe parties should be free to agree on any matters, apart from unlawful matters, in their agreements. Our amendments (13) and (14) provide for this.

Instead of sticking to that policy, the government have taken us back to the ‘matters pertaining’ formula, with some exceptions. While acknowledging that matters pertaining to the employment relationship do not include union activities, the bill has to provide for them and pay deductions separately. What this says to us is that the matters pertaining formula is inadequate.
                                                                             </p>

Professor Stewart commented that the law surrounding the concept of matters pertaining is ‘confusing, uncertain and downright inconsistent’ and he calls for the concept to be ‘given a decent burial’. Professor Stewart is also concerned that restricting the content of agreements will perpetuate the use of side agreements, which are ineffective and unproductive. Of particular concern for the Greens, as we as a community face the prospect of catastrophic climate change, is that the bill does not allow employees to engage in bargaining with their employers over environmental or climate change initiatives. Dr Buchanan agrees with us. He said:

We believe this is a particularly important set of amendments because we strongly believe in collective bargaining and that parties should be able to reach agreement on whatever matters they wish. This came up repeatedly during the Senate inquiry. We urge the chamber to support these amendments. However, I ask for the question on amendment (13) to be put separately, if possible.

The matter of environmental issues is raised, but these issues can also be included in agreements if they pertain to the employment relationship.
                                                                               </p>

It is inappropriate for enterprise agreements to undermine these provisions. The terms of unfair dismissals may be included in enterprise agreements as long as they do not lessen the qualifying period for unfair dismissal or deviate from the unfair dismissal provisions of the bill in a way that is detrimental to an employee. It is appropriate, though, that an agreement cannot remove or undermine an employee’s entitlement to unfair dismissal protections.

I note that I would normally have called a division on amendment (13), but I am being reasonable and will not seek to do that. We feel extremely strongly about matters pertaining to that. We would normally have divided. Given the late hour I will not call for a division, but I would like on record the reason for that. I know I am anticipating the vote of the chamber, but that explains why I will not be seeking to call a division.

Our amendment returns the period of time employees must have to consider a proposed enterprise agreement to 14 days. The seven days in the bill was too short a time for employees to be able to access advice on proposed agreements.

The seven-day period for ready access to a proposed agreement will ensure that the approval of an enterprise agreement is not unduly delayed when the parties have already agreed to the terms. When an employer initiates bargaining it must give employees notice of the right to be represented by a bargaining representative and it must not ask employees to approve an agreement until at least 21 days after this notice has been given, and of course good faith bargaining orders will also be available during this period. The government believes that it achieves the right balance between protections for employees and the need for an agreement to be speedily approved once it has been reached.

There was some important evidence given to the Senate inquiry about the provisions in the bill relating to multienterprise agreements and single-interest agreements. Evidence was received from unions representing teachers and nurses, for example, who were concerned that the provisions would limit their ability to reach agreements across their occupations and achieve fairness and stability. We share these concerns. Further, we believe it is the right of parties to bargaining to determine the level at which they will bargain. Our amendment does not go so far as to completely address all our concerns on this issue but it does allow Fair Work Australia to assist in multienterprise agreement making.

To ensure multienterprise bargaining occurs on a voluntary basis, protected industrial action and good faith bargaining orders will not be available when bargaining for a multienterprise agreement. This is also consistent with the government’s clear policy intention to prevent industrial action in pursuit of pattern bargaining. We have made that position very clear. We do not support the amendment. We understand the principle behind it but it undermines what we say is the system that we are seeking to put in place.

The low-paid bargaining stream is designed to extend the benefits of bargaining to employers and employees who have not been able to bargain in the past. This includes the small business sector, where individual employers often do not have the time or resources to bargain with their employees.

In fact, I think I have expressed my surprise that these provisions went as far as they did. I have congratulated the government and I congratulate them again for taking this approach. However, we think that they could be improved. There are three amendments that could improve on this stream and these provisions.

We think this is a practical suggestion, with no detrimental consequences. In amendment (19) we have also taken up another suggestion by the SDA, who pointed out that, in making a low-paid bargaining determination,

It may be implied—and in fact that is what the government’s response has previously been, that it is implied—but we believe it should be explicit.

While we understand the intention of the provisions is to assist collective bargaining where it has been difficult in the past, we believe this restriction is too severe and that there may remain barriers to collective bargaining even where an employer has been involved in one in the past.
                                                                                            </p>

In short, we do not think (18) and (19) are required. With regard to (18), we think that Fair Work Australia will be able to vary an application to ensure that employer names are correctly identified. Amendment (19) is not required, as the bill already makes it clear that a workplace determination must pass the

They limit the ability for low-paid workplace determinations and they should remain. On that basis, we do not support these Greens amendments—although, because of the substantive work that has gone into them, we did have a very long look at them.

I appreciate the lateness of the hour so I will seek to expedite the debate as much as possible, which is why I will talk to these amendments together. The amendments all relate to the guarantee of annual earnings and high-income thresholds. I realise that we dealt with this issue earlier in the evening. For amendments (7) and (21) the Greens oppose the exclusion from award coverage of high-income employees through the guarantee of annual earnings provisions. Awards contain important protections that are not just related to salary, and we do not believe that awards should be undermined in this way. As the Association of Professional Engineers, Scientists and Managers, Australia, said in their submission:
                                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                                  </p>
                                                                                                  <p>
                                                                                                   In terms of amendments (22) and (23) in the alternative, we do not believe the non-monetary benefits should be part of the calculation in determining whether a person’s salary reaches the high-income threshold. Obviously these are alternative proposals to (7) and (21) because we do not believe that high-income thresholds should be in the legislation. As I was saying, we do not believe the non-monetary benefits should be part of the calculation in determining whether a person’s salary reaches the high-income threshold, given guarantees of annual earnings can be a condition of work. This strengthens the ability of employers to demand particular calculations of non-monetary benefits, which can be extremely difficult to calculate.
                                                                                                  </p>

                                                                                                   In terms of amendment (24), we also believe that the high-income threshold in the legislation at the amount indicated by the government—that is, $100,000—is too low. We suggest that if it is to be in legislation it should be a threshold of $150,000 and that it should be indexed to AWOTE. We do note the government amended the legislation to provide that the threshold cannot be reduced, and that is important. As you know, we supported that amendment. Once again I commend the amendments to the chamber and appreciate that now we will be moving the different amendments separately.

In relation to amendments (22) and (23), the Fair Work Bill only includes non-monetary benefits where they are provided as part of an employee’s remuneration, and the government does not intend to depart from that. So, unfortunately, Senator Siewert, that is not comforting for you.

                                                                                                        This amendment relates to job security and unfair dismissal and redundancy. Some of these issues we have dealt with previously, but amendment (7) in particular relates to removing the discrimination against employees of small business. We have had a very long debate, I know, about unfair dismissal and the definition of small business, so I will try and keep this short. We believe the small business fair dismissal code must contain a requirement for written warnings. The committee inquiry heard a great deal of evidence about how allowing oral warnings could compound the unfairness to small business employees in particular. Asian Women at Work, for example, told of the prospect of an employer issuing a verbal warning in the midst of erratic and unwarranted abuse and bullying without any possibility of the worker making a serious response in their defence or even acknowledging that it was a warning in the first place. Verbal warnings are highly unreliable. It is likely they will be contested as to what an employer said and whether it constituted a warning or whether an employee understood what was required of them to meet their employer’s concerns, particularly if any warning is given in emotional circumstances. We believe greater formality is needed.
                                                                                                       </p>
                                                                                                       <p>
                                                                                                        We believe our amendment requiring written warnings is essential if we are actually properly to address the issue of fairness in this bill. During the committee inquiry we were given a number of examples where, for example, a manager or boss was being quite abusive to an employee and it happened on repeated occasions; it was not a one-off. So when is the employee to know when that abuse or that shouting at the worker or telling off of the worker was actually a reprimand or whether it was a formal warning? We believe relying on oral warnings will unnecessarily confuse things, in fact probably make things more complicated for small businesses, but also it leaves workers extremely vulnerable. Again here we are talking about some of the most vulnerable workers in our workforce, and very often we are talking about workers who come from a non-English-speaking background and so have even further problems understanding an oral warning. At least if it is a written warming they will be able to go and seek advice about it to in fact understand what is being said to them in terms of the warning.
                                                                                                       </p>
                                                                                                       <p>
                                                                                                        We believe this amendment is particularly important in delivering fairness through the small business fair dismissal code. It is called the small business fair dismissal code for a reason. We believe it is much fairer to deliver a warning in writing than to just rely on oral evidence.

The small business fair dismissal code was settled last year in close consultation with that working group. The fair dismissal code does require that a warning be given and that an employee be given an opportunity to respond to the warning and a reasonable chance to rectify the problem. That is the position that we have achieved. I think it is the right balance between the small business employer and the employee. Although it encourages written warnings, the emphasis is on genuine and honest exchange.

We do not believe that it is fair in any way, shape or form that relying on oral warnings is considered enough. We do not believe it is fair. Having said that, I can tell what the feeling of the chamber is. I would like to put on record that we normally would have called a division on this—this is how strongly we feel about it—but, given the lateness of the hour, we will not. I just wanted to put that on record.

                                                                                                         <p>

The bill provides that the new employer can decide whether or not to recognise the employee’s service for the purposes of unfair dismissal protection. We cannot support this position. It could lead to a situation where an employee has worked for an employer for five, 10 or 20 years perfectly satisfactorily then, doing the exact same job, have their employment terminated at will during the next six to 12 months.
                                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                                          During the Senate inquiry we heard evidence about that practice in the aged-care industry. There have been a number of stories of how, when aged-care centres are sold, the accrued entitlements of the employees are calculated into the sale price and then employees are taken on initially and then dismissed. This is an unacceptable practice. We also believe that the period of time an employee may work for an employer as a casual should count towards the employee’s period of employment. The minimum employment period is to enable the employer to assess the employee. A period of casual work definitely serves that purpose.
                                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                                          We believe this amendment deals with a hole in the unfair dismissal provisions, and there are real examples of where this hole has been abused. I have heard of numerous examples such as the aged-care example. There have been several examples in Victoria. We urge the government to act to ensure that this sort of thing cannot happen and that employees’ entitlements are protected.

The amendment that you have proposed is based on that. The bill requires that a new employer notify transferring employees if a new minimum employment period will be required. Of course, if the employer fails to notify transferring employees in writing of the requirement to serve a new minimum employment period, previous service with the old employer will be recognised and the employees will not be required to serve a new minimum period for unfair dismissal purposes. The government did decide that it was important to give the new employer flexibility in this regard; otherwise, it could act as a disincentive to new employers offering employment to employees of the old employer.

There are the Australian Green amendments, then Senator Xenophon’s amendment and then a government amendment. It seems to me, reading the mood of the chamber, that it is most likely that the government amendment will get up. In those circumstances, if we were to allow Senator Ludwig to move his amendment and discuss that, that would obviate the other three.

In particular, the government acknowledges the concern that, in such a case, the exceptional circumstances requirement may be difficult to demonstrate. The government is therefore prepared to support an extension of the existing seven-day period to 14 days. The government does not support an extension to 21 days as it considers that this would undermine its policy of providing certainty to business and a speedy resolution.

That terrible piece of legislation in fact allowed for 21 days to file for unfair dismissal, and the government went to the election on a promise of only seven days.

It is very interesting that numbers are vitally important and are subject to a mandate if they happen to agree with them. But if they do not agree with them, the mandate is out the window and, of course, it is the good sense of the Greens and Senator Xenophon and other people that we can then come to a compromise.
                                                                                                                  </p>

But when they started to shift ground then of course the doors were opened. When we were in government, we as a government at all times thought that 21 days was the appropriate figure. It is great to see Senator Siewert and the Australian Greens embracing that figure and giving the former Howard government a big tick on that and in fact inviting the government to breach its election promise on numbers. However, I have had my two or three minutes of fun pointing these matters out and I indicate that we will be supporting the government’s amendment.

                                                                                                                        It is very spooky and every time it happens I feel like I am in the twilight zone, particularly at two o’clock in the morning. However, I do agree that it was sensible to move straight to this amendment because, as you rightly said, it deals with the issues that we dealt with in our two amendments which related to this issue. One of our amendments, amendment (8), put the position that we believe the unfair dismissal timing should be moved to 21 days. We also had an alternative that, if that failed, we should go back to 14 days because we believe 14 days is better than seven days—although not, of course, as good as 21 days. So we will be supporting this amendment and I indicate that the Greens will withdraw our amendments (8) and (9). I will withdraw (10) as well, given the lateness of the hour, if this amendment succeeds.

I believe that seven days would have had unintended consequences. For instance, it could have been a combination of circumstances of some people not knowing their rights and not being able to lodge a claim in time. The likelier longer term consequence would have been for people to jump the gun and issue proceedings to preserve their position whilst they got legal advice, and I think that would have clogged up the system. I did privately suggest, somewhat cheekily, to Senator Ludwig that maybe 15 would have been the magic number for the government in relation to this, but I support the amendment.

I would like to talk about the issues around industrial action and the issues that are contained in the amendments that we are seeking to move. As I have said, they all relate to industrial action and how we think that this legislation curtails workers’ ability to take industrial action.

That has always been a very clear part of the Greens industrial relations policies which we took to the election. We believe the right of a worker to withdraw their labour is a fundamental human right. We do not believe industrial action should be unlawful or attract civil penalties.

These interests not only have to do with obtaining better working conditions and pursuing collective demands of an occupational nature but also with seeking solutions to economic and social policy questions and to labour problems of any kind which are of direct concern to the workers.

Such a right is intrinsically linked to the freedoms of associations and expression and the right to peaceful assembly.

The provisions restricting industrial action in this bill are almost identical to

The ILO were highly critical of the Work Choices provisions, criticisms that we believe apply equally to this bill. I have already articulated what the general report from the ILO Committee of Experts had to say about the numerous provisions of the Workplace Relations Act, and I will not go through those again.
                                                                                                                              </p>

We have many amendments here that relate, for example, to pattern bargaining and multi-enterprise bargaining. I have touched on that issue previously. We also have amendments that relate to Fair Work stop orders, and we believe that we need to significantly boost the provisions in that area.
                                                                                                                              </p>

We point out that in fact these provisions have been taken directly from Work Choices—so much for Work Choices being dead—which is why, unfortunately, we cannot just leave it buried. It is still alive; it is like a zombie. We generally oppose the provisions allowing or mandating Fair Work Australia to suspend or terminate protected industrial action, except in circumstances where the industrial action is endangering life or causing significant damage to the nation’s economy. These provisions put a further barrier in place for workers engaging in what is otherwise lawful industrial action. Employees can go through all the hoops in this bill and take lawful action, only to be stopped by one of the provisions that I just mentioned. The ILO has been consistently critical of these provisions as well.
                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                               We oppose the cooling-off period, in items 32, 33 and 34, but, in the alternative, seek to give Fair Work Australia greater discretion as to when to order a cooling-off period and to limit such a period to 48 hours. In item 35, we are completely opposed to the ability of third parties to make applications to Fair Work Australia to suspend otherwise lawful industrial action. The point of industrial action is to harm the other party in some way. In doing so, other parties may well be harmed. It is unacceptable for third parties to prevent lawful industrial action.
                                                                                                                              </p>

Similarly, in item 36, we oppose the right of the minister to make a declaration terminating industrial action. If lawful industrial action needs to be terminated it should be done by Fair Work Australia in limited circumstances and not by a minister as a political action. Again, we oppose this provision in Work Choices and we do so, again, in this bill. We also have a series of amendments around protected ballot orders and we maintain our general opposition to protected ballot orders. We believe they are unnecessary and can hinder the right of employees to take industrial action. We do not believe the changes made by this bill to Work Choices provisions go far enough in addressing the need for a more streamlined process.
                                                                                                                              </p>

                                                                                                                               We also have amendments relating to the four-hour pay deduction for unprotected industrial action, regardless of how long the industrial action lasts. This is another provision that the government decided to keep from Work Choices. For example, workers could be 10 minutes late for work after a meeting or have a ‘stop work order’ meeting for half an hour and they would be docked four hours pay. There was also a very unfortunate case under Work Choices where construction workers were docked four hours pay for taking 10 minutes to pass a hat around for the wife of a colleague who had been killed. These examples demonstrate both the harshness and ridiculousness of this provision.
                                                                                                                              </p>
                                                                                                                              <p>
                                                                                                                               The committee inquiry also heard evidence about how the provision is counterproductive and likely to lead, in fact, to more sustained industrial action—as workers will be docked four hours anyway, they may as well take the time off. It is also counter to the proposition that workers should be paid for the work that they perform. In discussing this provision we should also be mindful that the definition of ‘industrial action’ is very broad, amounting to doing your job in a way that you do not customarily do it. Employers should also be worried about this provision. They face a civil penalty if they pay someone contrary to the provision in circumstances where it may be difficult to determine whether unlawful industrial action is being taken. Our amendments do away with the distinction between unprotected and protected action in relation to payments, as recommended by Professor Stewart. We believe these are logical and practical amendments that deal with the issue of industrial action.

I appreciate that we have already dealt with some of these issues in one of Senator Xenophon’s amendments, but we believe that community legal centre lawyers should also be given an exemption from leave requirements. The community legal centres recommended that their lawyers be exempt from the need to seek leave to appear before

The Employment Law Centre of WA gave evidence to the Senate inquiry that, given the profile of their clients—particularly vulnerable workers—they should be exempt from this extra requirement. We were persuaded by their arguments and propose an amendment to exempt lawyers from community legal centres in the same way as lawyers from unions and employer organisations are exempt. We are concerned that the people represented by community legal centres—as I said, these are often the most vulnerable workers—do not have union representation. For example, the Employment Law Centre of WA does not represent any workers that have union representation. Community legal centres play a very important role in helping to protect vulnerable workers. We believe it is sensible that they should also be exempt from the leave requirement. They are essentially representing their clients in the same way lawyers from unions are. We would very strongly urge the government to accept this amendment. We believe that it is reasonable and practical to exempt the community legal centres from having to seek leave.

In opposing it, let me make the observation that it is regrettable—but it is a part of the system—that employer and employee organisations are automatically entitled to be represented whereas individuals are not. In the totality of the scheme, I do not think that is appropriate. The minister is right. Fair Work Australia does have the capacity or discretion to allow representation. I trust that they will allow that representation to be exercised on as many occasions as possible. There is no reason or rationale why only community legal centre lawyers should be exempt from leave. Why should it not be the same for a local suburban lawyer who sees the injustice in a particular case—be it for a small business or, indeed, for an employee—and says, ‘I feel so aggrieved on your behalf that I am willing to do this pro bono or on the cheap’? Why should it not be the case for any agent who could have the capacity to be paid but who decides to do it pro bono or on the cheap? Just because you are in a particular category, it does not justify the exemption being sought. Therefore, the opposition opposes this amendment.
