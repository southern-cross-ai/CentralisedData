         That the Senate—

             27 May 2007 marks the 40th anniversary of the referendum giving the Federal Government the right to make specific laws in relation to Aboriginal and

            <dd>
             the referendum was passed with an unprecedented level of support from more than 90 per cent of Australians, and is a great example of Indigenous and non-Indigenous people working together in support of equal rights for Indigenous people;
