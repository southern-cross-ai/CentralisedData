           The Labor Party seem to be revelling in a decision that was taken overnight, in another part of the world, determining what will happen in Senator Thorp's home state and my home state of Tasmania. It is a matter on which her party was absolutely decimated not once but twice—once at the federal election on 7 September and then later on in March this year.
          </p>

           So I would simply remind Senator Thorp that, as she leaves this place, she might like to reflect on the reason why she is leaving this place: that the

                 protection for a network of roads, disused quarries, a network of high-voltage lines, pine plantations, eucalypt plantations et cetera. I understand that one person from Portugal used the term that the honourable senator referred to. But can I say that the responses in the Tasmanian ballot boxes were not feeble in any way, shape or form. Having said all that, unlike the Greens and Labor, we do abide by the determinations that are made.

                   The Prime Minister is always very rigorous and robust and Senator Colbeck is always very rigorous and robust—there is no inconsistency in the statements made by either the Prime Minster or my very distinguished colleague Senator Colbeck.

                    , I wish to ask a second supplementary question. Why did the government present a case not supported by the Forest Industries Association of Tasmania, not supported by scientific evidence, but simply supported by Senator Colbeck's holiday snapshots?

                        Those of us on this side firmly believe that two interest groups stitching up a deal behind closed doors is not necessarily indicative of the national or state interest being served. I am on record as indicating that I disagree with the Forest Industries Association on this, and I make no apologies for saying so. I believe they have sold out the long-term interests of their industry and their state. That is my personal view—I have said it and I will continue to repeat it.

                             that we might adopt their approach of accepting these sorts of decisions and determinations. Of course if we were to accept the Greens approach on this, we would be holding demonstrations and doing all sorts of things in contradiction of the decision that has been made. Having not read every single word of the decision, I am not prepared at this stage to say that we unreservedly accept everything in it—but we are responsible world citizens and we will acknowledge and accept the decision and abide by it. However, one can still be critical of the decision as not necessarily reflecting all the objective evidence, the overwhelming majority of which relates to areas of pine plantations, eucalypt plantations, roads, electricity grid wires and old quarries—apparently, now, all somehow

                             . That is the determination that has been made, and so be it. Unlike the Australian Greens, we will respect the arbiter in this matter, and that is the big product differentiation between the Australian Greens and this government.

Can the minister confirm that the Australian government was advised early on that the bid was doomed to fail but the government proceeded to embarrass Australia in this way to satisfy ill-considered election promises made by Tasmanian Liberal Party senators?

                                 So ill-considered were these Liberal Party promises that the Liberal Party won 60 per cent of the House of Representatives seats and won one of the biggest majorities ever that saw Senator Milne's own party lose 40 per cent of its representation in the state parliament. I am one of these old-fashioned people who believe in the ballot box, in people having a say about their own bit of land and in having these decisions made locally rather than having an international body overseas determining our future. That seems to be the way of the world these days. As I have said, we accept the decision.
