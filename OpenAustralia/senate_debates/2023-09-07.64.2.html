        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister the Foreign Affairs, Senator Farrell. Does the Albanese government believe there are specific risks to the safety of Australians that result from travelling through Doha airport?

         I thank Senator Birmingham for his question. I have just travelled through Doha airport on my way back from a holiday a few weeks ago, and I personally don't see any risks. I think the issue that the senator is referring to was an event that occurred some time ago where, at the same time that an Australian flight was due to fly out of Doha, there was a terrible incident that occurred where a newborn baby was left in a bin in the airport and, for whatever reason, a decision was made by the Qatar authorities to take some action against a number of Australian women who were on the plane flying back to Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         This morning, the transport minister made reference to this issue when she was releasing her green paper on the aviation industry at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_Airport" rel="nofollow">
          Canberra Airport
         </a>
         . That was one of the issues that she has raised.

           Noting that the statements by the minister for transport that the minister has referred to about the incident at Hamad International Airport were, 'obviously a context for the decision that I made,' and given the seriousness with which the minister for transport must view that issue and the consequences on her current decision-making about future travel and future flights, has the government changed or updated the travel advice for Australians who are travelling through Doha?

            I thank Senator Birmingham for that question. I'm a bit unclear about the time line he's talking about. If he's indicating, 'Has the government made any changes to its advice since the minister made her statement this morning,' I don't know the answer to that question. But I'm very happy to make some inquiries to find out whether or not there has been any change. I'm not aware of any change that has been made. But in light of the fact that he has asked me this question I will follow that up and see whether any changes have been made to this or any other advice that we might give Australian travellers.

              If the issues cited by the minister for transport are of such concern as to have informed and driven her rejection of the

               Qatar Airways

              application, why are Albanese government ministers, including you, Minister Farrell, publicly encouraging Qatar to put more flights into secondary airports and more seats on in its existing landing slots? Is safety a real concern or just a smokescreen? Do you want more people flying through Doha or less people flying through Doha?

               I thank Senator Birmingham for his question. I don't think there are any inconsistencies here. I am advised that the travel advice remains to exercise normal travel precautions. To the best of my knowledge, in answer to your earlier question, we have not changed the advice other than to say to exercise normal travel precautions. My response, particularly to the issue of Qatar, was to say that if they want additional flights into Australia then there are opportunities for them to use existing rights. One of those rights, as you well know, Senator Birmingham, is to fly into airports like
