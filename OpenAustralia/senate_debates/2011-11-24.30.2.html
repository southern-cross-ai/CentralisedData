        (iv)   most of the dentists who have been found to be non compliant have failed to provide paperwork required by the scheme, but have carried out the treatments for which Medicare benefits have been claimed,

        (v)   of the 41 who are non compliant, only eight have been found to have claimed Medicare benefits for services that had not been provided, and

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i)   acknowledge that non compliance errors in the scheme appear, in many cases to this point in time, to be minor and technical in nature,

        (ii)   require Medicare Australia to desist from demanding full repayment of all Medicare benefits from dental practitioners in such circumstances where non compliance is of an administrative nature only,

       <p class="italic">
        (iii)   require Medicare Australia to halt all recovery action against dentists until a full reassessment of all current audit results has been carried out to consider whether a warning or smaller penalty would be a more appropriate response, and
