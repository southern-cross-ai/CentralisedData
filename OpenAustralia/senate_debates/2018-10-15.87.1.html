         I thank Senator Abetz for his question, and I'll come to Senator Smith in a moment. Australia's position on the death penalty is clear and unequivocal. We oppose the death penalty in all circumstances for all people. We are committed to its universal abolition and we will pursue this through all fora. This morning I launched here at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         our new whole-of-government strategy to pursue global abolition of the death penalty. I also acknowledge the former foreign minister, the Hon.

          Julie Bishop

         , the member for Curtin, for her work on the development of this strategy over the past few years. I thank today the co-chairs of the parliamentarians against the death penalty group, Senator Dean Smith and the member for Fowler,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
          Chris Hayes

         . They are leaders in this place in the campaign against capital punishment. Their strong advocacy is very highly regarded and much appreciated.
        </p>
        <p>
         The strategy I launched today, the first of its kind in Australia, will see our nation work very closely with partners across the world to protect and promote our shared human rights. Last Wednesday, we marked World Day Against The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Penalty" rel="nofollow">
          Death Penalty
         </a>
         , a reminder of the progress that we have made but also of the work that remains to be done to achieve global abolition. In the 50 years since Australia's last execution was held, 95 countries have completely abolished the death penalty. Last week, the Malaysian government announced that it will abolish the death penalty in our region and place an immediate moratorium on carrying out the death penalty. It is this kind of progress that has encouraged us to continue with our advocacy on this issue. It is the work of the parliamentary group against the death penalty that enables us to send such a strong signal from our own parliament.

           I thank the minister for her answer and I further ask: how does the government's whole-of-government strategy to abolish the death penalty provide a comprehensive framework for Australia to be a global leader in ending its use?

            This new strategy provides a comprehensive and cohesive framework for the Australian government to be a global leader in ending the use of the death penalty worldwide. It's built on four pillars and principles. Firstly, that the death penalty is irrevocable, and no legal system is free of error: if the convicted is later found innocent, that is a miscarriage of justice that cannot be rectified. Secondly, it denies any possibility of rehabilitation of the convicted individual. Thirdly, the death penalty is no more effective a deterrent than long-term or life imprisonment. Lastly, it is unfairly used disproportionately against the most vulnerable members of many societies. To progress the implementation of the strategy,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
             DFAT

            will establish a consultative group on the death penalty, which will include a number of Australian based civil society organisations who also campaign on this issue.

               I thank Senator Abetz for that supplementary question. Abolition is a gradual process, and our diplomatic network has been consistent and diligent in advocating our position. As part of our public diplomacy agenda, many of our missions marked World Day Against the

               last week. As a member of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
                UN
               </a>
               Human Rights Council for the first time this year, we were advocating abolition in a constructive, pragmatic manner that respects both the cultural and the social contexts of all retentionist states around the world, especially in our own region, the Indo-Pacific. Our diplomatic network will create clear and articulated plans for engaging with all non-abolitionist states. For some nations, complete abolition of the death penalty is just within reach. For others, the next step might be to seek a reduction in its application or perhaps to ensure that, where it is applied, it is actually applied humanely. We recognise that this journey is a difficult one, but all steps towards abolition, large or small, take us into a more civil world.
