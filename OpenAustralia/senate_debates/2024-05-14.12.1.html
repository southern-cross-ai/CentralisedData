         I move:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         That the Senate take note of the document.
        </p>
        <p>
         The minister has just tabled a document titled
         <i>
          Approaches to Senate Estimates Questions on Notice Asked of All Agencies
         </i>
         that's from the government. This should be a pretty simple document. It should be: 'Give honest, direct answers.' That would be the case if the government were living up to their rhetoric. The minister has tabled this document saying that it's no secret. I want to be clear at the outset that the government has only tabled this document because the Senate was about to order it to table this document. I acknowledge the Greens as well as the entire Senate crossbench for the fact that there was unanimous support from nongovernment senators in this place to call upon the government to table this document and to require the government to explain its contents.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the face of knowing that unanimous support from all nongovernment senators was coming—something you don't often see in this place—the government has decided at the last minute to table the document that the Senate was about to force it to table. Of course, we haven't had the chance to review it yet, because the document was a secret, Minister, until you just tabled it. But we came to ask for it because the coalition, the Greens and the Senate crossbench rightly shared in the outrage at revelations about the contents of this document. We shared in the outrage because this is not a document about how to transparently and honestly answer Senate questions. It's a document prepared—we don't know for sure—either in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister's_Office" rel="nofollow">
          Prime Minister's Office
         </a>
         or the Prime Minister's department but certainly with the Prime Minister's stamp on it. It has been circulated to minister's officers and/or government departments, giving them advice on how to obfuscate, avoid, cover up and ensure that Senate questions go unanswered rather than answered.
        </p>
        <p>
         The hypocrisy we see from the Labor Party in this regard is quite astounding. The Albanese government was going to be a beacon of transparency, but instead they've come up with their own codified manual on how to cover up their misdeeds and mistakes. I want to give credit to journalists Anthony Galloway and Jennifer Duke from Capital Brief, who broke this story in the last couple of weeks. They were the ones who got extracts of this manual and were able to publish it. In publishing it, they brought to the attention of nongovernment senators the tactics of the government, about which I think we'd all been somewhat curious as we saw more and more consistent responses coming to questions—responses that didn't go remotely close to answering them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Although we've only just had the document tabled by the government, let's take a close look at some of the examples that the journalists have published to date of what is in this document. For example, a question may say, 'Has the department or agency held any organised external retreats or external speakers?' You might think the suggested response would be 'yes' or 'no' with provided details, but no; the suggested draft response is, 'The data requested is not captured centrally and obtaining it would be an unreasonable diversion of resources.' Too bad! If the person drafting the response was sitting at an external retreat last weekend, they should full well know that that external retreat happened and be able to report upon it. But no. The recommendation is to say, 'Oh, that would be too hard to answer; therefore, we cannot answer it.'
        </p>
        <p>
         What if a question were asked about the number of meetings the secretary or agency head has had with ministers in their portfolio over a defined period of time? The suggested draft response from the Albanese government about interactions between their ministers and their agency heads is this: 'The secretary regularly meets with portfolio ministers and, at times, ministers outside the portfolio'—no answer at all. This is the best of

         <i>

         </i>
         ! This document must have been drafted by somebody sitting down in the Prime Minister's office, getting out the old
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCR" rel="nofollow">
          VCR
         </a>
         , putting in their old highlights from

           Yes Minister

         </i>
         and going, 'This is what
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Humphrey" rel="nofollow">
          Sir Humphrey
         </a>
         would have said,' because that seems to be the approach the government's taking.
        </p>
        <p>
         How many meetings might there have been? 'The secretary regularly meets with the portfolio ministers.' What is the minimum processing time for consideration of briefs by the minister? 'The department prepares briefs within agreed time frames on a case-by-case basis'—avoiding detail at every possible opportunity.

                <p>
                 What really strikes me is when we come to very precise questions about, for example, things to do with budget transparency. Now, this is very relevant. Today is budget day. We are going into the two-week budget estimates period after this Senate sitting week. A very focused, precise question would be, for the portfolio, 'Please provide a list of the 10 largest estimates variations in the most recent financial year.' You don't get much more precise than that. It's a specific question, specific to the budget, time limited to the last financial year, on a particular issue—namely, estimates variations, where a government department has changed in the course of the year how much it thinks it's going to spend on a particular item. You should absolutely be able to table precisely what those estimates variations are. What does the Albanese government's secret little manual on how to not answer questions suggest as a response to this very precise question? 'The portfolio additional estimates statements inform the parliament of changes to the proposed allocation of resources since the budget. The PAES, annual Appropriation Bills (Nos. 3 and 4) and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) are tabled in the parliament usually in February each year.'
                </p>
                <p>
                 So when senators, whether it is a coalition senator, a Greens senator, Senator Babet or any other member of the crossbench, go and ask a precise and detailed budget question of the Albanese Labor government, what do they get fed in return? A bunch of bureaucratic jargon referring them to go and try to work it out from the budget papers themselves—information that won't actually be in those budget papers. You will not find, in the detail that is requested, the information the government is referring you to go and find in the budget papers. They're setting senators up to run around in little circles, like a dog chasing its tail, never actually getting the answer. That's the type of contempt we are seeing from the Albanese government when it comes to how it is treating the Senate, when it comes to transparency issues and when it comes to the approach to estimates.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What is so galling is that this is a government who made so much about these issues when in opposition. In 2022 Mr Albanese said:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 The Australian people deserve accountability and transparency, not secrecy.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Well, this is the complete opposite of what Mr Albanese promised. He has actually taken lack of transparency, lack of accountability and government secrecy to a whole new level. The Prime Minister's office is directing, in a manual, government departments on how to avoid answering questions. You couldn't come up with a more precise example of the opposite of transparency. It's a scandal. The fact that the government, rather than coming in here apologising and saying, 'We're going to instruct our departments to ignore this, and we got it wrong,' instead came in here and said, 'It's no secret, and there's nothing to hide,' shows just how arrogant they are, just how out of touch they are and just how willing they are to break every single promise or commitment they made to the Australian people.

                  Senator Birmingham is right about one thing: we did make a big issue about that in opposition, and there's a reason for that.
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exhibit_A" rel="nofollow">
                   Exhibit A
                  </a>
                  is right there—Senator McKenzie. Exhibit B is right there—Senator Cash. When it came to avoiding questions at Senate estimates, we saw it all the time. They sat at the cabinet table with a former prime minister who appointed himself to five ministries.

                  So we absolutely made a big deal about this because the Australian people demanded we make a big deal about it because they were sick of it. They were absolutely sick of it and the way they were being treated by the previous government. Those opposite have come in here, and it was a fine performance from Senator Birmingham—but they have a record of being in government that we remember. The Australian people remember, more importantly, that we have a big task to overcome. That is why we absolutely highlighted this in opposition. We are proud of our record in government of actually turning this around. The Australian people know they can expect us to be transparent, honest and accountable with them on every occasion, unlike those opposite from what we've seen. The Albanese government are delivering a higher standard of integrity, transparency and accountability and we are upholding a standard the opposition never, ever did.

                       The numbers of Senate estimates questions on notice, parliamentary questions on notice and orders for the production of documents have all skyrocketed in the 47th Parliament. Despite this surge, the Albanese government is on track to answer more questions than any previous government.

                       They don't like hearing about it, do they? They actually don't like hearing about a government with integrity and accountability and a record of delivering on this. The Albanese government is on track to answer more questions on notice than any previous government. As of 13 May 2024, less than 0.1 per cent of questions on notice remained unanswered from the first four rounds of Senate estimates in the 47th Parliament. We are continuing to respond to the mammoth number of questions received in the most recent round. The number of questions has skyrocketed, and it's important we consider whether answering all of them is the best use of public sector resources.

                           Senator Birmingham is not immune to this sort of activity either. Senator Birmingham asked what temperature the department's buildings are currently set at. Senator Hume alone has asked 13,000 questions on notice in this term. That includes 331 questions concerning paper use by departments, 125 questions on working on the King's birthday and other public holidays and 31 questions concerning who might be the longest-serving agency member. The government wants the Public Service focused on answering questions that are in the public interest, not spurious questions seemingly written to waste the resources of the public sector. We are working across government to support efficient, timely responses to questions on notice. That is our record, and that is what we are doing.

                           Despite receiving nearly half the number of questions per estimates round as the Albanese government did, the Liberals had failed to answer 360 questions on notice when they left office, some dating back as far as October 2019.

                           had failed to answer nearly 780 questions on notice by the time they left office in May 2022. Some of these were many years overdue, despite receiving far fewer questions on average: 86 a month versus 138 a month. Over the life of the previous government, this equalled an average unanswered question rate of 8.2 per cent, significantly higher than the Albanese government's rate of 1.4 per cent.

                           As I pointed out, I think the Australian people remember, or I'm confident that they remember, but it's always worth reminding them of the record of those opposite during their decade in power and of the work we had to do to overcome so much damage they had done to accountability and transparency in this country. The former Prime Minister,

It is one that the Australian people understand. They still judge those opposite harshly. Those opposite have shown no remorse for their actions in government. We will absolutely remind the Australian people, at every opportunity we get, of their diabolical record. And the Australian people treated them accordingly.

                                  It's very rare that the Greens, the entire crossbench and the coalition agree on something. Now, answering questions at estimates is not optional, but it appears that this government would like it to be. We know that from leaks of a document distributed by the Prime Minister's office to ministerial offices in recent weeks that provides advice on how to avoid answering questions in estimates. Here are just a few choice quotes from Capital Brief:

                                  The document … urges everyone to consider referring questions to another department or agency 'where appropriate', and tells them to provide 'only information required to answer the question'.

                                  In the document, departments and agencies are advised to avoid answering a question on how many external retreats and speakers they have organised.

We only know of it because someone with ethics and with concern for democracy leaked part of this document last week, which of course led to all non-government senators tabling a motion asking the government to disclose the full document and also asking the Prime Minister's representative to come in and give an account of themselves. About five seconds before that was meant to happen, the government in fact tabled a copy of the document, but it's very embarrassing that it took the threat of this motion for them to do so. It's very embarrassing for the government that they didn't fess up and do this of their own volition and that it took the rest of the chamber to force them to do the right thing. I've had a quick squiz through the full document. I don't know whether it has been altered. I don't know if that is in fact the original document, so we will scrutinise that very closely.

                                  The second part of the motion that was going to be moved would have required Senator Wong to attend and explain 'what the actual' is going on. We called on the government to say who wrote this document, who ticked off on this document and who was sent this document. None of that has happened today in the government's hasty tabling of what they say is the full version of this cheat sheet on how to not answer questions in estimates. So we still don't know the extent of knowledge that the Prime Minister himself had over this entire debacle. What we do know is that the

                                  standing orders make it an offence for a witness to refuse to answer a question, unless they make a valid claim of public interest immunity, so questions in Senate estimates are meant to be answered. So much for the transparency and accountability that this Labor Party promised in government! This document does not provide advice that is consistent with the commitment that the Australian people deserve accountability and transparency, not secrecy. If the Prime Minister wants to live up to that commitment to transparency, he should immediately—today—retract this document. In recent estimates, it has been getting harder and harder to get answers to questions—and detailed answers, at that—and it is not acceptable from any government but particularly not from a government that said they would be better on transparency and accountability.

                                  I want to flag that the author of this document—we don't know who it is because there isn't a name on the tabled version—could be in contempt of the Senate. We don't know if the Prime Minister wrote this document or if the Prime Minister authorised this document. There's an argument that the Prime Minister could be in contempt of the Senate. Privileges resolution No. 6 says that a person should not 'improperly interfere with the free exercise by the Senate or a committee of its authority'. It further talks about offences by a witness:
                                 </p>

                                  I think you can mount an argument that this document is instructing departmental officials to breach those rules and is therefore instructing departmental officials to be in contempt of the Senate. This is a cheat sheet on how to mislead senators in estimates, and it's the Prime Minister showing absolute disregard for the process of open democracy. He is trashing his own so-called promise of more accountability and transparency. I reiterate that the Prime Minister should retract this document today and start delivering on their promise of a more accountable and transparent government, because this is a betrayal by the Labor government of their promises for a better government.

                                   As of the end of December 2023—7 December, specifically—after 94 Senate sitting days in the 47th Parliament, Anthony Albanese's parliament, 14 guillotine motions have been agreed to. Under the previous Morrison government, in the 46th Parliament, 14 guillotine motions were agreed to. Now we start to see the difference. A total of 87 bills have been subject to the guillotine in the 47th Parliament under the Labor-Greens-teals-Pocock coalition led by Anthony Albanese. In the 46th Parliament, under the Morrison Liberals, there were 59. So we have seen almost 50 per cent more under this government, under the coalition that Labor formed with the teals, Senator Pocock and the Greens, quite often with Senator Jacqui Lambie's support.

We see that the suppression of democracy is a form of control. Always beneath control there is fear. Of what is the Albanese Labor-Greens-teals-Pocock coalition afraid? It's afraid of truth and afraid, fundamentally, of an informed citizenry. They don't want people to know.

We want the government to govern. Senate estimates, though, are a vital part of holding governments and bureaucrats accountable for taxpayer funds. Why do you hide from that? Anthony Albanese's department wants to hide the truth from the people.

It's embarrassing for departments. We look forward to reviewing the formerly secret document in detail, because democracy is at stake.
