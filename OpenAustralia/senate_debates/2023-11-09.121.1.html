        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Farrell. I ask the minister: is it correct that newly released analysis of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        data indicates that—and I quote from the

          Australian Financial Review

        'Australian households have suffered the largest fall in living standards of any advanced economy over the past year' as a result of high inflation, increasing mortgage repayments and the effects of bracket creep on income tax?

         I thank Senator Birmingham for his question. I personally haven't seen those reports. But can I say—and I've said it many times this week—that it's the objective of the Albanese government to ensure that the sorts of issues that you've just referred to are dealt with in a competent, sensible and compassionate way so that this government puts downward pressure on all of those things that Australians are currently finding difficulty with. I've referred on so many occasions, Senator Birmingham, to the sorts of things that this government is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our first objective, of course, was to produce a $20 billion surplus, and, of course, that does have that downward pressure on interest rates. In addition to that, we've been providing a range of benefits to the Australian people to keep that downward pressure on—things like child care and things like rebates on your electricity. In the same process—again, I don't know if this particular article refers to it—of course, we have created 561,000 jobs in the time that we've been in government. All of those—

           On direct relevance: the minister acknowledged at the start of the question that he, perhaps unsurprisingly for the minister, didn't know and wasn't aware of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
            OECD
           </a>
           analysis, but, having waffled on from the couple of minutes after giving that indication, he could at least be directly relevant and helpful to the Senate and take on notice for the government its response to this and the particular question about whether it is correct that the OECD analysis shows Australia is the worst-performing advanced economy for the impact on household incomes.

                  Well, no—we understand that, and we are taking steps to try and address those issues. If I've said it once, I've said it a lot of times this week. We are trying to deal with these issues and put downward pressure on inflation to make life easier for ordinary Australians. It's the things that you voted against and that we have managed to get into legislation that are the sorts of things that ordinary Australians are benefiting from right this moment, whether it be cheaper child care, electricity bill relief, increased—

                    This is my second supplementary question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. The striking thing about this analysis is it shows Australian households as being worse off than households in any other advanced economies. Given this

                    data and the analysis of it, why have the disposable incomes of Australian households been hit so much harder over the last year under the Albanese Labor government than those of all of the other advanced economies? Why are Australians worse off, compared with the rest of the world, under you?

                          Thank you, President, for that protection. Given inflation peaked later in Australia, its moderation is only slightly behind. Inflation is moderating, but it will remain higher than we'd like for longer than we'd like. We've said that. Our economic plan is engineered to ease pressure—
