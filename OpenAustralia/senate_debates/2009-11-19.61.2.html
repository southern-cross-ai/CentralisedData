        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. Is the minister aware of Senator Feeney’s statement yesterday, ‘We reached an accommodation’—and he then went on with the standard spin—‘not with the occupants of that vessel but with the Indonesian government’? Will the minister confirm that this is a clear admission that there was a special deal applicable to those on the

         It seems to me that the tactics committee of the Liberal Party are totally bereft of new ideas, because I have been asked this question in various ways probably about 15 times this week. I can say at first I always listen to Senator Feeney’s contributions very closely because they are erudite and generally quite amusing. He has a certain way that I find very amusing. Senator Feeney obviously has correctly described that there was an agreement between the Indonesian government and the Australian government as to how those who disembark from the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_Viking" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
         </i>
         will be treated. That agreement was struck and that agreement was followed. We insisted that those people disembark in Indonesia and we rejected their claims to come to Australia. Those people have accepted the fact that they will disembark in Indonesia and have done so. They have gone into detention, as we agreed with the Indonesian government, and they will have access to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
          UNHCR
         </a>
         representatives, who will assess their asylum claims.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Feeney was correctly representing that there was an agreement between the two governments as to how this would occur, because the asylum seekers were on our vessel but were disembarking in Indonesian territory. Obviously Indonesian law must apply when they disembark, so there was an agreement between the two governments. That agreement has been honoured by the Indonesian government and it has been honoured by the Australian government. After some delay the asylum seekers on the
         <i>
          Oceanic Viking
         </i>
         have decided to disembark and given up their claim to be taken to Australia. That is as it should be. They will be processed according to the UNHCR processes and, following that, those who are found to be refugees will be treated accordingly. Those who are not will be returned.

          differ from those offered to all other asylum seekers in Indonesia and elsewhere in the world? Why can’t the minister simply acknowledge that it was in fact a special offer made to the queue jumpers to get them off the

           As I made clear, the arrangement between the two governments provided a time frame in which the claims would be assessed. That was agreed between the two governments as a means of resolving the situation of these people disembarking in Indonesia and the Indonesians’ interests in making sure that arrangements were satisfactory to them and satisfactory to Australia. Of course there are variances in time frames regarding asylum claims all around the world.
