        Accordingly, AIHW recently wrote to all Australian Government and state/territory agencies asking them to provide a list of relevant research and evaluation projects for the Clearinghouse online Research and Evaluation register. The Clearinghouse team will follow up with Departments to obtain reports for the Clearinghouse repository as they become available. The Clearinghouse team also distributes a quarterly newsletter and conducts annual presentations to all jurisdictions to encourage them to use and contribute to the Clearinghouse.

        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.43 The committee recommends that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        work on the National Strategy for Food Security in Remote Indigenous Communities include an analysis of alternative agriculture to improve the affordability, quality and availability of fresh fruit and vegetables in regional and remote Indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Australian Government notes this recommendation.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government recognises the important role of local traditional food, local agricultural and horticultural projects, and community gardens in supporting food security in remote Indigenous communities and agrees that these are an important element in improving the supply of healthy food to remote Indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through the National Strategy for Food Security in Remote Indigenous Communities, a draft
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
         National Health
        </a>
        y Eating Action Plan (NHEAP) is being developed which is proposing to, amongst other things, look at agriculture and local food supply development in an effort to improve the food security in remote Indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the NHEAP is yet to be considered by COAG, the Australian Government notes that any analysis of agricultural and horticultural projects in remote Indigenous communities would need to take into account: the impact on food security; the economic viability and sustainability of the projects; and the capacity and willingness of nearby Indigenous communities to support the ongoing implementation of the projects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        More generally, the Australian Government supports the development of sustainable and economically viable agriculture and horticulture projects in remote Indigenous communities. Significant funding support for this sector has been provided through the Aboriginal Benefits Account (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA" rel="nofollow">
         ABA
        </a>
        ). This includes: $3.2 million for the Alekarenge Horticulture Pty Ltd to construct an artesian bore field and support the farming of watermelons; over $900 000 to support the ongoing operations of Centrefarm Aboriginal Horticulture Ltd; $386 000 for the Ti Tree Horticulture Strategy for commercial horticulture development to cultivate bush tomatoes and other native plants; and around $90 000 for a feasibility study of 21 communities and outstations to identify suitable sites to develop sustainable community farms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the Australian Government also encourages the development of community and school gardens where a need is identified and community capacity and willingness to support the sustainable implementation of a garden project are demonstrated. The Australian Government also acknowledges the work of organisations such as Edge of Nowhere (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EON" rel="nofollow">
         EON
        </a>
        ) Foundation in facilitating and supporting gardens in remote Indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The EON Foundation has successfully established school gardens in a number of remote Indigenous communities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia

        , including

         One Arm Point
        </a>
        . Each garden grows a variety of vegetables and bush tucker, and medicine plants are also being propagated with help from community elders for planting into the garden. The work of the EON foundation is supported by $300 000 in funding from the Indigenous Land Corporation (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILC" rel="nofollow">
         ILC
        </a>
        ).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.50 The committee recommends that the Australian Government expand the remit of the Coordinator General for Remote Indigenous Services' reporting mandate for basic service and infrastructure in all regional and remote Indigenous communities with over 200 residents. The committee considers that the Coordinator General should be afforded additional resources to undertake such an expanded reporting role.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Australian Government notes the recommendation.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The functions of the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services (CGRIS) are defined in the Coordinator-General for Remote Indigenous Services Act 2009 (CGRIS Act). The CGRIS responsibilities are presently confined to 29 locations which, in accordance with section 5(2) of the CGRIS Act, are identified in a Gazette Notice. It is intended that the CGRIS functions support the implementation of service delivery reforms through the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Service Delivery (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSD" rel="nofollow">
         RSD
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP" rel="nofollow">
         NP
        </a>
        ). For this reason, the 29 locations identified in the Gazette Notice are aligned with the priority locations identified under the RSD NP.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports the role of the CGRIS in driving the implementation of the RSD NP and it will consider the recommendation further. However, it is important to ensure that the attention of the CGRIS is not diverted from the current 29 priority communities at this important stage.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government also draws to the committee’s attention the COAG National Urban and Regional Service Delivery Strategy for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        . The Overarching Bilateral Indigenous Plans will capture the efforts underway across each state and territory to close the gap on Indigenous disadvantage in urban and regional areas. The Overarching Bilateral Indigenous Plan governance meetings provide a regular opportunity to discuss shared priorities and identify areas for joint action.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.57 The committee notes the consultation being undertaken in developing local implementation plans but considers that as a matter of practice, consultation plans which are not readily accessible to the public should be made public prior to consultation being undertaken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        s) are public documents.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        LIPs are developed and agreed with Indigenous communities, and other parties to the LIPs (such as relevant local governments), through an open process of negotiation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        LIPs are expected to be evolving and iterative documents and subject to amendment as the implementation of the RSD NP in each location evolves.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All efforts will be taken to ensure that relevant parties are aware of consultation sessions well in advance to maximise engagement.
       </p>

        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2.72 The committee recommends that on a monthly basis the Australian Government publish the number and location of new, rebuilt or refurbished homes completed under the National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing program.

        The NPARIH was renegotiated in December 2009 when it became clear that progress was insufficient to meet the targets.

        </a>
        Education Action Plan 2010-2014 (ATSIEAP) was approved by the Ministerial Council for Education, Early Childhood Development and Youth Affairs in April 2010, and was referred for the consideration of the Council of Australian Governments. It contains a number of actions that could be employed by state and territory education systems and providers to recognise local and systemic support for reintegration or re-entry programs. For example, at the local level, schools are to develop Personalised Learning Strategies, involving families, teachers and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Workers to support improved educational outcomes. In responding to long-term absences by students, these Personalised Learning Strategies would typically include targeted actions to assist students to make up time lost as a result of prolonged absence. This could include re-entry programs such as those considered by the committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is also expected that focus schools under the ATSIEAP would develop local attendance strategies, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander parents and the community. Commitments to re-entry programs could be one element of these locally developed attendance strategies. Additionally, under the ATSIEAP, systemic attendance strategies are to be developed, providing an enabling framework for locally developed strategies. Education systems have the capacity to ensure their strategies outline the need to consider re-entry measures for students returning after long-term absences from school.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government considers that the revised ATSIEAP contains sufficient scope to support the intention of the committee's recommendation. However, as this is a matter for education systems, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will ensure that state, territory and non-government education systems are made aware of the committee's recommendation and observations.

        Most recently as part of the COAG decision on 12 April 2010 to establish the National Health and Hospitals Network, all governments except Western Australia agreed to undertake further work on the scope of additional mental health service reform for report back to COAG in 2011. This included the potential for further improvements to the allocation of roles and responsibilities in the delivery of mental health services.

The Plan will further embed the whole of government approach to mental health which recognises the importance of coordinated service delivery, including health, housing and community support services, particularly for people with a severe mental illness.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Central to the Plan is the principle of social inclusion. It recognises the importance of social, cultural and economic factors to mental health and wellbeing.

        In February 2006, all governments through COAG committed additional investment to improve mental health services nationally. A five-year action plan was developed and included a series of measures by both state/territory and Australian governments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of the measures being implemented by the Department of Health and Ageing is ‘Improving the Capacity of workers in Indigenous Communities’. This comprises $20.8 million over 5 years to support health practitioners identify and address mental illness and associated substance use issues in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. The programs funded under this measure encourage the sector to work together, through the development of various culturally appropriate resources and training.
