        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to the dire set of economic data in her home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia

        after yet another two major home builders were placed into administration this week. We have the worst state credit rating in Australia at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA" rel="nofollow">
         AA
        </a>
        . We have building approvals dropping for 16 consecutive months, including a 22 per cent drop in the 12 months to August. We have construction work declining 7.9 per cent for the 12 months to June; South Australia was the only state to record a decline for this period. And we have a 23.2 per cent decline in dwelling commencements in the 12 months to June, with South Australia having the lowest number of dwelling commencements in 11 years. When will the government accept responsibility for the catastrophic state of the

           . I do not accept the premise of the question, as per normal from this senator. I suggest he has a look. If he wants to talk about federal and state policies, it is interesting that he glosses over the fact that the employment figures released today actually show an increase in jobs in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           but over 20,000 jobs being lost in the state of Queensland, the largest drop that has been seen. In South Australia we have seen a small rise in the most recent monthly figures. If the senator is really concerned about the economic issues in our state, he might want to explain why it is that he is part of a party that wants to take $1 billion away from South Australia, because they want to change how the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
            GST

           is allocated. He ought to go back to Adelaide and fess up that Mr Abbott wants to take $1 billion from
