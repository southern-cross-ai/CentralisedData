        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Will the minister update the Senate on the suite of measures this government is deploying to deliver on its commitment to tackling illegal workers, visa fraud and worker exploitation, including the recent national day of action?

         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question and I acknowledge her longstanding interest in ensuring that the rights of workers are protected.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has a longstanding commitment to compliance in the immigration system and to ensuring that at all times the highest levels of integrity are maintained. I can advise the Senate that on Wednesday, 27 May 2015, a national day of action was held, leading to the detention of illegal workers and the gathering of crucial intelligence. The immigration and border protection portfolio, in conjunction with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Work_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
          Fair Work Ombudsman
         </a>
         , staged Operation Cloudburst, targeting the fraudulent use of temporary visas and unscrupulous practices by employers and labour hire contractors. Eleven operations were conducted in all states, also involving state and federal police. A total of 38 illegal workers were detained during Operation Cloudburst. This unprecedented crackdown on illegal working and on the exploitation of workers sends a very clear message to those doing the wrong thing.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has made it very clear that we will not put up with unscrupulous employers and labour hire companies blatantly flouting the law and allowing overseas workers to work illegally in Australia. Operation Cloudburst supports the government's announcement of the establishment of Taskforce Cadena to address allegations of fraud and worker exploitation involving temporary visa holders.

           As well locating and detaining 38 illegal workers, the operation has led to the collecting of important intelligence. The intelligence will form the basis of the taskforce work going forward and will potentially lead to further investigation and possible prosecutions. The penalties for employers who flout the law are well known and should not be taken lightly. This government will be as tough on those seeking to exploit our workplace laws as we have been on those who seek to exploit our borders.

             , and state and territory agencies as required, to ensure that instances of exploitation and visa fraud are properly investigated. Taskforce Cadena's important work will reinforce existing efforts to stamp out illegal practices involving foreign workers, particularly in the labour hire industry. Organised criminal networks and unscrupulous labour hire contractors seeking to profit by exploiting both illegal and legitimate workers, and the taxpayer, should be under no illusionâ€”Taskforce Cadena is targeting you.

               Australians have an expectation that across all visas the products are being used for their intended purpose. The coalition government has sustained a concerted focus on compliance within the immigration portfolio since being elected to office in 2013. The benefits of maintaining compliance are twofold: it not only ensures that we catch those who seek to misuse our migration programs, but, importantly, it ensures Australians retain faith in our migration programs, which, as we know, contribute greatly to our economic and social prosperity. It must be acknowledged that the overwhelming majority of employers in Australia do the right thing, and that the overwhelming majority of visa holders in Australia do the right thing. However, for those who seek to abuse the system, to exploit workers, or to circumvent our migration laws, we have a very simple message: we are targeting you. Our focus on compliance is unwavering and is here to stay.
