        or DAVEY (â€”Deputy Leader of the Nationals and Deputy Leader of the Nationals in the Senate) (): I rise today to highlight the power and potential of Australia's organic industry, which boasts the world's largest certified organic agricultural area, spanning over 53 million hectares. The minister's silence on the issue of organics and his indifference towards the industry is very disappointing. With an annual contribution of over $2.6 billion to our economy and projected revenue growth of 14.6 per cent each year, the organic industry is not just a passing trend. It encompasses not just food but also textiles, cosmetics and a diverse range of products. It's a force driving growth in our regional areas, creating tens of thousands of jobs. Consumers are increasingly embracing organic products. There has been a 53 per cent increase in the purchase of organic fruits and vegetables and there have been significant rises in purchases of things like organic eggs, dairy and meat.
       </p>
       <p>
        But here is the alarming truth: while consumers are eager to embrace organics, they are sceptical, due to the lack of a robust domestic regulatory framework. A staggering 31 per cent of consumers consider lack of trust in organic status as a barrier to making those purchases. The minister's duty is to address these concerns and to restore confidence in our organic industry. We must acknowledge its undeniable strength and its impressive growth and potential by providing the necessary support. Our organic sector deserves it. They deserve a true advocate who will champion their growth and success.
