           A number of questions have been asked since July of this year about the competitive evaluation process for the

            DSTO
           </a>
           , in relation to the Advanced Processor Build Program. Questions have also been asked in relation to the SEA 1000 program for the Future Submarines; visits of officers to France, Germany and Japan in the past 24 months; the Rizzo review; shipbuilding budgets here in Australia; the competitive evaluation process; and replacement combat systems. These are matters that ought to be answered under standing order 74.
          </p>
          <p>
           I know it was short notice, but I did give advance notice to the acting minister's office in respect of this. The issue is that we have Senate estimates coming up. As a courtesy, I did write to the Minister for Defence's office and the Prime Minister office yesterday to give notice of this situation so that this motion could be obviated. If there is some undertaking from the government to give an answer or answers prior to Senate estimates commencing, that would be very helpful in the context of what this standing order is meant to enforce.

            Senator Xenophon, if you say you have given advance notice of this question to my office, I accept your word, of course, although that has not come to my attention.
           </p>
           <p>
            You would be aware, of course, Senator Xenophon, that about four weeks ago there was a reconstruction of the government, with the election of Mr Turnbull as the leader of the parliamentary Liberal Party. And a new defence minister, Senator Payne, was sworn in on 21 September. Now, Senator Xenophon, you did not indicate in your question, or in the short speech that you just gave, the date on which those questions were placed on notice—nor would I expect you to. But it may very well be—

              It was 20 July—sorry, Senator Xenophon. If the questions were placed on notice on 20 July then, plainly, they were placed on notice during the incumbency of the previous defence minister, Mr Andrews. As I said, some four weeks and three days ago there was a transfer of responsibilities for that portfolio. But in any event I will examine the matter, as I ought to do under standing order 74, and get back to you.
             </p>
             <p>
              The defence department does endeavour to respond to these questions promptly, and I am told that it will be responding to outstanding questions as soon as practicable. Of course, Senator Payne has been away all week at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSMIN" rel="nofollow">
               AUSMIN
              </a>
              , as you know. These answers have to be cleared by the minister, and Senator Payne has not been available this week to do so.
             </p>
             <p>
              Given the level of detail and complexity involved in your questions, Senator Xenophon, I note finally that Senate estimates is an appropriate forum—probably the more appropriate forum—to raise these matters, and that you will have the chance to do that next week. I would also like to point out that all portfolio responses to Senate estimates questions taken on notice have been lodged.

                 Thank you. I will be very brief. I thank the Attorney-General for that. If there has been some miscommunication in respect of that, I understand that he is in the position of acting minister. Just for the record, so there is no misunderstanding: the number of questions that I asked started from 20 July of this year up until 2 September—all questions before the current Minister for Defence was sworn in. I just want to put that on the record for the sake of completeness.
