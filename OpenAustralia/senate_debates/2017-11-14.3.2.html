         Mr President

        , I take this opportunity to share with other colleagues in congratulating you on your recent elevation to this esteemed post. While a lot has been said—and probably a lot is still to be said—regarding some of the circumstances towards the end of Senator Parry's term as President, I want to echo the words of those on this side of the chamber and the other side of the chamber who speak of him as an incredibly distinguished, decent and good-humoured being—and I know you will share in this, Mr President. Aside from politics, all senators felt that he was an advocate for all of us. Mr President, I wish former Senator Parry the best in his future endeavours and I congratulate you on your elevation to this esteemed position.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to rise on behalf of the opposition to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Tax Integrity) Bill 2017 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Fees Imposition Amendment (Vacancy Fees) Bill 2017. This legislation is to do with issues around housing affordability. As my colleagues said last night, Labor supports this legislation and does not oppose the passage of it. However, we are not under any illusion that these measures will do anything for housing affordability. I note that this is an issue many members of the Senate have been very passionate about—and it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge my good friend Senator Jacqui Lambie, who has just walked into the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Lambie, there has obviously been a fair bit of media speculation over the past few days. I want to echo my personal view, which I know is the view of many senators across the political divide, that your contribution is a tremendous one. You are an incredible human being. You may be someone who on different policy areas at different times some of us haven't always agreed with, but what you have achieved and what you've been able to contribute, and the life experience that you have brought into this chamber, has made the Senate a better place. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later hour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate interrupted.
