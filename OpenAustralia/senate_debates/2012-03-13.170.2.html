        <p>
         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The comprehensive strategic assessment of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef
         </a>
         World Heritage Area aims to protect the environment, support more efficient and effective regulation of future coastal development and meet Australia's obligations to protect the World Heritage values of the property. It will achieve this by examining direct, indirect and cumulative impacts from existing, planned and potential future coastal development activities.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The strategic assessment can not “suspend” or “switch off” assessment and approval processes for individual actions that have already been referred or are referred before completion of the strategic assessment. Consistent with legal requirements, assessments will continue for individual project proposals in the Queensland coastal zone or Great Barrier Reef. Proponents of controlled actions will be expected to meet a high standard of assessment, including consideration of cumulative impacts, where appropriate, to ensure that any individual project assessment does not compromise the strategic assessment process.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Australian Government will strongly encourage all proponents of actions in the Great Barrier Reef to have their proposals considered as part of the strategic assessment process rather than individually, however, the government is required to consider all valid proposals referred in accordance with the law.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Refer to (1) above. Actions that have been referred or are referred before the completion of the strategic assessment will be assessed stringently in accordance with usual assessment and approval provisions of the

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Refer to (1) above. Proposed actions that have been referred or are referred before the completion of the strategic assessment will be assessed rigorously in accordance with the usual assessment and approval provisions of the
