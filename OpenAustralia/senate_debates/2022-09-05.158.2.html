        Teachers change lives. We often hear it, but I have always believed it. In July this year a teacher from Montello Primary School in Burnie on the north-west coast of Tasmania received the honour of being named as one of 12

        , an inspiring teacher from Montello Primary School in Burnie, has transitioned from a general classroom teacher to become a

        </a>
        specialist teacher. He has led a transformation in science and STEM education for students at Montello Primary School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Montello Primary School is in a low socioeconomic area with high unemployment, and Daniel's passion has helped to generate a cultural shift in the students' engagement and achievements at Montello school. He is their first STEM specialist teacher and has helped develop the school's make a space room to provide new opportunities for students to engage in STEM activities. He has since coached teams from the school to the finals of prestigious state, national and even international STEM challenges, including the top three Tasmanian teams in the Australian techgirls competition. And another student from the school, Indiana Wells, is an Asia-Pacific winner of the Microbit Foundation's do your :bit challenge. These successes have generated widespread acclaim and driven a new interest in STEM learning throughout Montello Primary School and wider community.
       </p>
       <p>
        With Daniel's leadership, the school has received awards for greater participation and overall commitment to the Tasmanian Science Talent Search STEM challenge and the TSTS competitions. One outstanding feature of Daniel's impact is his collaboration and sharing of knowledge with other schools. He has hosted STEM expos, volunteered as a judge for the national STEM video game challenge and international MakeX Spark robotics competition, and presented on best practices in STEM education at state and national conferences. His impact on education has been recognised by the 2021 Tasmanian STEM Primary Teacher of the Year award and selection as the 2022 Tasmanian finalist for the

        Science and Engineering Teacher Awards. Daniel said he felt he was on cloud nine after the Commonwealth Bank teaching awards and the opportunity to celebrate with a group of 12 incredible newly named teaching fellows—10 early career teachers who also received awards—as a privilege. Indeed, he describes the energy and passion across the room at the awards as inspirational.
       </p>
       <p>
        This award also gave Daniel the opportunity to meet many highly esteemed and inspiring educators from all around the country over the three days in Sydney. Genuine connections and relationships were formed, and Daniel plans to continue working alongside others on some great ideas for projects, potential collaborations and visits to each other's schools. In his own words, Daniel says, 'I am so proud to be part of this team and I am so excited about all of the great and innovative things we can continue to achieve for our students. Thank you also to all of the staff, students and wider community of Montello Primary School. There is not a place in the world I would rather be or any other job I would rather be doing. We are well and truly living up to our motto, 'making people shine'. Every single day, students and staff at Montello are achieving incredible things, and I couldn't possibly be any prouder to be playing a small part in that. I am so inspired, challenged and encouraged with the knowledge that this fellowship will enable so many opportunities for our students beyond what even I can comprehend.' I want to take this opportunity to thank Daniel Edwards, as well as the amazing team at Montello primary and the broader community of Burnie for embracing STEM, for all the good work nurturing the minds of the children, who will help lead North West Tasmania in years to come. Congratulations to Daniel and congratulations to Montello Primary School.
