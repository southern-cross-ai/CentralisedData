        by leave—On 12 August I addressed the parliament in the first of what I planned to be regular progress reports on Defence’s efforts in Afghanistan. This is my second ministerial statement on Afghanistan since becoming the Minister for Defence. The Australian government welcomes scrutiny by the Australian public of our progress as well as, of course, our setbacks.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
         NATO
        </a>
        on the ongoing issue of how we can contribute to the effort in Afghanistan. In our discussions with coalition partners, we will emphasise that we consider the increase in our troop commitment by about 40 per cent, to 1,550 personnel, in April this year to be significant and at about the right level. This is not to say that Australia cannot reshape our contribution if appropriate in the light of any revised strategy. In line with NATO’s priorities, Australia is examining what we might do in terms of focusing on training, civilian assistance and capacity building. I have asked
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
         CDF
        </a>
        to review the composition of our current contribution to determine if adjustments should be made within the current force level to support the revised strategy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Protection of our soldiers is a very high priority. On 22 July this year, I directed CDF to undertake a comprehensive force protection review. This was one of my first decisions as defence minister. I want to ensure that our troops in Afghanistan have the full range of protections. This review has been based on information received from our deployed forces. It covers aspects of personal protection such as body armour, ballistic eye protection and load-carrying equipment, and improvements to vehicles for physical and electronic protection. The review is a thorough analysis and includes a way forward. I reported to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         National Security Committee
        </a>
        of Cabinet on the review this week, and Defence is now progressing the outcomes as a matter of priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also address some recent criticism of the manner in which Defence provides information on battle casualties. Defence does not release the details of incidents when a particular operation is underway or involves special forces personnel because of operational security. As part of this statement, for the first time, I am reporting to the Australian people more fully on the status of ADF personnel wounded in action in Afghanistan. When I last updated the Senate, over 70 Australian soldiers had been wounded. This figure now stands at 92. Thirty-four have been wounded this year. Of these, 28 soldiers were wounded by improvised explosive devices and four by gunfire. Other injuries have included head injuries and leg fractures. Since the mission began, three soldiers have required partial leg amputations. In the last 12 months, 17 returned to Australia for medical care and rehabilitation. For those soldiers in recovery, on behalf of all of us in the Senate, I wish them well. Fortunately we have lost no further Australian soldiers on operations since my last ministerial statement, but I would not wish to forget the tragic loss of Lance Corporal Mason Edwards, who was accidentally killed in training while preparing for his third tour of Afghanistan. His loss has been deeply felt by his family, friends and comrades in the ADF.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have made this statement today because I did not want the parliamentary year to close without having made a further address on the progress of our efforts in Afghanistan. I thank the Senate for allowing time for this ministerial statement to be considered with the enormous pressure of business that we face. I certainly undertake to report further in the next session of parliament on developments in Afghanistan to keep the parliament and the public informed. I am sure the Senate appreciates that I have very significantly curtailed my remarks to enable other senators to address this important issue. Finally, I seek the leave of the Senate to allow the full ministerial statement on Afghanistan to be incorporated into

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , there may also be other areas where we could re-examine or enhance our approach to dealing with issues relating to operations. I said in August that this Government is committed to transparency in relation to any Australian involvement in incidents or engagements in which there are civilian casualties. I stand by that commitment. Since I last updated Parliament, there has been one such incident, reported on 10 November 2009, in which a man was injured and received immediate coalition medical attention. This, and other previous incidents are still under investigation, and will be made public once all the relevant processes are completed.

The ADF rehabilitation program is constantly reviewing international best practice to ensure that the treatment provided to our battle casualties is first class. For those soldiers in hospital or rehabilitation, on behalf of all Senators, I wish them well in their recovery.

        Mr President, Afghanistan has endured decades of conflict. The task ahead for the Afghan people is not an easy one. The

       <p class="italic">
        I can assure the Senate that as Minister for Defence I remain committed to and focussed on our mission in Afghanistan, together with the Prime Minister, the

        I have made this Statement today because I did not want the Parliamentary year to close without having made a further address on the progress of our efforts in Afghanistan. In the next few weeks we will see the United States response to McChrystal, further discussion in NATO and a renewed focus on strategic direction in Afghanistan from our coalition partners.
