        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Senator Wong, in a question time in September 2022, I asked you a question in relation to immigration. In response to the question, you said Labor had increased immigration to 195,000 per year as a consequence of capacity constraints in the economy. Will the minister please explain to the Australian people why Labor has let immigration blow out to a record 650,000 this financial year and the next as reported in the

             I do endeavour to answer your questions, Senator Hanson. I did want to just acknowledge the work of those behind me, particularly Senator Farrell, who I think did very well in my absence.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think my response to you, Senator Hanson, was referring to the net overseas migration figures. I am advised that the increase in net overseas migration is 304,000 for the year ending September 2022. There is also an increase in planned permanent migration in 2022-23 which, of course, is a commitment from the Jobs and Skills Summit. I'd make the point—and I assume my answer to which you're referring was making the same point—that we obviously do have some capacity constraints in the Australian economy. In fact, ensuring that we have an appropriate level, particularly of permanent migration, is one of the ways we can grow our economy and one of the ways in which we can ensure that some of those capacity constraints driving inflation are dealt with.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm sorry, Senator Rennick?

                What I would say to you, Senator Hanson, is that this government, in its approach to net overseas migration, will always be guided by the national interest. There will obviously be a balance of questions that the government has to address, which go to skills shortages but also to some of the issues that we've been discussing for some weeks now, including availability of housing supply, but the government will always make decisions on migration in the national interest.

                  Labor's Housing Australia Future Fund plan to build 30,000 new homes in the next five years will obviously do nothing to alleviate Australia's housing and rental crisis in light of the fact approximately 700,000 homes are needed. Minister, when will Labor finally commit to making the massive cuts to immigration necessary to reduce demand for housing so that Australians already living here can have a home rather than living in their cars, tents or even on the streets?

                   I thank Senator Hanson for the question. I would make the point that one of the reasons the government wants to bring forward the Housing Australia Future Fund is to ensure that we can contribute to greater supply. It is, I think, very deeply concerning that in the face of some of what is occurring in the housing sector that we have the no-alition—those opposite, who I know are struggling with the reality of opposition and are very angry, as is evinced by the sorts of interjections we get—simply saying no and the Greens saying it's not enough and, as a consequence, there are people in this country who would be benefited by increasing housing supply, which may be left wanting. Of course, always more can be done, Senator Hanson, and I think we all understand that. And, as I said, these are some of the issues the government will grapple with.

                        Thank you, first, in relation to Senator Farrell. My observation was that Senator Farrell was outstanding while I was away, and I was very grateful for his leadership, as I'm sure all of our colleagues are. Senator Hanson, what I would say is this: if people in this chamber are really concerned about housing, then they would stop their opposition to our housing fund, they would recognise that even if they don't agree with all aspects of government policy—

                            My message is, yes, we do need to increase the supply of housing. This government went to the election with a very clear policy, a set of policies, around increasing the supply of housing—because we on this side of the chamber care about social housing, we care about improving access to decent housing and we care about what is happening in the rental market. And we understand that one of the key ways in which government can do that is to—
