        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. Can the Attorney-General update the Senate on the attacks on two police officers in Melbourne last night, including an update on their condition?

         are still being investigated, we do know that two officers have been injured in the line of duty and one 18-year-old male was shot and killed overnight. As the Minister for Justice explained this morning, the person in question was of interest to both law enforcement and intelligence agencies from a national security perspective. The person in question attended the Endeavour Hills Police Station in Melbourne of his own volition following discussions with police earlier in the evening. He then carried out an unprovoked attack on the two officers at around 7.45 pm. The shooting by one police officer occurred in self-defence. Two officers were wounded in the attack, one seriously. An

         officer is in a serious but stable condition. I understand that a Victorian police senior constable is undergoing surgery today but is also in a stable condition.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government's thoughts are with the injured officers and their families at this time. The bravery shown by the officers last night in what was a very dangerous situation demonstrates, yet again, the dedication of our law enforcement officers and their determination to keep our communities safe and secure.

           Yes, I can, Senator. Although the investigation is ongoing—and for that reason I cannot provide too many further specific details—I can advise you that the Minister for Justice and I have been in contact with the Prime Minister, who is travelling overseas, and with the

            Acting Prime Minister

           following the incident. I understand that earlier today Prime Minister Abbott spoke to the wives of both of the injured officers. I have also briefed the Leader of the Opposition; the shadow Attorney-General; the local member, Mr Anthony Byrne, the member for Holt; and members of the

             What I want to say to you, Senator Fawcett, and to the Australian people in general is that the public should feel confident that law enforcement and intelligence agencies and the government are taking every possible step to ensure the safety and security of our communities. People should remain calm and let the authorities manage the situation that took place overnight. The government is ensuring that the agencies have the tools and resources necessary to combat threats to our security and safety.
            </p>
            <p>
             Later today I will be introducing a second tranche of legislation to address the most pressing gaps in our current counter-terrorism legislative framework, those that have the greatest impact on prevention and disruption of domestic terrorist threats. I am pleased to be able to tell you, Senator Fawcett, that this morning the Prime Minister received a letter from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, in which he advised the Prime Minister that the opposition would do all in its power to facilitate the effective and expeditious passage of that legislation through the parliament.
