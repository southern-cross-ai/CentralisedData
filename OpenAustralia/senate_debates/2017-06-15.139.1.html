         I thank Senator Back for his long interest in this particular policy area. Australia is making a very significant contribution to maritime security in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         through our contribution to the Combined Maritime Forces. Currently, the Anzac class frigate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
          HMAS
         </a>

         is deployed to the region as part of Operation Manitou and is helping to stem the flow of drugs and contraband through the waters of the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can advise the Senate that the ship's company has so far in this deployment seized over 1.3 tonnes of drugs during this time. On 7 June, just last week, the crew seized 260 kilograms of heroin in the north
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
          Indian Ocean

         that was concealed inside a suspicious dhow. This is the third successful intercept of drugs during
         <i>
          Arunta
         </i>
         's current deployment. The ship's company made a 250 kilogram seizure of heroin in May and an 800 kilogram seizure of hashish in March.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_April" rel="nofollow">
          In April

         , I actually joined HMAS

         during her transit of the

         </a>
         . I was able to meet and thank the ship's company for their efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         The interception of these narcotics is very important to help deny the financial pathway that terrorists use to fund their activities in the Middle East and beyond. By preventing those drugs from reaching their destination, not only are we destroying their ability to raise funds and helping to create a more stable region while fostering trade and commerce but we are also protecting destination countries from the potential harmful impacts of these drugs. This is

         's fourth deployment to the region. It is Australia's 64th rotation of a

            In fact, the success of these missions is due in no small part to the skill and the professionalism of the men and women who are embarked on our ships. When I met with the commander of the Combined Maritime Forces, United States Vice Admiral Kevin Donegan, in Bahrain in April, he described the skill of our boarding parties as amongst the most rigorous and meticulous of all of the nations contributing to the mission. During the most recent seizure that I alluded to in my previous response, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
             Royal Australian Navy
            </a>
            personnel worked right throughout the night and in very difficult conditions to complete that seizure. The people who are running these drugs go to extraordinary lengths to conceal them. It is a great testament to the proficiency of the men and women of our Navy that they are able to identify these suspicious fishing dhows and then conduct an absolutely meticulous search in very tough conditions to find these significant hauls of drugs.
