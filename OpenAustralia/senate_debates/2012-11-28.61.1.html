              The short answer is yes. That has been the position of this government from 2007, from its election: Israel guaranteed within secure borders. We would not contemplate any other policy. It is consistent with the views of federal Labor governments. It is consistent with the views of foreign ministers and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Ministers" rel="nofollow">
               Prime Ministers
              </a>
              of Labor governments. It has never been in doubt; it has never been in question.
             </p>
             <p>
              Moreover, I suspect, unlike the senator who asked me the question, I have argued this case with advocates of the Palestinian cause. I have said to them that Israel can never be bombed towards a two-party state. Unlike you—you would not have engaged in this sort of debate—I have debated this issue for decades, Senator. I have said to Palestinian delegations: you will not achieve peace or advance peace by firing missiles onto Israel. I have said that, until there is an unequivocal commitment to Israel within secure boundaries, the preconditions for a peace between the parties in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

              is not met. I do not say that when I am speaking only in the Senate, only in the Australian parliament. I have said it elsewhere. I have said it when I have been honoured to confer a peace prize on
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannan_Ashrawi" rel="nofollow">
               Hannan Ashrawi

              , an honourable spokesperson for the Palestinian cause. I said in that speech in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales
              </a>
              parliament: Israel will not be bombed towards peace negotiations—as simple as that. I have said it when I have met a Palestinian delegation that came to see me after the Parramatta Community Cabinet meeting. I said to these young students—two very bright young girls—we believe in a Palestinian state, but Palestinians will only advance that goal by giving Israel the security guarantees it legitimately wants. I said that is the Australian position. We will not retreat from that position. I said to a group of Palestinians on another occasion, when I was
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               Premier of New South Wales
              </a>
              , that Israel responded by building a security barrier because bombs were going off in bus depots and cafeterias. Any government, I said, would do the same.

                I would like to help the honourable senator find his way through these issues. I suspect that, given the expertise on this matter that resides in the Senate chamber on both sides of the house, you have probably been left behind by a debate far more intense and far more sophisticated than your comments suggest. The fact is that this motion does not confer statehood on the Palestinian territories; it does not do that. It gives a non-state status to the Palestinian delegation, which is somewhat higher than what it enjoys at the present time—a non-state status. When the vote takes place later this week, you will see that conservative governments from around the world will cast either a yes vote or an abstention. You will find that to be the case. To accuse them, to accuse the British government—

                     Any reasonable observer of the proceedings this afternoon in the Senate could well ask: is that the view of the coalition? Is the view that there should be no engagement with the Palestinians, even the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority" rel="nofollow">
                      Palestinian Authority
                     </a>
                     , now the view of the coalition in Australia? Is the view they have taken that the Palestinian Authority—not Hamas, not Gaza, but Ramallah—should be dismissed? That way lies no prospect of a two-state solution.

                    <p>
                     He is bewildered by the notion of observer status. The resolution before the Senate would lift the status of the Palestinian delegation from 'other entity' to 'observer status'.

The fact is that this government's position—restated last week, restated at every opportunity since 2007 and restated by the Prime Minister in question time in another place—has been that it remains a supporter of a two-state solution with a secure Israel—
