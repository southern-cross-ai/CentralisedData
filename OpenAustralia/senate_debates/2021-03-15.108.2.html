The amendments respond to the evolving impacts of and issues highlighted by COVID-19 on the ECEC sector and families and provide certainty to child care providers, enable IT system enhancements and provide further support to families using child care.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Industrial Chemicals Environmental Management (Register) Bill 2020 (ICEMR Bill) would establish a national framework to manage the ongoing use, handing and disposal of industrial chemicals, in order to reduce the impacts on the environment and limit people's exposure to potentially harmful industrial chemicals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Industrial Chemicals Environmental Management (Register) Charge (General) Bill 2020, Industrial Chemicals Environmental Management (Register) Charge (Customs) Bill 2020 and the Industrial Chemicals Environmental Management (Register) Charge (Excise) Bill 2020 (collectively referred to as the ICEMR Charges Bills) would provide a framework for applying cost recovery charges. This would allow the Commonwealth's costs of administering the framework in the ICEMR Bill to be appropriately recovered. These charges would be called scheduling charges.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Industrial Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2020 is a companion bill to the ICEMR Bill. It would make a number of consequential amendments to the
        <i>
         Industrial Chemicals Act 2019
        </i>
        to ensure the scheduling charge can be collected alongside the registration charge already collected under the framework of that Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ICEMR legislation gives effect to intergovernmental agreements between the states and territories and the Commonwealth Government. The passage of the bills is necessary to enable the establishment of the National Standard for the environmental risk management of industrial chemicals. State and territory governments are anticipating the passage of the ICEMR legislation and are preparing to implement scheduling decisions that will be made once the ICEMR legislation is in force. If the Bills are not passed in the Autumn sitting period, this will delay the implementation of the National Standard in all Australian jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth. This may undermine current momentum with states and territories for delivery of the reforms.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reforms in the Bill will reduce the time and cost associated with the provision of credit by removing responsible lending obligations for products other than small amount credit contracts and consumer leases. This will provide greater flexibility to lenders in adhering to principles of 'prudent' lending. Borrowers will benefit from reduced application times and the need to provide information to lenders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill's amendments to the Credit Act enhance the consumer protection framework for consumers of small amount credit contracts and consumer leases, while ensuring these products can continue to fulfil an important role in the economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These reforms are required as soon as possible so that consumers can continue to spend and business can invest and create jobs as the economy recovers from the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. The Bill's amendments to the Credit Act are required as soon as possible to provide regulatory certainty for Australian consumers.

       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bills
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bills will create a modem, fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for online safety that harnesses the strengths of the existing arrangements and holds industry to account for the safety of their products and services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage in the 2021 Autumn parliamentary sittings is necessary to introduce a new regulatory framework for illegal and harmful content - extending the reach and scope of the eSafety Commissioner's powers and making industry more accountable and transparent in relation to their efforts to keep users safe on their services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures in the bills will enhance the protections from online harms for all Australians, including a new scheme to address adult cyber abuse. While children are particularly vulnerable to online harms such as cyberbullying, increasingly and prominently adults are facing abuse and hate campaigns online. The most serious forms of abuse are disproportionately targeting women and minority groups, including Aboriginal and

        + community, people with mental health issues or people living with a disability. This kind of targeted abuse serves to silence certain voices and discourages engagement online. Online trolling also has a negative impact on the economy (estimated at $4 billion) due to lost income and medical expenses.

       <p class="italic">
        Passage of the bills will send a strong message that the online world is not an ungoverned space.

        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment (Age of Dependants) Bill 2021 amends the
        <i>
         Private Health Insurance Act 2007
        </i>
        to increase the maximum age of dependents for private health insurance policies from 24 to 3 I years and remove the age limit for dependents with a disability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill is part of the Government's commitment to ensuring private health insurance is affordable and provides value for money for consumers.

        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the bill is not passed in the 2021 Autumn sittings, then insurers will not have the option to offer young people, families and people with a disability access to more affordable private health insurance products from 1 April 2021, as announced by the Government in the 2020-21 Budget.

        Private health insurers also require certainty from passage of the bill, to undertake product and systems changes, as well as communicate to customers.

        If this bill is not passed in the 2021 Autumn sittings, permanent increases to maximum basic rates of payment and income-free areas will not begin to be paid on 1 April 2021 and all temporary COVID-19 arrangements will cease on 31 March 2021, which will mean the Government is unable to provide increased social security support to individuals into the future.

        The purpose of the Bill is to amend the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRV" rel="nofollow">

        Act) to extend the repeal date in section 17 of the Act from 30 June 2021 to 30 June 2023. This will allow special recreational vessels (also known as superyachts) to continue to operate charters in Australia until a longer-term regulatory solution is found.

       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consultation timeframes, reforms will not be identified and agreed before the SRV Act sunsets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Extension of the repeal date before 30 June 2021 is needed to support superyacht charters in Australia beyond this date. The ability to charter brings economic benefits into regional communities in Australia, supporting local industries and establishing Australia as a destination for these vessels.
