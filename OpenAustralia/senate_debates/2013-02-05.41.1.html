        My question is also on behalf of Senator Furner and is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister please update the Senate on the flood situation in Queensland and outline what assistance the federal government is providing?

         I thank Senator Moore and Senator Furner for their continued interest in this matter. Over the summer, we passed the two-year anniversary of the floods and cyclones that ravaged Queensland in 2010 and 2011. Unfortunately, in Queensland this summer, we again faced natural disasters caused by heavy rainfall from ex-tropical Oswald. In particular, as a consequence, communities were shattered and lives torn apart. During this crisis period, the government activated immediate assistance to protect lives and communities. We activated the Australian government disaster response plan to deploy support and physical assets into the affected areas.

         officers integrated into state crisis and response centres to link the Commonwealth and state management efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         At present, 358 ADF personnel are still deployed across the region, including 222 in Bundaberg specifically. They are performing critical work in supporting the clean-up, reopening key transport routes and providing specialised support—including today beginning work to reopen the Don Tallon Bridge, a part of the key critical infrastructure links between north and south Bundaberg—and working to support families, communities, primary producers and small businesses.

         is also providing financial support to those who are worst hit. Already we have rolled out significant Commonwealth funding to clean up and rebuild communities, provide emergency payments to families, support farmers and small businesses with clean-up and recovery grants and support for those employees whose place of work has been damaged. Also available are the Australian government disaster recovery payments which provide, for those eligible, $1,000 for adults and $400 for children to assist—

           The Gillard government has a track record of standing shoulder to shoulder with Queensland to repair, recover and rebuild after natural disasters. After the 2010-11 floods and cyclones, we put in place the right measures to meet the needs of the community. In times of crisis, and then through the long, hard road of recovery right across Queensland, what Queenslanders need is the right assistance delivered efficiently and effectively for the recovery. That is what this government has done through that whole period, and it continues to support Queensland post those disasters.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 2011, we saw ways to cut red tape and get on with the sensible solutions to rebuild the shattered infrastructure and also work with Queensland to fix roads and bridges. The Gillard government worked together with the Queensland government to deliver measures such as the Queensland local council package for water and sewerage and repairing damage to Brisbane ferry terminals—

             Coming out of the 2010-11 floods and the ongoing rebuilding effort, the Commonwealth and Queensland governments are preparing to manage this disaster through the immediate recovery and rebuild periods. The model of that recovery is still in place and ready to roll out in Queensland again. The government will be able to finalise measures for targeted assistance, streamlined processes and fast track support by striking a renewed national partnership agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
             Since last week, I have urged the Queensland government to work with the Commonwealth on a new revised national partnership agreement. I am happy to advise the Senate that I was contacted by the Queensland Treasurer earlier today, and that work is now underway. The new

             , along with the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, should deliver on the rebuilding of Queensland.
