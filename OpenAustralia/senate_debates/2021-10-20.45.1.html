        [by video link] Today I am so proud to be giving a speech written by Shania Gamble, from Adelaide, as part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Voice
        </a>
        in Parliament Week. Here's Shania's speech:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As of 2021, the Australian population accounts for approximately 13 million females.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Of this population, an average of 306,000 have given birth to a child this year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Shania Gamble, I am 20 years old, and contribute to the population that support women in their birth as a student midwife.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have been inspired, amazed, appalled, and disappointed at times observing the care women receive.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The health system needs help, going backwards isn't an option and standing still is not enough.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 20 years, I envision Australia to improve the care of the 13 million women in their pursuit to start a family.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My passion for helping women in the most vulnerable time of their life may not be enough however, improved resources for maternity care can.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I raise my voice for the women who sit in waiting rooms for hours because there isn't enough staff to attend to her.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the parents who want the same midwife throughout their pregnancy but cannot because they 'didn't make the cut'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the unborn babies who deserve the brightest future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Women will continue to give birth for the rest of time, how long are we going to deprive them of the care they deserve?
       </p>

         [by video link] I would like, at this moment, to contribute also to the Raise Our Voice in Parliament campaign that seeks to bring into this place youth voices that are so urgently needed. I read now a speech on behalf of Winter.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         My name is Winter and I'm a 17 year old from Tangney,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . There are many aspects of the Australian experience that I wish to see evolve, but there is one area that I am particularly hopeful to see change in the next 20 years. I have spent my highschool years surrounded by some of the most wonderful people, many of whom happen to be queer, trans, non-binary, or otherwise gender diverse. And I have watched them, my friends struggle to be accepted and have their feelings and identities taken seriously. I am hoping that as a society we can normalise the non-conformity to gender norms, as well as increase the availability and normality of gender neutral bathrooms. Similarly, I hope to see increased funding for services that provide gender diverse youth with guidance and acceptance so that they may live a life that feels authentic and fulfilling to them. Through facilitating societal evolution in this way I hope to see that the youth 20 years from now will not have to struggle, as my friends have, to find acceptance and understanding from Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you, Winter. Thank you for your words and your courage in putting them forward to parliament today.

          Today, as part of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
           Youth Voice
          </a>
          in Parliament Week, I deliver Shaziyeh Samadi's speech.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          In 20 years' time I hope that Australia continues to be a place of equality; where people treat each other with respect and kindness.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I value the way people treat each other, and the way the Government treats people because it is so different to the way it was in my home country (Afghanistan).
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          When I lived in Afghanistan I could not study or go outside alone; women do not have the same rights as men. Australia gives women and girls the opportunity to study and work.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I am excited for my future and what I can achieve in the next 20 years in Australia and hope to be a businesswoman one day.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I hope that Australia continues to provide these opportunities to everyone.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I hope that in 20 years every city in Australia has a high school that operates the same way as
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebarton_Senior_College" rel="nofollow">
           Thebarton Senior College
          </a>
          . Many young people arrive in Australia when they are past the age of being able to attend mainstream schools, or experience barriers to education that mean they miss out and might want to study again when they are a bit older. Being able to attend a flexible but supportive school environment that treats them like adults, but at the same time gives them a supportive school experience is so beneficial.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I would also change the legal age that people can buy cigarettes, vapes and alcohol. I believe that 18 is too young, and that increasing the age would help prevent young people from accessing harmful substances.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you, Shaziyeh, for your kind words.
