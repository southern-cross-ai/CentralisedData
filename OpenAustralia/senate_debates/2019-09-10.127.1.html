              Labor will not be supporting this motion from the Greens today. The motion is long, detailed and raises some complex issues. The issues raised in this motion warrant substantive debate in a way that allows all senators to participate if they choose. Placing this motion in formal business does not allow for this debate. If the Greens were to bring this back as an MPI or in general business then Labor would actively engage in that debate.
