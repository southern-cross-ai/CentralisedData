        I seek leave to move that the consideration of this bill be not limited by time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave not granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to contingent notice, I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of standing order 142 be suspended as would prevent further consideration of the Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2018 without limitation of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said in my speech in the second reading stage, this is a bill that has been hijacked to do something that it was never intended to do. It was a housekeeping bill to clean up an oversight. It has now been turned into a weapon of political destruction. The price of that political destruction is the wellbeing of men, women and children on Nauru. For all the confected outrage about how concerned these people are who want to dismantle Australia's border protection system, the fact is that they are limiting debate in this place on a matter of life and death. They've left it to the last day in the parliament to guillotine a committee stage, a Senate inquiry. They truncated debate through the second reading debate—less than an hour. It's the death knell of this parliament and they're playing with people's lives. It is an appalling indictment of the processes and the sheer bastardry that is levelled by the use of numbers.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that when Labor and the Greens team up the consequences for Australia's border protection are catastrophic. We know that the price of that red-green alliance is people dying at sea. We know there are 50,000 people, legacy cases, that are testament to their failures. And now we're meant to believe that, somehow, this is not worthy of debate. The Australian people know that perhaps the greatest success of this government has been the continuation of the border protection policies. It has saved hundreds—nay, thousands—of lives. There is cavalier dismissal of those deaths at sea by people like Senator Hanson-Young, who say 'accidents happen; tragedies happen', as people are drowning at sea as a consequence of the policies that they want to reopen again. This is a shameful indictment on what is to come should a Shorten-Greens government be elected in Australia.

        Even if you disagree with the policy position, the simple fact is that the sanctimonious and pious over on that side of the chamber refuse to allow debate. I note that Senator Pratt is

         interjecting
        </a>
        as loudly as she possibly can, but she's had nothing to say about process. They've been hoisted on their own petard, because they've failed and mucked up the process at every single level, and now they start to complain and whinge because they're not getting what they want.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will not have one bit of pious lecturing from those who have supported the hypocritical stance that you opposite are saving people from dying by opening Australia's borders. I'm standing up for Australia. I'm going to stand up for the people of Nauru. I'm going to stand up for the refugees—the genuine refugees—whilst you will stand up for any political act that will help entrench your power. What you're doing is diminishing the role of the Senate. You hijack an innocent bill, which was to clear up a very simple piece of administration, and you hoist your own ideological agenda on it. The price of that, that you're prepared to trade off, is the health and wellbeing of the little pawns in your political game, the people that are on Nauru as, I might add, you turn your backs on impoverished communities in this country. As you say, it's okay for the Indigenous people to live in abject poverty without appropriate medical care and without adequate schooling. You will not uphold the standards that you expect for the people on Nauru. The refugees on Nauru are in better conditions than our own populace are in some respects and still you remain silent. You think this is the most pressing issue for the people of Australia. That's how sadly out of touch you are.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an abuse of process that has taken place in this Senate. Not only are we not able to have a full debate and allow every senator to have their say on a very contentious and important piece of legislation or the amendments, but we're being expected to surrender the complete probity of process in the name of some fixation to score a cheap and petty political win. I will do what I can to deny you the ability to play games with people's lives on Nauru. I will not support you dismantling Australia's border protection system, because it is a great success of this government.

         The government will be supporting Senator Bernardi's proposed suspension motion. This is because what Labor and other non-government senators are seeking to do here is highly reckless and irresponsible, and Mr Shorten knows it's highly reckless and irresponsible.

                  . I'm not concerned about Senator Carr. What this is all about is
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
                   Bill Shorten
                  </a>
                  demonstrating to the Australian people that he will, at any time, sacrifice Australia's national security on the altar of his political tactics and on his short-term, self-perceived political interests.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In pursuit of a little tactical victory, Bill Shorten is losing sight of what actually matters. What matters is that we maintain our strong border protection framework here in Australia. When we came into government, we inherited a mess at our borders from the Labor Party. We inherited chaos at our borders. More than a thousand people died at sea because of the mess that the Labor Party made with our border protection policy framework, and what Mr Shorten is signalling to the Australian people today is that he will go back to the failed and discredited policies that Labor pursued in the past. People across Australia cannot trust Mr Shorten with our national security. People across Australia cannot trust Mr Shorten with our community's safety, as they can't trust Mr Shorten with keeping the economy strong, creating more jobs and keeping the budget in surplus over the medium and long term.

                  A whole series of amendments to this bill have been circulated. This is a very important bill. There are many pages of amendments. Many of them are quite complex amendments, and I think a number of second reading amendments have been moved by senators asking, for example, for inquiry and report by the Parliamentary

                  </a>
                  on Intelligence and Security to review the amendments that have been circulated so that we can actually make a decision in the full knowledge of the implications of voting for or against those amendments. There's been a second reading amendment moved that we should defer consideration of this bill until the Senate has received advice from the director-general of

                  and from the Commissioner of the

                  </a>
                  . Of course the Senate should do this. We should not be dealing with this government bill today until the proper work of the Senate and the proper consideration by the Senate have taken place.

                  Of course, Mr Shorten actually knows that this is a reckless move when it comes to our national security, but he's quite happy to sacrifice our border security. He's quite happy to sacrifice our strong border protection arrangements, including the offshore processing arrangements which were put in place as a late fix in the dying days of the last Labor government. The Rudd Labor government came into government in 2007, and we warned them: don't dismantle the Howard government's strong border protection policies—don't touch them. But, of course, they did. And do you know what happened? As we predicted, boatloads of illegal arrivals arrived on our shores and more than a thousand people died. There were 50,000 illegal arrivals on about 800 boats. That was the consequence. Of course, in the lead-up to the 2013 election, Mr Rudd was so embarrassed that he reintroduced offshore processing. He said that nobody on

                  would come to Australia under a Labor government. Of course, that is precisely what Labor is now supporting.

                        Mr Rudd was so conscious that the Australian people were seriously upset with the mess that Labor had created on our borders, Labor were advertising to or supposedly targeting potential people smugglers and potential illegal immigrants in Australia about their strong offshore processing arrangements. That was in Australia, where there are apparently a lot of potential people smugglers and potential illegal arrivals.

                        showing to the Australian people what he would do if he were elected at the next election. This is showing that he doesn't care about keeping Australia's border safe and secure. If given the opportunity, he would go back to the discredited and failed border protection policies of Labor in the past. Our very strong message to the Australian people is: don't risk it. And our very strong urging to the Senate is that this is a very sensible motion that has been moved by Senator Bernardi which deserves support.

                        shouldn't become captive to Mr Shorten's tactical games that are putting our national security and our border protection arrangements at risk. These sorts of bills should be debated in the proper fashion, as they usually are, and that is what the Bernardi motion is seeking to achieve.

                                       Right. The point of order that was inevitably raised is: is this in order, given the Senate's previous vote? Firstly, this is not a contingent notice. This is a simple motion to suspend standing orders, according to my advice from the Clerk. The second matter, with respect to it being in order to move this motion given the previous vote of the Senate, is that this is, firstly, a different motion—it applies to the extension of time, not the deferral of a vote beyond the end of this parliamentary session. Secondly, when we dealt with the income tax bills following the budget and exactly the same thing happened, there were two opportunities for the Senate to consider alteration of the time-management motion that had previously been put in place. I give notice that this is the last time I will entertain a motion to change the time limitation, consistent with my rulings at that time. But this motion is now in order. Senator Hanson is free to speak for five minutes to the motion she has just moved.

They're shutting down debate on this, which is such a very important issue. People stand up and talk about national security, but they're not prepared to actually debate it and talk about the issues that are happening.

                                            . I'm glad you are really interested in what I have to say because every Australian should be. It annoys the heck out of me and a lot of Australian people that the Greens have more interest in what's happening around the world and in other countries than they do in the people here in Australia. As I have said, in the

                                            , you've got the sexual abuse of children, babies, and what is done about it? Is everyone screaming about that in this chamber? There's nothing. You're all quiet.

                                           <p>
                                            You're worried about these children over there. There are nine left there and you're worried about them. Do you know what they're doing? They're shopping for doctors. They get on Skype, they find a doctor that appeals to them and then they go to the judge at one o'clock in the morning. I say, 'What is happening to these people?' We don't even have that in Australia for the Australian people. They've got 61 doctors over there. There is one doctor to every eight refugees. I can't even get doctors out to rural and regional areas in Australia. We're providing that number of doctors at a cost of $450 million a year to the taxpayers?

                                            These are not people who came here; these are people who have been denied coming here to Australia. Not only that but our obligation to them is on a welfare and medical basis. We have provided those. We have spent the taxpayers' dollars building a hospital wing on Nauru for these people. They had been taken to Taiwan. Some went while others refused to go there saying, 'We are coming to Australia because they are so soft over there.' Once they get to this country, they want to stay here.

                                           <p>
                                            You know what the Australian people tell me they get annoyed about? The Australian people are fed up with seeing refugees being given preference over Australians for hospitals, for housing, for welfare, for everything. The Australian people are fed up with it. They want to be looked after themselves. We are taxpaying Australians here and these people, who are economic refugees, have cost Australian taxpayers. They paid their way to get into this country.

There are 14,000 waiting in Indonesia to come here to Australia. I reiterate what I said: the Greens are absolutely disgusting and their attitude towards the Australian people is that they are more concerned about other people around the world. If that's your attitude then get out of this place because you don't deserve to be a representative of the Australian people. I believe that, if there are truly children in need of help, that help has been given to them by the 61 doctors there—more help than we give to Australian citizens.

                                            I say to the people here: you are representatives of the people of Australia first and foremost. Don't try and be the representatives for the world. Look after your own people here. That's all they're crying out for. Understand their needs and concerns, get them medical assistance and get doctors to rural and regional Australia because that is where we need the help and assistance and stop worrying about everyone around the world. Clean up our own backyard first. That's what the Australian people want: to clean up our own backyard first.

                                             There is no doubt the Senate should be spending more time dealing with what is a very important piece of legislation, in particular, given how many amendments have been circulated. The amendments that have been circulated by Senator

                                             and Senator Storer present a very serious risk to the integrity of our border protection policy framework. They present a serious risk in that they undermine the effective operation of our offshore processing arrangements. One of the central foundations of our successful efforts to stop the boats, which flooded Australia during the last Labor government, was a three-pronged policy framework. The first part was to turn boats around when it was safe to do so, which was something that former Prime Minister
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">

                                             said could not be done, but, of course, it was done. And it was done under the leadership of none other than our Prime Minister,
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">

                                             . Our Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, is the one who actually cleaned up the mess left behind by two successive Labor governments, with the very active and outstanding support of none other than Senator Jim Molan, who provided significant advice to Mr Morrison in opposition and subsequent to coming into government. So the first part was to turn the boats around when it was safe to do so. The second part was temporary protection visas, and the third was offshore processing arrangements.

                                             Under Labor, 800 boats arrived here illegally with more than 50,000 illegal boat arrivals and more than 1,000 people drowned at sea. Labor is now attaching themselves to a Greens motion, moved by Senator McKim of all people. If Senator McKim is going to be writing the national security policies of the Leader of the Opposition—who wants the Australian people to believe that he is the alternative Prime Minister of Australia—I say to the Australian people: 'Don't risk it. You don't want your Prime Minister to be somebody who is prepared to have his border security policies written by Senator McKim.' You could have knocked me over with a feather when I was advised that Labor had decided—

He is allowing the Greens to write his border protection policy. What I say to the Australian people is: if you don't want to see a return to drownings at sea, if you don't want to see a return of the people smugglers, if you don't want to see the people smugglers get back into business and send illegal boat arrivals to Australia, then don't elect Mr Shorten.

There was a boat coming over the horizon with illegal boat arrivals. That was the outcome of the last time Labor joined with the Greens to fiddle with our border protection policy framework. Don't do it. Our message to the Labor Party is: 'Don't do it. You don't know how to protect our country. Let us do it. Just accept that our policy framework works'—

That's what they did last time, and look at the chaos that created, including more than a thousand people dead at sea. Surely you don't want to go back there. Don't do it. If you do do it, I say to the Australian people: don't vote in the Labor Party at the next election. Don't do it.

My point of order is: could Senator Bernardi confirm that he will be voting differently on all of them, and whether or not there is any opportunity to form a subgroup of those amendments so that we can vote on some of them together.

Notice was clearly given by the shadow Attorney-General in the House of Representatives that some of the amendments did not reflect the bipartisan committee recommendations, and those would be moved in the Senate. We have a letter from Mr Christian Porter, reflecting the fact that government amendments would be moved in the Senate.

I urge the government to stop this filibustering; to ensure we can bring on the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill, a national security bill that has bipartisan support; to enable the amendments that reflect the majority report of the parliamentary Joint Committee to be passed; and to ensure that the House remains so it becomes law so that our security agencies have the powers they need. Their failure to keep the House because they are so worried about this bill is an indictment on a government—on any government—that says it says it cares about national security! Australians' safety is worth more than the political points you are seeking to avoid in the House of Representatives.

If the opposition are indicating through Senator Wong that they want to bring that debate on immediately then the government is happy to facilitate such a motion.

Clearly, the Labor Party wants to play tactical games in order to enable Mr Shorten to put our offshore protection arrangements at risk. So, in order to facilitate Mr Shorten playing tactical games, the Labor Party tried to gazump the government's legislative agenda in this chamber.

How often has that happened before? So don't tell us about games. If you're genuinely interested in national security, let's adjourn the debate on the home affairs bill now. I will support a motion to adjourn the debate on the home affairs bill now to bring on the bill in relation to the other matters immediately.

I won't do it, because I don't want to waste any more time. I was sitting here, quite happy to move through the divisions, but I'm mindful that we do have to deal with the hours motion before 4.30. So if the opposition is not prepared to facilitate efficient passage of the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018 through the Senate then it is on the Labor Party's head, and the Australian people will know that the Labor Party is deliberately standing in the way of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies having the powers they need.

We have done that twice and I have previously advised the chamber that I will not take any further suspensions of standing orders because the Senate has determined to deal with these matters first. So I will put your motion to suspend standing orders.

You know it's not my ruling. You sought leave of the chamber. You were granted leave for one minute. I will now put your motion to suspend standing orders if you wish. The question is that so much of standing orders be suspended so as to allow Senator Di Natale to make a statement of no more than five minutes.

This has been a disgrace, a shambles, and you should be ashamed of yourselves, both of you. Those contributions we just heard from both the Liberal and Labor parties didn't even mention the word 'refugees'. We have been, for the last two hours, trying to get those desperate people off Nauru, people who are being tortured and who, as a result of that torture, have serious mental health issues and need psychiatric assessment here in Australia, and we are denying it. We are denying innocent people who are being tortured at the hands of the Liberal government access to medical treatment. It is a disgrace. You should be absolutely ashamed of yourselves. This is a stain on the Australian nation. We had an opportunity to come together and to actually do something decent for innocent people, to show a bit of humanity, and what have you done? You've played politics.
