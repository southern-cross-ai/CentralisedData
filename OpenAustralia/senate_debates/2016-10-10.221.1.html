        I rise tonight to pay tribute to a much-loved Australian cricketer, raconteur, commentator and writer, one who was born in and spent his formative years in my home state of Tasmania. On Wednesday, 28 September, our nation said goodbye to one of its greats. At the age of 68, Max Henry Norman Walker lost a two-year battle against myeloma.
       </p>
       <p>
        Walker was a character larger than life. His presence played an important role in the highly successful Australian cricket teams in the 1970s and upon his retirement from cricket Walker charmed audiences with his colourful commentary as he became a celebrity on radio and television. He had a talent for embellishing even the most mundane tale to the point where it turned into a side-splitting yarn.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born on 12 September 1948 in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Hobart" rel="nofollow">
         West Hobart
        </a>
        , Tasmania, Walker was the son of 'Big Max Walker', who ran the then
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Hotel" rel="nofollow">
         Empire Hotel
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Hobart" rel="nofollow">
         North Hobart
        </a>
        . Anyone who has read one of his bestsellers,
        <i>

        </i>
        <i>
         Block
        </i>
        , would have had a bellyaching insight into Walker's Hobart childhood. Growing up, 'Little Max' would play cricket in the car park behind the club and hone his skills against unsuspecting patrons game enough to play with him. He refined his bowling technique trying to bowl out his late sister, Lexie, of whom it was said was an even greater batter. He attended
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Friends'_School" rel="nofollow">
         The Friends' School
        </a>
        in Hobart, where he dominated inter-school sport in footy, cricket and athletics. His talent did not go unnoticed and, on turning 17 in 1966, legend Demon's coach
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Norm Smith
        </a>
        came to the Walker household to sign him up.
       </p>
       <p>
        Walker's dad encouraged him to further his studies as well. So the following year he crossed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Strait
        </a>
        to study architecture at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMIT" rel="nofollow">
         RMIT
        </a>
        and to play football in what was then known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFL" rel="nofollow">
         VFL
        </a>
        . For the next several years he played footy during winter and cricket during summer, both at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCG" rel="nofollow">
         MCG
        </a>
        whilst working there as a maintenance man and scoreboard operator. This was despite his footy coach's protestations, as he was not too keen on the idea of his footballers dividing their attention by playing cricket in the summer. In any case, Walker went on to play 94 senior games with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Football Club
        </a>
        throughout 1967 to 1972. But, in the end, Walker's passion for cricket won out and, while he did not win many Brownlow votes in the VFL—as he himself would point out—he did bring with him fitness and stamina and the ability to forbear injury, as is showcased by him breaking his nose five times.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1972 he played his last VFL football match and in December of that same year he took up the baggy green cap to play his first test match against Pakistan, making his and my home state proud as the first Tasmanian to be picked for a test since C.L. Babcock in 1936. Walker proved himself in that game and the next, where Pakistan needed 159 for a victory and Max bowled with the ferociousness of a fast bowler and the cunning of a class spinner, destroying the visitors taking six for 15 off 16 overs.
       </p>
       <p>
        A tour of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Massie" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Massie

        falling to injury and to illness. Walker himself had heels and ankles so bruised he could hardly put his boots on and at the ground he stuffed masses of foam rubber into his boots, laced them up and muttered 'That'll do'. He proceeded to bowl 38 overs in the first innings and 23 in the second, taking five wickets and the famous near-impossible catch.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the first test of that series against Jamaica at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabina_Park" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maurice_Foster" rel="nofollow">
         Maurice Foster
        </a>
        sent the ball flying with Walker in hot pursuit, putting in all the speed he could muster in an attempt to catch the ball. At the final moment, Walker manoeuvred a magnificent dive action catching the ball and gleefully turned to the roaring crowds. But the crowds went silent and, realising something was amiss, Walker turned to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Chappell" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Chappell
        </a>
        , who was yelling at him that it was a no ball and the batsmen had just completed three runs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian test cricket was in a golden era at this time under the captaincy of Ian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Chappell" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Chappell
        </a>
        , perhaps second only to Sir Donald Bradman's 1948 'Invincibles'. Walker played 34 tests for Australia, taking 138 wickets as a right-hand medium-fast bowler. His wrong-footed bowling action earned Walker the nickname 'Tangles' and his style of swinging his right arm over his left earhole was imitated by backyard cricket players right across Australia. This, along with his handle-bar moustache and down-to-earth larrikin style, made him a genuine crowd favourite, even bringing a smile to the Queen in the 1977
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_Test" rel="nofollow">
         Centenary Test

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen" rel="nofollow">
         The Queen
        </a>
        was introduced to the Australian team in alphabetical order and, on Walker's turn, after a general enquiry about how he was feeling in the heat and with England piling up 130-odd runs, Walker returned with a 'Geez, ma'am, I'm bloody hot!'
       </p>
       <p>
        Between 1977 and 1979, the face of international cricket underwent significant transformation as

       </p>
       <p>

        's cricket commentary team between 1986 and 1991. He was a natural, achieving success through wit and intelligence. He had a natural presence on stage, and his ability to tell a good yarn made him a crowd favourite.
       </p>
       <p>
        Walker also appeared in many television ads. Who can forget the iconic series of 'World's Worst' Toohey's 2.2 Light Beer ads where Walker appeared alongside
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Walters" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , or promoting Aerogard with a young boy wishing him the classic 'Avagoodweekend Mr Walker'?
       </p>
       <p>
        Walker had a way with words both on screen and in writing. After his spell on Channel Nine, Walker went on to write 14 books, seven of them No. 1 bestsellers. He had a canny ability to bring energy and emotion to his stories and went on to sell over a million copies.

       </p>
       <p>
        Not one to stick to convention, Walker self-published and promoted his books personally. He would load up his car with copies of his latest title and take off all over Australia, ensuring that he visited cities and small country towns alike. That was typical of Walker. Despite his success and celebrity status, he remained down to earth and big-hearted throughout his career. Rather than use his celebrity for personal gain, he used his exalted status to assist his charity work with numerous organisations, many revolving around youth and social work.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also played a big role in promoting men's health. His 'mo' became an early drawcard for Movember. On 13 June 2011, Walker was awarded the

       </p>
       <p>
        Just as we are about to enter summer and enter another season of Aussie cricket, it is fitting that we salute this great gentleman and give our condolences to his wife, Kerry; his three sons, Tristan, Keegan and Shelden; and two daughters, Alexandra and Isabella.
