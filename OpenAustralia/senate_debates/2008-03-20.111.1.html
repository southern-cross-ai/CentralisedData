         Introduction
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Tonight I want to talk about the very serious issue of homelessness in our society. And I am very proud to say that this is an issue that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudd_Labor_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Rudd Labor Government
        </a>
        has already set about tackling head on following a decade of neglect by the former government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe that access to safe and secure housing is one of our most basic human rights, and yet on any one given night 100,000 Australians are homeless. We believe this is unacceptable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, from meeting with local community groups with an interest in this issue, it has become absolutely apparent to me that homelessness is not just about housing. Homelessness fundamentally affects the lives of those individuals and families experiencing homelessness. They are denied many of the rights and privileges others take for granted; such as missing out on eduction and social security, being subjected to discrimination and unable to participate fully in the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of the community groups I met with gave me a collection of pictures and quotes from children who had experienced homelessness called `No Place But Home’. The collection of stories from a child’s perspective really highlighted the fundamental way homeless effects a Childs life, from broken friendships, feeling unsafe and lost opportunities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An 8 year old girl reflected that “you do not get to play with your friends when you move”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many of the stories also talked about lost education opportunities. A 21 year old male was quoted as saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “From when I was homeless with my Mum till now I’ve never been at school. From when mum took me out of school when I was like 9—I’ve never been back”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Rudd Labor Government has a comprehensive plan to address homelessness across Australia —I will outline some of these initiatives later.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Homelessness in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although Canberra is commonly perceived by the rest of the nation as being a relatively affluent, this image masks the poverty that many individuals and families are experiencing here in Canberra.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This image of relative affluence leaves out the 120-315 people who sleep rough in Canberra on any given night and the recorded 5,300 Canberrans that experience homelessness every year. Of course, in reality even these concerning figures are grossly understated as the Census is unable to accurately count the homeless and many don’t seek the support of local services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2005-2006
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAAP" rel="nofollow">
         SAAP
        </a>
        services in the ACT supported 1,950 clients with 1000 accompanying children, but many more homeless people and families were turned away from SAAP services as there were no available beds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From discussions I have had will local crisis accommodation service providers and community groups it is clear that the sector is simply unable to accommodate the high levels of demand for crisis accommodation. Of particular concern in the ACT is the availability of crisis accommodation for indigenous people, families and women, as shown by high turn away rates from crisis accommodation services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Housing Affordability
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Closely linked to the problem of homelessness, is housing affordability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the ACT, the lack of housing affordability presents a particularly difficult problem to those facing homelessness, or trying to escape homelessness. Despite the efforts of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_Government" rel="nofollow">
         ACT Government
        </a>
        through its Housing Affordability Strategy housing affordability remains a critical issue in the ACT. Canberra’s median house rents are the highest in Australia with 35.9% of ACT renters spending more than 50% of their income on rent in 2005-2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With 18% of homeless people reporting to ACT SAAP services that they had issues maintaining tenancy at their previous accommodation, the serious lack of affordable rental accommodation Canberra is clearly having an effect on individuals and families becoming homeless and those trying to re-enter the housing market.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Rudd Labor Government has a number of plans to address the long term affordability of housing in Australia. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rental_Affordability_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         National Rental Affordability Scheme
        </a>
        will create 50,000 new affordable rental properties by providing tax credits to build affordable homes. Also, a new National Affordable Housing Agreement will bring together community, public and crisis housing to create pathways for people to leave homelessness and get a home for the long term.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Why is This Problem Persistent?
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the rates of homelessness across Australia is very concerning, what is worse, is that it appears that homelessness in may be getting worse. Preliminary data collected from the 2006 Census suggests that there is an overall national increase in the number of people sleeping rough.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Rather than addressing the very serious and pressing issue of homeless, the former government cut funding from crisis accommodation services to the tune of cutting $3.1 billion in real funding to the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement. This disgraceful act forced the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
         States and Territories
        </a>
        to target the provision of social housing even more tightly to those in greatest need.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Nationally, ABS data shows that in 1995, 22 per cent of applicants for social housing were accommodated. Ten years later, only 14 per cent were able to move off waiting lists and into housing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The previous government’s decade of neglect means that now the most disadvantaged Australians are waiting longer than ever just to get a roof over their heads.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need a new approach that prevents homelessness, improves crisis services, helps people to get long term secure housing and stops the cycle of homelessness. This means Government, business, community and charitable groups – a whole of community effort.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Labor’s Plan
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unlike the previous government, we understand that homelessness is serious problem. It is serious for those who experience it and for the community as a whole. We also understand that this problem won’t just go away, and that it is the role of the Federal Government, in cooperation with the States, to have a plan to address homelessness in the ACT and across Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We also understand that more can be done to reduce homelessness in Australia, and the Rudd Labor Government is committed to developing a comprehensive, long-term plan to tackle homelessness as a matter of national priority.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will build on our $150 million election commitment to construct new homes for Australians in crisis accommodation by developing a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Paper" rel="nofollow">
         White Paper
        </a>
        on how Australia can systematically reduce homelessness over the next decade.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the urgency the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudd_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Rudd Government
        </a>
        attaches to reducing homelessness, the Prime Minister has directed that the White Paper be completed by August.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Prime Minister has appointed

        , to lead a Steering Committee of experts to oversee the process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The paper released by the Government earlier this year `Homelessness: A New Approach ‘ recognises that the best responses to homelessness provide more than a bed. Providing an individual or family with comprehensive services including access to eduction, employment and counselling.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Already we have made specific commitments to tackle homelessness including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Working with the States and Territories to build an additional 600 houses for homeless individuals and families over the next 5 years
        </li>
        <li>
         Working with the states and territories to expand the reach of homeless services across the country, and
        </li>
        <li>
         $2.8 million to expand cultural and sporting programs for homeless people providing essential life skills and social networks
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">

         Conclusion
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unlike the previous government, we believe the issue of homelessness in Australia is urgent and we are committed to reducing the number of people and families experiencing homelessness in the ACT and across Australia by delivering and building on our election commitments.
