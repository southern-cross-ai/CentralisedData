        My question is also to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. I refer to the speech prepared for Defence Force chief
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
         Angus Campbell
        </a>
        obtained under freedom of information in September 2019. That speech notes, 'Climate change is predicted to make disasters more extreme and more common,' and warned the ADF will be required to undertake more disaster relief operations and peacekeeping missions given climate change has 'the potential to exacerbate conflict'. What is the Morrison government doing to prepare the ADF for conflict in our region and beyond as a result of climate change?

         Thank you very much, Senator Watt, for that question. I can confirm that Defence does have a very detailed policy on the impact of climate change and the impact on force structure. As you would know, it is also in the
         <i>
          2016 Defence white paper
         </i>
         , where it is very specifically referenced. The potential for climate change in our region, and also in our nation, is well addressed and well studied by the ADF.

            I would like to hear something about what that is, so I ask a supplementary question. The speech prepared for the

             Chief of the Defence Force

           <p>
            Deploying troops on

             numerous disaster relief missions,

            <i>
             at the same time, may stretch our capability and capacity.
            </i>
           </p>
           <p>
            Does the Morrison government acknowledge climate change induced disasters pose a threat to the capability and capacity of the ADF? And again, I ask: what is the Morrison government doing to prepare the ADF for these challenges?

             Thanks very much, Senator Watt. As I said, the
             <i>
              2016 Defence white paper
             </i>
             did identify climate change as one of the causes of state fragility, a key driver for our security environment, out through to 2035. Defence prepares—as you referenced the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDF" rel="nofollow">
              CDF
             </a>
             talking about it, as he does regularly—for climate change impacts on defence capabilities, estate, personnel, equipment and also related operational responses. You can see from Operation Bushfire Assist that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Defence Force

             is well prepared for humanitarian disaster relief operations both here domestically and overseas. So I think the proof is there, Senator Watt, that we are well prepared and well capable of supporting any of those disasters here in Australia and overseas.

               In January 2019, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
                US
               </a>
               Department of Defense released a report assessing the future impact of climate change on its military installations. The report found more deserts, bushfires, flooding and drought—exacerbated by climate change—posed risks to the US military's bases and capability. Has the ADF conducted a similar assessment?

                   Senator Watt, with all due respect, the minister had been speaking for 10 seconds. I was listening very carefully. At this point, I am more than happy to say she was being directly relevant. I believe your point of order goes to how she is answering the question rather than being directly relevant. There is an opportunity after question time to debate that. Senator Reynolds, I cut you off.

                    Thank you very much,

                    . As the Australian Minister for Defence, what I'm doing is actually answering the question about the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
                     Australian Defence Force
                    </a>
                    and the extensive work that we're doing here. I cannot speak for the United States system or the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    and what his department has done. We have for many years in Defence looked at the impacts of climate change, and we work with the region in terms of humanitarian disaster response and many other supports. So the answer is: yes.
