        Continued information sharing is vital to the effectiveness of the intelligence function and the success of the Australian Crime Commission (ACC).  Steps have been taken to ensure the ACC can share information with appropriate government agencies by prescribing a list of agencies and amending the Australian Crime Commission Regulations 2002.  Further consideration may be given to information sharing with the private sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that this recommendation was made in the context of information sharing between the ACC and non-police government agencies.  At the time of the Committee’s review, a Federal Court decision prevented the ACC from disseminating information to Commonwealth agencies that were not a police force unless they were prescribed by regulation under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (ACC Act).  In response to this decision, which has since been overturned by the Full Federal Court, regulations have been made facilitating information sharing between the ACC and other relevant government agencies.

         Recommendation 5:

        The Committee recommends that the ACC consider statutory proposals to amend the ACC Act to provide categories of ACC officers with the necessary identified powers, including such matters as the powers to apply for or execute a warrant, and the right to carry a firearm.  These should replace the current system of the use of

         Recommendation 14:

        The Committee recommends that the legislation for the creation of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity includes provision for the Committee to refer matters to the Commission for investigation, with a requirement to report to the Committee on the results of such investigations. This ensures the completeness and effectiveness of arrangements for scrutinising the operations of agencies, and - were its jurisdiction expanded as recommended above - prevents the Committee’s workload from becoming too great for effective Parliamentary supervision of the relevant agencies.

        There have been attempts to introduce a common employment framework which have proven challenging due to the wide disparity in conditions in different jurisdictions.  Secondee arrangements were reviewed in August 2009 and the ACC intends to amend the arrangements so that secondees retain the salary and conditions of service applicable to their home jurisdiction.  This will provide the following benefits:

        It is not accepted that allowing legal aid commissions to provide assistance directly would be a ‘far more efficient procedure for representation than having to provide an application to a government department before even approaching a lawyer’ as stated in the report.  There would be little difference if the statutory scheme arrangements were administered by legal aid commissions rather than the Department.  Grants of aid from legal aid commissions are made for specific purposes and a lawyer would still need to make a separate application for a grant of aid for an appearance before the ACC, even if a grant of aid had previously been made for a related criminal matter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Attorney-General’s Department administers 26 statutory and non-statutory schemes of legal assistance and has demonstrated its capability of efficiently assessing applications for grants of assistance.  It is also noted that the ACC Act scheme gives rise to a relatively small number of applications (six applications were received in 2008–2009 and ten in 2007–2008), all of which are dealt with promptly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is not correct to say that applicants must contact the Department before approaching a lawyer.  In the Department’s experience, most, if not all, applicants for assistance under the scheme have contacted a lawyer before applying for assistance.  In most cases this is a lawyer who has been assisting the applicant with matters related to the examination before the ACC.

        In response to an Attorney-General’s Department funded report – Building Illicit Drugs Forensic Capacity across Australia – which was endorsed by MCDS in May 2008, the AFP, in partnership with the Department, has developed a business case for the implementation of a national illicit drug forensic system.  This business case involved significant consultation with State and Territory law enforcement agencies and would assist in achieving greater consistency in the collection and analysis and reporting of data on the chemical composition of seized illicit tablets, as well as drug identification and coding.  Importantly it would also expand the drug seizures subjected to profiling to include samples from State and Territory seizures.
