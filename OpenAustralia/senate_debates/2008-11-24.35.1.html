        Dear Senator Wortley
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 28 August 2008 concerning the
        <i>
         Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Regulations 2008
        </i>
        . Your letter on behalf of the Standing Committee sought advice as to why the Privacy Commissioner had not been consulted regarding the provisions on use and disclosure of personal information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Both the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme (DHOAS) and its predecessor the Defence Home Owner Scheme (DHOS) are complex schemes. The DHOAS has strict transitioning arrangements for applicants previously entitled to DHOS. The use and disclosure provisions in the Regulations were designed to protect the applicants from the administrative process that could inadvertently expose them to double payments, and the recovery process that could follow. The amendments to the Regulations are nearly identical to those in the
        <i>
         Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Regulations 2008
        </i>
        and support the operation of the DHOAS as well as the DHOS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Regulations do not go beyond the scope of the use and disclosure provisions of the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Privacy Act
         </a>
         1988
        </i>
        . A report on privacy matters relevant to the scheme and compliance with Commonwealth privacy law has been prepared for Defence by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        Solicitor. The report noted that the arrangement appeared only to require the sharing of personal information to the extent necessary for the scheme’s proper operation and for the protection of the public revenue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To ensure that privacy concerns are fully addressed, Defence has forwarded a copy of the report to the Privacy Commissioner and requested she examine the use and disclosure of personal information provisions in both the Defence
        <i>
         Force (Home Loans Assistance,) Amendment Regulations 2008
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme Regulations 2008
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence was required to meet strict time constraints to prepare the legislation to support the new home ownership scheme. This prevented a full privacy assessment. In this context, it should be noted that the service providers contracted to deliver aspects of DHOAS must comply with the same standards of privacy protection required of Government agencies.

        A copy of the privacy report prepared by the Government Solicitor was forwarded to the Privacy Commissioner by Defence, with a request that she examine the personal information provisions in the Regulations and comment on the privacy implications.

        The Deputy Privacy Commissioner responded to Defence’s letter on 27 October 2008. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Commissioner
        </a>
        has not identified any issues with the regulations or with the privacy report prepared by the Government Solicitor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Deputy Commissioner has advised that Defence appears to be authorised by law to use and disclose the information to other agencies and organisations, in accordance with the purpose of the scheme and exceptions under Information Privacy Principles 10.1(c) and 11.1(d).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Deputy Privacy Commissioner has made some general recommendations on implementation and development of good privacy practice in the handling of personal information. In particular, he has suggested that Defence review notices and forms that underpin the scheme, to ensure they achieve best practice in relation to the collection of information that is relevant to third parties. Defence will review these matters and take any action necessary to ensure that information is collected in accordance with best practice.

        Under the
        <i>
         Legislative Instruments Act 2003
        </i>
        , all legislative instruments are required to be registered on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Register" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Register
        </a>
        of Legislative Instruments (FRLI). Those instruments which were made in the five years immediately preceding the introduction of FRLI on 1 January 2005 were required to be electronically lodged on the register by 30 September 2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While a draft electronic lodgement of the instrument was entered onto FRLI and a hardcopy was provided to the Office of Legislative Drafting and Publishing, the office advised the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Fisheries and Forestry in October 2007 that the electronic draft had not been finalised on FRLI. As a result, the declaration was repealed by default under the
        <i>
         Legislative Instruments Act 2003
        </i>
        on 1 October 2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Prior to my remaking the declaration, the department sought legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGS" rel="nofollow">
         AGS
        </a>
        ) as to the validity of the current SFA, including payments made to AWl during the period in which the declaration had lapsed. AGS advised that the repealing of the declaration has not legally affected the validity of the SFA. As the Act gives me the power to both declare a research body and enter into contracts with a body to enable it to receive payments, AGS advised that the declaration of a body appears to be an administrative formality rather than a substantive requirement affecting my ability to contract.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further, AGS advised that, while the Act requires a research body to be declared in order to receive Commonwealth funds, there is no provision in the Act to suggest that the absence of a declaration would make a contract with that body invalid. As such, AGS concluded there was minimal risk that the SFA (and payments in accordance with it) would be considered invalid by a court of law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On advice from AGS, as an administrative procedure to ensure AWl would be deemed a research body in relation to payments already made, I remade the declaration with a retrospective clause to 1 October 2006. As the declaration does not impose any liability or disadvantage any person in respect of anything done (or not done) before the date of registration, AGS advised that the retrospective clause is consistent with subsection 12(2) of the
        <i>
         Legislative Instruments Act 2003
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During the period in which the declaration was repealed, AWl continued to meet all its responsibilities under the SFA to receive funding and provide research and development services to industry. The retrospective operation of the declaration is intended to clarify the intention that AWl is the declared research body, and to regularise a procedural step that was not adhered to as a result of a technical error.

        Dear Minister

       <p class="italic">
        Thank you for your letter of 16 September 2008 concerning the Wool Services Privatisation (Research Body) Declaration 2008 made under subsection 30(1) of the
        <i>
         Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000
        </i>
        . This instrument determines that Australian Wool Innovation Ltd (AWI) is the research body for the purposes of the
        <i>
         Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In your letter you state that, under the Act, the declaration of AWI “is a pre-condition to … entering into a contract.” However, on advice from the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS), the declaration of a body appears to be “an administrative formality rather than a substantive requirement” affecting your ability to enter into a contract with AWI. Further, AGS seems to suggest that “while the Act requires a research body to be declared in order to receive funds, there is no provision in the Act to suggest that the absence of a declaration would make a contract with that body invalid.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee finds this distinction somewhat confusing and contradictory. It would appreciate receiving a copy of the AGS advice which draws this distinction, and some further clarification of how a precondition can be seen as a simple administrative formality. While the declaration of AWI as the relevant research body may have lapsed due to an administrative oversight, it may not be appropriate, or advisable, to use a retrospective legislative instrument as a remedy in these circumstances, particularly as they involve the expenditure of public monies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee would appreciate your urgent advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 9 October 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

        On 19 December 2000, the then Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Warren Truss MP, signed the declaration of Australian Wool Innovation (AWl) Limited as the wool industry research body. This clearly indicated the Australian Government’s intent that AWl be the services body entitled to receive levies and matching government funding for research and development activities. The declaration was only repealed on technical grounds due to an error in finalising the lodgement on the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments database.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) advised that, as the Act allows me to both declare a research body and to contract with a body to enable it to receive payments, the declaration of a research body can be considered an administrative formality to be followed before contracting rather than a substantive requirement affecting my ability to contract. This is why I advised the committee that the remaking of the declaration is an administrative formality.

       <p class="italic">
        As requested, please find enclosed legal advice provided to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry by AGS. As this is an internal government document, I ask that it not be made available to the public.

       <p class="italic">
        Following our recent correspondence on the Wool Services Privatisation (Research Body) Declaration 2008, your letter of 16 October 2008 requests advice on why I asked that the Australian Government Solicitor’s (AGS) legal opinion not be made public.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Wool Services Privatisation (Research Body) Declaration 2008 corrects an administrative error that resulted in the repeal of the 2000 declaration of Australian Wool Innovation Limited (AWl) as the wool industry services body under the
        <i>
         Wool Services Privatisation Act 2000
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I agree there is limited jurisprudence relating to this area of the law. However, my request to not make the AGS legal opinion public, reflects the advice given to me by the AGS and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry’s that publishing the advice would waive the lawyer-client privilege. Moreover, it was never intended that AWl’s status as the wool industry services body be repealed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I understand that the committee may exercise its discretion to publish the advice but ask the committee to take into account the advice that I have received. Further, I would appreciate the committee informing me of its decision in this regard.
