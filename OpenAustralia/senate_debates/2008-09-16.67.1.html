        , the leader of the pro-democracy movement in Burma, could the minister tell the Senate what the government understands to be the state of the Ms Suu Kyi’s health and her circumstances?

         I thank Senator Cameron for that important question. The government remains deeply concerned about the political, economic and humanitarian situation in Burma. Australia has consistently called for the full participation of all players in a political reform process supported by the international community. The ongoing detention of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi" rel="nofollow">
          Aung San Suu Kyi
         </a>
         , the

         of the

         for Democracy, along with that of a further estimated 1,500 political prisoners is, of course, a major impediment to genuine political reform.
        </p>
        <p>
         We understand that Aung San Suu Kyi has refused food deliveries for several weeks. We are pleased that, with the easing of some of the conditions of her detention, she has resumed accepting food deliveries. She has been under house arrest continuously now for the last five years and for nearly 13 of the past 19 years. While under house arrest we understand that she receives periodic visits from her doctor and her lawyer. The Minister for Foreign Affairs,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Smith
         </a>
         , has expressed Australia’s deep concerns about the further extension of Aung San Suu Kyi’s detention. He expressed those concerns directly to his Burmese counterpart when they met in July this year. The government, of course, has repeatedly called for her release immediately and has also called for the unconditional release of all political prisoners in Burma. Australia’s ambassador in Rangoon renewed these representations, most recently on 11 September, to the Burmese deputy foreign minister.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the

         , met with limited success on his most recent visit to Burma, it is important that the international community continues to support the development of inclusive dialogue in Burma. Australia places pressure on the Burmese leadership towards this end through the implementation of targeted financial sanctions and through travel restrictions on senior regime figures and their associates and supporters. The government maintains an extensive list of senior members of the regime who are subject to travel restrictions, which is kept under review. Should a person who is subject to travel restrictions apply for or be found to hold a visa, Mr Smith is provided with advice and options, based on consultation between his department, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">

         , and the

         </a>
         . From time to time it may be drawn to our attention that someone close to the Burmese regime is in Australia. Should this occur, of course the government looks carefully at such a case and responds appropriately.

           It is an important supplementary question, and I can assure the Senate that Australia is continuing to work with its regional and international partners, especially
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
            ASEAN
           </a>
           , to coordinate aid efforts and ensure that the Burmese regime maintains access for international aid organisations.

           discussed the relief effort with ASEAN Secretary-General Surin Pitsuwan in July, and Australia has agreed to support key personnel positions for ASEAN operations in Burma and is exploring further opportunities to assist ASEAN. Australia’s total contribution in response to the cyclone now stands at $55 million, making Australia one of the largest individual donors.
