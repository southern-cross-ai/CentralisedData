        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Today the COVID-19 crisis continues to grow. In

         I thank the senator for her question, and, indeed, I acknowledge that it continues to be a very challenging day for people across many different parts of Australia, as it is for people across many, many different parts of the world. I reject the assertion made by the senator in terms of 'pressuring'. It is well known that, throughout the management of the COVID pandemic,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         had shown an extraordinary capacity in terms of their COVID testing, tracing and isolating regime to be able to get on top of multiple outbreaks through that time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clearly, as is publicly acknowledged—and as the Prime Minister has publicly acknowledged—the delta variant has created an additional challenge for systems and in relation to the increased rate of transmissibility that comes with the delta variant. Indeed, it's estimated the delta variant results in a 100 per cent increase in relation to transmission, and with those changed circumstances, as we've had right throughout the pandemic, the advice and the approach changes appropriately too. We want to see the New South Wales lockdown succeed. We want to see New South Wales get on top of it. That is why, as a government, we've been offering additional resources and assistance along the way to New South Wales, be that in the form of additional contact tracing support or additional support in relation to enforcement of the lockdown through the supply of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

           , in addition to Dubbo, towns with very high Aboriginal populations, like Walgett, Bourke and Brewarrina, have today been plunged into lockdown. Does Mr Morrison regret that, despite promising First Nations Australians that they would be a priority in the vaccine rollout, only 10 per cent have been vaccinated, more than 18 months into the pandemic?

            Indeed, the government is acutely aware of the reality of different regional communities facing lockdown in cases of COVID-19, as we've been aware in terms of communities with a higher Indigenous population in consequences such as when the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Northern Territory
            </a>
            has faced lockdown conditions as well. Where possible, we deploy additional support and resources in relation to those communities. The senator asked a question about vaccine availability and prioritisation. As has been well canvassed, vaccine availability has been a challenge at times. However, I'd note that, in terms of some of the cohorts that have been amongst the first eligible to receive a vaccine, we've seen many undertake that activity of their own volition in numbers and achieve very high uptake. I urge all those who are in cohorts that may not have achieved such a high uptake—

               The government has made clear, both in the other chamber and in this place, views in relation to the comments made by Mr Christensen. The approach of the government is, clearly, to make sure that we emphasise to Australians the importance of abiding by public health orders, putting restrictions in place and following advice in all circumstances, and that includes advice in relation to the vaccination rollout as well. It's been deeply frustrating at times that different things have indeed hurt public confidence in the vaccination rollout. I've noted Professor Dore from the Kirby Institute's remarks that we will look back on anti-AstraZenecaism as one of the greatest public health failings in many years. And, whilst the health advice has ebbed and flowed, if you like, in relation to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AZ" rel="nofollow">
                AZ

               , it's certainly been disappointing that some have exacerbated that—
