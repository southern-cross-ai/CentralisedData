        Our government is committed to unlocking the jobs of the future, and we're also committed to a future made in Australia. We're doing that right now in regional Queensland. A few weeks ago, I was in Townsville to talk about our future in green energy and our future in manufacturing. Of course, many senators around this chamber would know that Townsville, and particularly regional Queensland, has a proud manufacturing history. Thanks to Labor governments, we've built trains in Townsville, we've built trains in Maryborough and we have a proud manufacturing history, which means that we have many jobs located in regional Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few weeks ago, I was at Aurizon, one of the major train organisations there, to talk about an investment that our government is making, a $9.4 million investment through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
         ARENA
        </a>
        into Aurizon, Australia's largest freight hauler, and their battery partner Alta Battery Technology, so that those organisations can work together to develop and trial a 1.8-megawatt battery electric tender, also known as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BET" rel="nofollow">
         BET
        </a>
        . I have to admit, when I was there at Aurizon—I'm used to seeing traditional mechanics and people talking about manufacturing in the traditional way. But this was a really exciting partnership between a green-energy battery company and Aurizon, a haulage company, coming together to develop this new world-first technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        The BET will power a diesel electric locomotive and electric train. Aurizon estimates that the BET could eventually provide up to 50 per cent of the required power for suitable haulage routes, helping to decarbonise the company's haulage. In addition, the BET will be charged with renewable energy to provide energy to the train and further displace diesel use on their trial route.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government, alongside companies like Aurizon in Townsville, is moving the transport sector into the future. These are opportunities that organisations out there, like Aurizon, are taking every day—and, finally, they have a government that's backing them. Taking advantage of low emissions technology is all about creating more jobs, particularly in our regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        It isn't just electric trains that our government is backing. A few months ago, I stood alongside the Prime Minister and the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. We were in Townsville again to announce a $70 million investment in developing Townsville 's hydrogen hub—again, an incredible opportunity that we are delivering in regional Queensland, powered by moving towards these green energy opportunities. I spoke last time we were here about this development. The project is a fantastic opportunity for Townsville. It's such a huge win for the community there. Not only will it produce tonnes of green hydrogen per year but it will also create 200 direct jobs. These jobs are opportunities for local sparkies, plumbers, fitters and concreters during the construction, which is set to start next year. This is just one of the places where we're setting up these hydrogen hubs. Another one will also be included in Gladstone, another proud manufacturing town in regional Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're doing this because we know that there's a future in renewables, there's a future in green energy and Australia has the opportunity to be a renewable energy superpower. We're investing in cheaper, cleaner, greener energy and that's what we need to do to unlock the jobs of the future and bring down energy prices for all Queenslanders and all Australians. Over the medium and long term, our government's plan is to support the experts to deliver clean, cheap, reliable and resilient energy systems for all Australians. We know that our plan is critical to delivering reliable and affordable energy into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians know and Queenslanders know that under the former government we wasted a decade. We wasted a decade when it came to developing these energy opportunities. The former government had 22 failed energy policies. They were not able to land a single one. Now what are they offering Australians? Instead of talking about believing renewables now, instead of talking about delivering jobs now in the regions, those opposite under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">

        are talking about—'possibly', 'maybe', 'sometime in the future', 'maybe in a decade'—building nuclear reactors all down our coastlines, including in a place that is the gateway to the southern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians don't have another decade to waste. We need cheaper, cleaner energy now. That's why our government is delivering. That's why we're in Townsville announcing green energy jobs today.
