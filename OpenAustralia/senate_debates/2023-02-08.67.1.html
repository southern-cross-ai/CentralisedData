        , not from Labor MPs and not from senators from South Australia. The cash rate is up at 3.35 per cent, and that means mortgages, too. This month Adelaide's median house price is $565,000, so with a $500,000 loan, you could be paying a total of $908 more a month.

        Inflation is at 7.8 per cent, with the impact worse for fixed incomes or in regional and remote areas. South Australia is highly centralised in its geography and, amongst other factors, is affected differently and disproportionately. But you can be sure your mortgages and taxes will be higher under the actions of this Labor government.

        What is the plan to put downward pressure on inflation, ensuring South Australian industry and small business remains viable and families can support their children? They're feeling the pain right now. They've got no problem with funding child care and cheaper prescriptions, but they need a plan for inflation—not an essay, and definitely not to be told they have to wait. The cost of living is the most important issue, particularly for South Australians but also for all Australians. Are you listening? It seems not.
