        Today I want to take a moment to speak about a great Queenslander, David Kerrigan, who was recently awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for his service to volunteering, his work in social welfare organisations and his passion for regional rugby league—and don't we all have a passion for that? I am fortunate enough to know Dave, or 'Kerro' as he is more fondly known, who has been a Barcaldine local for over 40 years. There he sees firsthand the different struggles that western Queensland communities come to face in their daily lives. Kerro understands the importance of Queensland's regions and what they contribute to our economy. He knows it's vital for investments to be made in local manufacturing and other industries in our regions to keep jobs local and to keep towns thriving. He's a fierce advocate for rural health, in particular mental health, and the struggles that come with remote life, including housing availability and secure jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dave is a passionate volunteer and fundraising leader at the Australian Workers Heritage Museum, which brings vital tourism to the region. He's also a proud presenter at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_Knowledge" rel="nofollow">
         Tree of Knowledge
        </a>
        , the birthplace of the Labor Party—just don't tell those Labor Party members from Balmain! He gives his own personal tours of the Tree of Knowledge from time to time, which I've had the privilege of being a guest at when I first came to the Senate. Kerro also taught me how to shear my first sheep, but that's a story for another day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot think of anyone more dedicated to their region and more deserving of this award. Again, I want to say a very big congratulations to you, Kerro, on the award of an OAM. Good on you, mate, great job! I look forward to working with you in the future.
