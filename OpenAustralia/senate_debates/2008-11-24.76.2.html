           I indicate that the opposition welcomes these amendments and other government amendments that are to be moved subsequently in the committee stage. I will not detain the Senate for long, but these amendments in their various forms are responsive to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which inquired into the

We welcome the government’s acknowledgement that the legislation in its original form could be improved by amendments of the kind recommended by the Senate committee. For that reason, the opposition will be supporting those amendments.

            I apologise to the chamber. I thought I had spoken to these amendments previously, but I gathered from the silence that I had not. In essence, the government amendments remove references to ‘the product of the relationship’ in definitions of child and parent in the bill and will instead refer to ‘a child of the person within the meaning of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Family Law Act
            </a>
            ’. As Senator Brandis has indicated, the amendments implement a recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
           </p>
           <p>
            The amendments I have outlined also insert a revised section in the Australian Citizenship Act to provide for recognition of children born to same- and opposite-sex couples as a result of artificial conception procedures and surrogacy arrangements. A number of other technical amendments are made as a consequence of the removal of ‘the product of a relationship’ in the definition of a child.

             I would firstly like to indicate the Greens support for the government amendments, but I also have a question to put to the minister if I could. In the Senate committee’s recommendation (3), the committee recommends:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             ... that the Government give further consideration to what administrative or regulatory mechanisms may be available to appropriately manage the impact of the reforms on same-sex couples who may have benefits reduced under the changes.
            </p>
            <p>
             The last time we were discussing this bill, if you remember, the Greens moved an amendment which was not passed—and I accept that. I just wanted to know what the minister’s response to how we manage the possible negative ramifications for people, at least in the initial period, may be to any benefits that may change. I have read out the recommendation from the committee but, if the minister could please elaborate on how the government would deal with these impacts, that would be wonderful.

              I think I did go to these issues in the summing up on the second reading and made reference to a couple of issues. I think there was a discussion about a transitional commencement date other than 1 July, and I think I may have indicated the reasons for that. My recollection also is that I discussed what
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
               Commonwealth
              </a>
              agencies have been asked to do in terms of communicating these changes to the gay and lesbian community.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also would make the point that the changes to social security and family assistance entitlements—which are, I suppose, the ones that do spring to mind when you consider the changes that may create a financial disbenefit from what currently exists for some couples—will not commence until 1 July 2009. So we obviously have a period of time for same-sex couples to be advised and to plan their affairs accordingly. Again, I would make the point that reforms which benefit same-sex couples commence earlier than those—social security changes, for example. The majority of amendments, including amendments to the Australian government superannuation schemes, would commence after passage, and amendments to the Medicare and PBS safety nets would commence on 1 January 2009.

                 The opposition support these amendments. These are amendments that were recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in relation to the sensitive issue of the definitions in the legislation. They do not attack its essential purpose but it was the view of the committee, and in particular the Liberal senators—Senator Barnett, Senator Mary-

                 and Senator Trood—that these amendments were appropriate to provide reassurance to those who questioned the effect of this legislation upon families that the legislation in fact respected pre-existing categories and created a scheme which was consistent with the maintenance of marriage and the traditional notions of family life.

                  <p>
                   I have been somewhat caught on the hop, having been in the chair. I had a list of questions which I forwarded to the Attorney-
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General" rel="nofollow">
                    General
                   </a>
                   in relation to this request, which deals with a step-parent and extends the definition of ‘step-parent’ contained within the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
                    Family Law Act
                   </a>
                   . Firstly, you have the duty of a step-parent to maintain a child outlined in section 66M of the Family Law Act. You have the definition of ‘step-parent’, which is contained in section 4. Associated with that you have section 62B, which deals with the right of a child to have contact with a person by whom it is cared for. The wording in that section states that the person has to have that relationship with the child, and it talks of, for instance, a grandparent or relative. When you look at ‘relative’ in section 4, you see that that incorporates a step-parent. It would therefore seem that, in the two streams you are looking at—one dealing with contact with the child—you have an avenue of criteria which talks of a step-parent having an ability to have contact with the child; and, in the other avenue of maintenance, you have criteria set out in section 66M(3). Those criteria are quite exhaustive. They talk of the nature of the relationship and the duration.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The question I put to the government today is this: are we requiring more stringent criteria for the relationship of step-parent when it comes to maintaining the child, as opposed to the criteria for communication and contact with the child by a step-parent? The other questions I asked went to what effect the inclusion of a de facto relationship would have on a step-parent, what class of relationship would be included, were there any time requirements, were the criteria contained in section 66M(3) relevant—although that is spelt out under that duty to maintain, could it come within that?—and what could be the effects of this change in definition. You can appreciate that when you look at who should have contact with a child it should be in the best interests of the child that that occur and the person who has that contact should have some standing in relation to the child concerned. I have enumerated those questions in more detail in a letter to the Attorney-General and I would be obliged if the minister could advise the committee as to the government’s view on those questions that I have put.

                    indicate to Senator Ellison that, broadly, my advice is that there is a consistent definition of step-parent in the two contexts you outlined. However, obviously there would be additional elements which would need to be considered—for example, the best interests of the child, financial arrangements and so forth. I do have a very detailed set of responses for you, Senator Ellison, in relation to the five questions that you asked, which I am equally happy to read out or to table.

                       What are all the legal (and some practical) consequences of the expanded definition of step-parent? For example, if a single mother has a series of de facto relationships would each of the men with whom she has a de facto relationship become a “step-parent” of her child?

                       The definition is being amended to remove its discriminatory effects in relation to ‘step-parents’ who are or were in a de facto relationship with a parent of the child.

                       However, on issues of de facto step-parent maintenance, a step-parent will only have a duty to maintain a step-child where the court has determined under section 66M of the Family Law Act that it is proper for that step-parent to have that duty.

                       I have just one question to ask on the hop, as it were. In relation to that question of contact with the child, an example of grandparent and other relatives is mentioned. Does the reference to that example give it any more status than just that—an example—or is the prime issue that of the interests of the child? I do not have the act in front of me, but in section 62B it talks about someone with significant care of the child. What we are looking at here is someone who might be on the scene temporarily, if you like, in a relationship, having the ability to communicate with and contact the child. That is my concern when you have much stricter criteria where you have a requirement to maintain the child. Perhaps the minister could place on record the answer to that if it is possible to glean it from the detail that is contained there.

                        I am advised that the reference to grandparents and other relatives which is in the proviso ‘such as’ is an example given of persons falling into the category, the parameters of which are set out in 60B(2)(b), which recognises that the principle underlying the act is that children have a right to a relationship with people other than their parents who are significant to their care, welfare and development.

                          Senator Ellison, I think what I said was ‘significant to their care, welfare and development’. As I read these notes, that is in fact the wording of the relevant aspect of that subsection of the act.

                                These are yet further amendments, albeit in small compass, which perhaps should have been picked up in the first draft of the bill. They are yet another improvement of the bill and they of course have the opposition’s support.
