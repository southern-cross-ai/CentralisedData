        Dear Stirling
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am writing in relation a question you raised regarding the regulations surrounding public health advertisements during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time" rel="nofollow">
         Question Time
        </a>
        on Thursday 1 August 2019.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (the Act) prohibits advertising to the public for prescription medicines, including vaccines. The only exception from this prohibition is content authorised or required by a government in Australia, such as content issued under public health campaigns.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Act" rel="nofollow">
         The Act
        </a>
        also requires therapeutic goods advertising to the public, for non-prescription medicines or therapeutic goods, to comply with the Therapeutic Goods Advertising Code (the Code).
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Code" rel="nofollow">
         The Code
        </a>
        requires advertising to the public to be substantiated and prohibits misleading advertising. Both the Act and the Code are designed in the interests of consumers, balancing the protection of public health with the consumers need for information.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consistent with the above exception in the Act, both the Code and the exclusion of public health campaigns from its operation are consistent with, and give effect to, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_Use_of_Medicines" rel="nofollow">
         Quality Use of Medicines
        </a>
        (QUM).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The policy goal of QUM, a key plank of the National Medicines Policy which enjoys bi-partisan support, is to optimise health outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Health campaigns sponsored by government are purposefully designed to optimise health outcomes for all Australians - that Australians have the information necessary to ensure appropriate selection of medicines for public health protection. This is the very reason for the Australian Government's investment of $20 million over six years (to 2021-22) to ensure parents and carers get the facts about immunisation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Similarly, the Code (and the advertising regulatory framework more broadly) is designed to optimise public health outcomes and protect consumer interests. It applies to third parties who provide information to potential consumers about the nature and benefits of therapeutic goods. It is designed to give consumers confidence that the claims they read and/or hear from those who are in the business of promoting medicines are well-founded. This means that, as QUM provides, the consumer can select management options wisely, choose suitable medicines (if a medicine is considered necessary), and use medicines safely and effectively.

        I trust this information is of assistance to you. I have provided a copy of this letter to the Minister for Health, the Hon Greg Hunt MP, for information.
