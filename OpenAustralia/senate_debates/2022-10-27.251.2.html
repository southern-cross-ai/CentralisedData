        INTRODUCTION
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We live in the best country in the world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But for millions of Australians, things aren't easy right now.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We're facing increasing financial pressures:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In your mortgage repayments, insurance premiums, visits to the supermarket, filling-up at the petrol station, and especially in your power bills.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Cost-of-living is skyrocketing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And it may seem out of control.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yet it can be kept in check.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But not while this Labor Government makes bad economic decisions.
       </p>

        was a missed opportunity to help you at a time when you need help.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It didn't address our economic challenges or inspire confidence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's a Budget which breaks promises, rather than keeps them…

        A Budget which weakens Australia's financial position, rather than strengthens it…

        Today, Kel's business is threatened as he faces an increase of $160,000 dollars on the power bill from last year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Peter, Lee and Kel's energy costs will go up further, that much we know.

        -of-living are going up partly due to global conditions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But also due to this Labor Government's bad decisions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Treasurer said his Budget 'makes hard decisions for hard times'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But his Budget makes bad decisions—making hard times even harder for all Australians…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whether you're young, raising a family, or retired…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whether you're an employee or running a business.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On Tuesday, the Treasurer failed to mention in his speech what Labor's Budget papers revealed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'Everything is going up, except your wages.'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Cost-of-living, power prices, taxes, interest rates, unemployment, and the deficit are going up, or will be going up under the Government's predictions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The same Budget papers confirmed that real wages are forecast to go down.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This means that, by Christmas, a typical family will be $2,000 dollars worse off under this Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And you have every right to be anxious and disappointed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Prime Minister has broken faith with you.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        RESPONSE
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TO" rel="nofollow">
         TO
        </a>
        BUDGET MEASURES
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The job of an Opposition is not to oppose for the sake of it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We don't disagree with everything in the Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Policy must be judged on its merits.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If it's good for you, we will support it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If it's bad for you, we will stand against it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So, we commend several good measures in Tuesday's Budget:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The extension of the childcare subsidy to more Australian families…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The commitment to reduce the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme Co-Payment to lower the costs of medicines…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The support for housing for of our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans" rel="nofollow">
         Veterans
        </a>
        …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The initiatives to combat domestic violence…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And the funding to help Australians recover from devasting floods.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Tonight, we will tell you about some of the Coalition's priorities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And we will also highlight where the Budget is failing you:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In energy, tax relief, housing, filling job shortages, industrial relations, and infrastructure in our regions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor's Budget makes life more difficult for millions of Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And it shows—yet again—that Labor can't manage the economy when it forms Government.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There's a historical pattern of Labor creating a mess and the Coalition cleaning it up.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Liberal Prime Minister John Howard and Treasurer Peter Costello inherited a damaged economy from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Keating
        </a>
        's Labor Government of high interest rates and unemployment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They turned the economy around, showed financial restraint, introduced reforms like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , and left our nation with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Future Fund
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2013, Liberal Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Treasurer Joe Hockey inherited a broken economy from Labor's Rudd-Gillard-Rudd tenure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They commenced Budget repair and prepared for a rainy day.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And this work was continued by Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Treasurer Scott Morrison.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By 2019, the Coalition brought the Budget back into balance for the first time in eleven years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Then, in 2020, COVID-19 hit.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That once-in-a-generation pandemic caused the biggest economic downturn since the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
         Great Depression
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was only due to our economic management over the seven years prior to the pandemic that we were in a strong position to implement a suite of support measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With 2020 hindsight, we didn't get everything right.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And some of the state government lockdowns went on for far too long.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians are still bearing the wounds of those lockdowns today.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's policies kept our nation afloat.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        JobKeeper assisted 1 million businesses and kept 4 million Australians in jobs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our cash flow boost helped 820,000 businesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On almost every economic and health measure, Australia was either world-leading or performed better than other countries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Final Budget Outcome for 2021-22 revealed a $48 billion dollar reduction in the deficit…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And a $115 billion dollar reduction in debt compared to the Budget handed down in March.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In just one year—2020-21 to 21-22—the Budget improved by over $100 billion dollars—the largest turn-around since Federation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are now 596,000 more Australians in jobs than prior to the pandemic.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Other economies fared much worse than ours.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Labor Government talks down our economy, but could not name a single country whose position they would rather be in.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They're vocal in criticising our pandemic response.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But they remain silent on the fact that their own measures would have cost taxpayers an extra $81 billion dollars, including further extending JobKeeper and paying people to get vaccinated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As for Labor's claim about '$1 trillion dollars of debt', even the ABC's Fact Check didn't support the claim.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Every democratic government around the world, left or right leaning, incurred COVID debt.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Yet Australia emerged from the pandemic in an economic position the envy of most nations with debt lower than any other major advanced economy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So, when you hear Labor's spin, when you hear them carry-on about a 'wasted decade', it's a distraction from the fact that this Government has no economic plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And Labor will continue to misrepresent the truth until the next election to mask their own bad decisions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most notably, their bad decisions on energy policy.

        In the Rudd-Gillard Labor Government years, power prices rose on average by 12.9 per cent per year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over nine years of Coalition Government, they rose on average by 0.3 per cent per year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Six months ago, the Australian public heard the Prime Minister very clearly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He said he had a plan to help with your cost-of-living pressures, especially your electricity bills.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 97 occasions he promised to you that your bills would go down by $275 dollars.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In this Budget, instead of going down by $275 as promised, Labor's plan will see your electricity bill go up by more than 56 per cent over the next two years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not only that, your gas bill will go up by more than 44 per cent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Pensioners can't afford that level of increase.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not just pensioners, but self-funded retirees, families and small businesses too. In fact, most Australians.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Europe" rel="nofollow">
         In Europe

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Between "heating or eating" this winter.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There, electricity and gas bills are spiralling out of control.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Countries are rationing power.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not just because of the invasion of Ukraine…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But because governments in several countries in recent years have made catastrophic energy decisions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They have turned off the secure supply of electricity and gas before the technology and system are ready for more renewable energy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Despite those warnings and lessons, this Labor Government is following in the footsteps of those countries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Investing in renewable energy, reducing emissions and doing so credibly to protect our environment is crucial.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Indeed, we want a sustainable and sensible pathway to reduce our emissions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But when the Prime Minister says that the sun and wind are free energy sources, your power bill tells a different story.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's much more complicated than what the Prime Minister wants you to believe.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The technology doesn't yet exist at the scale that is needed to store renewable energy for electricity to be reliable at night, or during peak periods.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is just the scientific reality.

        TAX RELIEF
       </p>

        Your cost-of-living relief is interconnected with tax relief.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To help you and your families to plan and get ahead, the Coalition believes in a core principle:
       </p>

        That you should keep more of what you earn.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hard working Australians should be rewarded.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The best reward for hard work is lower taxes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Due to our tax relief in government, a person earning $90,000 dollars paid $3,000 dollars less tax than they did under Labor, each and every year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Stage 3 of our legislated plan will lower tax for more than 10 million Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will simplify our tax system, abolishing the 37 per cent tax rate in its entirety and reducing the 32.5 per cent tax rate to 30 per cent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It means those earning between $45,000 dollars and $200,000 dollars will pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For a hairdresser earning $60,000 dollars a year, it means $400 dollars more in your pocket.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For an executive assistant earning $80,000 dollars a year, it means $900 dollars more in your pocket.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For a qualified diesel mechanic earning $100,000 dollars a year, it means $1,370 dollars more in your pocket, than in Labor's.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For 95 per cent of workers, it means a top rate of no more than 30 cents in the dollar.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our plan means that the top 5 per cent of income earners will pay 33 per cent of all income tax.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For millions of Australians, you can work hard, take an extra shift, or get a pay rise or promotion, without suddenly being pushed into a higher tax bracket.

        Our legislated tax plan future-proofs your income.

        But Mr Dutton wanted to speak of his parents.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        His Dad, Bruce, started out as a small businessman—as a bricklayer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        His Mum, Ailsa, was a secretary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By the time five kids came along—of which Mr Dutton the eldest—his Mum was at home raising them and doing the books for his Dad.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But she also took in local kids as a day care.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Dutton's parents had a strong work ethic.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They taught their children to appreciate the value of money.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They were raised with a lot of love and support, but not much money.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They lived in what is still a working-class suburb.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was a time when Labor was presiding over high interest rates and unemployment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And it was a terrible time for the building industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Dutton was encouraged to get a part-time job.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        From Grade 7 until he started university, Mr Dutton worked in a local butcher shop—after school and on Saturday mornings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Scrubbing floors, washing up, and serving on the counter was tough work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But it gave him an appreciation for many different perspectives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He saved like crazy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One of his proudest achievements was buying his first home.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was nothing flash at $90,000 dollars.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But it was his.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today, it's much harder, almost impossible, for young people to afford their first house—even with hard work, sacrifice and saving.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Tonight, we recommit the Coalition to assisting first home buyers by accessing their superannuation through the Super Home Buyer Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, a super fund can be used to buy a residential or commercial rental property…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To buy shares or even livestock.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In fact, it can be used to buy almost any asset class except a home to live in.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Taking money out of super before retirement is a bad investment decision, unless you put the money back in before retirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Take this example:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A 30-year-old couple withdraws $50,000 dollars each from super to help buy a home.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over a decade, the $100,000 dollars would be worth about $188,000 dollars if it had remained in super.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Without the $100,000 dollars from super, the first home buyer wouldn't have been able to afford the house.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But with the access to super, they have a home to live in.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the house was sold after a decade, the $100,000 would be worth around $214,000.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And if the $214,000 was reinvested back into super—as we would require—the couple would end up with a balance from that amount in their super when they retire with over $1 million dollars.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under a Coalition Government, we will extend the same opportunity to women who separate later in life; women with very few housing options and those who are increasingly left homeless.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Your super is your money.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government thinks it's their money—something we have seen in this Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They want your super to invest in someone else's home—not your own.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the same time, they want super funds to be less transparent with what they do with your money.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Coalition has a strong record when it comes to getting first home buyers and single parent families into their own home.

        It was disappointing, in Tuesday's Budget, to see that $50 million dollars set aside for Round 7 of the Safer Communities Funding was cut.

        Earlier rounds of the program supported the safety of our multicultural communities.

        A Coalition Government will restore that funding.

        EDUCATION
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a nation, we celebrate our wonderful Indigenous history.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But we need to be equally proud of our British heritage and our migrant story.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many parents from across the country are increasingly concerned about the education their children are receiving at school.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Despite great teachers and record funding going into schools—government and non-government—our nation's literacy and numeracy levels are falling short.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In our school curriculum, it's important to include studies of the environment and other social policies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But the system has allowed ideologically driven advocates too much influence over what is taught to our children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Teaching a sanitised and selective version of history and the arts—and radical gender theory—is not in our children's best interests.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What is needed is a focus on making the basics a priority—reading, writing and maths…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Fostering a love of our country and pride in our history and democracy, without sugar coating the past…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Where the teachers lead the instruction and are supported to have orderly classrooms…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Where students learn respect, discipline, and 'how to think' not 'what to think'.

        ONLINE SAFETY
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So much of our lives are already online, be it through internet banking or sharing personal messages, videos and photos.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While children and the elderly are most vulnerable, none of us are immune.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A Coalition Government Mr Dutton leads will do more to help families deal with the threats online.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our laws need to be tightened and social media companies held to account for what happens on their platforms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It needs to be a safe environment.
       </p>

        As Defence Minister, Mr Dutton provided more than $285 million dollars in support to President Zelenskyy and the people of Ukraine.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's a signal of our values and sends a statement to the world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with this Government in providing even more support…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Including the announcements made today.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The threat of conflict in our own region is real.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As many military leaders have warned, we have to be realistic about the increasing prospect of that conflict.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AUKUS deal negotiated by Prime Minister Morrison and Mr Dutton will give our country the best chance of peace.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It provides deterrence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not just through the acquisition of nuclear-powered submarines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But through collaboration with our two most important allies in the areas of artificial intelligence, space, cyber, hypersonics, and the interoperability of our respective forces.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With threats in the region, Labor and the Coalition must be on a unity ticket.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia must not only be a credible defence partner in the region, but also ensure our men and women in uniform have the capabilities they need to credibly deter aggression.

       <p class="italic">
        We thank the Government for continuing that investment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The number of veteran suicides in our country remains far too high.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's a national tragedy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Coalition strongly supports the Government's commitment to expand the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One moment as Defence Minister Mr Dutton will never forget was attending the funeral of Private Tom Halloran.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Tom was 21-years-old—an incredible young man with everything ahead of him and a proud digger.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He took his own life on the 26th of April this year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Entering the chapel, Mr Dutton and his wife spoke with Tom's parents—John and Robyn—and their daughter Annie—Tom's sister.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They put on a brave face but were understandably crushed and looking for answers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On Tuesday this week, John gave evidence to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        He wants a better system of support for our diggers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We all do.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Dutton raised some suggestions the family have made with the Minister for Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And we will work with the Government to do whatever is required to turn this situation around.

        investment drives economic growth, creates jobs, encourages investment, boosts productivity, busts congestion, and supports resilient supply chains.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That's why the Coalition committed record funding of $120 billion dollars for infrastructure over the next 10 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In contrast, this Labor Government's first Budget axed $2.8 billion dollars of infrastructure projects and delayed a further $6.5 billion dollars' worth of projects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's essentially an end for projects like the Rockhampton Ring Road—something which the current Prime Minister promised in 2019.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor has cancelled and delayed over $5 billion dollars of investment in water infrastructure, including dams like Hells Gates, Dungowan, Urannah, and Wyangala.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government has slashed $10 billion dollars from regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In so doing, it's put the interests of Premier Dan Andrews and Labor's commitment of $2.2 billion dollars for the Suburban Rail Loop ahead of the one-in-three Australians who live outside of capital cities…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Those Australians who generate much of the wealth that benefits our country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Speaking of regional Australia, farmers have been left in the lurch with this Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At a time when they're grappling with rising costs of inputs, like fertiliser, Labor backflips on its methane pledge.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor's intent to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent will drive-up the cost of meat at the supermarket.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's bad for our farmers and just another added cost to your grocery basket.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        CONCLUSION
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians will recall that prior to the election, Prime Minister Albanese promised that he would be a leader who wouldn't run from responsibility.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He promised to lead a government that steps up, does its job, and doesn't always blame someone else.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For all their moral posturing and all their promises, Labor shows—time and again—that their rhetoric in Opposition never matches their actions in Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You are never better off when Labor has its hands on the Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As an Opposition, we will stand against Labor's broken promises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will have a clearly defined, positive and bold plan ahead of the next election to take our country forward.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will support hard-working Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will support all Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And we will rebuild a strong economy for your family and for our country.
