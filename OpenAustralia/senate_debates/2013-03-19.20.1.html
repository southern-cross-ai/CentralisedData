         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        representing the Prime Minister. I refer the minister to an interview by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr, with Leon Compton on ABC Radio in Hobart yesterday morning where the minister on two occasions, when asked specifically to do so, refused to support the government's proposed media reforms. I also refer the minister to reports this morning by the journalists
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hartcher" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        that Senator Bob Carr has told people overseas that he has lost confidence in the Prime Minister and that the minister for aged care, Mr Mark Butler, has also lost confidence in the Prime Minister. Does the fact that two senior members of the cabinet refused to publicly express their confidence in the Prime Minister, and that one of the most senior ministers in the government, Senator Bob Carr, has said that that is because of the media package, inevitably mean that the Prime Minister presides over a divided and dysfunctional government?

He had spoken to his office and they had never even attempted to contact the office, to paraphrase what Senator Carr said, but reasonably accurately. And we have seen this morning Mr Butler tweet that it is also untrue.

           Those opposite have got no substance. They are policy free and they are stooping to the bottom of the barrel because they have no care for the vision for this country. They do not care about childcare workers. They do not care about textile workers. They do not care about transport workers. They have opposed every single reform in these areas to improve the life of working people in this country. They have absolutely demonstrated with that question—

             Those opposite have an hour in question time; probably half a dozen questions they get the chance to ask the government, hold it to account, ask probing questions about policy. They could ask about how strong the economy is; they could ask about the strength of our education system; they could ask about what is going on in sport or about childcare workers—not a question. Into sleaze: it hasn't taken long for those opposite. Perhaps you all should be made to wear blue ties like Mr Abbott and then you would get the message you are on the policy framework. Let Senator Sinodinos ask a question, because I know that he will actually put some thought into it, as one of the few economically literate members opposite. He may have to get clearance for the question first, but he would ask an intelligent question, I am confident of it.

Why don't you try asking one of the ministers a question about policy? They are all here in a line for you. Why don't you ask about some policy? Ask about media policy.

                   , on a point of order: it is hardly sleazy to ask whether the Prime Minister of Australia enjoys the confidence of her own caucus. The question was very simple: can the minister who does lead the government in this place give to the Senate a full and unequivocal assurance that the Prime Minister enjoys the confidence of all her ministers? The fact that he has exhausted almost all of his time in failing to give that assurance is itself revealing, but I do ask you to draw him to the question.

                     Order on both sides! There is no point of order. The minister is answering the question. The minister has nine seconds remaining if the minister has anything further to add.
