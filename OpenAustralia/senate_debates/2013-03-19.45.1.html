         Digital Economy

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Ltd" rel="nofollow">
         News Ltd
        </a>
        Chief Executive, Kim Williams, is correct when he states that the minister's bills are unconstitutional, dangerous and contain a deeply troubling lack of detail. Will the minister come clean and admit the reason that so many of the terms, definitions and powers in the bill are so ill defined is to give the public interest media advocate significantly more power and control than he has admitted to date?

         I thank the senator for his questions. The role of parliament in establishing underpinnings for regulatory frameworks for journalism has been a hot topic in this chamber for a couple of days.

It cannot be directly relevant to that question to be commenting on what the government of the United Kingdom may or may not have done overnight.

              . The question of Mr Kim Williams's testimony of whether or not the Public Interest Media Advocate's powers are objective or subjective has been debated all around the world. In Ireland they have had this very debate. I was interested to read the views of Michael McNiffe, then editor of the

                  , I ask a supplementary question. If he will not accept the concerns of Mr Williams, will he accept Fairfax chief executive Greg Highwood's assessment that his reforms are a nuclear option that have the potential to basically shut down news organisations?

                       , I should ignore those interjections. The public interest test is a concept that is not new. For 80 years it has existed in the United States of America. In the United Kingdom they have a public interest test and, as I have just described, overnight in the United Kingdom David Cameron signed up.

If the minister insists on remaining blind to the concerns of industry, will he at least take stock of the statements of Mr Oakeshott, Mr Thomson, Mr Windsor, Mr Katter and Mr Wilkie and admit that this outrageous attack on media freedom is dead in the water?

                          is engaged in an outrageous attack on the freedom of the press in the United Kingdom, and we have a public interest test in the United States, so those senators in that Senate over there are in an outrageous attack on the public interest! There is an outrageous attack on freedom of speech in the United Kingdom and, as for those Irish, they are a disgrace! Really, those opposite just need to lift their heads from up underneath the table and look at what the rest of the world is doing. A public interest test is common and, as we are seeing increasingly as the power of the press around the globe is increasing, governments in those countries are looking to ensure a fair balance for ordinary citizens—
