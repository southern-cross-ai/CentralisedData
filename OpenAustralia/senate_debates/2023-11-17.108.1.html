        , I have never ever witnessed such endemic incompetence from any government, not onceâ€”not even close. There is no greater responsibility for any federal government, as I know as a former defence minister, than the security of our nation and the safety of all Australians. It is a complete failure of national leadership and utterly unconscionable that our Prime Minister chose to flee overseas instead of staying to fix his mess.

        Labor have demonstrated time and time again they are incapable of acting quickly or decisively. The government should have prepared draft legislation the moment the likelihood of the High Court's decision became clear to them, which was in June of this year.

We don't know how many of these criminal detainees were released from the Yongah Hill detention centre in Northam, which houses the very worst of the very worst.
