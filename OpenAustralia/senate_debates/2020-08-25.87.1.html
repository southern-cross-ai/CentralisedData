        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. When did the minister first learn he had been cut out of decision-making in the aged-care emergency response? Was the minister ever consulted on the decision to exclude him?

         The reality is there has been no change in the decision-making process with respect to the establishment of an aged-care response centre in any state.

          I think the interjection from behind me is correct: don't always believe what you read in the newspaper. The decisions around the establishment of an aged-care response centre are made through the AHPPC. That is the decision-making process under the auspices of the national cabinet. It has been discussed at national cabinet now on two occasions—last Friday and a fortnight before that. The AHPPC has and does report to the health minister. So, in the context of an organisation that reports to the health minister in implementing our national COVID-19 health response, that's the decision-making line. So nothing has changed. It is as it always was. But I and my department play an important operational role in the oversight of all of those facilities, as I do in Victoria.

            Has the minister been sidelined because he failed to produce a COVID-19 plan specifically for the aged-care sector, or because he failed to learn the tragic lessons of Newmarch House, or because he forgot the number of deaths in residential aged care on Friday, or because he couldn't get the number of deaths right again yesterday? Or was it because of the first, second or the 328th tragic and avoidable death of an older Australian in aged care?

               I was consulted in the process of the formation of these centres across Australia before the documentation went to national cabinet last week, so I was well aware of all of the processes last week before any decisions were made with respect to the formation of a recovery centre in any other state. I played a part, firstly, in the formation of the Victorian aged-care response centre, and then in the process of decision-making for those that might be required subsequently.

                  Senator Watt demonstrates what happens when you just read the pre-written supplementary that you've been given before question time rather than listening to the answer that has just been given. I've just explained the process that has been involved with the design of the recovery and response centres for aged care in all of the states. I've explained my involvement in it and the process by which they are approved. I stand by my answer.
