           The government amendments update the required time frames for when eligible rollover funds need to comply with the requirements of this bill to ensure that the bill doesn't operate retrospectively. The amendments also provide for a mechanism for superannuation funds to voluntarily transfer amounts to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
            ATO
           </a>
           , where it is in the person's best interest for those amounts to be transferred—for example, where they may have otherwise been sent to ineligible rollover funds. The ATO will proactively reunify these amounts wherever they possibly can.
          </p>
          <p>
           An eligible rollover fund is a holding account that's designed to receive superannuation benefits of lost members and accounts with low balances that are no longer receiving contributions. The unclaimed superannuation regime, together with the recent passage of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Act 2019—which redirects to the ATO small and inactive accounts that may have otherwise been paid to an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERF" rel="nofollow">
            ERF
           </a>
           —means that the role of eligible rollover funds in the superannuation system has significantly diminished.
          </p>
          <p>
           This bill facilitates the exit of eligible rollover funds from the industry. But, as a result of the timing changes in the amendments, eligible rollover funds will be required to transfer all accounts below $6,000 to the ATO by 30 June 2021, which was previously 30 June 2020, and all remaining accounts to the ATO by 31 January 2022, which was previously 30 June 2021. The removal of eligible rollover funds from the market means that superannuation funds will need a mechanism to voluntarily transfer to the ATO funds that previously may have been directed to an eligible rollover fund. These amendments allow for such transfers. These amendments are needed to avoid small and unclaimed amounts held by trustees being eroded by fees. Importantly, the ATO will work proactively to reunify these amounts where possible, together with interest, to members' superannuation accounts or, in some cases, directly to the individual.
          </p>
          <p>
           The bill is consistent with recommendation 5 of the Productivity Commission's 2018 final report,
           <i>
            Superannuation: assessing efficiency and
           </i>
           <i>
            competitiveness
           </i>
           , which recommended the closure of eligible rollover funds within three years. The bill also builds on the policy intent of the Treasury Laws Amendment (Protecting Your Superannuation Package) Act 2019, which ensures that members' lost and inactive accounts are consolidated with active accounts.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to thank Senator Hanson for her work with the government on these changes. Through these changes the government is building a stronger and more efficient superannuation system and improving outcomes for members.

            I want to indicate that the opposition will be supporting the government amendments to this bill. As a broad principle, we are of course supportive of measures that target duplicate accounts and make the system stronger, fairer and more efficient. We consider that these are small but important changes that will improve the operation of the regime, as outlined in the bill. We thank all of the participants in the debate for bringing this forward.
