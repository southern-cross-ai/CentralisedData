        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, representing the Minister for Industry. In this National Skills Week, can the minister advise the Senate what action the government is taking to deliver a strong and stable skills and training sector so growing cities and regions in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         I thank Senator Back for his very important question. National Skills Week is one of the most important weeks on this nation's calendar. This government is committed not only to a stronger economy but to a strong skills base that will enable Australia's young people to make the most of the opportunities that are available.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Minister for Industry has been extraordinarily busy in this space since the election. The department's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
          VET
         </a>
         Reform Taskforce has been consulting widely across the nation. I understand from the minister that the task force has had some 5,000 engagements. Those consultations are continuing and this government is determined to ensure that industry and others have the opportunity to have input into our future plans. We have been listening to industry and to training companies to ensure that these VET reforms are strategic, meaningful and lasting and will strengthen a critical sector of our economy. A highly skilled and capable workforce, as I am sure all in this chamber appreciate, underpins this nation's competitiveness and productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am proud to confirm again that this government is getting on with providing real support for apprentices. Our trade support loans legislation, which passed this place earlier this year, is about providing those of Australia's young people who wish to take the apprenticeship and training path—which they are entitled to do and which we encourage them to do—with $20,000 loans over four years. This relieves their financial burdens and also increases completion rates for apprentices.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I strongly believe that apprenticeships are the flagship for skills and training. Can the minister update the Senate on how the scheme is going and how it is playing out?

           I again thank Senator Back for that very important question. The government, through the minister, has released a discussion paper for the $476 million Industry Skills Fund which will deliver over 200,000 targeted training places and training support services. This will assist small- and medium-sized businesses not only in the senator's home state of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           but right throughout the nation. Since July, when these loans started, the take-up has been fantastic. In the first three weeks of August alone some 1,700 apprentices applied, many of whom are currently in training and many of whom have already received their first cheque. I think that should excite all senators. It is a great opportunity for those young people to make a long-lasting contribution to this nation.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. I thank the minister for those most encouraging figures. Particularly for the benefit of those opposite, can the minister remind the Senate who is eligible for the scheme, including the generous repayment conditions that you have described?

             I again thank Senator Back. The trade support loans are available to all Australian apprentices who are studying in a skills need area—specifically, an apprenticeship or traineeship with a certificate
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
              II

             I or certificate

              IV
             </a>
             qualification that leads to an occupation on the National Skills Need List, such as electrician, cook, plumber, hairdresser or joiner, or an apprenticeship or traineeship with a certificate II, certificate III or certificate IV qualification in agriculture or horticulture.
            </p>

             </a>
             s can be paid regardless of the apprentice's age, existing worker status or income. School based apprentices can also apply for a trade support loan. Apprentices—and I think it is important to note this—will not start repaying their loan until they are earning a sustainable income of more than $50,000. Those who complete their training will get a 20 per cent discount on their loan, meaning they will repay less than they borrowed.
