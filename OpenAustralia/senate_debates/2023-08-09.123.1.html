        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. I refer to a speech by Uluru statement co-author and Referendum Council member Megan Davis when she delivered the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Parkes" rel="nofollow">
         Henry Parkes
        </a>
        oration in 2018. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Uluru Statement from the Heart isn't just the first one-page statement; it's actually a very lengthy document …
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister made a statement in the other place yesterday in which he said that leaders at Uluru had come with a statement that fits on an A4 page. When is the Prime Minister going to be truthful with the Australian people and admit that the Uluru statement is much longer than he claimed yesterday?

         Senator Hanson, I make a few points. First, Ms Davis has made a statement. There's been a lot of news this week that the Uluru statement is 26 pages long, but it's one page. That's the statement. That is what we issued to the Australian people. I can show you the Uluru statement here.

           It is, I think, a great sadness to many people to see the alternative government denigrating the statement that has been given by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           peoples to the people of Australia. But, Senator Hanson, this is the Uluru statement, and it does fit on an A4 page. I disagree with your position on this, and I appreciate that we have a different view, but I think we should at least ensure that we are clear about why we have a different view. With respect, you and others don't have a different view because of the length of the statement; you have a different view because, fundamentally, you don't think that we should have a voice. We disagree. In fact, I think many of those opposite disagree. There are those opposite who do support a voice and there are those opposite, including in this chamber, who support a legislated voice and have done so publicly. I acknowledge that. There appear to be those on your side who don't even support that.
          </p>
          <p>
           So the difference between those in this chamber is that there are some that don't support any voice. As I said, Senator Hanson, I disagree with you, but that's your right. There are some who support a legislated voice but are going all out to stop a constitutional voice. That's what they're doing. There are those of us who think that, given all that's happened in this country and the extent of Indigenous disadvantage, we should ensure that our First Nations peoples are recognised in our Constitution and are able to have a constitutional right to a voice to give advice. That's all.

I also have here Professor Megan Davis's comments and her statement. Professor Davis claimed she had been referring to the Referendum Council report published in 2017, page 16—

He said, 'Senior coalition members had told me to my face that defeating the Voice referendum was their way to hurt Albanese and turn their fortunes around.'

One can ask: why? It comes back to politics.
