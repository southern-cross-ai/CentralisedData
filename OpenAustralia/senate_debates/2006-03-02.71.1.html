        My question is to Senator Santoro, the Minister for Ageing. Isn’t it now 10 days since allegations of the sexual abuse of four women at the George Vowell aged care facility were made public? In those 10 days, haven’t we heard about three other cases of sexual abuse of elderly women in aged care facilities? Other than call a meeting of an established committee—a meeting that has now been delayed—can the minister explain precisely what he has actually done as the person responsible for protecting residents of aged care facilities? Given that there are now four aged care facilities that are the subject of police investigations for sexual abuse, can the minister now indicate whether any other facilities are the subject of similar investigations?

         I do not know why Senator McLucas continues on this crusade. I do not know why Senator McLucas does not wish to acknowledge the size of the industry. There are over 3,000 aged care facilities funded by the federal government, and there are over 150,000 residents being cared for in these facilities and at home, but Senator McLucas continues to build a case on the very unfortunate, small number of cases in relation to this.

           I will tell Senator McLucas what I have done. During the last week, since these allegations became known, I have been speaking to the relatives of the people who have been abused, I have been speaking to some of the people who have been abused, I have been speaking to their carers, I have been speaking to the professionals and I have been seeking advice from my department and from the complaints resolution scheme. Last night, I had the opportunity to have a long discussion with Professor Warren Hogan about his perspective on these issues, and I can assure you that Professor Hogan and the other experts I have been talking to have opinions. This morning, I received a delegation from one of the peak organisations within the aged care industry, and they presented me with their thoughts as to what should be happening in relation to mandatory reporting and police checks.
          </p>
          <p>
           I will continue to consult the people who are most affected, the people who care for them and the people who can give me advice. Meanwhile, Senator McLucas and the Labor Party can defame the industry and besmirch the reputation of providers. During the next three weeks, I will be addressing at least six of the peak organisations, and I will be quoting to them precisely what Senator McLucas and the Labor Party have been saying about the industry, about carers and about the providers, who, as I have said here so often, regard their duty of care towards vulnerable Australians in their care as sacrosanct and who perform a wonderful job on behalf of the vast majority of people in their care.

            , I ask a supplementary question. How could any Australian who has a family member in an aged care facility have any confidence at all that the government’s system will fully protect their relatives from the shocking abuse that has been reported over the last 10 days, given that the minister has done nothing effective since the events first came to light? Given that there are now four aged care facilities that are the subject of these investigations, can the minister indicate whether any other facilities are the subject of similar investigations?

             Many Australian families who have relatives in care within aged care facilities have written to me and made contact with me. In fact, a representative of a family placed a letter in the
             <i>
              Courier-Mail
             </i>
             this morning expressing great and sincere satisfaction with the way in which their relatives are being cared for within the aged care facilities of the state. Many families, including the families of the victims, have spoken to me, and they recognise that the vast majority of aged care facilities in this country provide the very best of care for their loved ones. So I can say to Senator McLucas that Australian families are overwhelmingly satisfied with the way that the people in aged care facilities are cared for, and they have let me know so.
