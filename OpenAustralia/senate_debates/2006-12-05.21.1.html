        My question is to Senator Santoro, Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing. I refer the minister to the tragic deaths of two teenagers—and another is on life support in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Darwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Darwin Hospital
        </a>
        —due to petrol sniffing last weekend at Oenpelli in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . It is a tragedy that has plunged the whole community into total grief and despair. Can the minister confirm that non-sniffable Opal fuel has not been rolled out to Oenpelli and the surrounding area? Is the minister aware of a study by Access Economics earlier this year which found that a widespread rollout of Opal would have a net benefit for governments through savings to the health and criminal justice systems? Didn’t this research conclude that the cost of not rolling out Opal is higher than the cost of doing so and that a more widespread rollout could prevent loss of life? Given those findings and the latest deaths at Oenpelli, will the government now commit to an immediate rollout of Opal fuel across all communities affected by petrol sniffing?

         I am sure that all senators would share my feelings, and that is that I am very sad to hear of the deaths of the two teenage boys from the community of Oenpelli in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         which the media has, in fact, indicated is the result of petrol fumes. Senators would be aware that petrol sniffing is a very complex issue and that supplying unleaded Opal fuel into a community can assist in addressing this problem. However, I am sure all senators would also agree that the community has an essential role to play in addressing petrol sniffing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Oenpelli, senators may be interested to know, is approved for the Australian government’s petrol sniffing prevention program and has received regular deliveries of unleaded Opal fuel in drums since May 2006. As further information for honourable senators, they may be interested to know that Oenpelli—for those who are not familiar with Oenpelli—is 3,000 kilometres south-east of Darwin and has a population of 1,500 people, with approximately 20 regular sniffers. The community has been approved for the petrol sniffing prevention program and had its first supply of unleaded fuel delivered in May 2006. It has one service station that only supplies diesel fuel through its bowsers. The local fuel supplier has confirmed that regular deliveries of unleaded Opal fuel have been provided in 200-litre drums to Oenpelli since May 2006. According to media sources, the Oenpelli Council banned the use of regular unleaded fuel in the community last week. The nearest source of regular unleaded fuel is at Jabiru, 70 kilometres away.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think this indicates that the government has been acting as expeditiously as possible. It has the assistance of the local community. Obviously, the government will continue to keep a very close eye on the situation, particularly in view of the very regrettable deaths of the two teenage boys who are the subject of the question.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer, but I ask the minister to take on notice for me his information about the supply of Opal fuel to Oenpelli. I am aware that the

           CEO

          of Oenpelli Council is reported in today’s newspapers as saying that the community has applied to the government for Opal fuel in Oenpelli. So would you please confirm for us that the

          has in fact received an application specifically for Oenpelli and not surrounding communities? Also, please explain why Opal fuel, as I understand it, has not been made available to Oenpelli. If in fact it has, would you please reconfirm the advice you have been given?

           I will take that question by the senator on notice, although I do wish to refer her to the substance of my first answer to the question, where I clearly indicated that, in fact, Oenpelli did receive the first supply of unleaded fuel in May 2006 in 200-litre drums. Nevertheless, I undertake to take the question on notice.

            If I

           can add to my answer either today or at a later stage—hopefully before the Senate rises this year—I will certainly do so.
