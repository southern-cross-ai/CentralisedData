         I thank Senator Farrell for his ongoing interest. As I said yesterday, the agreement that has been reached between Telstra and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         Co. will be remembered as the moment the Australian government and the industry joined together to revolutionise the telecommunications sector in this country. The agreement, once finalised, will mean that Telstra will be involved in the NBN build. It will mean that the build is more efficient, cheaper and quicker, with less use of overhead cable. The agreement will also provide a greater level of certainty for all players in the industry on the pathway forward towards a genuinely competitive telecommunications sector—

Can the minister further explain why the construction of a wholesale-only national broadband network is such a fundamental shift from the market structure in telecommunications from what we have today and what the competition benefits are that will follow from this?

                    Those opposite continue to try to suggest and imply—because it suits their political agenda—that Telstra is engaging in market manipulation. The agreement announced yesterday takes us one step closer to delivering a high-speed broadband platform and the structural reform the sector needs to drive genuine competition. This is what the

                    will deliver. The agreement provides us a clear, more certain pathway to this outcome. As

                   <p class="italic">
                    From our initial examination of yesterday’s announcement, the agreement is consistent with the Federal Government’s earlier commitments of an open access network, structural separation and regulatory reform.

                    It also means less unnecessary duplication of infrastructure—something that Senator Joyce yesterday just did not seem to be able to grasp.
