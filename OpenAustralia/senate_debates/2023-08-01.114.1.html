         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart" rel="nofollow">
          Stewart

         for the question. During question time today, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         board has decided to pause interest rates, keeping the official cash rate at 4.1 per cent. This is welcome news and confirms that our efforts to get on top of the inflation challenge in our economy are starting to work.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government's primary focus is addressing the inflation challenge. Our economic plan includes targeted, responsible cost-of-living measures that won't make the job of the Reserve Bank harder than it needs to be. This includes energy rebates, cheaper child care, affordable medicines and reduced bulk-billing costs. Our Energy Price Relief Plan is delivering up to $500 in energy bill relief to five million households on their winter bills and up to $650 to a million small businesses. This not only eases the burden for families and businesses but also contributes to our fight against inflation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Treasury forecasts indicate that our energy relief package will directly will reduce inflation by three quarters of a percentage point in 2023-24.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're also repairing the budget to alleviate inflationary pressures, including returning 87 per cent of upward revenue revisions to the budget, compared to 40 per cent under our predecessors and 30 per cent under the Howard government; limiting average annual real spending growth to less than one per cent, which is seven times lower than the coalition; and making $40 billion worth of savings and reprioritisations across both budgets, compared to zero new expenditure savings measures in the coalition's last budget. The Reserve Bank governor confirmed that our budget is reducing, not adding to, inflation, telling estimates:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I don't think that the budget is adding to inflation; it's actually reducing inflation â€¦

           Sounds like the Albanese Labor government is doing an excellent job. Noting the recent budget laid the foundations for growth by embracing clean energy and invested in value-adding industries, people, skills, technology and small business, can the minister please outline how the Albanese Labor government's budget is helping to build a more robust and resilient Australian economy?

            for the supplementary. As we know, Australia is not immune to the uncertainty that we're seeing in the global economy. We know that the challenges coming at us from around the world are felt most around the kitchen tables of people around this country. But, thanks to our responsible economic management, we confront these challenges from a position of strength. More Australians are in work than ever before. The participation rate is around record highs, and the share of women in work is near its record high. Since we came to government, 498,000 Australians have found jobsâ€”the strongest jobs growth of any new government on record. While we know that slowing global growth, high inflation and high interest rates will impact our economy and our labour market over the coming 12 months, Australia is in a better position than nearly any other country to face the challenges ahead.

               for the supplementary. Thanks to responsible economic management and spending restraint that would be absolutely unrecognisable to those opposite, we are on track to post Australia's first surplus in 15 years. Perhaps Senator
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume" rel="nofollow">
                Hume
               </a>
               can get that mug out againâ€”'back in black'! We loved the little video. We might need that mug! The Treasury and the Department of Finance will finalise their figures and release them in the usual way in the final budget outcome, but I can confirm we now expect our surplus for the last financial year to be slightly north of $20 billion. We've managed to do this at the same time that we've delivered billions of dollars of responsible, targeted cost-of-living relief without adding to inflation, an important focus of our budget, and we will continue to manage the budget responsibly, meet the needs of the Australian community and ensure that we're getting our budget back on track.

                noted that almost one-third of Australian mortgageholders are at risk of mortgage stress, the highest rate in 15 years. Does the Treasurer really believe that his

It uses 50 indicators to measure how we're faring as we pursue a more healthy, secure, sustainable, cohesive and prosperous Australia. It isn't about abandoning some of those measures like

                 In terms of the data that was used, Treasury has identified the best available indicators for the framework using data from ABS, Commonwealth departments and other sources. This process hasn't been done before; this is the first iteration of a framework. I note there has been broad community and stakeholder support for broadening out the way we measure the wellbeing of our community. It has revealed some data gaps, which we will work to address as we refine and develop the framework going forward.

When measuring what matters to Australians, does the government regret leaving out of your report these key indicators of the cost of living? Yes or no?

                      reckons, on gas and electricity, where we have taken action, you opposed it. On child care, I believe you opposed that investment as well. On housing, you're blocking the future fund; you're actually blocking us making investments that will make housing more affordable for the 30,000 people that would benefit from that fund. So I'm not going to take a lecture from those opposite about any of those areas where they voted no to every investment we've tried to make.

                        Under Labor's continued cost-of-living crisis, the No. 1 indicator of Australian's wellness is getting inflation and the cost of living under control, and you said so yourself. So why is the Labor government spending its time writing out-of-date reports rather than making the hard decisions that will actually get this persistent and sticky inflation lower faster and making life easier, which is what really matters to millions of Australians?
