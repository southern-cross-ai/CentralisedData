        The Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Trade and Investment have all made productive early visits to both Japan and the Republic of Korea to reaffirm the importance of the respective trade and investment relationships and enhance economic cooperation with both these close partners in the region. In 2014 trade agreements were signed with both Korea and Japan. The Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA) entered into force on 12 December 2014 and the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement (JA

        Australia and Japan signed the Japan-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement (JAEPA) in Canberra on 8 July 2014 during Prime Minister Abe's visit to Australia. Negotiations had previously been concluded in Tokyo on 7 April 2014 during the visits of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Investment. The Australian Government prioritised the conclusion of the agreement with Japan, Australia's second-largest trading partner, but a market where agricultural exports face significant barriers. Improved agricultural market access was a key priority in the negotiations and the EPA will deliver outcomes across a range of sectors, including on Australian beef, Australia's largest agricultural export to Japan. JAEPA entered into force on 15 January 2015.

        The Australian Government is committed to supporting languages education in Australian schools and recognises the importance of young people learning a language, including Asian languages. State, territory and non-government education authorities have the primary responsibility in following this pathway as they have responsibility for the registration and employment of teachers in their jurisdictions. The Australian Government has committed to a series of measures to revive the teaching of languages in Australia, including Japanese, and increasing the numbers of language teachers. This includes working with Teach for Australia to actively recruit specialist language teachers. In addition, the Government's Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group recommended that higher education providers equip all primary pre-service teachers with at least one subject specialisation, prioritising languages other than English, mathematics and science. Additionally, the Australian Government's New Colombo Plan will utilise education to facilitate improved cross-cultural links between Australia and Japan. It aims to lift knowledge of the

        In addition, the benefits of coordination across governments and industries are being pursued through a 'Team Australia' approach to market access and trade development.

The task group is supporting a more collaborative and team approach between governments, and ultimately industries, to enhance the effectiveness of market access and trade development efforts on behalf of Australia's agricultural sector. The Department of Agriculture has also held a number of roundtable meetings with industries, rural research and development corporations (

        Our relationship with the Republic of Korea is one of Australia's five principal relationships in Asia. The Government has demonstrated its firm commitment to strengthening the growing relationship, through regular high-level contacts with their Korean counterparts by Australian Government ministers including the Prime Minister, the

        and the Trade and Investment Minister. In addition to the signature of the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement during the Prime Minister's April 2014 visit, a new security focused vision statement was adopted. This vision statement reflects our growing security links, and Australia's status as the only country apart from the

         AKF
        </a>
        ) of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, led by an independent board, seeks to deepen bilateral engagement, beyond the strong and complementary trade relationship, through supporting a wide range of people-to-people initiatives. This includes cultural, sporting and academic pursuits, along with business and community exchanges. This soft power engagement complements Australia's diplomatic and economic engagement and strengthens Australia's ability to positively influence other countries. Supporting our most attractive assets - our people and their passion and dedication to culture, education and sports - builds trust at personal levels and enhances Australia's reputation. The AKF's 2014-15 priority areas were Korean language and literacy, science innovation, and sports diplomacy. Grants supported recently include: the Australia-Korea Internship Program; the Korea Research Institute (to convene Korean language teaching expertise); media internships; journalist exchanges; Korea Day at

        In 2013-14, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade worked with all levels of government, business, institutions and community groups to develop a comprehensive country strategy to broaden and deepen engagement with the Republic of Korea. This work has better identified whole-of-Australia objectives and priorities for the relationship.

        The Department of Industry and Science administered the Enterprise Connect Program which worked to build the capability and competiveness of Australia's SME cohort, supporting them to better capitalise on potential export opportunities in Asia afforded through relevant trade agreements. Enterprise Connect worked closely with Austrade to ensure SMEs could access services, such as the Tailored Advisory Service, that assisted in the development of international business opportunities.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Program" rel="nofollow">

        Enterprise Connect was replaced with the Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme as the Australian Government's flagship initiative for business competitiveness and productivity at the firm level. It forms part of the new industry policy outlined in the Industry Innovation and Competitiveness Agenda. With a national network of more than 100 experienced private sector advisers, the Programme offers support to businesses for business management, research collaboration and accelerating commercialisation. The primary focus is on providing access to the best advice and networks to solve their problems rather than focusing on financial assistance.

        Austrade awarded a Business Engagement Plan grant to the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Korea (AustCham) in June 2013. AustCham plans to strengthen Australian small and medium business connections with government and industry in Korea via an internship program.

The SSPF is a high-level business-led bilateral dialogue that enables sectoral peak-bodies - initially in the legal, financial and creative services (smart cities and audio-visual) - to discuss challenges and opportunities offered under KAFTA. Over 40 top representatives from the Australian and Republic of Korea services sectors attended the inaugural meeting. This was arranged in conjunction with the Federation of Korean Industries, the Australia-Korea Business Council, AustCham in the
