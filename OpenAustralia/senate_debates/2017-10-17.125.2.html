        In the 2017 Budget, the Government committed to implementing reforms to the credit card market as outlined in the Government's response to the Senate Inquiry into the credit card market (consultation paper released in May 2016). These reforms will improve consumer outcomes in the credit card market, assist consumers to better manage their credit card debts and foster competition in the credit card market. The Government has committed to legislating these reforms by the end of 2017 in order for consumers to benefit from these reforms as soon as possible and to give credit card providers a period of time in which to prepare for the changes.

       <p class="italic">
        Passage of the legislation is also urgent to give the CERI the certainty it needs to fundraise successfully.

       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This key Budget measure implements an integrity measure to address concerns that some taxpayers are claiming expenses without correctly apportioning costs, or have claimed travel costs that were for private purposes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The tax system currently creates opportunities for plant and equipment to be depreciated by multiple owners of a property well in excess of its actual value. Excessive depreciation is enabled because the tax system allows asset values to be easily overstated or reset. This measure seeks to correct this by reflecting the value of existing plant and equipment as part of the capital expenditure incurred by the investor to purchase the residential property. The measure also seeks to preserve depreciation deductions where a direct outlay is made by a property investor for plant and equipment, or where the situation closely reflects such a scenario (such as where an investor purchases a new build or a substantially renovated home).
