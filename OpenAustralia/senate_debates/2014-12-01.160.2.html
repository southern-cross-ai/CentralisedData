        I rise to make a contribution in this debate. I would like to start as I finished off in taking note. This minister ought to talk the plank. He ought to go off the plank—deep six himself—because of these reasons. At the moment, shipbuilding and submarines are approximately 3,000 direct jobs in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. The point of order is relevance. The bill that is before the Senate is the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring 2014) Bill 2014, and Senator Gallacher is not talking to any of the repeal provisions of the bill.

           There have been no amendments to that effect moved. I also point out that this is actually a repeal bill. This is not a bill that is seeking to insert new things into the statute books; this is seeking to take things off the statue books. But, putting that aside, no amendment has been moved.

             Order! I have just taken some advice from the clerk. The amendment has not yet been moved, so we are still on the second reading debate. At this stage there is no amendment before the Senate, so I would ask that you speak to the substance of the bill which is before the Senate. There will be the opportunity to speak to the amendments once they are moved, and people are free to move those amendments, but at this stage we are talking about the second reading of the omnibus repeal bill.

              On this issue: it is quite clear in my view that what is seeking to be done here is to ensure that the omnibus repeal bill is amended. That is what is being proposed. I understand there is no amendment before the Senate, but it is entirely proper for Senator Gallacher to pre-empt this amendment. It is not improper at all. He can speak on that issue.

               On the point of order I have taken advice from the clerk. There is no question in relation to that amendment before the Senate. As I pointed out and as you have foreshadowed, any senator is free to move such an amendment, at which time that can be addressed, but at this stage no such question is actually before the Senate.

I hope that might be of assistance to Senator Gallacher.

                     I'm telling you again!—Prime Minister and Cabinet, social services, Treasury and the Veterans' Affairs portfolio. This bill is one of the three that form part of the government's spring repeal day package. The deregulatory savings in this bill are calculated at $1,000,335,000. This bill does not contain some of the government's deregulatory measures that were outlined in the prime ministerial statement or some that have been made in the media—for example, the requirement to put mudflaps on motorbikes. That is really important! That's got to be in front of submarines in Adelaide, hasn't it! It changes the occupational health and safety requirements for government building sites. There was a worker killed in Adelaide the other day, and your answer is to change the occupational health and safety standards.

                     are among the deregulatory measures contained in this bill. Examples of the measures in this bill range from and include the repeal of an act in the Immigration and Border Protection portfolio related to a particular tariff decision between 1996 and 1999 which is no longer relevant. We cannot talk about submarines but we can talk about something that happened between 1996 and 1999. Repealing the Patents Amendment (

                     1952: this amending act was spent once an amendment passed into law. And there is abolishing several bodies including the Fishing Industry Policy Council, the Oil Stewardship Advisory Council and the Product Stewardship Advisory Group.

                     Whilst the majority of the measures in this bill are not contentious and have no deregulatory savings attached, there are some concerns with some of the measures in the Environment portfolio, including reducing details to be specified in an import or export permit for hazardous waste. Amendments may be moved in the Senate after an inquiry and after stakeholder consultation has been undertaken to determine whether there are negative consequences in any of the repeals where, if our amendments fails in the Senate, details of the amendments and repeals of each portfolio are attached at attachment A.

                         Senator Heffernan, regarding the mudflaps: for example, ending the requirement to put mudflaps on motorbikes. This is what the omnibus repeal legislation is doing. It is going to put mudflaps on motorbikes! But seriously, it will abolish the Fishing Industry Policy Council. The council has not been convened since the enabling legislation of the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 commenced. Functions and consultations that the council was to provide are being fulfilled by other working groups and bodies.

This includes ADF and government employees such as

                                         ; the industry employs about 14,500. These are old figures. They are from 2011-12. We are currently producing more economic data on these ancillary jobs, which are a direct benefit to the economy of South Australia. So that is: 3,000 direct and 27,000 across the board—any diminution of confidence in our state defence manufacturing sector can have a really deleterious effect on the economy of South Australia.

'And if he can't, his position is untenable.' Marshall said he would be talking to Prime Minister Abbott today about the comments. 'The comments made in the parliament yesterday by the minister were nothing short of deplorable. We completely reject the comments that were made.' That was from InDaily, 26 November 2014.

                                          Mr Acting Deputy President Seselja, I rise on a point of order. I seek your guidance. Just as I am looking at the title of the Omnibus Repeal Day (Spring) 2014 Bill 2014, it describes it as 'a bill for an act to repeal certain acts and provisions of acts'. It would seem that there is an inherent inconsistency with the purpose and objectives of the act and that which has been foreshadowed by those opposite in relation to substantive amendments.

He said the overseas experience showed it was not abnormal to have cost overruns and that such blowouts were worse at other sites around the world.

                                            The other side is fond of claiming that the Labor government did nothing. The Labor government provided over $200 million for detailed studies and analysis to inform the government's decision on the design of Australia's next submarine. About $80 million has been spent. This led to the decision in May 2013 to stop investigation of military off-the-shelf designs and focused on progressing two options: an evolved Collins and a new design. This research also informed our decision to use the

                                            What we have really got here is a critical case of neglect in South Australia. We need a manufacturing base and this decision will affect South Australia for generations if we do not make the right decision here. What is wrong with a full competitive tender? What is wrong with a full, open, transparent competitive tender? What is wrong with releasing the Winter report? Why is the government withholding critical information? Why are they not going ahead with what is a truly common-sense approach to this?

We are talking about a project where Australia will rely on a critical Defence component—that is, submarines. There is no dispute that we need submarines. The only dispute is that lot opposite want to buy them off the shelf and we on this side want to design them and build them using a fully competent trained workforce in
