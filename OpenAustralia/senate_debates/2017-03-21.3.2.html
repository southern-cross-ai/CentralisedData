          The Minister must, within 6 months after the commencement of this section, make a legislative instrument requiring internet service providers to block access to illegal overseas gambling websites.
         </p>
         <p>
          I excised this amendment because of a request from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Greens
          </a>
          , and I respect that request. This amendment says that the minister must within six months after the commencement of this section make a legislative instrument requiring internet service providers to block access to illegal overseas gambling websites. This is something that I know is contentious, but if you want this to work it can work.
         </p>
         <p>
          We know from just one company, Netsweeper of Canada, that I met with and that have given submissions to inquiries in relation to this that you can have internet content filtering categorisation, web threat management solutions and services that allow organisations to manage internet access and activity. This can be used for gambling. This can be used to ensure that these illegal overseas online gambling sites cannot be easily accessed. Netsweeper is not 100 per cent perfect, but my understanding is that it ends up filtering well over 95 per cent of these sites. It makes it very difficult for these sites to be accessed. We know from the Australian Bankers Association that they can track the merchant numbers, or they have a pretty good idea of what the merchant numbers are, of these unauthorised online casinos. We do not know exactly how much is lost to these casinos, but it is in the hundreds of millions of dollars. If we are going to be fair dinkum about tackling illegal online casinos this is the way to do it. This has merit and will be effective.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is enough of a battle to deal with the legal online bookmakers here in Australia, with sports betting and the damage that causes, but it is really the wild west when it comes to these unauthorised online casinos from overseas. I have had constituents and Senator Kakoschke-Moore has worked with constituents who have been devastated by losses to companies that are based in Malta, Gibraltar or the Caribbean. I commend this amendment as a means of requiring the government to seriously tackle this by ensuring that we use available technologies to block these sites.

          </p>
          <p>
           It is the view of the Nick Xenophon Team that the bill as it is currently drafted will increase the opportunities for in-play betting in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAB" rel="nofollow">
            TAB
           </a>
           s, clubs and licensed premises. This goes against the intention of the government's bill. Indeed, the Department of Communications and the Arts admitted that the definition of electronic equipment within the bill could include smartphones and tablets. They also admitted that they have done no analysis or modelling of whether this will increase the effects of problem gambling.
          </p>
          <p>
           Consequently, the amendments on sheet 8046 narrow the definition of electronic equipment and make it clear that electronic equipment will instead be defined as an electronic betting terminal which is installed on a permanent or fixed basis at a place where gambling services are provided, is unable to be connected to the internet in a designated supervised area and is available for the use only of customers using cash or a card issued by the provider.
          </p>

           This definition will limit in-play betting to electronic betting terminals to ensure that gambling operators do not seek to expand their operations by allowing people to place in-play bets using tablets or smartphones provided by the venue. These terminals are permanent installations located in a specific area set aside for gambling and are unable to be connected to the internet. We put that if the government is sincere in its intent to clamp down on in-play sports betting it should not be enabling venues to hand out tablets and smartphones to its customers. Therefore, we encourage the Senate to support the amendments on sheet 8046, which will put a stop to this harmful practice.

            Labor is well and truly on the record for raising concerns about terminals in licensed venues. As I have already stated, we do not want to see and do not support a proliferation of mobile devices. Minister Tudge, in the other place, has already said that he will act if there is a proliferation, and Labor expects the government to maintain the status quo. We are not supporting the amendment, on this occasion, but I just wanted to put on the record, again, that we have raised concerns about this issue and I indicate, clearly, to the government that Labor does not expect to see a proliferation of mobile devices, given the minister's comments.

             I am grateful to the fact that the opposition have the courtesy to respond to it. I do not agree with the argument and think it is a weak one, respectfully, but could the minister at least humour us and give a response to this amendment? You did not on the previous amendments, but this is a pretty discrete amendment. It goes to the heart of this bill about in-play betting and whether it can be circumvented. This amendment, moved by my colleague Senator Kakoschke-Moore, seeks to obviate that. Can the minister give us the government's position on this amendment and any undertakings that if there is a proliferation of tablets, smartphone devices, the government will monitor it and act accordingly?

              Thank you, Senator Xenophon. We did canvass these matters extensively last night, your contributions, and those of Senator Kakoschke-Moore, in relation to these amendments and the previous ones and I responded to those, at length, last night. As the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I have the practice of avoiding repeating myself, where I can, to ensure that legislation is passed efficiently. But let me restate that this legislation is not seeking to create a new situation. This legislation is, simply, seeking comment, with place based betting, to maintain the status quo. As I indicated last night, this is something that we will monitor.

               If these amendments are passed, the person who is licensed to provide an online casino-style poker or blackjack services under a law of the state or territory would face no criminal or civil penalty under Commonwealth law. This would only be a first step towards legalising online casino-style poker and blackjack services. State and territory licensing would still be required, but it is a necessary step.
              </p>
              <p>
               Despite the current prohibition in the existing law, online poker and blackjack are enjoyed by many Australians. They are entertaining games of chance and considerable skill. And despite the current lack of regulationâ€”or, should I say, loophole of regulation?â€”there is no evidence that online poker and blackjack causes more harm than the other services this bill seeks to regulate rather than prohibit, like online sports betting. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

                As I indicated in my second reading contribution, the government believes that online poker poses a risk to problem gambling in Australia and it will maintain the prohibition of these services under the Interactive Gambling Act. The act creates an offence of providing or advertising interactive gambling services to customers in Australia, prohibiting gambling servicesâ€”including online casino-style gaming services, including online pokerâ€”which are played for money or anything else of value. The intent of the act is to minimise the scope of gambling in Australia.
               </p>
               <p>
                The government was clear in its response to the illegal offshore wagering review that it will not expand the online betting market in Australia. This bill will maintain the status quo and uphold the original intent of the Interactive Gambling Act. Online poker will, therefore, remain a prohibited interactive gambling service.

                <p>
                 Senator Leyonhjelm has obviously thought through this amendment and it would be disrespectful not to respond to it.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I and my colleagues do not support this amendment for a number of reasons. There is an ambiguity as to how it would operate and as to what the betting limits would be. I have met with poker machine players who like playing online poker, and they have made the point that sometimes you pay $50 and it will last you for a number of hours, which is very different from sports betting services where you can lose thousands of dollars with just one bet. Their argument is that there is an inconsistency in the current law that allows sports betting where enormous amounts of money can be lost; whereas, if online poker were regulated with very small bet limits, it would not be as harmful as sports betting. I am not canvassing and I am not commenting on those remarks as such. But, in the context of this debate, whilst I do not want to see any expansion of online gambling, there does seem to be a dichotomy between poker players, who have described to me that they can bet 1c at a time and lose very small amounts of money in the scheme of things, and sports betting. Senator Leyonhjelm has raised an important issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The paradox may be that if there were very low bet limits, and I am talking very low bet limits as a number of cents compared to dollars or multiples of dollars, the impact would be smaller than sports betting as it currently exists. It is a matter that the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                  Productivity Commission
                 </a>
                 raised in its reports on gambling. I think there will still be an ongoing debate on this, and I understand the point of online poker players who say that there is a dichotomy between a game where $50 will keep you playing all day compared to being able to lose literally tens of thousands of dollars at a time with sports betting. This is something that will need to be debated. I do not want to be seen to be encouraging an expansion of gambling, but there is an inconsistency in the approach of the government and opposition to sports betting, where you can bet thousands of dollars at a time per game or per sporting eventâ€”per horse raceâ€”compared to online poker, where there could be some very strict limits as to what could be bet. It is something that needs to be debated further.

                  I am glad Senator Xenophon made the distinction between poker machines and poker. It is an important one. I do support the amendment from Senator Leyonhjelm. I have had a number of emails, text messages and tweets about this saying, 'I am a poker player. I am a hobby poker player. I enjoy it. I have fun. Please don't throw out the baby with the bathwater. Please don't include this.' If you will support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendment, I am happy to support the bill.

                   In the same way, I have respect for Senator Leyonhjelm with regard to the amendment he has put forward. With regard to these matters, the Senate standing committee's report indicates in its closing section at 2.62:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   Whether particular services should no longer be restricted under the IGA is a separate question that this committee was not asked to consider as part of this inquiry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That is one important point that should be made here in the course of the debate. We do also need to put on the record that the purpose of this particular piece of legislation is to act in a harm minimisation way as a preventative to the adverse outcomes of gambling in our community. I make that point by way of contribution to the debate this afternoon.

                    I want to add a few additional comments to put this into context. There is a very active poker community in Australia. They like to play poker. They like to win. There are tournaments. They make money. Some people lose money. Some of them have high stakes, and they can lose a lot of money at once, but mostly it is pretty small beer. That is not, essentially, regulated very much at all. That occurs in pubs and clubs where people gather, and if you are interested in playing poker competitively, there are no shortage of opportunities. What we are doing here is saying, 'You can't do that online. You can't play poker online with the same sort of people.' The risks are the sameâ€”you can lose small amounts of money or large amounts of moneyâ€”and you bet what you choose. Yet, we are saying, 'No you're not allowed to do that online. You're only allowed to do it face-to-face.' It a little bit like saying to Australians, 'You're allowed to talk to each other by telephone, but you are not allowed to talk to each other by FaceTime, because FaceTime goes via a server in another country.' I am sure most of you know what FaceTime is. It is that method within Facebook of talking to each other external to the telephone system. What we are basically saying here is that one kind of playing poker is okay, but another kind of playing poker is not okay because it is online. Seriously! This is the 21st century. Almost everything is online these days, and to pretend that we can regulate so that you can do one but not the other is dreaming. I think it is very bad legislation. We really should not entertain it.

                     My amendments are about a service related to betting on the outcome of a lottery. We have a foreign investor in Australia by the name of Lottoland, who bought a licence in the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                      Northern Territory
                     </a>
                     for $550,000. They are actually allowing people to bet on the outcome of a lottery anywhere in the world. They pay no tax. They are here in Australia. They do not employ a lot of people; they employ about six people. They are providing a service that is detrimental to 4Â½ thousand newsagents around this country who rely on lottery tickets being sold and who are struggling. So here we have a foreign company in Australia, possibly taking hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions of dollars, out of the country in unpaid taxes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I also raised this in light of the government moving a bill in this house to address multinationals not paying their taxes in Australia. I think this has been on the table since almost 20 years ago when, I can remember, I raised the topic of multinationals not paying their taxes in Australia. This would be a good reason for the government to support my amendment to shut down one foreign multinational company working here in Australia and to stop the demise of 4Â½ thousand newsagents who are losing business because of this. If they are fair dinkum about clamping down on multinationals in Australiaâ€”in this case not employing a lot of Australiansâ€”taking money out of the country by not paying taxes here, then I expect the government and the opposition to support my amendments.

                      's amendments. I think my colleagues would appreciate that, under the law as it is, Lottoland is not illegal, and I think that is the point of Senator Hanson's amendments. Lottoland is also not offshore. It is a licensed service in the

                      , and the proposition here is beyond the scope of this bill. As Senator Hanson and One Nation have put this proposition here, the government will examine it, but it is important, with the proposed changes, that there be consultation. So it is not possible for the government to support these amendments in the context of this bill, but, as One Nation have asked that we examine this, we are happy to do so.

                       I indicate very briefly that I and my colleague strongly support these amendments. If the government does not support them, I genuinely suggest Senator Hanson put up a private senator's bill. I would co-sponsor it. The sooner we get onto it, the better. We need to bring this to a head. This is a loophole under current laws. It is beyond me that the

                       </a>
                       regulator actually allows this to be licensed. I believe it is a sneaky and tricky form of gambling that effectively allows more people to get sucked in or roped in and become gambling addicts, because this service promises huge returns, but the odds are even huger. I think it is very problematic in terms of it being offered as a service. It also has a real impact on state-based lotteries. Whatever problems you have with those, at least you know that the revenue is staying here in the Commonwealth rather than going off overseas.

                         I am pleased that the government has recognised the merit of these amendments so far as the tax is concerned and so far as it will be considered. I will just add some weight to that because the evasion of tax by foreign entities is something that has not been addressed since 1953. It is something that we must, must get on top of because of our debt situation in this country and the unfairness of our tax system. It needs to be a part of the considered and comprehensive review of our tax system.
