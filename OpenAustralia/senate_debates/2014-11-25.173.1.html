        Today our Senate Select Committee into the Abbott Government's Budgets Cuts heard from an organisation called Reclink Australia. Reclink Australia was one of the organisations behind the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choir_of_Hard_Knocks" rel="nofollow">
         Choir of Hard Knocks
        </a>
        , a choir made up of people in our community who are homeless and have complex needs, including mental health issues.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        filmed this choir as it got together, rehearsed and began to sing, ultimately doing public performances and producing a CD. There are some beautiful songs on that CD. It is one of the prides of my collection. The documentary was riveting and the choir's singing was truly beautiful. What we learnt today is a tragedy. The committee heard that the Abbott government wrecking ball has hit this vital community support program and cut its funding from 1 July this year. Reclink Australia receives very little funding from the federal government. In fact, you could say it is small change in a federal budget context, just $560,000—half a million dollars—per year. But, without any warning—no reviews, no analysis, no inquiry—Reclink Australia lost its funding on 1 July 2014, and the shame of it is that I doubt the Abbott government really know what they have lost.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reclink Australia—from their annual report—aims to enhance the lives of people experiencing disadvantage or facing significant barriers to participation, through providing new and unique sports and arts opportunities and specialist recreation programs. Reclink Australia targets some of the country's most vulnerable and isolated people: at-risk youth, those experiencing mental illness, people with disability, the homeless, people tackling alcohol and other drug issues and social and economic hardship. Reclink works in partnership with over 380 community, government and private organisations. Reclink's mission is to 'Respond, rebuild, reconnect'. It seeks to give all participants the power of purpose. In the last financial year, Reclink delivered over 115,000 sport, recreation and arts participation opportunities. Its benefit to individuals is immeasurable, and I urge senators to read its annual report, which is full of stories about recovery—personal stories about reconnecting and, ultimately, wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today at our Senate select committee we heard evidence from Brian, who bravely told his story. Brian had drug and alcohol issues and said that, at 35, his life was washed up—he had wrecked his life. Brian was attending the 12 steps program when he was invited to attend a football game where the Salvo Hawks were playing. Brian told the committee that recovery is tough, particularly when you are doing it on your own. He ended up umpiring the first time he went to footy. He liked that because he earnt some money, and he liked that because he was broke. But Brian said the Salvo Hawks had players who were just like him, who had had or were working on demons in their lives. There was no pretence. Brian told the committee that there was too much of a gap for him to join any other club, as his self-esteem was low. Brian went back partly because he got paid to umpire but also because it gave him a purpose, one day a week, doing a good job. As Brian said: 'I was one of them. I knew it was possible, and I was feeling better. Reclink provided me with a purpose. Failure was not an option anymore. I had many people supporting me.' And Brian proved to himself he could do the tough stuff. Brian went on to compete in the Hawaii marathon, one of the toughest things he has ever done. And he continues today to train and participate in marathons. He has worked and continues to work with the disadvantaged in our community and now works for Reclink.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reclink Australia is modelled on the very successful, long-running Victorian program. This program has been running for 24 years.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cullen" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Cullen
        </a>
        , the founder and former president, told the committee that there is a lot in welfare that stops people drowning but does not teach them to swim. Reclink Australia bridges that gap. Mr Cullen said that Reclink stopped people falling deeper and deeper into isolation. He said that Reclink can reach people that others cannot. Brian told the committee of a participant who told him he had been contemplating suicide early one morning but knew that the bus was coming to pick him up at around 11 am and that the game he was going to play was something to look forward to. And, of course, after training and being with others, this gentleman was on a high and safe again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reclink is one of a number of organisations which have been cut by the Abbott government. There are other programs which will not have the funds to continue—good programs, life-saving programs, programs that connect to the most disadvantaged in our community. You would think that a caring government would not cut these organisations, but we have seen, time and time again in this place, that the Abbott government does not care. It cuts and cuts and cuts, simply for the sake of it. As I said earlier, I doubt the Abbott government really understands what it cut when it cut the funding to Reclink. Youth Connections is one organisation, like Reclink, which, without warning, has had its funding chopped.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Come_December" rel="nofollow">
         Come December
        </a>
        , the Youth Connections programs right across Australia will cease to exist. This is a travesty. These are inexpensive programs to run and they have a massive success rate—over 80 per cent successful participation by young people back into education or employment. This is not an organisation to cut. Like Reclink, it bridges the gap. There is a gap out there, and these programs are meeting a need.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we heard Brian's heartfelt story today it was truly amazing. You could see the opportunity that Reclink gave him to restart his life. Yet we have just seen the Abbott government slash this program. There was some consultation with them. They were told: 'We are not sure where you fit: whether you fit in mental health, or here or there.' But that is not a reason to cut a program. There was no review, analysis or consultation. They were simply advised that come 1 July they would not be getting their funding of just over $½ million any more.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why would you cut a program like that that is working and providing opportunity and purpose? We hear from the Abbott government day in and day out about purpose. Clearly Reclink is a program that provides purpose. Nevertheless, it has been on the chopping block and lost its funding. It is time for the Abbott government to start to see sense about it is harsh, cruel budget. In fact, it is long overdue for the Abbott government to reconsider its harsh, cruel measures. We have seen many of these measures fail to get through the Senate. It is time for the Abbott government to reflect on the sorts of budget cuts it has put in place. It is time for the Abbott government to realise and own up that it made a mistake with Youth Connections and that it made a mistake with Reclink. These are not expensive programs. They fill a real need in our communities. They give real purpose to those who have lost their way. Nothing will replace them once they go. That is the crime. When December comes and Youth Connections loses its funding there will be nothing there. It is simply not true that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Services_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Job Services Australia
        </a>
        can fulfil this need. It cannot.
       </p>
       <p>
        These programs are worthy of funding. It is time for the Abbott government to face up to the fact that its harsh, cruel budget has gone too far. It should immediately reconsider funding Reclink—it is $½ million a year—and to re-fund Youth Connections.
