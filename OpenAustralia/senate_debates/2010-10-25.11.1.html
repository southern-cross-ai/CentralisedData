          My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Carr.

          n Labor Premier Mike Rann says that he found out just one hour before the public announcement about the Gillard government’s decision to house 400 asylum seekers at Inverbrackie in South Australia. Why didn’t the Gillard government consult with the Adelaide community prior to this decision being made? Isn’t this just more of faceless Labor men sitting in Canberra issuing edicts for government and treating local communities with contempt?

The decision was actually made on 18 October and it was difficult to consult about a decision that was not actually made prior to that date.

                          the day before this decision was announced. Minister Bowen says the Prime Minister did not tell the local community when she was there that it would take 400 asylum seekers because ‘the cabinet had not made a decision when the Prime Minister was there’. Wasn’t the Prime Minister aware that a decision was imminent the day before it was announced, when she was there? Or was the decision made for her—

                           The senator is quite correct in saying that the Prime Minister was present in the Inverbrackie area the day before the decision was announced. It is not the custom and practice of governments of any description to announce decisions of cabinet before they are actually made. Of course, the matter could not be raised because it was to be discussed by the cabinet. We have a simple proposition here that I suggest senators opposite give some thought to. This is an important element of our approach to this country’s international obligations to properly house people who come to these shores. We are providing proper facilities in a proper manner and consulting with the local communities about the way in which—

This takes to a total of 110 the number of boats to arrive in Australian waters in 2010 and the total number of people on board to 5,523. When will the government admit that another boat is another policy failure?
