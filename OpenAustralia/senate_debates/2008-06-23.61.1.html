        ’s cooperative legislative regime will apply the National Gas Law and National Gas Rules in all participating jurisdictions to create a harmonised national gas access regime.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This cooperative regime involves the enactment of lead legislation in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n Parliament, and the enactment of “application legislation” in all other participating jurisdictions (with the exception of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        ). Western Australia will pass complementary legislation to give effect to the National Gas Law, rather than applying the National Gas Law established by

         South Australian

        will be asked to enact the lead legislation for the regime, the
        <i>

        </i>
        in the first half of this year. The National Gas Law will be the Schedule to that Act.

         The Commonwealth

          Market
         </a>
         Act 2004
        </i>
        . This Act was amended in 2007 to apply the National Gas Law in the Commonwealth’s offshore jurisdiction. However, the South Australian lead legislation implementing the National Gas Law and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        complementary legislation will be passed in 2008 rather than 2007.  This delay has allowed the inclusion of a gas market
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_Board" rel="nofollow">
         Bulletin Board
        </a>
        in the regime to increase transparency in our gas markets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Similarly, the Commonwealth amended the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Practices_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Trade Practices Act
         </a>
         1974
        </i>
        in 2007 to empower several Commonwealth bodies (the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Regulator" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Energy Regulator
        </a>
        , National Competition Council and Australian Competition Tribunal) to perform key functions under the gas access regime andthe

         Administrative Decisions (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Review" rel="nofollow">
          Judicial Review
         </a>
         ) Act 1977
        </i>
        to ensure the decisions of Commonwealth bodies under the regime are reviewable under that Act. The references in those Acts also need to be amended.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Therefore, this Bill makes minor amendments to the
        <i>
         Australian Energy Market Act 2004,
        </i>
        the
        <i>
         Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Trade Practices Act 1974
        </i>
        to correct references to the South Australian lead legislation and to the Western Australia’s complementary legislation.  These amendments are required to ensure that the Commonwealth’s application legislation correctly applies South Australian and Western Australian legislation in the offshore area, and correctly empowers the Commonwealth bodies under the regime.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In summary, the amendments I am introducing today are minor technical amendments to further the smooth implementation of the cooperative energy reform agenda. This Bill has the full support of my State and Territory colleagues on the Ministerial Council on Energy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend this Bill to the Senate.
