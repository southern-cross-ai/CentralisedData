         I think other parties in the chamber last night stated their position on this amendment. The opposition opposes this amendment. We think that, in attempting to further define the definition of equivalence, as the Greens are seeking to do, they will end up potentially limiting the definition of equivalence. We think the definition as stated in the bill is an appropriate definition and we will not be supporting this amendment.

          I move amendment (16) on sheet 7005 revised:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (16)  Schedule 1, item 31, page 59 (after line 7), at the end of clause 74, add:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (ca)    the principle that Telstra’s wholesale/network business unit should have discrete branding and identity to that of its retail business units;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (cb)    the principle that Telstra’s management and personnel should be strictly separated between:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (i)    its wholesale/network business unit; and
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (ii)    its retail business units;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          and that remuneration should be tied to business unit performance, not group performance;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (cc)    the principle that Telstra should maintain strict information barriers between:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (i)    its wholesale/network business unit; and
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (ii)    its retail business units;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          and that Telstra’s retail business units and its wholesale customers should interact with Telstra’s wholesale/network business units using the same information systems;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (ce)    the principle that Telstra should maintain separate financial accounting between:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (i)    its wholesale/network business unit; and
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (ii)    its retail business units;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (2)    In determining the principle of equivalence covered by paragraph (1)(a), regard must be had to whether:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (a)    the terms and conditions relating to price or a method of ascertaining price; and
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (b)    other terms and conditions;
         </p>
         <p>
          on which Telstra supplies regulated services to its wholesale customers are no less favourable than the terms and conditions on which Telstra supplies those services to its retail business units.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (3)    Subclause (2) does not limit the matters to which regard may be had.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (4)    Disregard subclause (2) for the purposes of subsections 577A(2) and (3).
         </p>
         <p>
          This amendment relates to the functional separation principles. It requires that there be separate branding and identity between Telstra’s wholesale network business and its retail business unit. This amendment further specifies that there be strict separation between their information sharing, financial accounting and personnel. This is to ensure that there is a distinct and identifiable difference between the two entities. This amendment also provides that, in determining the principles of equivalence, which we discussed earlier today and last night, regard must be had to the terms and conditions and methods of ascertaining prices to ensure that what Telstra wholesale supplies to its wholesale customers is no less favourable than the terms and conditions applied to the Telstra retail unit. I emphasise that this amendment relates to the issue of functional separation. I said previously that functional separation would be a poor second cousin to structural separation, but it enhances those principles in terms of equivalence, pricing, accountability and ensuring that the separation is as strict as possible if it is a functional separation. I know that the government is likely to support some but not all of this amendment. I will wait to hear the government’s position in relation to this amendment—and, of course, the positions of my colleagues in the opposition and on the crossbench.

           The government is broadly supportive of this amendment but we do not support paragraphs (ca) to (ce). If functional separation is required by Telstra then these are the types of matters that will be addressed in the minister’s functional separation requirements determined under clause 75 in the bill. Such an instrument will be able to be drafted in a way which avoids technical problems which we believe Senator Xenophon’s amendment brings about. I seek leave to move government amendments (1) and (2) to Senator Xenophon’s amendment (16) on sheet 7005 revised.

            The opposition will not be supporting Senator Xenophon’s amendments. We do not believe they add to the bill’s workability or to how it will function. There is also the fact that the government is seeking to excise a large swathe from the amendment and simply again leave behind parts, similar to those we have discussed previously, that may add to the process undertaken but do not add to the strength of conditions upon the minister or the government. Therefore we do not see that it is worthwhile supporting this amendment; it will not give a meaningful enhancement to the bill. And, as mentioned, the government itself is choosing to excise a large part of what Senator Xenophon is proposing.

              I move amendment (18) on revised sheet 7005 standing in my name:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              (18)  Schedule 1, item 31, page 59 (after line 21), after subclause 75(4), insert:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              (4A)    Before making or varying a functional separation requirements determination, the Minister must:

             <p class="italic">
              (c)    consider any submissions received within the 14-day period mentioned in paragraph (a); and
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              (d)    ask the ACCC to give advice to the Minister, within 28 days after the publication of the notice, about the determination or variation; and
             </p>
             <p class="italic">

             <p>
              I have withdrawn amendment (17), but I am persisting with amendment (18). This amendment requires that, before the minister makes the functional separation requirements determination, the minister must publish the draft determination on the department’s website and call for submissions to be made within 14 days. Again, it is similar to other amendments—it is about greater transparency; it is about the process of allowing for input to the determination.

               will be supporting Senator Xenophon’s amendment (18). It is quite consistent with a number of the amendments that we have moved and carried, providing these windows for transparency part of the way through the process that I think will provide other participants in the market, and indeed the general public, with an important idea of how the process is rolling out.

                The government is supporting Senator Xenophon’s amendment (18). This amendment requires the minister, before making or varying a functional separation requirements determination, to publish the determination or variation and to undertake a public consultation process about the determination or variation for a period of 14 days. The minister is also required to ask the

                to give advice within 28 days after the publication of the determination or variation. This amendment addresses concerns raised by the Competitive Carriers’ Coalition and

                  I move amendment (19) on sheet 7005 standing in my name:

                 <p class="italic">
                  (19)  Schedule 1, item 31, page 70 (after line 17), at the end of Part 9, add:

                 <p class="italic">
                  (3)    In addition to the Federal Court’s powers under subsection (2), the court:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  (a)    has power, for the purpose of securing compliance with any other order made under this section, to make an order directing any person to do or refrain from doing a specified act; and

                 <p class="italic">
                  (b)    has power to make an order containing such ancillary or consequential provisions as the court thinks just.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  (4)    The Federal Court may, before making an order under this section, direct that notice of the application be given to such persons as it thinks fit or be published in such manner as it thinks fit, or both.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  (5)    The Federal Court may, by order, rescind, vary or discharge an order made by it under this section or suspend the operation of such an order.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  This relates to the enforcement of functional separation undertakings. This amendment inserts an enforcement of undertakings provision into the functional separation undertakings. If the ACCC determines not to take any breaches of the undertaking to court, it must publish its reasons. That is the basis of it. I think it is important that, if there will not be an enforcement for an apparent breach, we need to know why.

                   , after careful consideration, will not be supporting Senator Xenophon’s amendment (19). It appears as drafted to introduce an obligation upon the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                    ACCC
                   </a>
                   to take action in the Federal Court if Telstra breaches functional separation undertakings or principles. It goes a step further than the way the system would function with regard to structural separation, where the ACCC may take action. My reading—unless Senator Xenophon wants to correct me—is that this amendment would actually compel the ACCC to go after Telstra in court, even in the event of a fairly minor or accidental breach of the undertaking. We would prefer that that power remain discretionary. We hope—as I think everybody said in here last night and has said over the last couple of days—that we do not wind up going down the functional separation path, but we think it is probably a bit tough and perhaps a bit heavy-handed to compel the ACCC to give Telstra a belting even in the event of a fairly minor or accidental breach.

                    I need to apologise and to clarify this amendment, with this swathe of amendments. In terms of functional separation, in the event that an undertaking has not been enforced then the requirement is to go to the Federal Court rather than a publication of reasons. The issue of publication of reasons was another matter. Here it is quite clear from the wording that the court needs to consider it. I note that the government is not likely to support this, but I think it is important to flag this amendment and to raise it. Could the government explain on what basis it considers that it will be satisfied if there is not enforcement—what mechanisms are there to ensure that if there is an apparent breach some action is taken?

                     I indicate that the opposition strongly opposes this amendment. Senator Ludlam, who is often a wise and astute commentator in this place, even though we may disagree from time to time, indicated that this is a very heavy-handed amendment. The reality is that the amendment reads very clearly that under certain conditions the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                      ACCC
                     </a>
                     must apply to the Federal Court for an order under proposed subsection (2). We think that this is extremely heavy-handed, that it ties the ACCC’s hands and that it does not provide for the type of responsiveness that we would expect from an agency such as the ACCC. There are of course other means by which the ACCC can seek enforcement, and we do not think that the chamber needs to be this prescriptive in this legislation on this occasion.

                      I indicate that the government opposes this amendment. The objective of this amendment is already addressed in the bill, in the government’s view. Under the bill, an ‘in force’ functional separation undertaking is a condition of carrier licence—I refer you to clause 82 on page 70—with a range of remedies for a breach available, including for minor breaches, where court proceedings may be excessive. This amendment undermines those enforcement options by requiring the

                       This relates to the whole issue of spectrum licences for the 4G network, which is the next big thing because it is much faster than 3G. This amendment provides limits in the allocation of spectrum whereby in metropolitan areas, not including the

In regional areas no more than 50 per cent may be used by any one entity. This is in line with the competition limits set in 2001 for the allocation of the 3G spectrum. I understand the government will not be supporting this but I look forward to an undertaking from the government that we are not going to end up with some near monopoly or monopolistic behaviour in the context of the 4G spectrum.

                        will not be supporting this amendment although we are supportive of the position of ensuring that competition principles apply right through the sector, including to the allocation of 4G spectrum. My understanding, unfortunately, is that it is more for reasons of technology than competition policy that it is very difficult to carve up spectrum in this way, given the number of players who are likely to be active in each of the different markets. I also call on the minister, if he is able, to provide us with a fairly detailed explanation of how the government proposes to avoid the kinds of anticompetitive outcomes that I think this amendment is designed to address. We have similar concerns. I am not certain that technologically it is possible to cut up spectrum in the way that Senator Xenophon is proposing.

                         The government does oppose this amendment. We are very conscious of the concerns that Senator Xenophon has raised. Competition limits regarding the allocation of spectrum need to be considered on a case-by-case basis taking into account the purposes for which the spectrum can be used, the quantity of spectrum to be made available, how it is best packaged and the level of competition in the market.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Furthermore, under the current Radiocommunications Act there are procedures for placing competition limits on spectrum that require consultation with the

                         . It is not clear whether the caps imposed on available spectrum under this provision apply to all available spectrum in a particular area or to a spectrum available under a particular spectrum allocation process being run by the

                          I would like to follow that up. Can you indicate that competition principles will be applied to it—that we are not going to have one operator? I am not concerned so much about consultation with me; I am concerned about consultation at large to ensure that there will not be one operator that will dominate the market. Are we likely to have something similar to 3G or approximating that, so that we will not have market domination by any one player and that there will not be any special deal for any one operator?

                           they are working very much on a competitive model. There are no special deals being envisaged at all. As I mentioned, competition limits regarding the allocation of spectrum need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Those laws will be applying. I appreciate that you are very concerned about this. I would be equally concerned if we had a perverse outcome like that. While we are certainly seeking to maximise the outcome for taxpayers, the ultimate outcome for taxpayers would be significantly reduced if there was some of the domination that you are concerned about, Senator Xenophon. I will certainly be consulting on that issue and I will certainly have that uppermost in my mind. I believe those competition rules will be part of this consideration.

                            I am grateful to the minister for his answer. So does that mean that it is a transparent process? Presumably, the spectrum will be auctioned—is that what the minister is considering—so therefore there is that transparency by virtue of an auction process?

                             over the last six months about the process of the auction. A range of auction methods have been used around the world. Some have been widely criticised; some have been less effective. ACMA may have been doing extensive research on this. If you are genuinely interested, I would be happy to talk to ACMA. They have not finalised their position, but they could certainly give you a flavour of the complexities involved and the types of processes. I know that, deep down, you are a bit of a geek, Senator Xenophon, so I would be happy to see whether I could facilitate some information for you on that process. That auction process is absolutely designed to maximise the outcome for taxpayers of a very valuable resource.

We are talking about, say, 120, so 340 sounds fairly straightforward. But what the industry sector has said to us over the last 12 months is that, despite that being the thinking behind the process, say, 12 months or two years ago, different technologies are now being used. Industry’s preference would be for the blocks to be sold off in smaller bits. So there is a trade-off between what technology industry want to use—upload and download is the wrong way to describe it, and I am not an engineer—and the auction process. It is very complex and fascinating, and I will happily organise that briefing if ACMA are in a position to do so.

                                      I am not sure whether I will put myself closer to Senator Xenophon or Senator Ludlam in the debate around geekiness or otherwise. I do not think I can compete with Senator Ludlam. Senator Xenophon, I am sorry but you are all alone on this amendment. While consistency is not always a standard adhered to in this place, the opposition has been very critical from day one about the government’s approach of using spectrum triggers in this legislation and mixing up issues around spectrum allocation with the division and structural separation of a fixed line service. Is the minister showing off his

                                        The article is a total fabrication. The only accurate thing about the article is the tangled mess you appear to be in, in the pictures. We think that the issues around spectrum allocation are not issues that should be dealt with in this bill. We think it was wrong for the government to try to use them as a gun at the head of Telstra. We obviously have had that debate already. We attempted to remove that and sadly were unsuccessful. I know that Senator Xenophon comes to these amendments with good intentions, and I think the discussion that we have just had in the chamber will at least add to some of the process. We hope the government adopts a transparent, engaged and consultative process with industry, consumer representatives and others to ensure that this spectrum allocation is done in a way that maximises competition. We note we have had strong representations from the mobile telecommunications industry. Now the minister even has the clerks reading his puff piece. He is very proud. Have you got it framed already, Stephen?

                                          and other sectors who believe this is the wrong way to go; that, whilst Senator Xenophon’s intentions are well meaning, trying to specify in this legislation in this way would be the wrong outcome and would potentially stifle the type of competitive outcomes you would hope to see from the allocation of this spectrum. So we hope that the minister’s good words thus far in response to Senator Xenophon and Senator Ludlam will transfer into good deeds and that we will see a decent process for the allocation of this spectrum and something that provides a good competitive outcome.

                                            Senator Ronaldson was the absent senator who did not make up the numbers which would have tied the vote, which would then have negatived the vote. Senator Ronaldson, along with a number of other senators, very wisely seek leave in advance for the last Friday of the last week of sittings. Leave was recalled from all senators when the Senate extended its sittings, and there has been a communication error with Senator Ronaldson’s office and the understanding of the leave withdrawal was not completely comprehended. On that basis Senator Ronaldson is absent from the parliament, so I seek leave to recommit the vote. The upside for the government is that they now have an additional pair.

                                             These amendments relate to merits review provisions within the legislation. The opposition think it is important that these decisions of the

                                             are subject to some level of merits review process, and we think that our amendments will enhance the legislation by implementing such a process.

                                             There has been a great deal of criticism of Telstra over the years and the way they have in many ways gamed the system, using lawyers to challenge access decisions made by the ACCC. That mechanism was previously known as ‘negotiate and arbitrate’ in the terms that were used and it has now been replaced with a more prescriptive approach, locally known as ‘set and forget’. We support those changes.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             However, while supporting those changes to a more prescriptive approach that eliminates that potential for gaming of the system, we think that it is important to not completely lose sight of issues of justice and fairness in the way that these matters are dealt with. It is one thing to say that a corporation is using lawyers to game decisions. It is fine to use that description. But to remedy that by totally taking away the rights—in other words, taking away the natural fairness provisions and natural justice provisions entirely—you will end up with a situation which is quite extraordinary, where the ACCC become totally beyond review. We do not think it is appropriate for the ACCC to be able to operate totally beyond review. We have of course—and I have in this debate—placed great faith in and set great store by the capacity of the ACCC in their decision-making processes. Indeed, we wish that the minister would allow the ACCC to do the job that they do in so many other instances without the need for him to limit the scope of their considerations in other aspects of this legislation.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             However, in this regard we think that issues of procedural fairness should ensure that there is some review process and review mechanism. This is fundamentally an issue about getting the balance right in this legislation. We think the government has gone too far in one direction in totally eliminating these review processes and we think that allowing a merits review of access determinations by the tribunal is a fair and reasonable step to take. It is important that there be a merits review of these access determinations because they will be conducted in a prescriptive way as opposed to the much criticised approach taken in the legislation prior to this time.

                                             I urge those senators on the crossbenches to understand that this is a relatively simple step. It is a commonplace step. I know that in other areas they have strong regard for the importance of merits review processes and I would hope that, if the government is unwilling to accept these amendments, those on the crossbench will accept that these processes of merits review should occur in determinations by the ACCC in this regard, just as they argue that merits review processes should exist in a range of other ways.

                                              The coalition is proposing to restore merits review for anticipatory individual exemptions and special access undertakings. When this bill was first introduced to parliament, the removal of merits review from anticipatory individual exemptions and special access undertakings was widely supported in the industry. The removal of merits review was supported by industry because experience has demonstrated that any accountability benefits provided by merits reviews are strongly outweighed by the delays, the regulatory uncertainty and the outright gaming that have occurred.

Submissions will canvass complex pricing and technical issues. The

Access determinations fall into this category.

                                                   Senator Conroy sought to base a large part of his argument on the time frames for the merits review and the impact that they would have. We highlight to those on the crossbenches that we do have very specific time lines set out in these amendments and that, yes, merits review processes were previously abolished. However, we are looking at a different approach now and a different system being put in place. It is a system that is, as I said, far more prescriptive in terms of the outcomes. We think that, in terms of a balanced approach, if you have a prescriptive decision-making process at one end, it is quite reasonable to have a merits review process at the other end.

                                                   The time lines proposed in these amendments, No 59 and particularly the proposed sections 152BCX and 152BCY, do set out some very tight time lines that will not only limit but effectively prevent the type of gaming that we have seen previously while providing some reasonable level of fairness. So we think that those time lines are a good balance. It is always up for debate but, in terms of what the minister has said, arguing emphatically against a merits review approach is unreasonable. We think that having something in here is better than nothing in this regard. We believe we have got the balance right by putting in place a merits review provision but ensuring that it is one that has some clear, set time periods that ensure that there is not the type of gaming and the type of delaying tactics that we have seen previously. I would ask the crossbenchers to look closely at those time lines to see that we actually do have a process in place that we believe gets that balance right.

In the context of the binding rules of conduct issued by the ACCC, these are actually out of place, as binding rules of conduct are urgent interim measures intended to manage a situation until it can be properly addressed via an access determination. This will be produced or varied through a process of public consultation with all stakeholders and I think it would be a waste of public resources, quite frankly, to review an interim decision to see whether it is a proper response to a situation while the ACCC is essentially busy conducting a process to determine the proper response to that same situation. Senator Birmingham has moved the first batch but I indicate in advance that the Australian Greens will not be supporting either of these batches of amendments for those reasons.

                                                     I indicate that for similar reasons to Senator Ludlam’s I will not be supporting these amendments. There is a question to Senator Birmingham in relation to this. I understand the intent of what he is trying to do and I will not say it is well-meaning or well-intentioned because that is what Senator Birmingham accuses me of and I take that as—is it a backhanded insult? It is not a backhanded compliment—damning with faint praise I think is better. The concern I have is that, given the policy objective here of structural separation of Telstra, if we insert what Senator Birmingham is seeking to do on behalf of the coalition you would actually put a spanner in the works, because that is what I see as the public policy imperative: to structurally separate Telstra so that we do not have this vertically integrated monopoly of telecommunications services in this country. That was a mistake and I think there are some coalition senators, as I have said, who in their heart of hearts would acknowledge that the way this was done, particularly in the last sale, by having the wholesale and retail arms meshed together, has been bad for competition. It has been bad for services. I do not think it has been good for the bush.

I think Senator Joyce’s interjection was helpful. He said that openly in terms of the whole issue of having the wholesale and retail arms together. Senator Joyce understands that better than most, I think, and he is to be commended for that. I know about his concerns for telecommunications in the bush.

                                                           I cannot support this amendment. I am concerned that it would stymie the process. It could make it unworkable. We need to consider that Telstra shareholders need to approve this by June. That is a key date in relation to this, although I would have thought that what the government is offering is a significant sweetener. I understand the policy dilemmas that Senator Conroy had in relation to this. He has to unscramble the egg. When it comes to unscrambling this legislative egg, if he pulls this off it will be a

It is $35.7 billion if you cost it one way and probably in excess of $50 billion if you choose to cost it in other ways, but somewhere in between, most likely. Because of its close association with that major reason for Australia to go further into debt, we need to be very diligent about exactly what we are doing here. We can have our concerns, as we do, in the National Party about needing structural separation. Actually, I believe those concerns are held all around the chamber. But just because you believe in something does not mean you believe in any possible way to get to it, because any possible way, as in the way the Labor Party are doing it, has all sorts of hairs all over it. The biggest concern is the debt that you end up landing us in and the fact that you are unable to prove to us that you can actually pay that debt back or that there is an actual benefit from that debt. That is the crux of it.

I fully understand the claims and the way it was with the merits review as it currently stands—the gaming issue and the endless delays that that caused. And so the immediate response could go to the reverse and just take it out—get rid of it completely.

But there is something in me that says I am reluctant to just throw out the merits review completely at this stage, so I will be supporting the opposition on the merits review issue. It is basically a very final issue in a determination, and there is something in me that says there should be at least some way of having a merits review with some time constraints on it. A lot of the amendments that the opposition have put forward could be classified as maybe a little mischievous. I think this one is a genuine attempt to look at the issue and not go from the one extreme of open slather to the other of having no merits review at all. That is my case. I will be supporting the opposition.

What might those steps be? They might be ensuring that there are appropriate consultation and comment periods on drafts, ensuring that there is a procedural fairness mechanism there to allow affected parties to make comment on the determinations, on the binding rules of conduct, that the commission may be making.

                                                              This is a relatively straightforward amendment. I look forward to hearing the minister’s arguments, which I am sure there will be, as to why the government thinks that stripping the ACCC of the requirement to act in a fair way is necessary in this legislation and why the government thinks it needs to take out all those types of provisions. As we discussed with the previous amendment related to merits review, there is a significant change in the way determinations are made from the historical basis to what will occur under this legislation. The chamber has just decided not to have a merits review process, so the chamber has already decided that the ACCC’s determinations will be final. What we think is at least reasonable in this regard is that the ACCC be required to act in a procedurally fair manner. That is the simple aspect of these amendments, and I urge the chamber to support them.

Requiring the ACCC to comply with procedural fairness as part of the process of making binding rules of conduct would severely compromise its effectiveness. Binding rules of conduct are intended to enable the ACCC to quickly address problems which are affecting the supply of a declared service. The ACCC will only be able to make binding rules of conduct if it considers that there is an urgent need to do so. If the issue is not urgent, the ACCC will have to deal with it by varying the relevant access determination.

                                                               Since binding rules of conduct can only be made in cases of urgency, it does not make sense to require the ACCC to comply with procedural fairness, as that will have the effect of delaying the making of the rules. Binding rules of conduct will have a maximum duration of 12 months. Within 30 days after making binding rules of conduct, the ACCC will have to commence a public inquiry to vary the access determination or make a new access determination. Parties will be accorded procedural fairness in the public inquiry.

                                                               This set of amendments is probably the most disappointing. Those opposite have taken a largely constructive view in the debate around the bill, but they know that the current system has failed and that the whole industry is behind these changes because what we have seen are ridiculous situations where it has taken years for outcomes to be achieved, which has completely defeated the purpose of the current regime. This allows swift action by the ACCC. Suggesting the reintroduction of these amendments really is opposition for opposition’s sake. I think this is more politics than it is actual, fair dinkum policy rationale. It probably is the most disappointing part. The whole industry knows that the current system is broken, almost irretrievably, and this is the best mechanism to repair a broken system.

                                                               As for restoring current procedural fairness in relation to decisions to issue a part A competition notice under part 11B, the bill streamlines the process for issuing a part A competition notice. It does this by removing the requirement for the ACCC to issue a consultation notice before issuing a part A competition notice and by removing the requirement for the ACCC to accord procedural fairness when issuing a part A competition notice. These reforms are necessary to enable the ACCC to act as quickly as possible against alleged anticompetitive conduct, to limit the damage to competition. Powerful and well-resourced industry players who are engaging in anticompetitive conduct should not be able to string out the enforcement process so they can continue engaging in the conduct for long enough to consolidate their anticompetitive gains in the market.

                                                               That is what this is really about. The system currently has been gamed in a way that destroys its effectiveness. This block of amendments is designed to reintroduce a system that has manifestly failed, and that is acknowledged. I am sure even those opposite would acknowledge the current system has failed. You are hiding behind this pretence of an argument that ‘we’re suddenly behaving in a way that’s anticompetitive’ when you know that is not right. This is politics purely for politics’ sake.

This is certainly not politics for politics’ sake, as he said at the end of his remarks.

We do have concerns about the way the system was gamed. We do think there are problems that need to be fixed. We acknowledge and support the more prescriptive approach that is being put in place that will ensure that the setting of determinations is done by far quicker and more effective means. We acknowledge that we believe there should be some form of merits review; that matter has been decided.

                                                                In relation to these binding rules of conduct and Senator Conroy’s arguments that these need to be applied without procedural fairness because of their urgency, we do not believe there is an undue delay in providing a reasonable level of normal procedural fairness. By having procedural fairness you are not imposing forms of appeal; you are not opposing anything that will actually allow the parties to delay the process in any meaningful way. You are simply ensuring that there is some notice given, that there is potentially some opportunity for comment. That is basically as far as decent procedural fairness provisions are likely to go.

                                                                In terms of the urgency, if you were talking in terms of a court system and you sought an ex parte injunction along the way, you would not have such an injunction usually stand for a 12-month period. It could, Senator Xenophon, but it would not be usual for such things to stand for that period of time without the other party having the opportunity to make their case to get the matter effectively resolved. In this instance we acknowledge there is a need for the government to have provisions for urgent action. That is fine. These amendments will not prevent that urgent action. They will simply require the

We think this is a straightforward amendment. We do not think it comes with enormous ramifications for the operation of the system. We think, however, that it simply strengthens the system and ensures that the ACCC’s actions and decisions engage the parties that they affect in a fair and responsible manner.

If there is injunctive relief sought, Senator Birmingham is right: you would not expect it to go for 12 months. But potentially it could and it could go for several months. That has huge implications in relation to this.
                                                                   </p>

The risk with this is that—and I do not say it in a pejorative sense at all; I do not question Senator Birmingham’s intentions other than being good ones from the perspective of the coalition—if you go down this path you will throw a spanner in the works when it comes to the structural separation of Telstra, and that is my primary concern.

It also includes a provision whereby the ACCC will have regard to commercial interests and will remove that portion annotated to that effect. I understand issues of commercial-in-confidence, but I think it is important that access agreements be up there on the website, that they be transparent and that people are able to compare apples with apples, in a sense, in access agreements. If there is preferential treatment in access agreements, it is there for all to see. An independent analysis can take the place of that. That is what this amendment is about. I may be alone on this amendment, as I have been with others, but I still think the principle is an important one and it ought to be pursued.

Senator Xenophon has outlined that it requires the publication of a register of access agreements once commercially sensitive information has been redacted. We understand—but perhaps the minister can tell us from his own mouth—that the government will be opposing it in that it would reduce room for flexible negotiations by Telstra with access seekers. We just were not sure why, in a world of access determinations, we would need to have all access agreements published in this way. The

If Senator Xenophon or Senator Birmingham have some compelling arguments for it, then we would consider it. We will not be supporting this amendment.

There are legitimate commercial reasons for the parties to keep confidential the fact that they have entered into access agreements, and this amendment may discourage the industry from using access agreements. For example, a provider may be willing to negotiate inferior commercial terms on one aspect of access in exchange for better terms on another aspect. Disclosure of this information would be likely to reveal critical information about the provider’s future retail strategy.
                                                                        </p>

It is highly likely that parties to the majority of access agreements will claim confidentiality. This would create a high administrative burden for the ACCC, which would ultimately impact on the industry through the cost recovery process. A publication requirement will inhibit development of new services to meet the needs of niche markets.

We concur in some ways with the comments of others in the chamber. We believe that there is potential for this amendment to go one of two ways. One way could be for so much commercially sensitive information within those agreements published as to render them fairly well ineffective in terms of being published. The other way is that you will end up with a lowest common denominator approach, or potentially a highest common denominator approach, where we do not get the competitive, innovative, thoughtful solutions and approaches to these access agreements that do spark competition, that do drive different carriers to take different approaches that can lead to better outcomes for customers. In this case we need to have some faith in the work that the commission does and have confidence that they will, under all of the new powers that either the minister has or that they have, in different respects ensure that they get good competitive outcomes. We think that this could be an amendment that either backfires or potentially ends up as a meaningless amendment. Either way, we think it is better not being in the bill as it proceeds.

As a result of discussions over the past couple of days, we have revised it. We have circulated a revision on sheet 7020, which effectively balances things a little bit. We recognise that in the short term access seekers may need to secure access agreements in the absence of a special access undertaking, a binding rule of conduct or on an access determination which could place them at a disadvantage. And if such instruments come into force at a later time, we believe that access seekers should be able to effectively roll back to the safety net of such a determination.
                                                                          </p>

We were persuaded that the early form of the Australian Greens amendment effectively would have allowed the access seekers to cherry pick the best bits out of the contracts that they had signed, and therefore we have balanced this up a little bit. Now it reads so that either party to the access agreement can notify the other that it wishes to cancel the agreement. Having this clause in there will probably guide the discretion of parties to these agreements when they are being signed in the first place. That right would not just apply to the access seeker; it could just as easily apply to Telstra. We feel that some of the critique of the first version of the amendment was probably justified and I hope that the government will at least support this one, where we have effectively made the playing field level for all parties to these agreements.

                                                                           <p>
                                                                            I indicate that this has probably been the toughest of the amendments for us to consider. It has many things in it that are very, very attractive to the government. I understand the sentiment and I understand why the Greens are moving this, and I have spoken to many of the people who have encouraged them to, but, on balance, after much consideration—and I know this will disappoint some people in the industry—we will be opposing this amendment.
                                                                           </p>
                                                                           <p>
                                                                            As has been said, the amendment proposes that either party to an access agreement may cancel that access agreement where it is inconsistent with the terms of an access determination, binding rules of conduct or a special access undertaking which comes into force after the access agreement is made. The amendment is based on concerns raised by the Competitive Carriers Coalition that Telstra could compel access seekers into accepting an unfavourable access agreement in order to guarantee supply of a declared service. However, the revised part at 11C will not operate in this way. Access seekers will not be forced to agree to unfair access agreements. Instead, they will be able to require Telstra to provide them with access to its network on the terms and conditions set out in the relevant access determination. This is clearly set out in the revised terms of proposed section 152AY. In other words, once a final access determination is made, access seekers will only sign agreements with Telstra where it is in their commercial interests to do so. This amendment would have the effect of removing any incentive for Telstra or any other access provider to make commercial agreements with access seekers, as they would know that access seekers could simply walk away from the access agreement when it suited them.
                                                                           </p>

                                                                            The amendment does not recognise that parties may incur costs and obtain benefits at different stages of an agreement. For example, an access agreement may require the access provider to make investments to upgrade its network capacity or infrastructure. In return, the access seeker would commit to obtaining supply of a service on particular terms, such as a price that reflected the investment or for a fixed term or a guaranteed minimum capacity. It is precisely these types of mutually beneficial arrangements that the access agreement provisions seek to allow and that this amendment would stifle.
                                                                           </p>
                                                                           <p>

However, to address a transitional issue the bill already provides that access seekers can lodge a dispute in relation to access agreements until such time as the first final access determination is made for that service. But I do acknowledge the very legitimate concerns in industry, and I will be keeping a very close eye on how this plays out in reality. I am sure that other senators will also be watching that.

In terms of the primacy of access agreements, I think what this amendment is intending to do is desirable in the scheme of things. I think it enhances what is being proposed by the bill. It is interesting that Senator Conroy said that it was a tough call in relation to this amendment. I appreciate his frankness in relation to that.

Will there be some formal monitoring? Will there be a process of review in relation to this whole issue of primacy of access agreements? I appreciate the minister’s candour in indicating that it was a tough call and that it is complex, but given the substantial merits of this amendment moved by Senator Ludlam I wonder how those concerns can be facilitated in some constructive way and with some due process.

I am very conscious of the argument of Senator Ludlam, and more importantly the arguments that have convinced Senator Ludlam to move down this path. As I said in my earlier contribution, we will be watching this closely. We will be having conversations with the

I will welcome the ongoing scrutiny by the ACCC and I will be liaising with the ACCC. I am sure, Senator Xenophon, you will also be maintaining a weather eye on this so that you can keep me well informed. I have, as I said, many people in the industry keeping me continually updated on these sorts of matters and I will be monitoring this closely.

A formal review will allow the government to assess whether the new access regime is functioning as intended, and we propose that it be undertaken before 30 June 2014 and then be provided directly to parliament within 15 days of its receipt by the minister.

We are seeking to widen the range of matters for which ACMA may develop performance benchmarks which it can then enforce. This will go some way towards winding back the high rates of complaints and customer dissatisfaction which have plagued the industry and which the minister himself has acknowledged on many occasions.
                                                                                      </p>

I am aware that the government has concerns that some of these issues are diffuse and it will be difficult to provide accurate metrics against which to judge carriage providers. We believe that ACMA does have the ability and the wit to develop such benchmarks even if they have commonsense and plain English standards to give service providers a better defined idea of what the government expects, or it could simply be metrics along the lines of the number of complaints received during a defined period of time. I hope that we can give ACMA the benefit of the doubt and let them define these benchmarks rather than assuming that it cannot be done.
                                                                                      </p>

The power is a more appropriate and broader mechanism than the amendments of the CSG as proposed by the Greens. If the matters in the Telecommunications Consumer Protections Code are made an industry standard under part 6 of the Telecommunications Act, providers will be required to comply or face civil penalties.

Some examples of where a standard may be appropriate include that on 1 July 2009 a new industry code came into force relating to mobile premium services. This power may have been utilised to address the issues around mobile phone premium services if industry had not put in place a robust code. Work is currently being undertaken by two separate bodies on consumer protection and customer service issues within the telco industry. The Communications Alliance, an industry peak body, is currently undertaking a review of the Telecommunications Consumer Protection Code and ACMA is currently undertaking an inquiry into customer service and complaints handling. If the current Communications Alliance code review fails to adequately address the interests of consumers and the government were to judge the revised code as deficient in the protections it afforded to consumers in the area of complaint handling, or the ACMA review were to result in recommendations about minimum standards for customer service, the government may direct the ACMA to develop a standard dealing with such issues.

These are issues that the minister himself has been extremely outspoken on in preceding years and so I find it curious in the extreme that the minister is not seeking to effectively grant one of his own agencies the powers to deal with these matters directly. I wonder whether the minister would like to spell out for us where exactly consumers will go for the matters that we have raised in parts G through to K that we have sought to insert, how exactly those matters will be addressed and why exactly it is that the government believes that it is not possible to provide metrics, for example, on financial hardship policies, now in the water space, electricity space and so on. A lot of work has been done in recent years about financial hardship policy for essential services, to pick that example out as one. Why should we not apply such policies to the telecommunications space and give ACMA the benefit of the doubt that if so directed they could indeed create standards that would be able to be benchmarked against to give industry participants a very clear idea of what exactly they need to come up with? If we can do it in other utilities, why not in telecommunications?

We are going through a new process that I believe deserves a chance before we need to move to where you have arrived at. I would invite your participation in all of those reviews that you have been talking about. I know that whether or not I invited you I would be going to get it! So I think that we should see how these new processes work before we jump to where you are. I look forward to my ongoing work with the ACCAN group—and I know you work closely with them as well—to see if we can improve these processes that we are going through which will allow us to incorporate many of the issues that you have raised. I think it is a little unfair to suggest that we are not addressing those through this process. I look forward to your ongoing participation and cooperation in those processes.

These are the last amendments in the debate on this piece of legislation. Most of the time in the committee stage has been spent on debating amendments related to the structural separation and/or the functional separation of Telstra. Those are reasonable things. It is appropriate that we have looked at those as one of the key objectives of this piece of legislation. Whilst we may disagree with some of the means by which the government is seeking to achieve this key objective, the opposition does support the ultimate aim of that separation and the competitive benefits that it will provide to the telecommunications sector into the future. However, integrated into this bill is fundamentally a structure to support the development of the government’s

Whether this is a $35.7 billion network, a $43 billion network or a $50 billion network—and we can have those debates—it is a very large amount of money. It is a phenomenally huge amount of money that the government is committing to its NBN and it is committing it with no knowledge whatsoever as to whether it is the best way to deliver fast and affordable broadband services to all Australians at the lowest cost to taxpayers in a manner that promotes competition in the Australian telecommunications sector.

That is the fundamental basis of this amendment and it is, of course, something that the opposition has been calling for from day one of the conception of this NBN by the government.

It has been a long time in the debate since Senator Conroy first announced that $43 billion proposal. However, we still have not seen anything that vaguely resembles a cost-benefit analysis of the government’s proposal. This amendment seeks to achieve that.

That should be the aim of everyone in this place—to achieve fast affordable broadband at the lowest possible cost.

That is right; you can ignore it, because there is nothing binding about a PC report. Your government, and governments before it, have ignored PC reports before. It has been done many times before.

That is the real risk. That is the risk that Australians have to bear.

So the taxpayer is up, already, for at least a billion dollars more than the figure stated in the implementation study and more than the figure stated by Senator Conroy when he first announced this proposal. At that stage, I remember that proposal as being a fifty-fifty split, where you had 50 per cent government equity and the other 50 per cent was going to come from private investors.
                                                                                             </p>

Because now we learn that anything required above that $27.1 billion is going to come from debt raising. So, from day one, the 100 per cent government owned

So every single dollar of the billions of dollars that will be spent building this network will come from debt, either from the government’s massive debt or NBN Co.’s debt, all of which comes back to the Australian taxpayer. That is why the opposition believes that we need a fair dinkum, robust analysis of the costs and benefits of this proposal and a fair dinkum, robust analysis of whether there is a better way to get the NBN built. We think the government is being utterly reckless in continuing to pursue this policy without any knowledge as to whether it is in fact the best policy to be pursued at all.

He said that he believes there is real merit in the Productivity Commission being involved in the process. In considering this amendment I appeal to you, Senator Xenophon, and to all of the crossbenchers: you know this is the right thing to do; you know that there is no harm in the PC undertaking an inquiry. No harm whatsoever can come of this amendment. All it will do is better inform the debate by 31 May next year. It will not block or delay this bill, it will not block or delay the NBN and it will not even force the government to change track. All it will do is ensure that, if they are on the wrong track, pressure will come to bear on them to change their track. That is all it will do. It will better inform your decision making, it will better inform our decision making and, hopefully, it will better inform the government’s decision making.
                                                                                             </p>

What you need to consider is whether the deals you have made with the government are actually worth compromising your positions on this PC inquiry. To Senator Xenophon in particular, I note the agreement you have struck with the government for the setting up of a joint standing committee. Regrettably, that joint standing committee does not take effect until 1 July next year. The PC’s involvement there is, regrettably, only to provide some advice and to inform that joint standing committee. That will not provide the type of analysis of whether or not this is the best way forward. It will not provide what we require for Australia to get the best outcome.
                                                                                             </p>

You have managed to negotiate, from your perspective, reasonable outcomes with the government on all the other matters of concern. That is perfectly fair and reasonable, but on this matter you have not negotiated a reasonable outcome. The proposed joint standing committee will still end up being largely dominated by the government. It will not even start its work until 1 July next year. I note that my colleague Senator Fisher—with the cooperation of others, I trust—will be moving an amendment to the motion to adopt the committee’s report to ensure that at least the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee can get on with some work. But none of those things are substitutes for the Productivity Commission inquiry and for real robust work. On many other occasions, Senator Xenophon, you have paid great heed to the workings of the Productivity Commission and you have recognised the ability of

                                                                                             </p>

Voting for this amendment would not put you on side with the opposition in opposing the NBN; it would simply put you on side with the opposition in saying that we want to get the best outcome for Australia. And, if the best outcome is the government’s NBN, if that is what the Productivity Commission says, we will wear it. We will wear what the Productivity Commission says and, of course, we will wear the words that we have spoken arguing against the NBN to date.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              But, if the Productivity Commission comes back with an alternative, you will wear it. You will wear it if the Productivity Commission comes back saying that there is a lower cost way. Senator Conroy believes there is absolutely no possible lower cost way that this can be done. Senator Conroy, you are the one who flipped from thinking, just a year or so ago, that 12 megabits per second was effective to thinking, now, that we need 100 megabits per second. You did that without any decent cost-benefit analysis, and, in the process, you have put billions of extra taxpayer dollars on the line.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>

This government is spending billions of dollars of taxpayer money. It is empowering a 100 per cent government owned entity to borrow billions of dollars of taxpayer money to roll a network up and down every street of Australia, including those that already have very fast broadband services. If we want to get value for money for Australians and we want fast, universal access to broadband, we should have the right policy approach, and we should test it. This amendment will allow the Australian community to test the government’s policy.

I indicate that, while it would be possible to believe that the opposition were motivated by sound public policy, their track record indicates otherwise. Their $10 billion water package was apparently done on the back of an envelope. It had no cost-benefit analysis. It is a little hard to take seriously people who were involved in that process suddenly being the champions of a cost-benefit analysis by the

I do not remember Senator Birmingham jumping up and down and demanding a cost-benefit analysis on that white elephant the Adelaide to Darwin railway.

This legislation will deliver historic reforms to the telecommunications sector. It will deliver cheaper prices and more choice and it will drive innovative services for Australians.

It delivers key reforms that allow for the structural separation of Telstra, which means the agreement between Telstra and the NBN Co. can be finalised. This bill does create a framework to deliver this important reform, but the bill also does much more than that. During the NBN rollout, the existing telecommunications regulatory regime will remain important for delivering better and more affordable services in the interests of Australian consumers and businesses. The reforms are designed to reshape regulation in the telecommunications sector in the interests of consumers. Also, small businesses and the economy will benefit enormously from the reforms we are voting on today. Specifically, the proposed reforms establish a framework for Telstra to progress its decision to structurally separate, including providing it with greater clarity around the undertaking process which will allow Telstra to seek approval from its shareholders on a firm proposal to migrate its fixed line customers to the National Broadband Network. They will streamline the competition regime to provide more certain and quicker outcomes for telecommunications companies, and they will strengthen the consumer safeguards to ensure service standards are maintained at a high level. Importantly, they are supported by the overwhelming majority of the industry. The delivery of the government’s reforms, in parallel with the rollout of the NBN across Australia, will finally deliver the affordable broadband services Australians need now and, importantly, into the future.

It is disappointing. One of the proudest mantras of the opposition during the period of the Hawke-Keating government, and then when they became the Howard government, was that they were able to say, ‘You could never have made those economic reforms without us,’ because you supported them. The opposition put Australia’s national interest ahead of short-term political gains. But those opposite today are turning their backs on economic reforms that they know this country needs and will benefit from. Short-term politics has been put ahead of national economic reform, and it is a disappointing day. You had a proud record through the period of the Hawke-Keating government of supporting economic reforms that were in the national interest, and you know this bill is in the national interest. You know this bill is about improved outcomes for every single Australian and you have torched the record and the mantle of economic reformers by how you are going to vote on this bill—and you should be ashamed of yourselves. You cannot claim the mantle of economic reformers anymore, because of your opposition to this bill.
                                                                                              </p>

It is a bill that is in the interests of Australian consumers, and every day of delay in the 12 months we have had to put up with has been another day of higher prices, less choice and less innovation for consumers. The task of undertaking such difficult but necessary reform in an industry that is fundamental to Australia’s long-term national interests is one which this government embraces wholeheartedly and encourages the parliament to embrace.

The agreement reached with the Prime Minister allows for the Productivity Commission to give continual advice over an eight-year period to this committee about its implementation. Senator Birmingham, I think we will have to revisit this. This is a very tough amendment for me. I believe that, on balance, that is the best way to go forward. I think the government will confirm, if not in the next three minutes, issues of members being able to participate.

If the Productivity Commission merely provides a report, the risk is that it can be ignored, as Labor and Liberal governments have both ignored reports of the Productivity Commission. This is about implementation. This is about ensuring some ongoing accountability. The government knows and the opposition knows that, when the

There was not a word from the coalition all the way through this proposal as to exactly what its broadband policy is. The spectacle of the coalition, and the National Party in particular, opposing a broadband rollout into regional areas I still find utterly incomprehensible. So we look forward to this debate proceeding. Again, I would like to thank my staff and the folk who have looked after us through the long hours of this debate and I very much look forward to the passage of this bill.

Had we succeeded in doing so, had we not been frustrated by a government that hides from public scrutiny and parliamentary review, then the time for this debate would have been extended by another 10 hours and the consideration of the committee stage of the debate would have been able to proceed, and proper and due consideration by this chamber of this legislation would have been allowed to happen.
                                                                                                        </p>

We saw a stunt in the course of which the government first of all tried to get rid of question time. Then, shamed out of that, they put forward a revised motion which reinstated question time but nevertheless constrained the consideration by the parliament, by the Senate, of this legislation.

So far we have heard from one opposition senator on this motion: the shadow spokesman, Senator Birmingham. How can anyone maintain that there has been proper scrutiny by this chamber of this legislation if the principal opposition amendment has not even had the opportunity to be discussed? And yet, as a result of the government moving this guillotine, unless the motion which I have sought leave to move were to be passed, there will be no significant discussion in this chamber of our proposal to refer to the Productivity Commission the expenditure of $43 billion of public money.

They are, after all, the party which in government drove Australia into the greatest level of peacetime debt we have ever suffered in our history. They are a government which fecklessly and flippantly proposes to commit at least $43 billion of public money to an untested, untried scheme; has serially sought to conceal from the parliament the business case that underlies the

How could anybody seriously maintain that, before the parliament is asked to approve this expenditure, as we would be doing by voting on this bill now, the taxpayer is not entitled to be satisfied from a technical point of view and from that point of view of parliamentary scrutiny that there had been a full discussion? But, if the motion, which I sought leave to move, is frustrated, as I expect it will be by this government, the Australian people will know that they were committed to a generation of debt by this Labor government and the parliament was denied the opportunity of properly discussing the matter.

The opposition denied the ability for the committee stage to sit on Wednesday night for a number of hours. They did not want to sit on Wednesday night. Why? Maybe you could ask the opposition why. Maybe they had other engagements.

The opposition refused point-blank to engage in it. In addition to that, not only did they refuse point-blank to deal with it; they then used every procedural device they could think of—and, quite frankly, that was not all of them but every one that they could think of—to ensure that they could not get to the substantive element of the debate, that is, the committee stage. They think that they have not had an opportunity. They had an opportunity on Wednesday. They did not want it. They wanted to spend all their time on procedures. On Thursday, when they had another opportunity to start again and deal with the committee stage of the bill, they did not want to do that. They wanted to spend all their time on process, on procedural devices to ensure that they did not have the ability to engage in the debate. They did not want to engage in the debate. They wanted to ensure that they did not get an opportunity to get into the committee stage. Why? Because they wanted to deal with procedural matters, the process. This is an opposition that is stuck in process.
                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                            <p>

What we now have, as I have indicated, is another procedural device—just another one. If they had ensured that they used their time effectively during the committee stage of the debate, they would have had more than three hours; they would have had up to five hours of additional debate in committee. But, no—they spent 2½ to three hours on not wanting to debate the bill in committee. It is up to the opposition to come up with a reason for why they did not want to debate in committee. Now they cry crocodile tears that they did not get to speak. They had not only Wednesday night; they had two hours of procedural matters, when they could have said, ‘No, thank you. We understand the debate,’ as has been done in this parliament before, when you can collapse a procedural debate to ensure that there is sufficient time to deal with these things. But, no, they wanted to continue to do that.
                                                                                                            </p>

The device, the management, was put in place yesterday. It was agreed to by a majority of the Senate. What we now have is an opposition that does not want to abide by the majority will of the Senate. They want to continue to wreck not only the Senate’s procedures but also this bill. This government is pursuing this bill. It is a bill that is vital for this government to pass this week, and we intend to do so. I move:
