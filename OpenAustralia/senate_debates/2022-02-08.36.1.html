          Over the summer, I again had the opportunity to travel across
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          's

          </a>
          . Those of us who are familiar with the Kimberley will know it for its rugged charm, its waterways, particularly in the wet season that we're experiencing now, and most particularly, of course, the resilience of people living across Kimberley communities. But I'm disappointed to have to share with the Senate today what is a new and emerging challenge for those people and communities across the Kimberley who choose to make the Kimberley their home and the place of their small businesses.
         </p>
         <p>
          During those travels, I was surprised to hear the depth of concern, frustration and disappointment from people who have lived in Kimberley towns and communities for years upon years—since their birth, in some cases—and to hear the stories they are now telling me of an escalation in crime and violence not seen before. We know there are many politicians who would be quick to point the finger at other politicians about the need to do more. But, in standing before the Senate today, I know that my colleagues Senator Dodson and Senator Cox, who have great passion for my home state of Western Australia and great passion for northern Australia, are interested in working together to make sure that we can tackle these issues.

          Everyone will come to this debate with their own philosophical view. I am someone who believes that we should trust the data first. Let's have a look at what the data is telling us. I don't believe that more money is the answer. I do believe that greater coordination between state and federal officials is important. I do believe the federal government can take on a greater responsibility on some particular matters, and I'll name one of those. It's very clear on what has been shared with me by local people that social media is emboldening the attitudes of some very, very young people. TikTok—I'm not familiar with it, but this is an opportunity for the federal government to think laterally and to exercise much greater influence over these important but terrible issues—
