         I thank Senator McLucas for the question and I thank the Senate for its support for the apology today. Today the nation has acknowledged and apologised for the pain and devastation caused by the actions of governments and institutions to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Forgotten Australians
         </a>
         and former child migrants. Speaking this morning, the Prime Minister outlined the abuse, deprivation and neglect that befell children placed in orphanages, homes and institutions where they were supposed to be protected, nurtured and educated. To our shame as a nation, we failed to properly provide for the half a million children placed in the care of state governments and charitable and religious institutions in Australia. Of these, some 7,000 children were brought here from the United Kingdom and Malta, often taken without their parents’ consent or in the absence of their full knowledge of what was happening. Half a million children were deprived of their childhoods, many of whom were also torn from their families. Many of these children were denied love, affection and protection from those charged with their care, and instead were neglected, exploited and abused.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today we recognise that, while these Forgotten Australians and former child migrants are now middle aged, the past continues to have profound and far-reaching effects on their adult lives. Beyond the devastating impacts of the deprivation and abuse for the individuals, we also see that their families have come to be burdened and haunted by their past as well. We also remember today those people who, unable to cope with the pain and the horror of their experiences, took their own lives. The apology delivered by the Prime Minister and the motion tabled today are the first steps in the healing process. They mark an important turning point in Australia’s history, where we show our respect for the people affected, support further recognition for the terrible wrongs inflicted and hope to assist the process of healing. The unanimous support of the parliament sends a very strong message on our commitment to this apology and is an important contribution to the healing of those so badly treated.

           While we cannot reverse the past, we can help the healing process and support child migrants in their search for their families. To support former child migrants the government will continue to provide funding for counselling services, family tracing support and other assistance as it has under former governments since 1990. This assistance occurs through the

            Child Migrants Trust
           </a>
           , an independent organisation for former child migrants, their parents and their relatives. The trust is working with over a thousand people to rediscover their origins and deal with the legacy of their childhood experiences—really important work. In the 2008-09 budget $450,000 was provided over the next four years. We are also working with those who support the

           . We are funding the Alliance for Forgotten Australians and the Care Leavers of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Network" rel="nofollow">
            Australia Network
           </a>
           to continue to support work for care leavers. They are small steps, but they are positive steps which demonstrate our commitment to offer practical and meaningful support.

             In addition to the measures already implemented by successive governments, today the Prime Minister announced a national find and connect service, which will provide Australia-wide coordinated family tracing and support services. The service will also provide counselling and support for family reunifications. I am also pleased to advise the Senate that overnight

             announced that the British government will also apologise to the thousands of children from Britain who were sent to colonies around the world, including to Australia, during the early part of the last century and into the 1960s. This is obviously a very welcome development. We hope that the apologies of the Australian and British governments will bring some peace to the victims of this tragic policy. We thank those who attended the ceremonies in parliament today, and we hope that this has helped in their healing.
