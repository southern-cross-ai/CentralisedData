        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin. Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_First" rel="nofollow">
         Family First

        believes that the Australian parliament should be a showcase for Australian-made products to proudly display Aussie talent. Recently, however, senators received a new set of mugs with the Senate logo, and they are made in China. Minister, why don’t government procurement guidelines recognise that Australia’s parliament should showcase Australian-made products?

             I am attempting to treat it seriously,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
              Mr President
             </a>
             . The government’s general attitude to procurement is to ensure that taxpayers, who pay for all these things, receive value for money. It is the fundamental objective of this government, and I suspect of any government, to ensure that we respect the right of taxpayers to ensure that governments exercising their authority in relation to acquisition do ensure value-for-money propositions. We do not run a protection racket for domestic suppliers. We ensure that through our rules.
            </p>
            <p>
             Acquisitions are the prerogative of each department, but there is a framework. The emphasis in that framework is on value for money, but we do seek to ensure that every department, whether it is a department of the parliament or otherwise, does its utmost to make sure that Australian suppliers have every fair and equal opportunity to tender for the particular procurement that has been put out. So there are very clear rules as to how procurements are to be conducted, with due probity and due openness and ensuring that there is fair and equal opportunity to tender for the particular contract.
            </p>
            <p>
             But the overriding concern of the government is to ensure that taxpayers, who pay for all these things, do receive value for money. If at the end of the day there is an overseas supplier who can supply a product at a much better value-for-money proposition then, with due respect to taxpayers, who pay for these things, that will be the contract that will be entered into.
            </p>
            <p>
             Obviously we all hope that there are Australian suppliers of these things. I do not particularly know off the top of my head whether there are Australian suppliers of the type of mug that was apparently acquired.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
              Senator Fielding
             </a>
             may know if an Australian supplier missed out on this tender. I do not have that information. For the sake of Senator Fielding, I am happy to have a look at that tender just to make sure it was properly conducted in accordance with the rules. But we do not run a pro-Australian tender operation. I think that would be quite wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             Of course, with respect to MPs’ cars—something I feel strongly about as a senator for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              South Australia
             </a>
             —we do seek to ensure that Australian vehicles are on the list. The only vehicles on the list that are not Australian made are those supplied by companies that do make vehicles in Australia. I think that is an appropriate policy. The Australian automobile industry is a very significant one, and I think it is appropriate that MPs who are supplied with vehicles do seek to drive Australian cars. I know most MPs would voluntarily do so anyway. But in terms of general acquisition policy the principles are as I have stated.

              , I ask a supplementary question. I am not sure whether that answer would be in line with the community’s expectations about promoting Australian made. This is the Australian parliament. I do not know whether you are familiar with the famous Bendigo Pottery, which is just one Australian company that would be delighted to supply quality Aussie-made mugs to this parliament. Instead of using mugs made in China, wouldn’t it be more in line with the Australian community’s expectations to be using Australian-made products in the Australian parliament?

               There are certain iconic and significant features of this parliament that are made in Australia. Most of the woodwork in this place is Australian made. But, with great respect, when it comes to things like mugs I think it is appropriate that we apply the general principles of value for money. I would love to see an Australian supplier be able to compete and win the contracts, but at the end of the day taxpayers expect us to ensure value for money in our procurement.
