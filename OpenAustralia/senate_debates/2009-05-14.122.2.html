       <p>
        I have just been provided with so more information that might assist Senator Ferguson in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIEV" rel="nofollow">
         SIEV
        </a>
        36 issue. I understand that Defence was required under subpoena to provide all Defence imagery concerning the incident to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        police to assist with the criminal investigation into the incident. Because of the ongoing Northern Territory police criminal investigation, Defence is not authorised to publicly release any of this imagery at this time. I can also say, and this might be of interest to some senators, that I have been advised now that a small quantity of imagery, consisting of approximately 20 seconds of video footage of the aftermath of the explosion together with approximately 20 photographs, was cleared for public release by the Northern Territory police. I am also advised that Defence subsequently released that imagery and that is the only imagery that Defence has released at this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, if it assists the Senate I can say that the Northern Territory police remain in possession of all other Defence imagery concerning this incident. As the Northern Territory police investigation progresses I am advised that the police will continue to formally advise Defence when imagery can be subsequently released. Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would be aware, before I had that further advice provided to me I indicated that I would take on notice that particular matter that Senator Ferguson raised in relation to one of the supplementary questions. I will still do that, but I do indicate to the Senate that I believe I have been able to provide to the Senate what the current status is. However, of course I will indicate if there is any further information.
