        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator Nash. While announcing the start of construction at the White Rock Solar Farm in his electorate of New England, the Deputy Prime Minister celebrated the government as:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … supporting renewable energy production to help secure the national grid.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the Deputy Prime Minister's statement reflect the coalition government's position?

         Yes, of course it does. The coalition government absolutely support renewable energy. Indeed, I don't think we as the coalition could have been clearer that, when it comes to the provision of reliable and affordable energy, we believe in an all-of-the-above policy. Of course renewables are part of the future, and they are very much part of the government's policies.

         I do need to point out for the Senate the bizarre and hypocritical nature of somebody from the Labor Party asking me a question today, because only a few short hours ago the Labor Party moved a motion trying to shut me down in my ministerial duties. They actually wanted to stop me doing my ministerial job. They wanted me not to be able to do my ministerial job. But what do we see now? We see those on the other side asking me a question in my ministerial role. It just shows the chaos on the other side. Who knows what's going on over there? Nothing sensible is immediately obvious. We can only assume that they are simply shambolic. Anybody outside watching the proceedings today and, having watched the chamber a few short hours ago, with the Labor Party trying to shut me down from my ministerial duties, seeing them ask me a question in my ministerial capacity would see it as simply hypocrisy.

           member of parliament, Mr George Christensen, has reportedly threatened to cross the floor if the government attempts to legislate a clean energy target. Has the Deputy Prime Minister explained the importance of renewables for the national grid and in supporting regional jobs to Mr Christensen?

            I'm not aware of a personal conversation between the Deputy Prime Minister and Mr Christensen, but I can certainly tell you that all of us in the National Party discuss many aspects of energy policy. They include renewables, coal-fired power and extending the life of coal-fired power stations. They include a whole range of things. So it would be unsurprising for any of those things to be canvassed between the Deputy Prime Minister and Mr Christensen.
           </p>
           <p>
            Isn't it interesting that we're getting a question from the Labor Party on the other side under whom electricity prices doubled 101 per cent? It is going to be the coalition that will continue to ensure that we are focused on reliable and affordable energy for people right across this country under the all-of-the-above policy, and we will be consistent in doing so.

              Reports today indicate that former Prime Minister Tony Abbott and up to nine of his colleagues will cross the floor if the Turnbull government attempts to legislate renewables in Australia's energy mix. Is Mr Christensen included in the count, or does his position take the total number of MPs willing to vote against the Prime Minister up to 11?

               The coalition government will continue to put forward sensible policy to ensure that people across this country have access to reliable and affordable energy. Isn't it a shame that those in the Labor Party use question time to talk about an issue of parliamentarians crossing the floor when they could actually talk about things that are important to regional Australia? If only they cared as much about regional Australia as they do about the issue of people crossing the floor. Then they would be asking me about the Building Better Regions Fund and the half a billion dollars that the coalition government is putting into that. They would be asking me about the Inland Rail—$8.4 billion being invested by the coalition government into regional Australia. They'd be talking about the major regional projects fund—$272 million going to major regional projects across the country where regional people are going to think big and deliver big.
