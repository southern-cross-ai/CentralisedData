        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. I refer to the example given by Associate Professor Owler, the President of the AMA, of a young woman with a breast lump who needs a biopsy for diagnosis. Can the minister confirm that out-of-pocket costs could rise to at least $63 over nine visits as a consequence of co-payments for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s, radiology and pathology adding up? Does the minister agree that the imposition of a $7 GP tax will increase costs and could deter women from accessing an often life-saving early diagnosis?

         I can again indicate to the chamber that I am well aware that there have been a range of commentary on the budget around the health measures since the budget was introduced. I know that there have been a range of comments around the changes to some of the current charges for healthcare provision. I have indicated to the chamber on several occasions that those decisions have been made because of the necessity to have a sustainable health system into the future. That is the priority for this government. Unlike those opposite, we do not believe—

The consequences of the previous Labor government policy is an unsustainable health system. If this government does not make the changes to the policy, our children and their children will be paying for it for decades.

                    , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to a common scenario, given by Associate Professor Owler, of patients on the anti-clotting medication warfarin who may not always fall under the 10-visit concession cap. Associate Professor Owler says that when patients go on warfarin they usually need a large number of visits to determine whether their blood is too thin or thin enough for this treatment. Isn't it true that with a $7

                    tax this could add up to hundreds of dollars for this life-saving treatment?

                     I am well aware of Professor Owler's comments on this. Those opposite would be well aware of the changes in financial arrangements and would know the answer to that question. I do not have anything further to add.

                       What I agree with is making sure that we have a sustainable health system into the future. What I agree with is making sure we have a strong economy. What I agree with is making sure we get the budget back on track. We have indicated to the chamber why this has been a tough budget, and this government have indicated very clearly why those changes have been made. We are going to ensure a sustainable health system into the future and we will make sure that we improve health outcomes for all Australians.
