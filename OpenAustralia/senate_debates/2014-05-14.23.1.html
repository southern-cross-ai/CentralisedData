        I rise today to speak at a time of great sadness. The Australian Turkish community woke this morning to the news of the death of more than 150 coalmine workers in a tragic explosion. Our prayers and our thoughts are with their family and friends as they wait for further news of the rescue operation. It has been reported that a total of 787 mine workers were underground at the time of the explosion in Soma, where mining is the primary industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is home to many families from the province of Manisa where this disaster took place. Words are inadequate to express the sorrow we feel during this time of tragedy. On behalf of the Australian community, I offer my deepest condolences to the families that have lost loved ones and pray for those who are still waiting for news of those who are missing. I would also like to express my appreciation for the rescue teams and volunteers who are working in difficult circumstances on the rescue operation. It is in difficult times that communities come together, and I hope that our prayers can help those who are going through the pain of losing loved ones.
