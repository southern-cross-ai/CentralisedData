         Special Minister of State

         Australian Electoral Commission

        , how much did the audit cost and what was the result?' The answer was: 'If you are trying to suggest there is a problem, I don't understand why you would do that.' Let me ask again: who conducted the most recent audit of the

         I thank Senator Roberts for the question. I can't quite recall whether those details were taken on notice during the estimates hearings. It would not be a surprise to the Senate that I don't have the precise contract details to hand in the chamber. I will take them on notice here, noting they may already have been taken on notice through the estimates process. But I would also state our complete confidence in the integrity and operation of the

            We are talking about two entities that operate with independence from governmentâ€”the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Electoral Commission
            </a>
            and the

             Australian National Audit Office
            </a>
            . In terms of the interaction between those entities, I can take it on notice to seek information from them, but I am not able to provide Senator Roberts with details of those interactions. They're certainly not interactions directed by the government.

              In March and, again, in May this year, I asked the following question and on both occasions did not receive an answer, so I ask again. In 2019, how many physical paper ballots were compared back to the electronic data report after the initial data entry, which would be an essential part of the auditing we are assured is going on?

                Australian Electoral Commission
               </a>
               er did talk through some of those issues in the recent estimates hearings with you, Senator Roberts, and that it was addressed in those estimates hearings. I know you have been exploring those issues for a period of time and that some responses have been placed on notice. In relation to the comparison between the paper ballots and data processing, and the steps that the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
                AEC
               </a>
               undertake in that regard, I also recall that the commissioner took you through the explanations during the recent estimates hearings. I would refer you to the
               <i>
                Hansard
               </i>
               in that regard. If, following review of that

               , you have additional aspects that are unclear, then of course I'm always happy to work through them with you.
