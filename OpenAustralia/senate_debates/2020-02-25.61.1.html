        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister Payne.

        says that China is attempting a takeover of Australia's political system with foreign interference and espionage. My question for the minister is simple and direct: is China a threat to Australia's political system and national security?

         I thank Senator Lambie for her question. As colleagues would know, China and Australia have a deep and longstanding relationship which is underpinned by the development of a comprehensive strategic partnership between our two nations. We have the highest levels of engagement and respect within the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and its key platforms. The senator has made observations in relation to the differences that exist between us. These are differences which we endeavour to manage with respect, acknowledging that we are very different systems. We are very different culturally and politically, and we have—as we all realise, being elected to a democratic parliament—very different approaches to a number of key areas of governance. That said, though, I think it would be remiss of me not to also acknowledge the depth of the strength of the Chinese-Australian diaspora, for example, in this country, which brings enormous richness and support to our nation and goes back over at least a century. Those of us who are heavily engaged in this area in strategic terms work very closely, but we make our differences clear in a respectful and appropriate way. I appreciate the concerns that Senator Lambie has raised, but they do not lead to the conclusion, on my part, that she has drawn.

           I'll attempt to rephrase my question to the minister for her to answer directly. Has China conducted foreign interference operations against any Australian targets?

            I think Senator Lambie has been part of this chamber for long enough to know and been part of the relevant committees for long enough to know that the Australian government never comments on intelligence matters.

              China says that all suggestions by Australian media and security institutions about Chinese interference are fabrications. So I'm asking the minister about what they're saying—does she believe they're right? And if she doesn't, then why won't the Liberal-National parties support an inquiry into relationships with China?

               I actually missed the very beginning of Senator Lambie's second supplementary question. But I will say that in relation to matters of foreign interference, no matter where they come from, this government has taken a very forward approach on those matters. We have introduced legislation, which has been through this place and the other place, to address issues of foreign interference. We have in the last week, for example, attributed cyberinterference particularly in relation to actions of Russia, and these are things that we take very seriously. We make those decisions and acknowledgment of those issues—
