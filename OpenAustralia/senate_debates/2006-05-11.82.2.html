         Handguns
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        COAG agreed on a national approach to restrict the availability and use of handguns, particularly concealable weapons. The agreement will result in a major reduction in the number of handguns in the community and will significantly strengthen controls over access to handguns.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        COAG endorsed the 28 resolutions made by the Australasian Police Ministers Council (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APMC" rel="nofollow">
         APMC
        </a>
        ) and agreed that legislative and administrative measures to implement the resolutions should be in place by 30 June 2003. The resolutions include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         a system of graduated access to handguns for legitimate sporting shooters, based on training, experience and event participation;
        </li>
        <li>
         giving shooting clubs greater access to information by requiring a prospective member to produce a police clearance prior to acceptance as a member, information on other shooting clubs a person belongs to, and their current ownership of firearms;
        </li>
        <li>
         more stringent requirements to prevent club shopping by potential members of gun clubs, including better access for clubs to information from licensing authorities; and
        </li>
        <li>
         allowing the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioner_of_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Commissioner of Police
         </a>
         in each jurisdiction, subject to appropriate safeguards, to refuse and revoke firearms licences and applications on the basis of criminal intelligence and other relevant information.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        COAG agreed to restrict the classes of legal handguns that can be imported or possessed for sporting purposes to those meeting recognised sporting shooter classifications in the Olympic and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Games
        </a>
        and other accredited events.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        COAG noted the proposals of the APMC but agreed that handguns will be limited to a maximum of .38” calibre (except for specially accredited sporting events where handguns up to .45” calibre will be permitted—details will be considered by Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities as a matter of urgency, with final arrangements to be agreed by COAG).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        COAG noted the importance of removing easily concealable handguns from the community. As a result, COAG agreed that semi-automatic handguns with a barrel length of less than 120mm and revolvers and single shot handguns with a barrel length of less than 100mm will be prohibited. Highly specialised target pistols, some of which will have a barrel length of less than 120mm will be allowed. These types of pistols are large, visually distinctive and not readily concealable due to their overall size.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        COAG also agreed that reducing the number of handguns held legally in the community should be accompanied by a compensation scheme for licensees who are compelled to hand in handguns, operating from 1 July 2003 until 1 January 2004. The cost of funding the compensation scheme will be funded firstly from $15 million remaining from the 1996 firearms buy-back funds and then shared on a two-thirds: one-third basis between the Commonwealth and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
         States and Territories
        </a>
        , for the handguns prohibited and returned in each jurisdiction.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        COAG agreed that an amnesty will be in force from 1 July 2003 until 1 January 2004, during which time owners of illegally held handguns can surrender those weapons to authorities without incurring a criminal penalty for possession of that weapon. Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities are to ensure that the buy-back arrangements are not able to be exploited.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        COAG agreed that the States and Territories would introduce necessary legislation as a priority and there will be ongoing consultation between Police Ministers on arrangements for the buy-back and amnesty. COAG will agree the final arrangements for the national approach. Progress on both legislation and arrangements will be reported at the next meeting of COAG
