        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Women, Senator Cash. Can the minister update the Senate on the government's involvement with the Netball World Cup competition, which commenced in Sydney on Friday?

         I thank Senator McKenzie for the question. On behalf of, I think, everybody in the chamber I congratulate the Australian Diamonds on their outstanding 10-goal win against England last night and wish them the very best for their future games in the World Cup. Last Friday I was honoured to join the Prime Minister and Minister Payne in Sydney for the opening ceremony of the 14th Netball World Cup. The Netball World Cup is held every four years and it is the premier event on the netball calendar. Sydney is this year playing host to the 16 nations playing in the tournament, which will conclude on Sunday. This is the second time this pinnacle event has been held in Sydney and the third time it has been held in Australia. It was held in Sydney in 1991 and, for the Western Australians here, we were privileged to hold the event in Perth in 1967.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian Diamonds are the defending champions, having defeated the

         , Uganda—who appear for just the second time—Wales and Zambia. The opening ceremony on Friday night was a truly spectacular event and a celebration of all things netball. It was capped off with an outstanding win by the Australian Diamonds against Trinidad and Tobago. Our Australian Diamonds are exceptional examples of elite sportswomen in Australia. They show us what can be achieved through hard work and determination, and they certainly give girls the confidence to be successful in any arena they choose.

           I think everybody here can agree that in no sport does Australia dominate like we do in netball— and in no competition do our Australian Diamonds shine like they do in the Netball World Cup. Since 1963 we have won the Netball World Cup 10 out of 13 times. That is over 75 per cent of World Cup titles. That figure would be astonishing in any other sport, but for our Australian Diamonds and our netballers it is just business as usual. We all know about netball's profile in Australia. It has the highest female participation rate of any sport in Australia with 350,000 registered players and an estimated one million players nationwide. It is without doubt a truly grassroots movement, with approximately 80 per cent of games being played at local or state clubs. I hope that in hosting this World Cup we are helping women's sport—
