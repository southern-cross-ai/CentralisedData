         I am sorry to have to tell you this, Senator Chisholm, but the premise of your question is wrong. The premise of your question is wrong because, as I pointed out to your colleague Senator Watt a little earlier, unemployment in Australia at the moment, at 5.6 per cent, is at its lowest level in three years. That is the key indicator of the health of the labour market—the unemployment rate. You can ask about the participation rate, but it is does not follow from that proposition that the labour market is in a poor condition. The unemployment rate, at 5.6 per cent, is the lowest it has been for three years, and there is a reason for that, Senator Chisholm. The reason is that the policies of the Turnbull government are working. The policies of the Turnbull government are working to create more jobs—twice as many new jobs created in the past 12 months as in the last 12 months of the Labor government. Senator Chisholm, I know you were not a member of that government, but I think you were a party official of some description. In the last year of the previous Labor government, the rate of growth of new jobs was half what it has been under this government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Chisholm, it is not a surprise that the unemployment rate is at a three-year low, it is not a surprise that consumer confidence and business confidence is buoyant and it is not a surprise that our exports are booming and that the various contributing sectors to our exports are booming, because the policies of this government are working. If the Labor Party would get out of the way here in the Senate and pass some—

Why are young Australian job seekers the losers under Mr Turnbull?

            Senator Chisholm, let me give you some more relevant information. Total unemployment has fallen by 2,000 in the past month. It has declined over the year. The female unemployment rate is now the lowest it has been since July 2013. That is an employment participation figure that you may care, Senator Chisholm, to deny, but it is the reality and it is an outcome that this government celebrates—the female unemployment rate is the lowest it has been since July 2013.

                , I was simply trying to explain to Senator Chisholm that if you inquire as to the health of the labour market the most relevant inquiry is as to the unemployment rate, which has fallen as a headline rate. The female unemployment rate, in particular, has fallen to the lowest level in three years.

                   Senator Chisholm, the kind of economic leadership that Mr Turnbull has in mind is the kind of economic leadership that sees unemployment fall, as it has done. It is the kind of economic leadership that sees exports boom, as they have done. It is the kind of economic leadership that sees consumer confidence and business confidence boom, as they have done. It is a kind of economic leadership that sees not only the unemployment rate fall but the youth unemployment rate fall to 13.2 per cent from a peak of 14.5 per cent within a year after the coalition government was elected. On every metric you care to identify, Senator Chisholm, whether it be the employment rate, whether it be the strength of the economy, whether it be economic growth of 3.3 per cent—the strongest in the G7—whether it be the strength of exports or whether it be the strength of confidence, this government's economic policies are working.
