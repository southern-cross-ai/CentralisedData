       <p>
        As a servant of the many different people who make up our one Queensland community, tonight I'm going to speak about the need for a royal commission into the federal government's response to COVID-19. Here are the latest reasons why, all coming to light since the last Senate sitting.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, there is the Pfizer 'fakecine' and malignant lymphomas. An article published in the journal
        <i>
         F
        </i>
        <i>
         rontiers
        </i>
        <i>
         in
        </i>
        <i>
         O
        </i>
        <i>
         ncology
        </i>
        in May asked if the emergence of malignant lymphoma, commonly called turbo cancer, was an adverse event caused by the COVID vaccine—the COVID injection. Researchers injected 14 mice with saline and 14 with the Pfizer COVID product. All the mice given the saline remained healthy. The mice injected with Pfizer appeared healthy. However, one died suddenly two days after the booster dose was administered. An autopsy revealed: 'B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma following the intravenous high-dose
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRNA" rel="nofollow">
         MRNA
        </a>
        vaccination, at age 14 weeks.' The autopsy further found:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … diffuse malignant infiltration of multiple extranodal organs (heart, lung, liver, kidney, spleen) by lymphoid neoplasm.
       </p>
       <p>
        How many more of these studies showing fatal outcomes from the COVID products are needed before this government accepts our 30,000 excess deaths in the last 12 months are, in part, caused by these injections?
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, one in 35 recipients of a Moderna COVID booster experienced myocarditis. According to the TGA, myocarditis is a very rare adverse outcome of the COVID injections, occurring at the rate of one in 33,000. A gold-standard, peer-reviewed study by leading cardiologists at the Basel University Hospital in Switzerland found that the rate of myocarditis serious enough to place the patient under restricted activity was not one in 33,000 but one in 35. Forty-four of the 777 participants were found with cardiac troponin markers in their blood at levels that showed their hearts were damaged, and that damage could not have resulted from any other factor but the Pfizer injection. Those same patients demonstrated reduced antibodies against viral and bacterial infections, as against an unvaccinated cohort. The average age of the subjects was only 37 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an age when a heart attack is far from their minds. It's an age when someone would get the injection and then go about their life, including exercising, and in so doing risk serious heart complications or even being another 'died suddenly' statistic. 'Safe' and 'effective' were two lies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Third, hospital deaths from respiratory failure increased after the COVID products were at 90 per cent. This is data from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMO" rel="nofollow">
         ECMO
        </a>
        protocol. ECMO was a controversial and experimental intensive care treatment for COVID. Protocols dictated that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s were not allowed to treat patients in the community with antibiotics—not allowed! Instead, they were told to go home without treatment until they could not breathe. Instead of receiving antibiotics in the community, as they should have, they got sicker and sicker and developed pneumonia. Then they were put on ECMO, and then some of them died. The rate of ECMO protocol use rose from 12,000 in 2020 and 2021 to 18,000 in 2022, despite a 90 per cent COVID injection rate. Many in those cases resulted in death. We can add to this the growing list to data showing that COVID products did more harm than good. Peer reviewed papers show that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fourth item is plasmidgate: the vaccines may be contaminated. Leading virologists have tested the contents of the Pfizer vaccines and found they did not meet the standards set out by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDA" rel="nofollow">
         FDA
        </a>
        for contaminants. COVID vaccines contain mRNA strands, which are grown in a vat using a derivative of
        <i>
         E
        </i>
        <i>
         .
        </i>
        <i>
         c
        </i>
        <i>
         oli
        </i>
        as the base solution. Contaminants from that process are removed and the remaining
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
         DNA
        </a>
        strands are then encased in a protein, called a lipid nanoparticle, to protect the strand. It is impossible to completely remove contaminants, so the FDA and Australia have set a maximum standard for safety of 10 nanograms per dose. Samples tested had contamination of 330 nanograms per dose, 33 times above safe levels. Even worse, some of that contaminant was encased in lipid nanoparticles, protecting the
        <i>
         E.
        </i>
        <i>
         coli
        </i>
        derived genetic material and introducing that into subjects—into people. We don't know the side effects resulting from this genetic material being taken up by the body, and that is malfeasance. It is deliberate ignorance to maintain the safe and effective lie.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fifth, Scottish data shows a clear correlation between COVID injections and neonatal deaths. Data from Scotland shows a clear correlation between the rate of COVID injection in mothers and the rate of neonatal deaths nine months later. Deaths rose in line with vaccination rates and then fell once the booster rate fell. One correlation can be significant, but a correlation between both the increase in injections and then the decrease in injections is telling.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sixth, excess deaths in Australia are 27 per cent above expected levels. That's more than a quarter. Perhaps we do know the side effects of this malfeasance by the TGA and the Department of Health. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        provisional mortality figures to April 2023 show mortality is running at 12.3 per cent above the expected level. But, wait, there's more. When I asked the Australian Bureau of Statistics about this data at Senate estimates, the ABS were very clear in saying this data only shows 85 per cent of the deaths. It's provisional. It is entirely correct to add that to the provisional mortality figure, meaning excess mortality in Australia in April this year was 27 per cent above where it has been since the COVID injections—about where it has been since the COVID injections started. Around 30,000 more Australians have died in the last 12 months than were expected to die, yet this body count is being ignored by our health authorities, by our parliament and by our media.
       </p>
       <p>
        Seventh, Professor Angus Dalgleish has called for the COVID injections to be suspended. Highly respected veteran consulting oncologist Professor Angus Dalgleish has called for the immediate suspension of COVID vaccines because of the high rate of adverse events. The professor went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have no doubt that the vaccines are associated with the current increase in cancers that are being witnessed around the world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … they suppress the innate and T-cell system, making your body much weaker at defending itself from new viruses … This also has the additional effect of disturbing the T-cell surveillance of dominant cancers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the message RNA of the spike of the vaccine binds to genes that normally control cancer
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … It is high time that patients and the medical profession rose against the dreadful imposition of what was essentially mandatory vaccine with no informed consent.
       </p>
       <p>
        They're the professor's words.
       </p>

        could not agree more. We agree entirely. It's time for a royal commission. I call on the Prime Minister to call the COVID royal commission today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to talk briefly about climate science, because we've seen COVID science has been smashed. Earlier today, I promised to talk tonight on why the climate change cult of doom and their rebranding to 'climate boiling' is scientific nonsense. Let me do that now using my favourite thing, empirical scientific data, by referencing a peer reviewed paper titled 'World atmospheric
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
         CO2
        </a>
        , its 14C specific activity, non-fossil component, anthropogenic fossil component, and emissions (1750-2018)', published in
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Physics" rel="nofollow">
          Health Physics
         </a>
        </i>
        journal in February 2022. It's a long title, but it saves the phone calls from fact-checkers. This paper used caesium-14, or 14C, to analyse carbon dioxide in the atmosphere across the period from 1750 to 2018:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After 1750 and the onset of the industrial revolution, the anthropogenic fossil component and the non-fossil component in the total atmospheric CO2 concentration, C(t), began to increase. Despite the lack of knowledge of these two components, claims that all or most of the increase in C(t) since 1800 has been due to the anthropogenic fossil component have continued since they began in 1960 with "
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keeling_Curve" rel="nofollow">
         Keeling Curve
        </a>
        : Increase in CO2 from burning fossil fuel." … The specific activity of 14C in the atmosphere gets reduced by a dilution effect when fossil CO2, which is devoid of 14C, enters the atmosphere. We have used the results of this effect to quantify the two components. … These results negate claims that the increase in C(t) since 1800 has been dominated by the increase of the anthropogenic fossil component. We determined that in 2018, atmospheric anthropogenic fossil CO2 represented 23% of the total emissions since 1750 with the remaining 77% in the exchange reservoirs. Our results show that the percentage of the total CO2 due to the use of fossil fuels from 1750 to 2018 increased from 0% in 1750 to 12% in 2018, much too low to be the cause of global warming.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fundamental basis of the theory of anthropogenic global warming has been found by analysis of atmospheric gases to be completely wrong. Nature, as I've said many times, controls carbon dioxide levels.
