        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Senator Wong. What consultations with the

         I understand from advice received that it is not the case that a stop-work order has been issued. I am advised that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEWHA" rel="nofollow">
          DEWHA
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Environment" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Environment
         </a>
         , Water, Heritage and the Arts, has been in active discussions for some time with Forests
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
          NSW
         </a>
         about their operations as part of an investigation into whether the Environment Protection (Biodiversity and Conservation) Act has been breached. The department requested certain actions by Forests NSW as part of those discussions. I am advised that Minister Garrett has asked his department to intensify its effort to achieve an outcome which is good for both the environment and local jobs. I am also advised that Minister Garrett’s expectation is that these matters ought be resolved before 31 May. However, if necessary the Commonwealth government is prepared to agree an appropriate time line for the resolution of these matters with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government as part of these negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the timeframe, I understand that the department became aware first of potential contraventions of the act in May 2008. There was a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Parks_Association" rel="nofollow">
          National Parks Association
         </a>
         report alleging that river redgum forestry operations in New South Wales Murray and Murrumbidgee state forests have significantly impacted upon Ramsar wetlands and on listed threatened species. I am also advised that these forests contain the last remaining remnants of river redgums in the region and are the last remaining stronghold for a number of state and nationally threatened species, of which the superb parrot is just one. DEWHA has visited the forestry areas in question and has been investigating whether any breach of the act has occurred. I am advised that the department has been raising these issues directly with Forests NSW since July 2008.

          Primary Industries Minister, Ian Macdonald, when he said that the ban ‘put 875 jobs at risk in a part of New South Wales already struggling to deal with the effects of prolonged drought’ and when he said: ‘I have no idea why the federal government would take this action right at this time. That is quite a significant employment level when we’re talking about areas which are already devastated by drought and have lost hundreds of workers’?

           Obviously the good minister from

            New South Wales
           </a>
           has put his views on the public record, and if the senator has questions about that he probably ought address them to the good minister. What I can advise—this is in relation to the part of the primary question I did not have the opportunity to address—is that I am advised that the department has requested that Forests
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
            NSW
           </a>
           cease certain types of harvesting activity and cease activity in the Ramsar site. There has not been a request, on the advice provided to Minister Garrett and through him to me, for the cessation of all harvesting. As I said earlier, Minister Garrett has indicated that his expectation is that the department will intensify its effort to achieve a satisfactory outcome.

              EPBC

             Act. These matters have been raised with Forests

              NSW
             </a>
             on the advice provided to me since July 2008. I am not sure what the allegation is in Senator Colbeck’s question in terms of the support of the science. The fact is that Minister Garrett and his department are charged with implementing and administering an act that was passed, in fact, by the government of which you were a part, Senator. They do so, obviously, to the appropriate standard. I have indicated to the senator the minister’s expectation about negotiations.
