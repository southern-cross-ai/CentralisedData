         Procedure Committee

        in its first report of 2021 have effect during the sittings of the Senate from 8 to 10 February 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        In doing so, I do just note and reinforce to senators that this is a time-limited extension of the eligibility to participate in remote sittings for this sitting week only. We have continued to extend remote participation as border controls and other restrictions have existed around the country, but it is the wish of the government and I believe of other parties to ensure that remote participation is not a permanent feature of this place. No senator should automatically assume that it will be extended for other sittings, and we will continue to monitor carefully the COVID situation around the country and work cooperatively across the chamber to ensure that participation is available to senators but also that the appropriate place for Senate participation, being here in this chamber, is the paramount consideration in the long term. I thank the Senate.

         The opposition would like to associate itself with the comments made by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Leader of the Government in the Senate
         </a>
         around extending remote participation for this period of two weeks, acknowledging that there are border restrictions still in place in WA and quite widespread community transmission of COVID. However, we don't see remote participation as a permanent feature of the Senate and it should remain under review each sitting period. Our view is that people, if they are able to, should attend the Senate in person. It has served a purpose during these unprecedented times, but it is time limited, and senators should be aware that that is certainly the thinking of the opposition on this matter.

          I want to make sure of the stance of the Jacqui Lambie Network on remote participation: the sooner it is over the better. You're all talking about the country getting back to normality. Quite frankly, unless you have a medical certificate, you should be sitting in this chamber. It's as simple as that.
