        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has repeatedly put on record its strong support for the work of the Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) and agrees with the Senate Committee’s assessment that the ALRC's work is widely respected.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since its establishment in 1973, the ALRC has concluded more than 100 inquiries and has made a substantial contribution to the public debate on issues as diverse as privacy, personal insolvency, the use of genetic information, admiralty law and the operation of the federal justice system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This contribution continues, with the ALRC’s recent work with the

        (2010). The recommendations in this report are helping to shape the Government’s response to this complex issue, including by influencing the landmark Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill 2011 that is currently before this Parliament.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ALRC is currently going through a period of transition. Reforms made to the Australian Law Reform Commission Act 1996 (the Act) by the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010 give the ALRC greater flexibility in the way it goes about its work whilst providing an appropriate governance framework that preserves its independence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government believes that the reforms will generate opportunities and ongoing benefits for the Commission, and is committed to working closely with the Commission as it adapts to these changes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6.1 The committee recommends that the

        As with other Australian Government agencies, the Commission is required to meet the efficiency dividend.

         The Commission

        ’s budget was also reduced in the 2009 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the savings from which are a key component of the Government’s commitment to returning the Budget to surplus and maintaining spending restraint to support long-term stability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is satisfied that the ALRC has sufficient funding to discharge its important statutory function – to conduct inquiries into matters referred to it by the Attorney-General.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ALRC is implementing a range of measures that will provide substantial savings over time, but which will not compromise the delivery of its core work. These measures include relocating to more affordable premises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the interim, additional financial assistance is being provided to the ALRC through the Attorney-General’s Department to allow the appointment of a second full-time commissioner to assist for the duration of the review of the National Classification Scheme. Terms of reference for this inquiry were released on 24 March 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has full confidence in the ability of the President of the ALRC, Professor Rosalind Croucher, to manage the organisation within its appropriation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6.2 The committee recommends that the ALRC Act be amended to provide for a minimum of two standing, fixed-term (not inquiry-specific), full-time commissioners.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6.3 The committee recommends that an additional full-time commissioner be appointed, for each additional inquiry referred to the ALRC, in circumstances where the ALRC already has two or more ongoing inquiries.

        Government Response to Recommendations 2 and 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not accepted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A key aspect of the reforms contained in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010 is the removal of mandated numbers of commissioners. The purpose of this reform is to allow the ALRC to use its appropriation more flexibly in responding to the work it has on hand. This revised structure takes into account the varied, and often highly technical, subject matters of inquiries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As outlined in relation to Recommendation 1, the Government has appointed a second full time Commissioner, Professor Terry Flew, for the duration of the inquiry into the National Classification System. Professor Flew’s expertise in media and communications will be a great asset to the Commission for this review.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government anticipates that the second Commissioner position will continue to be filled beyond the inquiry into the National Classification System. In keeping with the Government’s desire for greater flexibility, the Government would look to fill the position in a way that best suits the ALRC’s program of work at the time of any appointment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Attorney-General is committed to ensuring that consultation with the ALRC on its capacity to take on new work continues to occur before new references are given.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6.4 The committee recommends that the ALRC's public information and education services program be resumed immediately.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Government Response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a matter for the President to determine the best use the ALRC’s resources to undertake inquiries into matters referred to it by the Attorney-General.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        6.5 The committee recommends that the ALRC be provided with all necessary resources to enable it to continue to travel to undertake face-to-face consultations as part of its inquiry processes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the Government agrees that there is value in face-to-face consultations, the ALRC’s innovative use of online consultation practices demonstrates the variety of ways in which a law reform body can reach stakeholders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As it approaches 40 years at the forefront of law reform in this country, the Government believes the ALRC is well equipped to respond to new challenges and opportunities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has an ambitious law reform agenda and is confident the ALRC will make a significant contribution to that agenda.

        The Australian Government has a continuing commitment to investing in the economy's productive capacity through better and more targeted skills and training, measures to boost participation, and improving the private sector's opportunities to invest in infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, announced as part of the 2011-2012 Budget, the Government has invested in a new approach to deliver the skilled workers the economy needs. The package has four components:

        The package strengthens and extends the role of industry in the national

        ) system. The involvement of industry in the Australian VET system has been a defining feature of vocational education and training in Australia for almost two decades, and has given rise to its high international standing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Primarily, industry engagement is realised by representation of industry bodies on, and industry direct input to, the various formal committees and councils that guide the policy agenda for the national training system. This high level of engagement at all levels of decision making ensures that industry plays a leading role in driving training policies, priorities and delivery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The core of industry's leadership of VET in Australia is also realised through its active involvement in the development of industry-validated

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC" rel="nofollow">
         ISC

        s), industry has a direct say in determining relevant skills needs for the industry and defining the competencies required in the workplace.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since ISCs were established in 2005, their role and responsibilities in the national VET system has been expanded and strengthened. ISCs are recognised and accepted as key organisations underpinning the effectiveness of the national VET system and key sources of advice regarding workforce skills and training needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Building Australia's Future Workforce package reflects the significant role of ISCs in the national VET system. ISCs will be key contributors to the implementation of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package through participation and collaboration in all four of the package's components, for example, in the National Workforce and Productivity Agency, National Workforce Development Fund, Language, Literacy and Numeracy Programs and Apprenticeship reform.

        ISCs, and a new national industry training advisory body for the automotive industry-Auto Skills Australia, are privately registered companies run by industry-based boards of directors (employer and employee representatives). Their funding is provided substantially by the Australian Government through the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (

       <p class="italic">
        Since their inception in 2005, ISCs have built on their role in the key area of developing and maintaining Training Packages and have grown into their strengthened role in workforce development under the Government's Skilling Australia for the Future policy announced in November 2007. The success of ISCs and recognition of the value of the ISCs contribution to the effectiveness of the national VET system has led to increased demands and expectations in relation to the range and volume of services that ISCs could provide under the core Funding Agreement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The core Funding Agreement provides a strong framework that enables DEEWR to monitor and manage the ISCs' performance of their key roles and responsibilities and to ensure expenditure of government funding accords with these. However, the Australian Government recognises that the funding provided under the core Funding Agreement does not and cannot cover the range of all of the possible activities that ISCs could undertake as contributors to the national VET system. The scope of what ISCs can do is limited by the funding they receive under the core Funding Agreement and their related capacity. ISCs' Annual Business Plans provide a mechanism that enables DEEWR to ensure that funds provided through DEEWR-ISCs core Funding Agreements are spent in accordance with the purpose of these Agreements and Government priorities. Under the Funding Agreement ISCs, must provide an Annual Business Plan for DEEWR approval.

        The following comments are offered in relation to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        '...The production of training materials should only be considered where there is a demonstrated. unmet need and any conflict of interest is avoided.'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ISCs are the only bodies that have a mandate to develop and maintain Training Packages. A Training Package is an integrated set of nationally endorsed units of competency, Australian Qualification Framework qualifications and assessment guidelines designed for a specific industry, an industry sector or enterprise.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Training materials are the materials or resources that are developed to support the delivery of and/or assessment of Training Package qualifications. ISCs do not have an exclusive mandate to develop training materials; these materials may be developed by other organisations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While ISCs are allowed, and may, under the core Funding Agreement develop training materials, given the limitations of the funding available, the associated capacity constraints and the number of demands on these resources, ISCs have to carefully prioritise their activities and, as a consequence, the majority of ISCs do not develop training materials.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ISCs as independent companies are able to develop training materials from sources other than funds provided under the core Funding Agreement. Some ISCs do have a commercial `arm' of their organisation with which DEEWR has no contractual relationship.

        The requirement for ISCs to produce an annual Environmental Scan (E-Scan) was first introduced in 2008 by the National Quality Council (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NQC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Employment responsible, until 1 July 2011, when the National Standards Council becomes operational, for the Training Package Development and Endorsement Policy. The NQC's Training Package Development and Endorsement Policy provides the policy framework for the timing, style and focus of the E-Scan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DEEWR has provided the ISCs with a template and guidelines to assist with the development of E-Scans. The guidelines and templates are regularly reviewed in
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        consultation with Skills Australia and with the ISCs' CEOs. The guidelines and template for the E-Scans are updated in response to the feedback and in alignment with the NQC's Training Package Development and Endorsement Policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The focus of E-Scans, as described in the Training Package Development and Endorsement Policy, is to provide a national high level snap shot of current and emerging skills needs based on industry intelligence. Thus the E-Scans do not purport to, and cannot provide an enterprise, jurisdiction or region with a detailed workforce and skills development plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The requirement to deliver an annual E-Scan is also a requirement of DEEWR-ISCs Funding Agreement, which stipulates its delivery date for each ISC as the end of February each year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The productivity and participation focus of the Government has increased the need for a more systematic approach to workforce development and for matching skills and training delivery with the current and future needs of industry, sectors and regions. As a consequence, the expectations of E-Scans have increased over the last few years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A new independent agency, the National Workforce and Productivity Agency, will be established under the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. Its role will include the development of sectoral skills and workforce development plans in conjunction with ISCs and industry. The provision of independent advice on sectoral and regional skills needs to support workforce planning and productivity, including small business, will be critical to this particular role.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the context of the new Agency's roles and activities, the role and content of E-Scans may need to be reviewed, taking into account that ISCs are not research, or data gathering and analysis agencies and may have a limited capacity to develop E-Scans that may be needed in the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the evolving and growing expectations of E-Scans and ISCs' role in this regard are acknowledged, the E-Scans, as a requirement of the Training Package Development and Endorsement policy, remain for now as specified by this policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Senate Committee also recommends that the ISCs CEOs' Forum develops a template and mechanism to achieve greater consistency in the timing and reporting of E-Scans. However, given that these considerations are covered by current policy and that the CEOs' Forum is an informal body, the CEOs' Forum may not be the most appropriate body to consider the changes to the template and to E-Scans generally. Its advice and views on E-Scans may be sought in the future in the context of current policy review, when undertaken.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the government develops standard contracts with clauses detailing accountability and reporting requirements for all paid works undertaken by ISCs under contract to government agencies. These standard clauses should be incorporated into contracts between DEEWR and each ISC.

        and Accountability Regulations, Commonwealth Grant Guidelines and the DEEWR Procurement Manual and, as such, provide a sound accountability and reporting framework.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ISC core Funding Agreement incorporates the standard DEEWR contractual requirements and clauses and the same template is used for all DEEWR core Funding Agreements with ISCs.

        A key reporting requirement in the core Funding Agreement relates to financial accountability. It includes Annual Audited Financial Statements and a Final Audited Financial Statement and Acquittal of Funds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The payment of instalments under the core Funding Agreement is linked to DEEWR's acceptance of satisfactory progress against requirements and deliverables described in the Agreement. DEEWR is able to withhold payments until satisfied with the quality and content of the reportable item. Thus ISC core Funding Agreements provide a strong and consistent reporting framework and mechanisms to ensure that ISCs are accountable for the expenditure of funds and the delivery of the project outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The existing DEEWR standard Funding Agreement and relevant clauses provide sufficient mechanisms and frameworks to ensure that legal and fiduciary requirements are followed and met. In recognition of the importance of accountability and reporting requirements, DEEWR in the new Funding Agreement with ISCs for 2011-2014 has further strengthened reporting requirements using the existing standard clauses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While Government funding provided via the Funding Agreement is the main source of ISCs revenue as independent companies, ISCs also access funding from other sources. which may include other Australian Government Departments as well as state and territory governments.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ISCs are independent companies registered with ASIC and they are subject to the Corporations Act 2001 (Act). Under the Act, directors of a corporation must ensure that the corporation is trading solvently. A necessary corollary of solvency is to ensure that the corporation has sufficient reserves to meet existing statutory obligation. Additionally, the core ISC Funding Agreement requires that ISCs comply with all statutory obligations including the obligation to trade solvently. There is no need to duplicate ASIC requirements or to include additional clauses in the Funding Agreement to address the requirement to trade solvently.

        `.... prohibit the ownership by Industry Skills Councils of physical assets, such as real estate....'
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the terms of the current Funding Agreement, ISCs could acquire physical assets as long as the asset was under $100,000 and as long as the asset was used for the purposes of the DEEWR-ISC Funding Agreement. Any purchase involving funds of $100,000 or over requires DEEWR's approval. This constraint clearly would not allow ISCs under the current funding arrangements to purchase any real estate from the core government funds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As ISCs are independent legal entities, DEEWR is not in a position to prevent them from purchasing real estate with funds from sources other than those provided by DEEWR.

        Recommendation 5

These Sections identify that it is a director's obligation not to place his or her own interests or those of persons with whom a director is linked, ahead of that of the corporation. This applies not only to use of the position of a director, but also to the use of information that comes to the director.
