         Thank you, Senator Fawcett. I'm sure that Senator Fawcett would agree that Australia has a proud record of working with our international allies to help people escape from a crisis, such as what we are seeing in Gaza right now. The war between Israel and Hamas has displaced millions of Palestinians, and Australia has once again done its part. But we've not allowed this to comprise our national security. Our security and intelligence agencies have taken exactly the same approach here as they took with Ukrainians who arrived after the Russian invasion in 2022 and with Afghans who fled from the Taliban, under the former government.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm a little surprised to hear someone like Senator Fawcett, who I know has a great deal of respect for our armed forces and our security agencies, question the judgement—

              Senator Fawcett, as I've already implied and will now make explicit, we are following exactly the same process as what occurred under the former government. Applicants for visas are checked for security risks, which is the case here. We are following exactly the same process.

              , has said that this is the same process as what was followed under the former government and is the appropriate process. I think the question for the opposition is whether they have faith in ASIO or not.

                Minister, the issue for you is that in the same interview the director-general said: 'When things get referred to
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                 ASIO
                </a>
                , we deal with them effectively. Of course, there might be times when they didn't get referred to us in time.' Is this why multiple individuals leaving Gaza had their Australian visas cancelled after they had been granted?

                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
                  ASIO
                 </a>
                 to provide advice that certain individual's visas should be cancelled or not granted, rather than not make that decision. That's an example of ASIO doing its job and the government listening to the advice of ASIO. Would the opposition seriously prefer us to ignore the advice of ASIO? What we've done in some instances is cancel visas when security checks have revealed that those individuals should not be granted a visa.

                     is adopting is exactly the same process as ASIO adopted under the former government. We listen with respect to the advice of our security agencies, including from Mr Burgess as the Director-General of ASIO. Where he and his colleagues provide advice that a visa should not be issued or should be cancelled, we accept that advice.

                       Media reports suggest that the Albanese government is developing a visa pathway to allow temporary visa holders from Palestine to remain in Australia. Minister, will you make a commitment to the Australian people that not a single Hamas supporter will be brought into Australia under this scheme?

                       <p>
                        Thank you, Senator Fawcett. I saw the comments of Mr Burgess on this matter on the
                        <i>
                         I
                        </i>

                        program, and I'm sure you can go and have a look at them yourself. He explained the approach of our national security agency to people who have expressed views about Hamas. Again, we respect the advice of our security agencies and people like Mr Burgess, and we act on that advice, so I'm confident that ministers will act in accordance with that advice when those decisions are required.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        I also saw Mr Burke, the incoming home affairs minister, make the very obvious point that Gaza is a war zone. People were provided with tourist visas initially in order to get them out of a conflict zone quickly after security checks had been undertaken. It is unrealistic to think that it is proper or safe to return people to a conflict zone like Gaza, which is why further consideration is being given to their status going forward.
