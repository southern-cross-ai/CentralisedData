        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. I refer to the misinformation campaign following the decision of the independent Fair Work Commission on penalty rates. Can the minister update the Senate on the government's response to this misinformation?

         I thank Senator Hume for the question. As you would expect, Labor and the unions have deliberately sought to mislead the Australian people in relation to the decision of the independent Fair Work Commission when it comes to penalty rates. Colleagues on this side of the chamber know why. This is nothing more and nothing less than a desperate attempt by the current Leader of the Opposition to hide from what is a very, very inconvenient truth. Let us put the facts on the record insofar as Mr Shorten is concerned. When he was the leader of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Workers Union
         </a>
         —and at that time he had the responsibility of representing the workers—what did Mr Shorten do? He sold the workers down the river! And how did he do that? Mr Shorten, the 'champion of the working man and working woman', did a deal whereby he saw their penalty rates either reduced or removed. Mr Shorten had the penalty rates of some of the lowest paid workers in this country removed—and he was meant to be representing their interests!
        </p>
        <p>
         Why would a leader of a union charged with representing the interests of the workers sell them down the river? Let me tell you why. The company Cleanevent made a secret payment to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
          AWU
         </a>
         to continue this arrangement for several years, to continue the arrangement of stripping the workers' penalty rates, which Mr Shorten himself did when he was head of the union charged with representing their interests. He ripped the workers off—solely and with intent.

            The reality is this. Unfortunately, small businesses in this country have had an unfair disadvantage because Mr Shorten and Labor are very happy for big unions and big businesses to do deals which basically either remove or reduce penalty rates for workers on Sundays. Small business is not afforded the same opportunity. Let us have a look at some of the deals that have been done and how it creates an unfair playing field. A bed-and-breakfast, a small business, must pay $10 more per hour on Sundays than a five-star hotel. A family chicken shop must pay $8 an hour more than
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KFC" rel="nofollow">
             KFC
            </a>
            . A family owned takeaway must pay $8 an hour more than
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's" rel="nofollow">
             McDonald's
            </a>
            . A family greengrocer must pay $5 an hour more than Woolworths. The decision of the Fair Work Commission helps small business and levels the playing field so they have half a chance against the big union deals.

               Colleagues, this is yet another inconvenient truth for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
                Bill Shorten

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Labor Party
               </a>
               . The Fair Work Commission, this independent tribunal, was set up by the Australian Labor Party in 2009. The Labor Party then tasked the Fair Work Commission to review all awards every four years. As workplace relations minister—he does like to do things himself, like rip off workers and their penalty rates—Mr Shorten amended the Fair Work Act to specifically ensure that penalty rates were considered as part of this process. But they have even more ownership of this decision. Mr Shorten and Labor actually appointed the members of the commission who sat on the panel and made the decision. Good old President Iain Ross is one of those from the other side. So Mr Shorten made the rules, appointed the umpire and insisted on the decision—and now he is running a mile!
