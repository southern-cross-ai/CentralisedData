         The opposition will support these amendments, and I appreciate the government working with the opposition in relation to these changes. These changes are important for providing certainty for Australians and Australian employers. The amendments will provide clarity and certainty for businesses and employees on their rights and obligations that they are not competing between the antidiscrimination laws and the work health and safety laws. We're also supportive of further clarifying the application period for the compliance notices.

          </a>
          162 are technical refinements to provide greater certainty and clarity on the operation of the bill and to allow for additional consideration of the proposed reforms to cost protections.
         </p>
         <p>
          To outline each of those amendments, amendment (1) relates to third parties in positive duty. This amendment would add the words 'by any person' to the end of the headings of subsections 47C(4) and 47C(5), amending them to read 'other conduct towards employees and workers by any person'. The purpose of this amendment is to clarify that subsections 47C(4) and 47C(5) cover conduct engaged in by third parties or other persons such as customers and suppliers. This means that an employer or person conducting a business or undertaking must take measures to protect their employees or workers from certain conduct by third parties such as customers.
         </p>
         <p>
          The second amendment would make a technical correction to the current language used in paragraph 47(6)(c) of the

           Sex Discrimination
          </a>
          Act as inserted by the bill. Amendment (3) would add an additional subsection to the positive duty in section 47C of the bill to provide that it does not limit, or otherwise affect, a duty that a duty holder has under Commonwealth and state or territory health and safety laws. And amendment (4) would provide an explicit time frame for a person to seek judicial review of a compliance notice that has been issued by the Human Rights Commission in relation to noncompliance with the positive duty. Amendment (5) is in relation to cost protection. This amendment would remove schedule 5 of the bill which was going to insert a cost protection provision in the

            Australian Greens
           </a>
           to indicate that we will be supporting these government amendments. They're all of a technical nature. I particularly welcome item 1, which extends the positive duty obligations on an employer to address improper and harassing behaviour by customers or clients or contractors. That's a very meaningful extension and a very important one.
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to item 5, as I mentioned earlier, we're really pleased that the government has dropped their proposed cost changes. There was real concern that this would have put barriers in the way of people accessing and enforcing these new rights, and we very much welcome the agreement that the government reached with the Greens to look more closely at these issues and, indeed, to look at potentially making access to justice more accessible for all protected attributes not just for harassment on the grounds of gender. That's why we won't be moving the joint amendment between the Greens and the Jacqui Lambie Network on sheet 1700 today—because the government has now dropped their cost provisions and has agreed to expedite a review to, ideally, come to an approach where, if a complainant is successful, they can get the cost awarded, but, if they're not successful, they don't face that risk of having to pay their employer's legal costs. That's the ideal scenario that many experts have pushed for, and that's what we hope will be found in the review. Of course, we'll come back to this chamber and, ideally, legislate those stronger provisions in due course.

              These are joint amendments between the Greens and the Jacqui Lambie Network. I thank the government for their indication that they will support these amendments. These amendments would require a comprehensive review of the operation of the act, not just a review of the costs provisions—which we've also reached agreement with the government on—but a broader review of the operation of the whole act to make sure that it is delivering on its intentions, to make sure that employers and employees have the support and guidance that they need for the operation of these provisions. We commend these amendments to the chamber.

                The coalition will support these amendments. An independent review, with a report to the parliament, will ensure we can make any changes necessary to ensure any deficiency in this amendment legislation is identified and puts forward a pathway to address these potential issues. It is important these significant changes are reviewed for how they are operating, and, for this reason, the coalition will be supporting the review.

                 I will briefly outline the nature of these amendments. Amendments (1) to (3) pertain to amending the hostile workplace environment provisions. As drafted, the bill's hostile workplace environment provisions apply primarily to interactions between individuals. One person must directly subject another person to the hostile environment. But requiring this nexus fails to clearly target those who create or perpetuate a hostile work environment, as opposed to those whose behaviour is encouraged by that environment. Individuals who discriminate or harass will already be captured by other sections—28A and 28AA—so, unless it's made clear that section 28M goes beyond individuals to those creating the environment in which misconduct is fostered, 28M will not achieve its aims. We think this is an amendment that gives effect to the genuine intent of the Jenkins recommendation. It's clear that strong and clear hostile work environment provisions would assist the bill to achieve its key aim. So we particularly commend amendments (1) to (3). I understand that we will not be receiving support for those amendments, which is precisely why we need a review of this bill. So I'm pleased that the previous amendments did pass. I flag that we'll be progressing clarity-style amendments along these lines when that review is underway.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I will briefly outline what amendment (4) does. The steps needed to create a safe workplace will differ between workplaces and industries. In our view, staff are best placed to identify the key risks in their workplace and how to address them. For this reason, staff should be consulted as part of the positive duty obligations, to ensure that what an employer is doing is targeted and is effective. If employers are serious about making workplaces safer, they do actually need to talk to their staff about particular risks in their workplace and what should be done to address them. Many employers will do that. Sadly, others will not. Employers need to report on the actions that they take, and they need to regularly review whether those actions are actually working. Anything else is just lip-service. That's why we've drafted our amendments to that effect, to require employers to talk with their staff and regularly report on if the positive duty is properly being implemented. The bill requires the Human Rights Commission to publish guidelines on how to comply with the positive duty, so our amendment also gives those guidelines some teeth by requiring the employer and the commission itself have regard to those guidelines in determining whether an employer has met that duty.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Human Rights Commission requested the change in amendment (5) in the inquiry on the bill. The Human Rights Commission can issue compliance notices to employers that they believe are not meeting their positive duty obligations. The employer can then do nothing, they can dispute the notice or they can respond to the notice and enter into an enforceable undertaking setting out what changes they will make. The
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHRC" rel="nofollow">
                  AHRC
                 </a>
                 can currently publish those enforceable undertakings. But they are not permitted under this bill to publish those compliance notices, and it's our view that allowing the commission the discretion to publish compliance notices would improve the transparency for employees and the guidance for other employers. It's important that employers know that these changes have teeth and that people are watching, and if the commission serves a compliance notice, it is in the public interest, in my view, for people to know about that. That's why we think the commission should be given the discretion to publish those compliance notices, not just the subsequent enforcement notices when the compliance notices have been ignored. So we commend those amendments to the chamber.

                  The government will not be accepting the amendments circulated by Senator Waters in relation to these provisions. Comprehensive reasons for the government's position were given in the House, and I would refer people to those reasons for more detail. But in brief, the government considers the hostile work environment amendments as not necessary, as substantial contribution to the creation or maintenance of a hostile work environment would already be covered by what it means to subject someone to a hostile work environment. The amendments would also broaden the protected attributes that would be covered by the prohibition on hostile work environments, and this is beyond the scope of what was recommended by the

                  The amendment on positive duty matters to be taken into account would add two further factors to be considered by the Human Rights Commission when determining whether someone has complied with the positive duty. These amendments are not necessary. The commission's guidelines would inform their assessment of compliance with the positive duty. It's not necessary to legislate for this.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Finally, the amendment put forward in relation to publication of positive duty compliance notices would provide the President of the Human Rights Commission with the power to publish a compliance notice on the commission's website. This amendment is not supported, as it may be counterproductive to the objective of achieving compliance with the positive duty. As I said, comprehensive reasons were provided for the government's position in opposing these amendments, but that just sums it up very much in brief.

                    </a>
                    . The welcome repeal of section 13 of the Sex Discrimination Act by the respect at work bill of 2021 removed the restriction that had prevented state government employees accessing remedies under the Commonwealth regime. But the repeal was not made retrospective, and this meant that a number of state government employees remained locked out of seeking justice. Section 47A, which was introduced at the same time and allowed civil action for victimising conduct, was given retrospective effect in recognition of the justice denied to victims by the option not having been made available previously. The same right should be extended to those excluded by section 13. It would still be subject to the statute of limitations as a reasonable time limit on claims. We are seeking to move this amendment to redress that inequity and that inconsistency.

                     The government will be opposing this amendment. The government doesn't support making amendments from the respect at work act of last year retrospective in operation. The respect at work act of 2021 repealed section 13 of the

                     </a>
                     . The amendments to section 13 last year did not apply retrospectively because they created a new form of liability that didn't previously exist. Retrospective operation is only appropriate in very limited circumstances. That's a longstanding principle. Each state and territory has antidiscrimination laws prohibiting sexual harassment and sex discrimination, providing an avenue for state and territory employees to make a complaint for conduct that occurred prior to the amendments at the Commonwealth level last year.

                        I'll make some brief comments in relation to the amendments. Proposed section 28M does not include the words 'in relation to'. This merely brings the text into line with existing obligations. As currently drafted, the proposed prohibition may extend to instances where the complainant has no exposure to the conduct that causes the hostile work environment. In practice, this may mean that an employee could make a complaint under proposed section 28M without ever being in the vicinity of the alleged conduct. We've introduced amendment (1) to ensure that the relevant conduct occurs in relation to the second person. Proposed section 28M includes the words 'after the conduct occurs'. Given the possibility of large organisations with workplaces distributed across multiple locations, it is important that the person was in the workplace at the time that the conduct occurred. We have introduced amendment (2) to delete the words 'after the conduct occurs'.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In relation to the positive duty, section 47C would require employers and persons conducting the business undertaking to take measures to eliminate as far as possible certain conduct under work health and safety law. The obligation imposed on PCBUs is to ensure the health and safety of their workers as far as is reasonably practicable. We've introduced amendments (3) and (5) to bring this provision within the well-understood existing position of industrial relations law by using the formulation 'as far as reasonably practicable'. In terms of shifting the enforcement inquiries to the Fair Work Ombudsman, in order to avoid regulatory overlap and duplications in compliance regimes, we have proposed to shift the enforcement powers for the positive duty to the Fair Work Ombudsman. We've proposed to shift the inquiry powers to the Fair Work Ombudsman to prevent an employer being investigated by more than one body in relation to the same conduct and to avoid any conflict between the conciliation and inquiry functions of the Australian Human Rights Commission.

                        . Allowing a party who is not an aggrieved party to have standing to commence a claim, as this provision does, is a significant departure from Australia's class action laws. Representative groups are not prohibited from providing financial or legal support to parties pursuing a representative proceedings in the court. Rather they are simply prevented from commencing the proceedings on their behalf.

                          will be opposing these provisions, particularly items (1) and (2), which would change the hostile work environment provisions to require that the conduct be directed at a complainant. The individual complainant approach defeats the purpose of having provisions creating a workplace and cultural change approach, so wrong way, go back. Items (3) and (4) would weaken the positive duty by requiring employers to do simply what is reasonably practicable rather than what is possible to make the workplace safe. We won't support a weakening of the positive duty. The proposal to give compliance powers to the

                          would fly in the face of Ms Jenkins's recommendations, which identify the AHRC as the best compliance agency, given its expertise.

                          Again, on item 10 to scrap the representative actions provisions, the Greens believe representative actions are a key reform in allowing complaints to be made without exposing individual workers. Lastly, the proposal in item 11 is to revert to the previous government's weak version of the objectives clause, which would seek equality of opportunity rather than substantive equality. Structural gender inequality is not simply about denial of opportunity. It reflects how discrimination, stereotypes and other factors can affect people's capacity to take up opportunities. The goal of substantive equality recognises that opportunities need to be offered differently in some circumstances in order to overcome structural barriers and achieve substantive equality. For all those reasons, we won't be supporting any of these amendments.

                          The CHAIR: Senator Cash has moved amendments (1) to (11) on 1752. I am required to put those amendments by two questions. I will take you through the questions before I put them. The first question is that amendments (1) to (6), (8) and (9) be agreed to. Regardless of the outcome, I will then put the second question, which will be that items 17 to 22, 24 and 25 of schedule 2, schedule 4, and item 2 of schedule 8 stand as printed, and item 23 of schedule 2 stand as amended.
