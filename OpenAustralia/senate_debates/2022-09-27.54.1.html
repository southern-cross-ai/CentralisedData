        Islands in May 2021 clearly stated the federal government breached their fundamental rights to culture and life. What will the new Labor government do to ensure they uphold Indigenous rights as part their climate policy and planning, in particular article 27—the right to culture—and article 17—the right to be free from arbitrary interference with privacy, family and home?

         Thank you, Senator Cox, for the question. She is correct that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Human Rights Committee found on Friday 23 September that Australia had violated the rights of a group of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait
         </a>
         Islanders by failing to adequately protect them from the impacts of climate change. The finding was made in response to a 2019 complaint filed by eight
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         s from small or low-lying islands in the Strait. This is a reminder, if I may say, before I try to respond to the second part of the question, of what the Labor Party has been saying for years, which is that climate change was an existing threat to island nations and island homes, both in the Pacific region but also in the Torres Strait. I can recall going to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saibai_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Saibai Island
         </a>
         when I was climate minister in 2008 or 2009 and seeing first hand what was already occurring as a result of increased storm surge, how that was eroding coastline and eroding infrastructure. It is a reminder yet again of the irresponsibility of those opposite, who, for nine years, refused to do anything about this.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the broader issue, which is how you try to give effect to and keep faith with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         peoples, we have a long way to go on this. I acknowledge that. Part of what we're trying do with our First Nations ambassador and First Nations foreign policy initiatives is work through how it is that we bring the perspective of First Nations people into the work that we do into the world, including on climate. I was very grateful to have Senator Dodson accompany me to the

           Australia can no longer hide behind the myth that scope 3 emissions are not their responsibility and they are free of legal obligation after this landmark case. What are the decisive steps this government is taking to drastically cut emissions and invest in adaptation measures in the

            In relation to the first part, we are not hiding behind anything. That is the framework the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             United Nations
            </a>
            has agreed, so let's be clear about that. We are adhering to a finding that the world community has agreed. We will take decisive steps, as we are taking for the first time in a decade, to reduce emissions. Under our policy, in excess of 80 per cent of Australia's energy—despite the fact we have vast fossil fuel resources—the overwhelming majority of our energy this decade will be renewable. That is a substantial step.

            In relation to the broader issue of adaptation I would make the point that we are clear about the need to try and help, or work with,

              Islander brothers and sisters and their children, who echo their neighbouring Indigenous nations of the Asia-Pacific and globally, to say no to new coal and gas projects on their ancestral lands that breach their human rights, fast-tracking the destruction of our culture and climate and risking their livelihoods?

                First Nations
               </a>
               communities, Australia's environmental assessment regime will ensure those voices are heard. I think you have seen from senators in this place on this side and, I would hope, from some from the other side a recognition that that is an important part of ensuring approvals meet the community test, the social licence test.

We intend to engage in good faith with them and with the views of the human rights committee.
