         Perhaps I could just clarify the question. You are asking about Dr Ricketson, correct? Then the answer is no.

            I thank the minister very much for that very concise and clear answer, which we are particularly interested in. What disclosures and assurances have you sought from Dr Ricketson about the extent of the contact between him and the

             I did see reference to this conspiracy theory, being run by Mr Turnbull, that a group of academics and journalists wrote to Senator Brown with some policy issues. I was a little surprised, because—and I will let you in on a secret—he wrote to me as well. It is my understanding that he actually wrote to a whole range of people. He did not just write to Senator Brown. I am taking a wild guess, but I suspect he may have written to some members of the opposition as well. I certainly received the same letter that Senator Brown received, so I was fully aware of Professor Ricketson's views in these areas. In fact, one of the reasons somebody might be chosen to examine these issues is that they have some experience, training and knowledge in these areas. But I do not believe there was any contact with Senator Brown.

              Again, I thank the minister for his answer. I ask a further supplementary question: who proposed the inclusion of paragraphs 17 and 18 of the issues paper, issued by the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation, which canvass whether there is a need to assist independent journalism and the best method of doing this? Has the minister discussed the issue of tax deductibility status for not-for-profit media with Senator

                 You mean the issues paper they issued themselves. No, there was a terms of reference, and they issued one, Senator Abetz. It may come as a surprise to you, but the first I saw of their issues paper was when they supplied it to me very shortly before they publicly released it. I had no conversations with Professor Ricketson, Senator

                 or former Justice Finkelstein—or 'the Fink', as he is more affectionately known, I am told. Senator Bob Brown might want to nod or shake his head, but I do not believe I had any discussions with Senator Brown about their issues paper. He is indicating 'no', so he has put that conspiracy theory completely to bed for you as well, Senator Macdonald.
