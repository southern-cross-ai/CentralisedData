        My question is to the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp. Minister, as you know, the 2006
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">

        are only 13 days away. Will you outline to the Senate how the Australian government has assisted the organising committee to prepare Melbourne to host the 18th Commonwealth Games? Is Melbourne ready and are our athletes ready?

        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Fifield, for that very important question. The short answer to Senator Fifield’s question—‘Is Melbourne ready and are our athletes ready?’—is yes, they are. However, I will now give a longer answer to you, Senator Fifield, and I thank you particularly for your interest. As many senators and members will know, the

         provide Australia, and particularly Melbourne, with a chance to show once and for all why Melbourne is regarded as the world’s sporting capital—although, of course, as a Melbourne boy I may be a little bit biased.

             will be the centrepiece of the games, where much of the sporting drama will unfold, Senator Ray. During the games, the G will transform from a theatre for art and culture to a theatre for sport. There was no surprise when the Treasurer,

                    will bring together around 4½ thousand sportsmen and sportswomen from 71 Commonwealth nations and territories. There is no doubt that the international competition will be fierce, but our team is very well prepared. The Australian team will be the largest ever for the Commonwealth Games, with 426 athletes vying for a place on the podium. As many senators and members would know, there has been fierce competition in qualifying for these games and we know that our athletes are looking forward to the chance to compete.

                    The Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games also feature a fully integrated competition for elite athletes with a disability, with 12 gold medals on offer in athletics, swimming, table tennis and weightlifting, all of which will count in the official medal tallies. No doubt all athletes will be hoping for gold, and I am sure that all senators and members wish our sportsmen and sportswomen all the best in their endeavours.

I know Senator Ray would be very interested in that. I would like to acknowledge the efforts of

                    and John Harden, both of whom have worked very hard on these games and very closely with the Bracks Labor government in Victoria to help ensure that the games are a great success, which I am sure they will be.
