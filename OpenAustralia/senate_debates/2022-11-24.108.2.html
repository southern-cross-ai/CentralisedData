        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Watt. I refer the minister to two statements the department put out on Tuesday night saying they did not actually rely on the website of a modern-day spiritual healer when calculating the cost of a bargaining consultant. Is it just an amazing coincidence that the figure of $175 an hour that his department uses in the report is the figure mentioned on the modern-day spiritual healer's website which the department provides as a reference in the regulatory impact statement? Will the minister take responsibility for this appalling error?

         Senators, I don't want to repeat of the shouting that we had yesterday. The question has been asked. I'm going to call the minister in a moment, and I expect him to be heard in respectful silence.

          Thank you, Senator Duniam, for the question. Well, another day, and we have the opposition continuing to clutch at straws to find any reason possible to stop workers in this country from getting a pay rise. They will do anything to stop talking about workers getting a pay rise. They will do anything to stop small businesses and medium-sized businesses being able to participate in a system that exists under their current legislation to deliver pay rises for their workers, a more simple industrial relations system and higher productivity for small businesses.

            <p>
             As I say, this is a continuation of what we saw yesterday from the opposition, trying to find any possible reason, whether it be websites or people—consultants. What this is actually about is one of the false claims that the opposition has been making this week, which is their claim that it will cost small businesses $14,000 to participate in multi-employer bargaining, and medium-sized employers will pay even more. Now, you'll be surprised to hear that that's actually wrong.
            </p>
            <p>
             The way the laws are structured allows for small businesses to have access to the cooperative workplaces stream, so that, if a small business wants to go and engage a consultant, whoever that might be, to assist them with their results, then that's a matter for them. But what I think you will find is that most small businesses are members of chambers of commerce, are members of industry associations, who would actually go and do the negotiations on their behalf. And then a small business would have the option of choosing to be part of that or not. Of course, if their workers would like to be part of that, then the majority of those workers have to go through a process to support that option. They also have to go to the Fair Work Commission to get approval to do so. So this idea—

Is the minister going to ask his department to fix the regulatory impact statement, or does the minister stand by the calculation of the modern-day spiritual healer he references in his report?

                   I'm not going to call the minister until there's silence. And those interjections are disorderly, Senator Ayres.

                                is one of the organisations that will have every ability under this legislation to prepare a template agreement for all small businesses to opt into under the cooperative workplaces stream. So are ACCI telling us that they oppose a wage rise—shock, horror; ACCI have always supported pay rises, haven't they? Are they also saying that they're not prepared to play their role as an employer group to design a template agreement that small businesses can sign up to? That would be a very interesting offer to their members.

I've called the minister to answer it and I expect him to be heard in silence.
