        My question is for the Minister for Finance, Senator Gallagher. ABC reports in July revealed that hackers were able to exploit loopholes in the government's myGov system and, as of February 2023, lodged more than half a billion dollars in fraudulent tax claims. Given the minister's claims that a digital identity would be secure, can the minister please provide an updated figure on how many billions of dollars in fraudulent claims hackers have lodged to date in exploiting myGov system vulnerabilities?

         The first thing I would say about that is myGov is different to myGov
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
          ID
         </a>
         ; they are completely different things. I don't have updated information. MyGov is the site you go to, as many people in this place will have, to engage with government in an online way. But myGovID is a digital ID that you control and own and use for verifying your identity and, if you are a business, for engaging with the tax office in particular. There are 10.5 million Australians who have a myGovID and use it for that purpose, but it is very different to the question that Senator Roberts raises around the myGov system, which I don't have an update on. It falls under the Minister for Government Services' portfolio. I am happy to see if there is something that minister would be able to provide you around an update on that.
        </p>
        <p>
         MyGov obviously is a system that we invest heavily in to make sure it is useable and safe for people when they are engaging with government, but that doesn't change the comments I made last week about the digital ID system being safe and trustworthy and voluntary. If you are an individual, you will not have to have one of these digital IDs but, if you do want one, the option is there, and it's a way of reducing the amount of information that government collects in order to verify your identity. So, the two things, myGovID and myGov—I accept they are similarly named—are very different things indeed.

            I don't accept the proposition that's being put by Senator Roberts. Yes, government systems are under constant attack and threat, as most businesses are in this country, from cybercrime, from hackers, and from scams and criminals that are engaged in such activity, so the government invests heavily in protecting our systems, making sure they are safe. But in a sense, you are making the argument for a digital
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
             ID
            </a>
            , because a digital ID is about reducing the amount of information that the government holds on you about you for services.
           </p>
           <p>
            Because of the way the system works, you retain the information, but you're able to have your ID verified through a process of exchange that allows those systems to be unlocked. Absolutely fundamental to the digital ID system is reducing the amount of information, having the safeguards in place—

               I'm happy to engage with you genuinely on digital

                ID
               </a>
               . I accept your interest in it and I am very willing to work with anyone in this chamber to make sure that the legislation that passes this place is the best that it can be. In relation to your specific question, as part of the bill we do require that services be maintained and offered for people that don't want to have a digital ID. That protection is there. I am very happy to engage with you more broadly on the bill, including in other areas that you might have concerns about.
              </p>
              <p>
               That clause relates specifically to individuals. As you know, myGov ID is required for business-related services, and part of that is about minimising fraud and identity theft, verifying individuals as part of their engagement with the tax office.
