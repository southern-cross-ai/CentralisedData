        My question is to Senator Kemp, Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Can the minister confirm that the only benefit to pensioners in the budget is a one-off payment of $102.80 to a pensioner or pensioner couple? The Treasurer in his budget speech said that the strong budget position allowed the government to recognise pensioners’ important place within our community. Can the minister confirm that a payment of $1 per week each to a pensioner couple accurately reflects the government’s recognition of pensioners’ contributions to our community?

           Sorry—no-one except card-carrying members of trade unions who are in this Senate. I correct that. You were right to draw that to my attention, Senator Carr. The fact is that over the life of this government the Howard government has given a very high priority to assisting pensioners. In relation to the issue you raised, Senator Brown, we did give a pensioner bonus, and I think that has been welcomed. You of course wonder what else we have done. I would have thought a lot of pensioners would have been delighted with the announcement we made in relation to the assets test. I would have thought that the changed treatment of that assets test would be one of the issues which a lot of pensioners would be happy with. I am rather surprised that you did not mention that.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a very good day to ask such a question, because tonight Mr Beazley will be putting down the Labor Party policy. The interesting thing for the community to see, since the Labor Party is quibbling over matters in relation to the Howard government’s budget, which has been overwhelmingly welcomed, will be whether in the Beazley reply tonight he picks up Senator Brown’s suggestion. I for one will be looking very closely to see whether Senator Brown’s suggestion has been picked up and properly costed, showing what the effect on the surplus will be. But of course the Labor Party would not want any measure which affected the surplus, in light of the campaign that they are running on interest rates.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is an interesting test for the Labor Party. Senator Lundy asked me some questions in relation to child care and I had some questions from Senator Evans. The issue is what the Labor Party will put up tonight—whether, having raised concerns about this budget, Mr Beazley will in the budget reply tonight show that he has taken the views of senators seriously or whether senators are going to be ignored. The government has announced its policy. We believe it is a policy which has been welcomed.

                   I do not know whether Senator Brown has been well briefed. My understanding is that the Beazley opposition have accepted our tax cuts. They have obviously done that because they think that the tax concessions we made are sensible and fair.

                    If the Labor Party are going to oppose these tax measures, that will be very interesting to see. But I suspect you will find that the Labor Party support our tax measures.

                     <p>
                      I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for the question and for her keen interest in this matter, which is of great interest to many Australians. As many senators are no doubt aware, there are a number of very positive measures in the budget for film and television producers, which is of course very good news for Australian viewers. The government has demonstrated its commitment to quality national broadcasting by providing the ABC with significant new funding in the 2006-09 triennium. In addition to its triennial base funding of more than $2.5 billion, the ABC will receive $88.2 million in additional funding. This funding will help produce significant new Australian content and further strengthen the ABC’s regional and local programming.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      We have committed $30 million over three years for the ABC to establish an independent commissioning arm to invest in high-quality drama and documentaries from the Australian independent production sector. The government expects the fund will operate in a similar manner to the successful

                       SBS
                      </a>
                      Independent, that is, the

                       SBSI
                      </a>
                      , commissioning fund and will attract significant external investment to boost the size of the commissioning fund. The figures in the ABC’s triennial funding submission suggest this funding of $10 million a year will enable the ABC to leverage additional investment of around $15 million a year. This will allow for the production of around an extra 30 hours of high-quality Australian drama, documentary and arts programming each year.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The funding will meet twin objectives: helping to address the reduction in Australian content on
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_TV" rel="nofollow">
                       ABC TV
                      </a>
                      over recent years and also providing a significant boost to the local production sector. Funding for regional and local programming will also be increased by $13.2 million over the next three years, bringing total funding for the regional and local programming initiative to $68.7 million over the triennium. In total, the ABC will receive more than $2.5 billion in government funding over the next triennium—significant investment in public broadcasting by anyone’s measure. In fact, the ABC chairman has described it as the best budget result for the corporation in 20 years.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In the budget the government also announced a review of the full range of government support measures for funding films in Australia. I commend Minister Kemp for his commitment to achieving this review. The 2006-07 review will be broad ranging and will examine the effectiveness of current programs. I note the government’s measures have been welcomed by both the screen industry and the ABC. Of course, we always hear from the other side some mouthing of support for the creative industries, but it is only the coalition that can deliver a strong economy and the real commitment that Australia needs to support a healthy and a creative screen industry.

                       My question is directed to Senator Kemp, Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. I ask: can the minister confirm that both the new family tax payment rates contained in the budget and the welfare to work changes will operate from 1 July 2006? The budget contains welcome additional assistance to families by increasing the eligibility for family allowance. The welfare to work changes mean single parents applying for parenting payments will receive a lower payment—$55 less each fortnight to care for their children. If helping families is the highest priority of the government, as the Treasurer, Mr Costello, claims, why is the government treating single parent families on income support differently to other family unit types? Why should the children in these families be forced to live on less?

                        Senator, I have to point out to you that the government has given a very high priority to families. I made the point to you yesterday that the best friend families have had in relation to federal governments is our government. If you feel that the welfare measures announced in this budget are not up to Labor Party expectations and that the Labor Party can go further, what we will do is look very closely at what Mr Beazley will announce in the budget reply tonight.

                         He did not even go a minute! The question was longer than your answer. Maybe you should swap sides—in fact you probably will.

                         , the supplementary question I have is: if the budget initiatives are designed to assist families to meet additional costs, such as petrol price increases, as the Prime Minister has argued, can the minister explain why single parent families are apparently immune to these cost increases and, in fact, in the government’s view, can live on even less?

                                        Tuesday’s budget delivered a huge boost to Australian health and medical research with the allocation of an additional $905 million as a major investment in our future health, meaning national health and medical research funding will increase fivefold from $127 million in 1996 to $700 million a year in four years time.

It will be part of a total of $692 million to boost research grants, fellowships and specific research agendas. This will be complemented by an investment of $213 million in infrastructure and capital works for medical research organisations.

The funding will enable these research facilities to expand and to improve their capacity and their reputation for quality research into the causes, diagnosis and treatment of disease. This budget builds on the government’s strong record of support for medical research, including infrastructure, and underscores our view that such research is of vital importance. Today’s research will produce tomorrow’s medicines and technologies, which can bring about greater health and wellbeing for our fellow Australians. The government looks forward to learning of the great advances that our highly regarded scientific community makes through this increased support over the years to come.

                                         My question is to the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchin. I refer to the government’s budget commitment that Defence will receive a three per cent real increase in funding each year to 2016. While this is a welcome announcement to meet the security challenges facing Australia, what is the identifiable risk to future defence budgets from the continuing mismanagement of defence projects? I refer to yet another adverse Audit Office report into a defence project, the Tiger helicopter, which is some $276 million over budget. Given the involvement of Department of Finance and Administration officials in the defence procurement processes, and the minister’s responsibility for budget accountability, what has the minister done to ensure that taxpayers’ money is not squandered and frittered away?

                                          Under Senator Hill, the then Minister for Defence, the government initiated the Kinnaird review of the way in which defence procurement operates. As a result of that very substantial review, the

                                          I think that the DMO has instituted some very major changes to the way procurement is conducted in this country. It is true that Finance has worked closely with Defence, both in that review process and in ensuring that Defence operates as efficiently and as effectively as possible in the very difficult task of managing procurement projects in this country. I do not want to allow any suggestion to float in this chamber that those involved in the DMO are doing anything other than working to their professional best in the service of this country in acquiring the equipment that Defence needs. They are extremely well funded by this government.

                                          Senator Bishop is right to point to a recent audit report in relation to the Tiger acquisition. That is the proper role of the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General is independent and is an extremely good Auditor-General. I strongly supported his appointment—and he is a former Finance officer, as you well know, Senator Bishop. Mr

                                          is doing a very good job, and it is very important that Defence know that Mr McPhee will be all over them with respect to their acquisition projects. I am sure that will bring about a superior performance.

                                          It is a regrettable fact for all finance ministers to observe that nowhere in the Western world, at least, is there perfection in the acquisition of defence materiel. Former Labor ministers, like Senator Ray, will know that no matter what efforts governments make to ensure perfection in acquisition, it is probably unachievable. However, all governments must aim to maximise the cost effectiveness, efficiency and delivery of defence acquisitions. Senator Bishop is quite right to point out that there is a lot of taxpayers’ money at stake.

                                          Through the national security committee, to which I am co-opted when matters pertaining to money are raised—therefore I am there a lot—it is my job, but it is also the job of ministers on the national security committee to hold Defence to account in the acquisition process. We regret whenever there are any slippages in contracts or any unfortunate outcomes in relation to defence acquisition. But I am satisfied that there has been very substantial improvement in the operation of the DMO, and they are delivering the equipment which this country needs to ensure our national security and defence at a time when the defence forces of this country are under extreme pressure—as you know. They are serving in many theatres around the world, and that is putting enormous pressure on the

                                           , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, isn’t it true that the failure to deliver the Tiger helicopters is matched by other recent and equally disastrous project failures? For example, the Seasprite helicopters budget has blown out to $2 billion and nearly $1 billion has been spent on the

                                           project with nothing to show for it. Isn’t it correct that continuing to have massive overspends will undermine the value of the three per cent real increase in funding each year? When is the government going to accept its responsibilities in managing these projects so that the ADF gets what it needs and taxpayers’ money does not continue to be wasted?

                                            has accepted all those recommendations and will implement them. I am also advised by Defence that it is confident the Tiger helicopter will have very effective capability and that it will meet Army’s operational requirements. But I accept your injunction on the importance of the government holding Defence to account to ensure that it does use taxpayer resources cost-effectively to deliver defence projects.
