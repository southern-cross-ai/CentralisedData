        My question is to Senator Carr, the Minister representing the Minister for Education. Can the minister inform the Senate how much federal money is included in

         I would indicate to Senator Mason that the Queensland state government’s election promises are matters for the state government. They are of course matters that have been canvassed within the state of Queensland; they are not necessarily canvassed with the Commonwealth government. We have announced a series of policies to support the improvements in education attainment levels for all Australians, whether they are in Queensland or any other state. We have indicated our commitment to an education revolution and, as a consequence, there have been billions of dollars committed to a transformation of the Australian education system, be it in terms of infrastructure, teacher education or access to university places. So I can say this to you, Senator Mason: I am not familiar with the precise details of the Queensland government’s election commitments, but the Australian government’s commitment is to every single parent and every single student throughout the Commonwealth, no matter where they live.

              I have already indicated to Senator Mason that as far as the Commonwealth is concerned our commitment is to every child and every parent throughout the Commonwealth. It is not confined to any one state or to any one group of students or parents, whether they be in the public system or the private system. We have indicated that our commitment is to an education revolution, beginning in early childhood and going right through to research and development. We are about ensuring the full and capable development of our projects. Already, in terms of universities, for instance, the Commonwealth has committed $141 million more on capital universities than the previous government did throughout their whole term in office. We have a commitment to schools, we have a commitment to vocational education and we have a commitment to universities.

                </a>
                has committed $14.7 billion to boost jobs and investments through the building and upgrading of buildings throughout the Commonwealth. We have committed $12.4 billion to build and upgrade large infrastructure, including libraries and multipurpose school facilities, whether they be in primary schools, whether they be in special schools, whether they be in K to 12 schools. Major infrastructure investment is a major commitment from this government and a major achievement of this government already, which of course stands in sharp contrast to the neglect that the conservative government showed throughout its term. We have also committed to science and language centres: over $1 billion of investment has been put towards 500 new science laboratories and language-learning centres in secondary schools. We have a commitment, it is solid—
