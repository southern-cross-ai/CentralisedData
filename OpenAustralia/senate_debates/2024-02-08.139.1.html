        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. In Senate estimates last June, the coalition raised questions about education materials promoting antisemitism, glorification of violence and martyrdom being used in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        RWA schools.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        told the committee it had made representations to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA" rel="nofollow">
         UNRWA
        </a>
        about its neutrality and that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        UNRWA has obligations written into its contracts requiring it to undertake due diligence and risk management activities … we work with them on governance mechanisms to ensure that they comply with that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … Australia assesses UNRWA's performance yearly …
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, how did you assure yourself that UNRWA had met its contractual obligations to not allow funds to support terrorism and extremism before you authorised the full $20 million to be paid by January 2024?

         The first point I would make to the senator is that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         RWA has been funded by Australian governments of both stripes since 1951 and is also funded by our closest partners—the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. We also know—and this is relevant—that currently about 1.4 million Palestinians are sheltering in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA" rel="nofollow">
          UNRWA
         </a>
         facilities. Thousands of its staff are involved in the humanitarian response.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would make the point that the government, as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT
         </a>
         said in estimates, have agreements with UNRWA that prohibit Hamas or any other terrorist organisations from receiving funding. These requirements are closely monitored and applied by DFAT. I also would say to you—and I'll provide further information when I find it—that further consideration by the department did occur in the context, I think, of the 2022-23 budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I would say to you is this: there are two very clear facts about UNRWA. The first is that UNRWA is the only organisation capable of delivering assistance into Gaza. And, in a context where you have 400,000 Palestinians starving, a million facing starvation and 1.7 million people displaced, that does matter. The other irrefutable fact is that serious allegations have been raised, which is why the government has paused funding and is engaging with UNRWA and with partners, including in the context of the investigations which have been raised.

           RWA staff members participating in the holding of Israelis taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October were public in December 2023. On 19 December, the Australian Jewish community wrote to you and the Prime Minister warning that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA" rel="nofollow">
            UNRWA
           </a>
           had been aiding and abetting Hamas, including during the horrific 7 October attacks. In early January,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Watch" rel="nofollow">
            UN Watch
           </a>
           released extensive materials showing UNRWA staff celebrating the terror attacks. Minister, what assessment did you undertake of this evidence and these warnings before announcing an additional $6 million for UNRWA on 16 January?

            first go back to the point in the question that was first raised. I can advise that I received advice on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
             UN
            </a>
            RWA from my department last year prior to the disbursement of Australia's core funding for 2023-24. The advice to me, based on an independently audited review, was that there was no evidence that funds had been diverted and that our key partners, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada, who all fund
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNRWA" rel="nofollow">
             UNRWA
            </a>
            , held the same view.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to the letter from community representatives, I would make the point that I am aware of that letter. I do know these are not new views. They're views that have been expressed for many years by individuals and organisations who do not support the Australian government continuing to fund UNRWA. By the time we received the letter, my officials had already acted on the issues it raised, which had been identified in a November report by

              Minister, your department told the committee last June: 'We are working with governance mechanisms to ensure that our funding goes to the right people.' In October last year, you announced in total an extra $25 million for humanitarian assistance in Gaza and the region, of which $12 million was to go to unnamed

              agencies or trusted partners to address needs. How much of this funding went to

               UNRWA

               I'll provide information about the October announcement. My recollection is that it was

                UN
               </a>

                UNRWA
               </a>
               is the only entity on the ground that is able to deliver aid and humanitarian relief at scale. The Israeli government officials with whom I spoke would accept that. It may be that people don't like the entity, and I appreciate that that is where you are coming from, but I don't think it is disputed that there is no other organisation that is capable of delivering assistance in that way. That is consistent with the discussions I had in Israel and consistent with the discussions I have had with officials of the UN and also the
