        , Fuelwatch has ended up heading straight off to the poolroom, straight off to the cabinet. Fuelwatch is going to sit up in the cabinet with GroceryWatch, with the war on obesity, with the war on binge drinking, with the education revolution—it is a very violent party, the Labor Party; a lot of wars and revolutions going on. We have the highest interest rates, the highest inflation and the record lowest consumer confidence—with a $10.4 billion expenditure of our surplus with no modelling. Now we have a motor vehicle package. I hope a bit more thought goes into the motor vehicle package. We have a deficit heading towards us. And the good news is that they have not even been in government for a year yet. This is the sort of government we have got. In the Labor Party poolroom are going to be all the adornments of what a marvellous government it is, what an absolute blessing to the nation this
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_government" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        is.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is interesting to go back through Fuelwatch. I was just having a bit of a read of the notes and looking at all the people who did not support it. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAA" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        have all indicated that they did not support it. It was also indicated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        that figures for Perth motorists were based on buying petrol at prices greater than the average price over the cycle. What was Fuelwatch’s purpose? That is the question that is going to be finally left on people’s lips: what was the purpose of that exercise? The purpose of that exercise was the same purpose as the exercise that Mr Rudd used when he disclosed a private conversation with the President of the United States. The purpose of that exercise was purely and simply the media. That was it; that was the purpose of that exercise. The ramifications of that exercise are complete and utter embarrassment. I see Mr Dimasi from the ACCC waiting for the day when he can let the remnants of Fuelwatch slip into dark, distant memory.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we can learn out of this Fuelwatch debacle is that we have to watch the Labor Party very closely when it comes to detail because they are lacking. When it comes to detail, when it comes to homework, they are very dangerous in how they actually go about spending our money and delivering a program for the nation. What we learned from Fuelwatch is that if the acumen that they deliver into that program is delivered into how they run the economy, if it is delivered into Minister Carr’s motor vehicle package, we will have the expenditure of funds for no outcome. We believe that we should have a strong and vibrant motor vehicle industry. We just do not believe for one moment, on the record that the Labor Party have presented so far, as ably displayed in the Labor Party pool cabinet, that they have any capacity to actually show diligence and efficacy in outcomes. The Australian people are going to start looking at the Labor Party pool cabinet, the trophy cabinet in the poolroom, and start asking themselves this question very soon: do these people know what they are up to? There have been so many reviews and programs and so much spin doctoring going on, but on delivery of an outcome that can be discernible, that can be attributable, that can actually show the nation benefit, they have not got one run on the board—not one. Not one thing can they show to the Australian people as a program that worked. But we have the instigation of a multiplicity of marvellous ideas. Anybody can come in here with marvellous ideas, but your capacity to govern is your capacity to deliver an outcome—not the initiation of an idea but an outcome of an idea. Not one outcome has this Labor government so far been able to present to the Australian people.
       </p>
       <p>
        One outcome that we do have is that we started with a surplus in excess of $20 billion and we have now lost most of it. We are now heading towards a deficit. The Australian people are going to have to go to the marketplace to borrow the money to run a nation which was left in surplus. We will go into the most tenuous credit market in the world to borrow those funds. And think of the profligate waste of money! On 8 December money will be spent in lump sums that will appear in retail therapy, and everybody will be happy to get it. I am not denying for one moment that people are going to be happy to get it. But a lot of it will end up in poker machines and being spent on alcohol. In some areas of our nation, 8 December will be like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guy_Fawkes" rel="nofollow">
         Guy Fawkes
        </a>
        night, the Fourth of July and Christmas all rolled into one. Unfortunately there will be the abuse of alcohol, the abuse of gambling and the assaults and everything that get rolled into that practice. I know because I will see some of it outside my window—I live next door to a pub.
       </p>
       <p>
        This also is part of Labor Party management. They actually lack the acumen to see the social implications of some of their policies and exactly what happens next when the big lumps of money turn up in certain bank accounts in one fell swoop. This also is a reflection of the lack of Labor Party planning. After the money has been squandered on 8 December, the thought that the people of Australia will have to go to the market to borrow back the money I find absolutely incredible. But it fits well with Fuelwatch. If someone said, ‘Describe the Labor government to people from another nation, another planet,’ I would say, ‘Fuelwatch. That is the Labor Party.’ That is them to a tee. They think it is a marvellous idea, but they have absolutely no conviction whatsoever to bolster the powers of the Fuelwatch commissioner so they could actually do something. It was all rushed, with the ridiculous situation whereby people had to work 36 hours straight towards the delivery of a program with no efficacy or modelling on what the outcome was going to be. Then there was the huge charade, the absolute rubbish of a launch, with all the earnest faces that said, ‘Look at us bringing the price of fuel down.’ That was so insincere when you actually got behind and saw that they did not do the homework. That is the issue that I hope the Australian people start connecting to. The Labor Party do not do the homework. They can spend half the nation’s surplus without doing the modelling. I believe that if you ask them right at this moment, you would find that they still have not done it. This is the sort of management that is now running our nation. The results are so clear.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are heading towards a deficit. We now have one of the highest inflation rates in recent history. We are now heading towards record growth in unemployment. We now have one of the lowest levels of business confidence on record. We have interest rates at their highest levels on record. That is certainly a quantifiable and salient picture of Labor Party management. It cannot be attributed to anybody else. If they say that it is unfair, you only have to balance it up with Fuelwatch. And the next fiasco tearing down the path towards us is GroceryWatch. You would think after you made one complete and utter botch up of a job that you would be smart enough to curtail the embarrassment and not continue down exactly the same path in another field. But, no, not only have they botched up the job, they have the arrogance to not be able to reflect on what they have done and improve the process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fuelwatch today will be taken off to the poolroom to be stored in the trophy cabinet where it will gather dust and be an item of ridicule. Slowly, that Labor Party trophy cabinet in the poolroom will fill up to such an extent that the people who come to visit will ask: do these people know what they are on about? This sort of banal and kitsch policy, which it is, will be seen clearly as the emblem of Labor Party government. The honeymoon is over today, ladies and gentlemen, with the purposeful burial of Fuelwatch. It will be interesting to hear the requiem that is now going to be sung by the Labor Party about the proposed benefits or losses to the Australian people for what could have been had things been different. What any person looking at this has to ask is: why would things be any different when the planning was so completely lacking?
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Walker is a classic endorsement of the Fuelwatch package. He was the person in charge of it and he bolted. That is the ultimate indictment of the package. The boss was appointed with such lauding and fervour and one of the first things he did was to run for his life because it was an absolute and utter mangy dog. This has to be seen. But, no doubt, Mr Bowen is going to come up with some other political fascinator to be worn on his head in the near future. We will wait for that and we will treat it with the same contempt with which we treated Fuelwatch.

         I heard Senator Joyce commence his tirade last night, and I thought it was a bit flippant, a bit lightweight and a bit without substance. Well, it did not get any better this morning. Here is the National Party criticising the government’s economic capacity. Let me tell you that the nation will not be running down to put money into poker machines, they will not all be getting drunk and they will not all be fighting outside the pubs. Our economic security package is there for hardworking families in this country. I think it is an absolute disgrace for Senator Joyce to come in here and flippantly run those tired old lines that people cannot look after themselves and they should not have access to the government security package. Listening to Senator Joyce this morning, you would think that nothing has changed in the world, that we are still in the middle of an economic boom and that there is no economic crisis or no failed banks around the world. Senator Joyce continues with the same claptrap that he went on with for the 11½ years that the Libs were in government.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will now turn to the
         <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R3019" rel="nofollow">
          National
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel" rel="nofollow">
           Fuel
          </a>
          watch (Empowering Consumers) Bill 2008
         </a>
         . I appreciate the opportunity to participate in this debate. This is an extremely important bill that will provide significant benefits to the Australian public. The public are entitled to get some access to information on where the cheapest fuel is; it should not be just the public who do not have access to information. Fuelwatch will go directly to the problem of the lack of information available to consumers. It will provide detailed information to consumers. It will not leave us with the current situation whereby the only detailed advice or information on petrol prices belongs to the producers, the wholesalers and the retailers. This inequality of information is described in economic terms as ‘information asymmetry’. We did not hear any argument about this economic issue from Senator Joyce; we just heard a flippant rant about the government.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz" rel="nofollow">
          Joseph Stiglitz
         </a>
         , who won the 2001 Nobel prize for his work on information asymmetries in the market, put it this way:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Efficiency requires that information be freely disseminated. The private market will often provide an inadequate supply of information … there are various market failures associated with imperfect information …
        </p>
        <p>
         That is exactly the position that the Australian public find themselves in in relation to fuel. The public do not have access to the breadth and depth of information available to the big oil companies, the wholesalers and the retailers. Yet we are going to see Liberal senators get up and argue that the public should not have access to information while their mates in big business, their Maserati-driving mates who do not need to find cheap fuel, have better access to information than the Australian public do.
        </p>
        <p>
         The public are expected to predominately rely on petrol station billboards—that is the Liberals’ answer to Fuelwatch—which requires the visual sighting of a number of billboards at different petrol stations to establish the lowest price amongst that range of petrol stations. That is what the Liberals are saying to the Australian public: you depend on the billboards and let the retailers and big business have access to minute-by-minute information on petrol prices which you will not get. The public have to rely on an extremely inefficient, time-consuming and—for most of the public—frustrating exercise to find cheap fuel. During a Senate Economics Committee inquiry the cheap fuel day was described as ‘magic Tuesday’. Nobody could explain during any of the committee hearings that I was involved in how magic Tuesday worked. Magic Tuesday, in my view, is a manipulation of the market. It gives big business a very big incentive to make sure petrol prices stay high. Nobody could explain to me whether magic Tuesday was about black magic or white magic. Everybody knew magic Tuesday was there, but nobody could explain how it worked. Yet the Liberals want magic Tuesday to stay. I do not want the Australian public to have to face magic Tuesday, the black magic of big business, supported by the Liberals, keeping proper information from the public.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is interesting to note that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
         </a>
         have commented on this information asymmetry and its potential to distort the market in favour of the petrol industry. The industry uses a private company, Informed Sources, to provide instantaneous advice on movements in petrol prices to it. Using Informed Sources is an extremely expensive proposition that is beyond the reach of the general public and even a lot of businesses within Australia. Evidence was given to the committee in Rockhampton by Mr Steve
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marshall" rel="nofollow">
          Marshall
         </a>
         of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIN" rel="nofollow">
          WIN
         </a>
         Television—and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WIN_Television" rel="nofollow">
          WIN Television
         </a>
         would not be the poorest lot around and not the poorest company in the country—that the cost of obtaining price information was extremely high. WIN Television wanted to provide a community service in the Rockhampton region. They conducted their own surveys. But Mr Marshall told the Economics Committee it was going to cost ‘an extraordinary amount of money’ to pay
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_Mouth" rel="nofollow">
          Motor Mouth
         </a>
         , which is a subsidiary of Informed Sources, to collate that information for WIN Television. He said they were quoted $50,000 per year per market to get access to the information that is available to big business. All WIN Television wanted to do was provide that information to the community of Rockhampton. As WIN Television cover five Queensland markets, it would have cost them $250,000 to participate in the Informed Sources program.
        </p>
        <p>
         This demonstrates that, if you have money and power, you can participate in the Informed Sources program to give you an advantage in the market. That is what the Liberals are going to stand up here today and support: an advantage for big business, an advantage for the retailers and a disadvantage for ordinary Australians. If you are an ordinary consumer, according to the Liberals, you are to depend on the billboards. But if you are one of their big business mates, you can spend money and get access to the computer technology that lets you manipulate the market. If you are a small independent petrol station operator and you cannot afford to participate in the Informed Sources program, you have to either hope for the best or seek to conduct your own local survey of prices at significant cost to your small business.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is not a good system. This is a system that the Liberals wanted to continue. This is a bad system. It is a system that provides benefits to the business users of Informed Sources and, in my view, disadvantages Australian consumers. This is what the government wants to fix. We want to deal with it in an economically credible manner. We want to deal with the information asymmetry. We do not want to deal with the rant that we heard from Senator Joyce. The unfair advantage that business has over consumers has prompted the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         chairman,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graeme_Samuel" rel="nofollow">
          Graeme Samuel
         </a>
         , to comment on the current system. He said that while the use of Informed Sources information by large retailers was not illegal—and I say that in inverted commas—it could be described as being as close to illegal collusion as you can get. So what do the Liberals want? They want ordinary Australians to depend on the billboards, and they want their big business mates to have access to illegal collusion to disadvantage ordinary Australians. Fuelwatch will move the retailing of petrol from a system which is close to illegal collusion to one which is open and transparent for the Australian public. Why should the Australian public not have an open and transparent system? Why should the Australian public not have access to the same information that big business has? Do you know why? It is because the Liberals do not want the Australian public to have access to that information. It is an absolute disgrace.
        </p>
        <p>
         Concern has been raised about the 24-hour rule, which requires companies to lock their prices in for 24 hours. There has been an argument put that this would be anticompetitive and that it would distort the market. There was no substantive argument put to the committee in support of this unfounded proposition. The people who argue this proposition are the same people who take advantage of the collusion that now goes on in the industry at the expense of ordinary Australians. I expect it is also supported by the mates of big business on the other side, the Liberal Party. To the contrary, on this proposition, evidence from the ACCC, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRMA" rel="nofollow">
          NRMA
         </a>
         , the

          Department of Consumer and Employment Protection
         </a>
         , Professor Wang and Commerce Queensland supported the 24-hour rule. The NRMA said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         By having to quote fixed fuel prices for a 24 hour period, petrol retailers will have to make better judged and more competitive choices on fuel prices.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thus the pressure comes back onto the retailers, not the consumers. Professor Wang, an international expert on fuel prices, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The disincentive to be the first to hike price is much greater under the 24-hour-rule. Without the rule, the price leader for a cycle knows that once its price is hiked, other firms can respond very quickly (within hours) by hiking their prices as well. If other firms do not respond quickly, the price leader can quickly retract its price hike to avoid losing much market share. However, under the 24-hour-rule, after a price leader hikes its price, other firms cannot respond within 24 hours. The price leader has to lose market share for an entire day—it cannot retract its price hike either.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Joyce’s rant this morning suggested that we were not dealing with economic reality. The economic reality is that the Treasury, via evidence from its executive director, Mr
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Murphy" rel="nofollow">
          Jim Murphy
         </a>
         , has clearly said that it is in support of the need to provide consumers with some counterbalance to the unfair advantage that petrol retailers have by their use of Informed Sources. So it is collusion. It is an unfair advantage. That is what the Liberals are standing up to support this morning: maintaining a position that disadvantages Australian consumers. Jim Murphy, from Treasury, said this:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Realistically, if you want to get the best deal you can for Australian consumers, you have to start looking at getting pressure coming, at the grassroots level in my view, from consumers to be seeking out the best prices for petrol. Hopefully they will then put pressure on the retailers to actually compete more aggressively in the supply of petrol. The only way you can do it, given the introduction by the retailers of this informed sources device or mechanism, is to actually try to redress that and get an energetic consumer awareness out there.
        </p>
        <p>
         How do you get energetic consumer awareness out there? How do you try and get this disadvantage against consumers dealt with? You do it with Fuelwatch. If there are other issues that are problems in the industry, they should be raised and dealt with, but what we can do immediately, in the short term, is to even up the disadvantage that ordinary Australian consumers have against big business in this country in the retail petrol industry and give them access to the same information that is available to big business.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am sure we will hear the same refrain from the Liberals here this morning about the econometric modelling, so let me turn to that. Opponents of Fuelwatch have asserted—in the absence of any evidence—that the scheme led to higher petrol prices in Western Australia. The reason for this assertion was never put in a proper manner to the committee. The reasons were never stated. In the face of the criticism, the ACCC conducted a model of the Fuelwatch scheme to test the assertions that had been put by those opposed to putting more market information in the hands of the consumer. The overall conclusion of not only the ACCC study but also of the analysis done by Professor Harding, Professor Davidson, Access Economics and Concept Economics, is that, since the Western Australian Fuelwatch scheme was introduced, the average retail margin in Perth relative to other mainland capitals had fallen. This was the evidence that was put forward, and what the Liberals want to do is to deny consumers access to the information that is paid for by big business in order to give them an advantage over ordinary Australian consumers. It is an absolute outrage.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was clear that the wild fluctuations in fuel prices that had characterised the petrol market in all the capital cities no longer existed in Perth. So what the econometricians really argued about was whether Fuelwatch, some other factor or a combination of factors contributed to this highly beneficial phenomenon in Perth. Let me tell you what we heard from some of the econometricians in their arguments to the committee. They said that Perth is just different from the rest of Australia.

           had had different effects in WA than it had in the rest of the country; that there is only one refinery in Perth; and that Perth is closer to Singapore than the rest of the country is. The committee was left to determine what effect any of these factors have had in WA, if any.

           described the ACCC’s work as ‘a far more rigorous investigation of the WA scheme than anyone had ever done’. These were the facts that were before the committee, and all the support for big business to have an advantage over Australian consumers will not hide the facts about the need for the Fuelwatch scheme for the benefit of ordinary Australian consumers. If the Liberals want to protect their big business mates, they should be upfront about it. Do not hide behind some crook econometric modelling. Do not hide behind an argument that says this is bad for consumers. Because none of those points can be sustained. None of those points were argued with the committee. This is a good thing. Fuelwatch will be good for the economy and good for consumers. It will fix up the information asymmetry in the industry and give ordinary Australian consumers a good old Australian fair go.

When people think of Rudd Labor they think of overpromising and underdelivering. They think about spin over substance.

              During Mr Rudd’s desperate attempt to win the election, he made promises to the Australian people he must have known he could not keep. Mr ‘I feel your pain’ Rudd told Australians he would reduce petrol prices for them. He has not. The only way he could have done so would have been by reducing the excise tax, but the only positive move to reduce petrol prices was deliberately rejected by Mr Rudd and Labor.

                      at the moment. So, despite all the electioneering and promising of reduced petrol prices by Labor, it is only the coalition that has a decisive plan to reduce the burden of petrol prices for pensioners, wage earners, small business and, indeed, everyone.

                      <p>
                       Mr Rudd promised to reduce petrol prices. He has not. Labor has failed and broken this fundamental pledge, like Labor has done with grocery prices. So Mr ‘I feel your pain’ Rudd has failed to provide pain relief through price relief at the bowser. The coalition has the plan and the will to ease the burden.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Another hallmark of Labor is the triumph of spin over substance, and
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel" rel="nofollow">
                        Fuel
                       </a>
                       watch is the exemplar of spin over substance. First we were told that Fuelwatch would reduce petrol prices by 1.9c per litre. Then it was to be 2c per litre. Then we had the hapless Fuelwatch commissioner—remember him?—saying it would be 5c per litre. Then we were told Fuelwatch was not even about reducing petrol prices. And then we had the Treasurer, in a most desperate and quite pathetic effort, claim that savings of $10 per tank, or 20c per litre, could be achieved. And all these quite ridiculous and misleading claims were made in the face of all the evidence clearly indicating the contrary and, indeed, suggesting that prices would increase under Fuelwatch.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       So overtaken by spin were Labor that they spent $100,000 of taxpayers’ hard-earned funds to develop a logo for Fuelwatch—before it was even passed through this place. Before the legislation was passed, they arrogantly concentrated on getting a slick logo to help us overlook Fuelwatch’s failures. I could have saved Labor that $100,000, because a perfect logo for Fuelwatch would have been the visage of Mr Rudd wearing a dunce’s hat with a big ‘F’ on it—F for failure, F for fatally flawed, F for foolish or F for ‘foolwatch’! Take your pick, the logo would be a great and accurate descriptor.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Throughout this disastrous process, we also witnessed the shameful and unacceptable abuse of the Public Service. We had Treasury trying to advocate for Fuelwatch before the Senate
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                        Standing Committee
                       </a>
                       on Economics when we know that they, along with three other senior economic departments, had advised the government against Fuelwatch because it was so badly flawed. But Labor forced these public servants to appear before committees to support Fuelwatch against their advice to the government. They also forced individuals in Treasury to work 37 hours around the clock to get this legislation ready for tabling. Why? What was the urgency of it? We still do not have an answer despite that question being raised at Senate estimates.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Why was it done? It was done to answer the coalition’s popular and highly regarded budget response to reducing petrol prices. Mr Rudd unconscionably forced Treasury and other officials to work 37 hours straight in a pathetic attempt to regain the political agenda. There was no imperative other than Mr Rudd’s partisan political agenda. It was an abuse of the Public Service, which is totally and utterly unacceptable. This behaviour links in with Mr Rudd’s quite bizarre and manic predisposition. Why would any self-respecting Prime Minister make such a bizarre and manic demand of his Public Service to prepare, in 37 hours straight, that which the department itself had recommended against? It was simply for politics and for no other reason.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       What was the reason the departments recommended against Fuelwatch? The evidence did not support the policy. Having promised evidence based policy during the election, Labor again broke faith with the Australian people and embarked on Fuelwatch, deliberately ignoring the wealth of evidence against it. In desperation, Labor even abused the parliamentary process of the Senate committee system. We got an urgent interim report in August because of an alleged urgency to get this report out to the community. That was in August. And here we are, three months later, debating it. The government could have brought this legislation on for debate in August if they had wanted to, but they did not. They made bureaucrats work 37 hours straight to get the legislation ready—because it was so urgent it had to be rushed—and now we have had a hiatus of three months. What happened to the urgency?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Even more concerning was the maltreatment of witnesses and the deliberate misquoting of evidence in the Senate economics committee report. Labor did not cherry-pick the evidence; they manufactured it. Witnesses wrote into the committee complaining of exactly that. It was not only the Australian Institute of Petroleum—who you might think may have had a vested interest—that made a complaint. The respected
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Automobile_Association" rel="nofollow">
                        Royal Automobile Association

                       </a>
                       made a similar complaint. If there is one thing the Royal Automobile Association of South Australia are concerned about, it is representing the consumers—the petrol buyers—in South Australia. And they themselves were moved to write to the Senate committee to object to the way that the evidence had been mishandled, mistreated and, I would say, distorted. Although urgency was claimed in relation to bringing down the interim report, the final report was tabled two weeks after it could have been tabled in this place. There was no explanation from Labor as to the reason for that, and I think the Senate is entitled to one. What all this highlights is that Labor will stop at nothing to pursue their flawed agenda.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Let us now turn to Fuelwatch proper. This $21 million impost on Australia’s taxpayers will, if anything, increase petrol prices and not reduce them. Indeed, the one independent fuel provider quoted by Labor senators in the Senate economics committee report into Fuelwatch said that he favoured Fuelwatch—and that is where Labor stopped the quote, of course. They did not go on to tell the readers of the report why this independent vendor of petrol supported Fuelwatch. And do you know why it was? It was because Fuelwatch would increase his margins; he would make more money out of Fuelwatch. But the Labor senators deliberately cut and pasted the quote to make it read as though there was an independent fuel provider who actually supported Fuelwatch. The only one who supported it did so on the basis that he was of the view that he could make even greater profits. Who do you think would bear the consequence of that? The petrol-buying public of Australia—the consumers of Australia. That is why I compliment Senator Xenophon on his very strong stance against Fuelwatch. If there is one state and one lot of consumers in this country who would suffer very heavily under Fuelwatch, there is no doubt that it would be South Australia and the petrol buyers of South Australia.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The one place where Fuelwatch does operate, Western Australia, has been unable to provide any proof that there is in fact a reduction in price in that state. What is more, when we as a committee were over there in Western Australia asking questions of that department, they admitted as much. They agreed that they could not point to a price reduction for

                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I must say that the conversion of the

                       </a>
                       to supporting Fuelwatch after years of opposition and ridiculing of Fuelwatch smacked of the adoption of the government’s agenda. To change their mind so conveniently around the time of the change of government in November last year does not build confidence or trust in the ACCC’s objectivity. Indeed, if we accept their evidence now, it leaves big questions over their previous advice to the Senate committees.

                         watch, but what it shows is that all their previous reports and discussions on Fuelwatch have been flawed. As a result, one has to question the robustness of the way that they approach their business—and that is the point that I am seeking to make.

                         </a>
                         , because I am sure he would have been at the cabinet meeting where those four departments’ recommendations against Fuelwatch were presented. Despite all the evidence against Fuelwatch, he and other
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_minister" rel="nofollow">
                          Labor minister
                         </a>
                         s in cabinet voted for Fuelwatch for one simple reason. It was for politics—for the spin—not the substance, because cabinet ministers were told by their own departments that there was no credibility to the claim. Then, of course, on top of the view of the four departments, you have got such distinguished people as Professor Don Harding, Mr Henry Ergas and Associate Professor Frank Zumbo—whom I see in the gallery and who has shown very real interest. When you combine all that evidence, and the late conversion of the ACCC as the only ones who actually support Fuelwatch, I confess that I do have some questions about the way that they have arrived at their conclusion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         But, above all, Fuelwatch would be, without any doubt, anticompetitive. Retailers could not reduce their price for 24 hours because, if they did, they would be fined. How could that be of benefit to Australian consumers? Of course, it would not be. It cannot be and it never will be. Fuelwatch will overwhelmingly hurt the small independent operator and the small chains. Interestingly, the supermarket chains seem quite comfortable and relaxed with Fuelwatch. Yet Mr Rudd disingenuously inserts into the public debate that somehow the opponents of Fuelwatch are the friends of big oil. I can tell you that the Senate
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                          Standing Committee
                         </a>
                         on Economics heard time and time again from independents and the small chains that they were opposed to Fuelwatch and the big companies told us that they could live with Fuelwatch. Who is on the side of big oil? But, once again, it is all about spin—say whatever you like and hope you can get away with it. That is where the importance of these Senate committees comes in, because we can unravel the spin and get to the substance. What we have done in this case is expose the huge flaws in Fuelwatch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         The legislation will impose penalties—and this is interesting—as of 30 November 2008 on those retailers not providing price information. Today, if I am correct, it is 12 November. There are 18 days to go before its implementation, and the small operators will have to be set up for that. I hope, without reflecting on or suggesting the way the Senate will vote, that this will not happen—and I suggest to the Senate that it cannot happen. Interestingly enough, though, Labor have got a logo in place but not the mechanics to make it work. So they have got the spin in place but they do not have the substance in place. That is the hallmark of the Rudd
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_government" rel="nofollow">

                        </p>
                        <p>
                         It is time for Labor to level with the Australian people. Labor should say they should never have made their promise about reducing fuel prices—a promise they knew they could never keep. They should also acknowledge that all this Fuelwatch nonsense was about trying to create an impression of taking action rather than actual action. Labor should admit their spin contained no substance. Labor should repay the Australian people the $100,000 wasted on developing a logo for Fuelwatch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Hopefully, today, Fuelwatch will be laid to rest. Fuelwatch has been running on empty now for a very long time. Labor, still sitting at the wheel, despite the needle being on empty, think they can still drive this vehicle. Well, it has been on empty for a long, long time, and I think later on today, hopefully, we will see Fuelwatch coming to a spluttering halt. That is what happens if you keep trying to drive on empty for too long. That is a lesson that I hope Labor will learn from this exercise. The people have a right to be angry with Rudd Labor. They are right to be angry over the electoral deceit, the spin, the waste of money, the abuse of the Public Service, and the overpromising and the underdelivering.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I conclude as I began: the exercise of Fuelwatch provides us with a great insight as we approach the first anniversary of the Rudd Labor government. It provides us with an insight as to how Rudd Labor does business: overpromise and underdeliver. Spin first; do not worry about the substance. If need be, abuse the Public Service. If need be, for your political agenda, abuse the parliamentary processes. If need be, manufacture the evidence. If need be, have policy based evidence rather than evidence based policy. This has become the hallmark of the first year of Labor in office, and Fuelwatch embodies all those fatal flaws of Rudd Labor. That is why, sad as it is that the Senate has to be debating Fuelwatch, it does provide an excellent window into the operations of Rudd Labor. Fuelwatch is a dud and should be opposed.

                          , I believe I can speak with some authority on the intent of these bills. The reason for that is that Fuelwatch has operated in metropolitan and regional areas in Western Australia since January 2001, so we have had almost seven years of comprehensive experience of how Fuelwatch operates and the benefits it provides to consumers in Western Australia. Fuelwatch in Western Australia was introduced by the Court Liberal government in response to a select committee report. Since that time it has been supported by both the Gallop and Carpenter
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_government" rel="nofollow">

                          s and it will be maintained by the Barnett Liberal government.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          So how does Fuelwatch work? At 2 pm petrol retailers are required to provide a price at which they will sell petrol the next day. At around 4 pm that information is available on a website. Fuelwatch also operates a personalised email service. On evening news bulletins, information on the cheapest petrol prices and the suburbs that have the cheapest petrol prices is listed for viewers. The information is also available regularly and readily on radio, and the next morning the daily paper also lists the daily petrol prices. It is an extraordinarily popular scheme. Why? Because motorists know what petrol prices will be for that day. If there is going to be an increase, they have 14 hours to decide whether they need petrol and to take advantage of the lower price. Consumer surveys have reported that over 90 per cent of Western Australian motorists are aware of Fuelwatch. A

                          —survey shows that 57 per cent of motorists use the service. Over 32,000 motorists receive daily emails on petrol prices. The point is that almost all motorists are generally aware of the range of petrol prices on any given day.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Much has been made about how supplying pricing information to motorists will lead to a reduction in competition, but that has not been the experience in Western Australia for the last seven years. Pricing information in the eastern states is available but you have to pay for it. Large petrol retailers subscribe to a company called Informed Sources, which collects information on petrol prices in defined geographic areas. Updates are then provided to large retailers several times a day. Informed Sources was not willing to disclose the cost of collecting data on retail prices throughout the day or what it charged its clients for the service. I would imagine that it is rather an expensive service. Apparently the company relies heavily on people driving from service station to service station to get the information. So what we have are large petrol retailers with information on competitors’ prices throughout the day. If their competitors are cheaper, they drop their prices. But what if their competitors have a higher price? Do they maintain the price advantage they have or do they make a decision to maximise profit? It is a fair question that is difficult to answer because petrol prices can change throughout the day.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I understand it is common for someone who is looking for the best price on their way to work to find that the same retailer is not the cheapest on their way home. Receiving updated information on petrol price fluctuations throughout the day is not an illegal practice; however, the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                           ACCC
                          </a>
                          has described it as being ‘as close to illegal collusion as you can get’. Fuelwatch, by comparison, will provide retailers and motorists alike with up-to-date and accurate information on petrol prices in their particular suburb. The information would also be available to independent retailers who, I understand, are not regular subscribers to Informed Sources. It is my understanding that independents drive around a few times a day and do their own research on local competition. However, by far the greatest advantage is that Fuelwatch will provide motorists with information on what petrol prices will be tomorrow, not what they were half an hour ago.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          There is considerable merit in a national Fuelwatch scheme.
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
                           The Senate
                          </a>
                          was not so sure about that and referred the matter to the Senate
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                           Standing Committee

                          on Economics back in June 2008. Unusually, the committee was told not to report until 29 September 2008, and that report was tabled around the middle of October. The report properly recommended that the Senate support the introduction of a national Fuelwatch scheme. It also recommended that a review of the scheme be undertaken 12 months after its introduction and the data collected by Fuelwatch be released to independent academic researchers.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          But, in what has become common practice, those opposite have chosen to issue a dissenting report. Their main opposition to the plan is that watching fuel prices will not bring them down. What an obvious comment to make. What an obvious theme to have in their report. Clearly the opposition do not understand the intent of the bills, which is to provide consumers across Australia with information on the price of petrol at each service station in the metropolitan and major regional areas every day.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The value of the scheme comes from its utility. The utility lies in the fact that every evening on each of the major news bulletins there will be 30 seconds in which the price of petrol by suburb and by retailer will be disclosed. The price will then be fixed for a 24-hour period so that we as consumers will know that, for example, tomorrow the cheapest fuel will be available from Caltex in Belmont. The utility, the drive, lies in the disclosure. Disclosure leads to price competition, price competition leads to consumer choice, and consumer choice leads to maximisation of welfare. The benefit of disclosure is that it is an aid to effective price competition. Consumers will be able to ask the most obvious of questions: why? Why are petrol prices 20c a litre higher in an outlet 300 yards away from another? Why is there a 20c a litre differential? This in turn will require responses from major wholesalers and fuel companies to justify to the public their price settings and margin settings. Again, it will assist in the elimination of hyperbole, disinformation, misinformation and outright lies about a product critical to industry and households alike. The bills will also give compliance and enforcement powers for the scheme to the ACCC.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          There are many critics of this scheme. They are found only on the benches opposite. However, there is no—and I quote from the dissenting report—‘overwhelming evidence that it provides a greater certainty of higher prices’. The truth is that price volatility does not equal competition, that weekly price cycles cannot guarantee motorists get the best price if they fill up on a Tuesday and that supermarket shop-a-docket discounts have not led to a measurable increase in competition in petrol prices. I quote from the dissenting report:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          The evidence also suggested that a national scheme would adversely affect the position of independent retailers, making the market less competitive.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The truth is that there is the same percentage of independent retailers in the Perth market as in other capital cities and that they are not disadvantaged by fixing petrol prices for 24 hours. Motorists and independent petrol retailers in my home state support Fuelwatch and want it to continue. And, in the Western Australian experience, the Fuelwatch scheme has received for the last seven years, with different governments, bipartisan support.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Coalition members recommend in their dissenting report that the bills be opposed. My question to those opposite is: why is it only motorists under a Liberal government that are permitted to enjoy the benefits of a Fuelwatch scheme? This is a scheme that will empower motorists to make informed decisions about where and when they fill up their cars. It will increase the reliability and certainty of fuel price information for motorists every day of the week, and it has done so every day of the week for the last seven years. It will also provide motorists with information that in most Australian cities is only available to large petrol retailers.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          In summary, Fuelwatch is a scheme that was championed by the Court Liberal government in 2000. It was supported by the Gallop and Carpenter Labor governments. And in the lead-up to the last state election, barely two months ago, Mr Barnett—now the Liberal Premier for Western Australia—said he would not tamper with the existing state Fuelwatch scheme. As late as 3 October 2008, the daily paper in Western Australia reported the Liberal state Treasurer as saying that he had received advice from his department, the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Consumer_and_Employment_Protection" rel="nofollow">

                          </a>
                          , that Fuelwatch in Western Australia was working successfully. He went further and said to the
                          <i>

                          </i>
                          that allowing petrol stations to lower their prices on the same day to match those of their competitors would ‘undermine the integrity’ of the system. He also said:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          What Fuelwatch does is provide information to consumers to allow them to make decisions as to where they buy their petrol …
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          That is precisely what the national scheme is intended to do, it is precisely what the national scheme wants to do and it is precisely what the national scheme, if enacted, will do. It will provide information on a website and through reports in the media on the price of petrol for the next day. It will allow consumers to identify when and where to buy fuel at the lowest price.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          It is incomprehensible to argue that competition will be eroded by fixing the price of petrol for a 24-hour period. It is incomprehensible to argue that a motorist who stumbles across a retailer offering a lower petrol price at, say, three o’clock in the afternoon is participating in a competitive process. Fuelwatch will provide a competitive environment because it will allow motorists to buy the cheapest petrol at the cheapest petrol stations at the cheapest times. You cannot ask for a better scheme. There will be no guesswork involved in picking the best time and place to get the best price. Fuelwatch is not a silver bullet that will lower petrol prices, but it will ensure that drivers do not pay one cent more than they have to or one cent more than they choose to. The government has committed to a review of the effectiveness of the national Fuelwatch scheme after 12 months. I am betting that consumers across Australia will be as supportive as those in Western Australia. I commend the bills to the Senate.

                                  , the peak motoring body in my state, which cast serious doubts about whether such a scheme could assist in reducing retail petrol prices. And, just as significantly, I was contacted by independent petrol retailers who told me unambiguously that Fuelwatch could well squeeze them out of the market because small players could not spread the risk if they locked in a price for 24 hours and got it wrong, compared with the larger operators who had the financial muscle to be able to do that. The independent operators told me that the most effective way to make a difference with fuel prices at the pump would be to tackle the wholesale market and the stranglehold that the big four oil companies have in this country over the supply and distribution of fuel.

                                  I subsequently moved for a select committee inquiry into the wholesale fuel market in South Australia and the impact the mothballing of the Mobil Port Stanvac refinery and storage facility was having on consumers. The evidence that that inquiry heard was clear. It showed that consumers could get a benefit of some 4c a litre, possibly more, if the wholesale market was freed up and made more competitive. So in a sense I agree with Minister Bowen’s intended policy destination—to reduce the price of fuel. Where we differ is on the best path to achieve that. At this stage I want to thank the minister for his time in discussing this issue with me. I am also grateful for the meeting I had with

                                  do not support Fuelwatch. The RAA, in its submission to the Senate inquiry on this issue, stated that by forcing retailers to lock in prices for a full 24 hours you actually flatten the price cycle and reduce the opportunity for motorists to seek out a bargain. To quote directly from the RAA submission:

                                  RAA has long opposed the introduction of a Fuelwatch scheme into South Australia (1) due to the absence of comprehensive modelling which shows

                                  motorists would benefit from such a scheme; and (2) on the basis that Adelaide’s retail market is highly competitive and operates under a distinct and predictive weekly discount cycle. Indeed Adelaide’s discount cycle clearly demonstrates that the price available at the bottom of each week’s cycle (Tuesdays) is consistently lower than those prices likely to be available under Fuelwatch.

                                  motorists would be no better off should a national Fuelwatch scheme be introduced. In fact, such a scheme has the potential to deliver higher fuel costs.

                                  Mr Acting Deputy President, I want to achieve a reduction in the retail price of fuel. And I believe there are significantly better ways for the government to achieve this than by running a Fuelwatch scheme. One way forward is that the whole issue of oil retail prices needs to be simplified. Price boards are almost written in code these days, and motorists are the ones being left confused or, worse, misled. I believe the ACCC should work with petrol retailers to develop a price board protocol to minimise confusion amongst motorists. So-called discounted prices can be deceptive. If you do not have a discount docket, what is the price then? Sometimes the discounts are 4c, sometimes they can be 20c—depending on whether you have gone to an associated liquor outlet. Sometimes it is not a true discount—if the retail price is inflated, as it has been in recent times. How can motorists really know what they are going to be paying? But that is at the retail end.

                                  I believe that, if the government is serious about helping motorists, it needs to be tackling the wholesale market. It is here that significant savings can be achieved. We need to inject new competition at the wholesale level. This means opening up the current buy-sell arrangements between the big four oil companies to competition rather than letting these arrangements continue to operate as a cosy club between the oil companies to the detriment of independent retailers and to the detriment of motorists. We need to open up access to terminal and storage facilities, controlled by the oil companies, to inject new competition into the market. Without access to these facilities importers simply cannot get the product into Australia to help break the oil companies’ stranglehold over the wholesale fuel market.

                                  and diesel prices; and, finally, the government immediately strengthening the Oilcode regulations under the Trade Practices Act to ensure independents continue to play an important and competitive role in the retail market. On this I note the work of Minister Ferguson in reviewing the Oil Code. That is important because the Oil Code needs to be reviewed and reformed to give the independent operators a fighting chance.

                                  I had a discussion with Professor Zumbo earlier this morning and I believe that these recommendations have real merit. I also want to refer to the removal of the ‘sites’ act from our legislative framework several years ago. It was supported—and I believe shamefully—by both the coalition and the Labor Party. It was opposed by some crossbenchers, including Senator Joyce, who crossed the floor to oppose the abolition of the sites act. The sites act had a ceiling of five per cent on the control that oil companies could have over petrol sites. That has been lifted. We are now seeing a slow, creeping but steady acquisition of sites and a greater degree of vertical integration in the market.

                                  So when the government talks about trying to do something at the retail level, that to me just does not cut it. It does not address the fundamental issue that, where the wholesale price can be manipulated and is less competitive than it should be, that obviously impacts on the retail price. That is what we need to do. We need to have real transparency at the wholesale level. Without this transparency we will never know if the pump price is a fair price.

                                  entitled ‘Petrol giants quizzed over margins’. The article reported that petrol prices had fallen by less than 14c a litre at a time when the international oil price had more than halved. Even after factoring in the slide in the Australian dollar, the crude oil price had fallen from a peak of $153 a barrel in July to $100 a barrel back on 20 October. Whilst I accept that there are a number of factors at play, the question has to be asked whether consumers are getting the full benefits of a reduction in world oil prices. I and many other Australians would suspect not.

She slashed the unleaded petrol price to 94.5c a litre in protest against the petrol companies and supermarkets, which she says are killing small business enterprises. Yesterday in Adelaide a number of independent fuel outlets made similar complaints about this unlevel playing field.

                                  Recently I met with the Petrol Commissioner designate, Joe Dimasi. It was a good meeting and I certainly wish Mr Dimasi well in his new role. One of the issues I would urge him to investigate is whether oil companies are passing on the full extent of the drop in world oil prices.

                                  The Motor Trades Association of Australia also supports real transparency at the wholesale fuel level. They are also seeking a review of import parity pricing in the way that the benchmarks are set.

                                  I am strongly committed to cutting the cost of petrol for motorists, but Fuelwatch is not the answer. I support the RAA when it says ‘there is more merit in looking to expand the availability of real-time pricing information to motorists rather than introducing a national Fuelwatch scheme’. The RAA said:
                                 </p>
                                 <p class="italic">
                                  This option would make real-time price information available to the public for each petrol retailer—ideally through a website managed by the ACCC and/or utilising the Australian automobile clubs.

                                  There has been a suggestion that those who do not support Fuelwatch support the big four oil companies. I think it is clear from what I have said that that is not the case. We need to tackle the big four oil companies, and there has been a lack of political will in this country over many years, under both coalition and

                                  I agree with the destination Minister Bowen has been seeking—that is, to lower the price of fuel for motorists. But Fuelwatch is the wrong road to achieving that. I look forward to working with the government to find the right road to cheaper petrol. If the government want my support in tackling the wholesale price of fuel and retail transparency and in tackling the power of the big four oil companies over fuel supply and distribution in this country, they have it. If you want to drive down fuel prices, you need to tackle the wholesale market and you need to tackle the big four oil companies. We must find better ways to help motorists, but Fuelwatch is not that way.

                                   , which concern the Fuelwatch scheme. I note that the basis on which Fuelwatch was proposed was increased petrol prices in Australia. For the 20 years that I have been in politics, every time fuel prices go up governments rush around and announce yet another inquiry into fuel prices, and that inquiry comes out with a whole range of recommendations and very little ever happens. The main reason for that is that you can run around all you like and have as many investigations as you like into fuel prices—and I have absolutely no doubt that there is manipulation in the market to a certain degree—but the underlying driver of increased fuel prices is the increasing price of oil at a global level and the underlying driver of that is that the world is running out and has already run out of cheap, easily accessible oil.

                                   Global oil, in my view, has peaked. That is not to say that it has run out. It is saying that from now on extracting oil globally is going to become more and more expensive as the explorers have to go into deeper water, more difficult terrain and, of course, have to deal with the extreme weather events of climate change, which we have already seen in terms of reduced field capacity, especially when you have a look at what is happening in the Caribbean as a result of extreme storms, cyclones and the like. The issue is, as the

                                   The future of human prosperity depends on how successfully we tackle the two central energy challenges facing us today: securing the supply of reliable and affordable energy; and effecting a rapid transformation to a low-carbon, efficient and environmentally benign system of energy supply.

                                   In my view, Fuelwatch is actually fiddling while Rome burns. We need to deal with the fact that Australia is no longer self-sufficient in oil. We are already importing more than 50 per cent of the oil used in this country, and it is to the detriment of motorists and farmers. You only have to look at the increased price of petrochemical fertilisers to see the impact on agriculture and the flow-on effects to food prices. There is the whole dependence of the working fleet in Australia—whether it is in agriculture, fisheries or whatever it is—on petroleum based product. We are now in a situation where Australia has lost its independence in terms of energy security and we, just like the Europeans, are reeling from the fact that we are not sustainable or self-sufficient. We are now dependent on what is out there.

We had, at the time,

                                   telling us that it did not matter because Australia could always buy oil on the global market and that we could be net energy positive because of our gas supplies. To an extent that is true in terms of the exports but it does not alter the fact that, when you import that much foreign oil and are vulnerable to the machinations of the oil supply globally, you are going to end up in this scenario.

                                   Fiddling around with a scheme that is just to give motorists a more informed choice is really not delivering on the critical issue, which is: what are we going to do to get off our dependence on imported foreign oil, which is also driving up our greenhouse gas emissions? That is what we should be doing. That means that the government should have a national energy and transport strategy that gets Australia off its dependence on foreign oil and makes a significant contribution to our targets, which we have already under Kyoto but also under a post-2012 scenario.

                                   The first thing the government should be doing is looking at the issue of urban design and how we might redesign and rethink our cities and convert them into urban villages linked by rapid mass transit. Then they should look at our national transport system to get off our dependence on road based transport and get our freight onto the rail networks. To do that we have to spend money through

                                   We need to consider the fact that aviation fuel is one of the few fuels that, at the moment, is not substitutable with anything else and that we are going to see increased prices for aviation fuel. We saw it in the price spike earlier this year and it is going to come again. That means that we need to start looking in Australia at building, particularly between Sydney and Canberra, for example, the kind of fast rail networks that you have in Europe. It is a logical thing to do.

                                   When we look at rescuing the car industry we need to not only go with a strategy of electrifying the car fleet and moving to plug-in hybrids, which I support, but also look at building public transport systems. We need to be actually building those systems and rolling them out in Australia as part of a national transport strategy. When the fuel prices went up, people went to get out of their cars and onto public transport, but the public transport was not able to do the job because it has been run down over a long period of time. People will use public transport if it is safe, clean and efficient. At the moment, depending on where you are, there is a variety of combinations of how that might be achieved.

                                   We need to look at having this national strategy which recognises that we need to get off oil and to electrify the transport fleet, to get the freight onto the trains, to get more people out of their cars and onto that public transport. We need to ensure that the cars are plug-ins and that they are powered by renewable energy sources, which goes to the national strategy on energy security. This means rolling out more renewable energy and enabling consumers to be energy suppliers by putting photovoltaics on their roofs, by having small-scale hydro, by having small wind turbines or whatever they are going to have domestically, plus plug into solar thermal and the like. This is the kind of big picture thinking Australia ought to be engaged in to come up with a really bold national strategy which looks at squarely facing climate challenges and oil challenges.

                                   I will just go through the way the government is responding. You have Fuelwatch, which is a tiny fiddling-around-the-edges program. I agree with Senator Xenophon and others who have spoken in here—particularly Senator Joyce—about the need to actually look at the wholesale market and at the transparency issues with regard to that. We need to look at the import parity issues and the Oil Code regulation. All those sorts of things need to happen, and I do not think there would be anyone in the Senate who would object to those things happening.

                                   That will make a marginal difference, but Fuelwatch and even dealing with those wholesale issues will still only make a marginal difference. If you are serious about acting and acting fast, we need to get on to mitigation strategies and planning strategies for the long term. As the Hirsch report to the

                                   The obvious conclusion from this analysis is that with adequate, timely mitigation, the costs of peaking can be minimized. If mitigation were to be too little, too late, world supply/demand balance will be achieved through massive demand destruction (shortages), which would translate to significant economic hardship …

                                   That is what we had recently when the oil price went above $100 a barrel and approached $150 a barrel. Then you start getting chronic dislocation and shortages in places, like

                                   , where there is very little public transport. We know that the way Australian cities have developed the poorest people live furthest from the centre of the city; drive the oldest, least efficient cars and have the least, if any, access to public transport. So they are the people who are disproportionately affected when you get higher oil prices flowing on to high petrol prices. With Fuelwatch you might be able to give them some certainty around one or two cents, but in the longer term we need to ensure that there are better options for moving those people so that they are protected permanently.

                                   It is actually cruel to keep building cities that do not take into account the need to mitigate greenhouse gases and oil prices. I know there will be some people saying, ‘Oh well, this doesn’t really matter so much because the underlying issue is not peak oil; there is plenty out there.’ I would draw their attention to the International Energy Agency report which has just come out on 6 November which is pointing out that, whilst there is a global economic slump that has curbed energy demand and pushed oil prices down in recent months, it will only provide a short-lived respite for consumers. The International Energy Agency is saying that supply shortfalls that pushed oil prices into triple-digit territory this year are far from resolved and could lead to a new period of high prices. In fact, it goes on to say that we are going to see oil consumption reach 106 million barrels a day in 2030, up from 86 million barrels a day this year. If that is the case, where is this oil supply going to come from? There have been several large-scale new developments announced but they have not been taken forward—the investment has not been forthcoming. We are rapidly going to reach a time when the economic stimulus packages get the economies going again, the demand is going to rise but the supply is not going to be there for the reasons I mentioned in the beginning—the cheap, easily accessible oil is gone and now we are into accessing oil from much trickier scenarios: deeper sea, more difficult terrain and extreme weather events.
                                  </p>
                                  <p>
                                   What I would like to see the government do is actually give a sense to Australians of whether they believe in peak oil—whether they think peak oil has occurred and what we are going to do about it. How are we going to get rural Australia off its dependence on petrochemical fertilisers—off its dependence on petroleum based products, whether it is in fisheries or farming? How are we actually going to do that? When are we going to say there is a win-win scenario here by getting our rural community back to more sustainable farming practices and by giving them adaptation strategies to farm renewable energy as well as to increase their soil carbon, build more resilience in the face of climate change, and reduce their prices and improve their margins? That is the kind of strategy we should be looking at as a nation rather than what I see as a political exercise to disguise the reality of the situation. Governments are going to wring their hands and say, ‘There is nothing we can do about the international oil price.’ That is right; there is nothing we can do about that. What we can do is get ourselves off the dependence on foreign oil and that oil price and at the same time meet our climate objectives.

                                   It is not a sensible policy to spend millions on coal to liquids, which is what the Australian government strategy is at the moment, saying: ‘Yes, we could well be in a situation where we can’t run our cars on petrol because we cannot afford it. Therefore we are going to run them on coal.’ That is a terrible strategy. It is a bad climate strategy. You cannot be serious about addressing climate change if you go down that route, and that was one of the conclusions of the oil inquiry conducted in the Senate three years ago—that we ought not to be issuing policies to deal with energy security that undermine our climate strategies. So I would like to see that work on liquefying coal finished, over, done with, and instead the effort going into electrifying the car fleet and, as I said, rebuilding the rail network so that we have that freight network along the east coast of Australia and the Sydney bottleneck dealt with—and at the same time the rollout of public transport systems, urban metros and a fast train between Sydney and Canberra, for example.
                                  </p>

                                   I just think what we have got with Fuelwatch is a political reaction to high fuel prices that disguises the actual problem we are dealing with. Yes, you have got manipulation by the oil companies. I am sure that is the case. As Senator Xenophon said, we can deal with those things; bring them in here and let us deal with the Oilcode, let us deal with import parity and let us deal with transparency in pricing. But it is not going to change anything when the oil price gets to $150 or even goes north of $150 and higher towards $200 a barrel. That is what I would like the government to exercise its mind on. There is an opportunity to do it now when there is a respite in the oil price, where it has fallen back in the short term because of the global economic downturn and less demand now. The pressure is not on so much now, so now is the time to bring out a national strategy to tell Australians how we are going to get off oil, how we are going to electrify the transport fleet, how we are going to invest in the rail networks and how we are going to roll out renewable energy so we can electrify the fleet. It was exciting news to hear that we had a company here ready to invest in three Australian cities with plug-in stations for the electric cars. That goes hand-in-hand with the investment in what I hope will be plug-in hybrids.

                                   The second thing we can be doing is looking at second generation biofuels. We certainly do not want to go down the track of substituting food-growing land for fuel-growing land. That has been a bad strategy globally and has had many perverse outcomes, including the loss of tropical forests, which is a disaster. The second generation of biofuels using lignocellulose and actually generating a fuel from a waste product is well worth investing in. Also,

                                   have developed algae grown from salt pans which can be put in the centre of a solar collector and the chemical reaction makes a high-grade transport fuel. That is a win-win for rural Australia because it means that people who have salt pans and high levels of salinity on their properties can actually do something with that, and frequently those areas also have very good solar radiation. So it is a win-win scenario, again providing rural Australia with an alternative to the kind of farming they do now. They could be not only farming renewable energy but also generating a transport fuel if we get behind that research.

                                   What we need is a national strategy that deals with energy security and climate change that says, upfront, it is an unacceptable scenario for Australia to be left so vulnerable and exposed as to be dependent for more than 50 per cent of its oil on foreign imports. It is an unacceptable scenario for us in a climate change world to go down the route of liquefying coal. Therefore, what do we do that addresses climate change, that gives us self-sufficiency in transport fuel, and, at the same time, builds competitiveness and new jobs? The competitiveness and new jobs will come from the investment in those technologies and the rollout of the green new deal infrastructure. Fuelwatch, as I see it, is just fiddling while Rome burns.

                                   The kind of strategy I am talking about is what Australians want to hear from their government—a strategy that says there is a whole-of-government approach that is internally consistent. Infrastructure Australia with its building fund will roll out public transport systems and the freight links that we are talking about. We then go to Resources and to Education and say, ‘Let us invest in commercialising those technologies which give us self-sufficiency, keep our best brains in Australia and get the jobs out there in rural Australia.’ We go to Agriculture and say, ‘Adapt to climate change. If you can’t continue to do what you are doing on your land now because of the temperatures and the climate then let us farm renewable energy.’

                                   position is that we will support Fuelwatch because, on average, we think it will not do any harm and it may do some good, but it is fiddling while Rome burns. I implore the government to see that there is a big picture here. This is a political gesture towards a problem which is going to come back as the oil price goes up to $150 again, before they will have made any decisions about how to address it, and we will have another inquiry at that point and be no further advanced.

But now that those votes were firmly in their party’s pocket, the Labor Government is trying to pass off a mere website as a solution to this problem that has inflicted so much pain to Australian hip pockets. The government contends that this scheme will ease the squeeze on motorists by informing the public of where fuel prices are lowest in their area. And petrol stations would be obligated to set their prices for a 24 hour period, on pain of a hefty fine.

                                     In other words Fuelwatch is a giant government-mandated price-fixing scheme. And price-fixing constitutes the antithesis of competition. The Coalition Critique of the Labor’s interim report on Fuelwatch in the Senate Economics Committee explained this basic economic principle as follows:

But even economic semi- literates who occupy the government front bench should be aware that constraints on competition will raise prices rather than lower them. Even an economic dilettante like Treasurer Wayne Swan should understand that anything that reduces the flexibility of the fuel market will only make petrol dearer.

                                     And then there are the gaping inconsistencies in the government’s claims about the benefits that Fuelwatch will supposedly provide. First you have the Prime Minister, who asserted that the scheme would bring about a reduction of 1.9 cents per litre in the “relevant weekly average price margin.” Then Labor’s petrol Tzar,

                                     , who walked off the job after only four months, claimed that the national implementation of the scheme would lower prices by 5 cents per litre. And finally, you have the Treasurer himself, who is peddling the Fuelwatch fish story that motorists will save $10 per tank, which works out to a whopping 20 cents per litre. So which is it? 1.9 cents per litre? 5 cents per litre? Or 20 cents per litre? This government is the political equivalent of the gang that couldn’t shoot straight. They can’t even get the lines straight on their Fuelwatch sales pitch.

                                      </a>
                                      was elected on the promise that it was listening to Australia’s working families and that Labor had heard they were suffering under the dual yoke of rising grocery prices and increasing petrol prices and that, enough was enough.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      It went to the people saying it had a plan to fix the cost of living pressures that grocery and petrol price increases were introducing.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      Mind you, it didn’t say what the plan was for either —because, I suspect, it didn’t have one - but it did say that it had a plan.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      And many Australians, who were finding the increase in the price of petrol and groceries difficult to manage, liked the sound of someone who said they had a plan.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      They didn’t want to know the details, or the realities of how prices of both are delivered, or the effects on petrol prices of international factors, or even the lack of competition in both the wholesale petroleum markets in Australia and the retail grocery market and how that affects retail prices.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      All they wanted to hear was that someone could bring the prices down—and that is what the then Labor Opposition told Australians—regardless of Labor’s ability, inability or otherwise to actually implement this promise.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      Why are petrol prices so important to Australians? Because many Australians have limited or fixed incomes that are stretched already. Combine that with the importance of the mobility that having their own car provides and increases in petrol costs suddenly start to seriously impact upon their lifestyle.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      Of course, there are worse things that can happen to Australian families than having to use their car a little less, or even a lot less. But it is important to understand that the personal mobility provided to Australians by being able to afford to drive their car is significant to most. And the impact on lifestyle by reducing that mobility is not something they want to accept.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      As such, and make no mistake about this, the drift in votes to Labor at the last election—a drift that delivered them government—was in a large part contributed to by people who heard Labor say they would bring the price of petrol down and that they expect them to do so.
                                     </p>

                                      We have before us a Bill that is the Rudd Labor’ Government’s total commitment to addressing petrol pricing—a bill to take a scheme in place in Western Australia and turn it into a national scheme—a scheme that at best in Western Australia has been spectacularly ineffective at reducing prices and at worst, has introduced anti-competitive pressures and largely removed the ability of WA motorists to access their petrol at the bottom end of the price cycle.

                                      Prime Minister Rudd was quoted earlier this year as saying ‘we have done as much as we physically can to provide additional help to the family budget recognising that the cost of everything is still going through the roof cost of food, cost of petrol, cost of rents, cost of childcare.’
                                     </p>

                                      At the same time, he went on to say ‘when it comes to things you do not have direct control over, obviously in terms of the global price of oil, then what you can do is simply act in the other areas to make sure that there are some more dollars to draw upon in terms of the family budget’.
                                     </p>

                                      At the time, this statement by the Prime Minister attracted a lot of negative press and the justified ire of many Australians

                                      It is not that he is so wrong. The fact is that a lot of what was driving up petrol prices earlier this year were outside the sphere of influence of the

                                      What annoyed so many Australians was the fact that this was no different prior to the 2007 election, when he was travelling around the country quite happily telling people that there was a lot that could be done, the then Coalition government wasn’t doing any of it and that a Labor Government would

                                      I am sure that there are Australians all over the country who expected a little more of Mr Rudd when he told them he felt their pain on petrol costs, who heard him say that he had a plan and who thought the plan would be something more than a half baked copy of a system that had delivered little or no price benefit in Western Australia

                                      Many of the inquiries into petrol pricing I have already referred to, examine these issues and particularly the first of them—that is the policies implemented at an Australian government level affecting the regulatory environment in which petrol is sold and the level of true competition at both a wholesale and retail level

                                      the government has argued that the Fuelwatch scheme, the subject of the bill before this chamber today, is designed to address the issue of competition in the petrol markets and that the new regulatory environment it creates will promote additional competition.

                                      said on the ABC that Fuelwatch would lower fuel prices by 2cp1.

                                      Within a week, in the face of the barrage of criticism and evidence thrown up in horror at the prospect of a national Fuelwatch scheme, the rhetoric of the Minister responsible, Chris Bowen, had dramatically changed.
                                     </p>

                                      No longer was he, or the government claiming the main reason for the scheme was price. On the contrary ‘the much more important reason for doing this is to give consumers more information’.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      Ah, I see now, when Labor went on the attack about petrol prices before the election, when they aggressively accused the Coalition government of being asleep on the job with petrol and that they would put a ‘cop on the beat’—they weren’t talking about petrol prices —and the difficulties Australia’s ‘working families’ were having with rising petrol costs—no they were promising to give motorists more information!
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      And I am sure that the many Australians who voted for them because they ‘had a plan’ did so because they thought that plan would ‘give them more information’.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      Unfortunately for the many Australians facing real and worrying cost of living pressures as petrol prices remain high and grocery prices and rents keep rising, more information is not what they want or need.
                                     </p>

                                      Australians were hoodwinked by Labor prior to the last election —the government promised something they knew they couldn’t, or possibly more accurately, wouldn’t deliver.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      The Prime Minister’s statements that there is little that can be done by the Australian government to affect international oil prices is correct.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      But he knew that before last year’s election.

                                     <p class="italic">
                                      Yet Labor deliberately worked towards creating the impression that they would tackle petrol prices head on and make a meaningful difference.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      It was a con of a grand scale conducted on the Australian public and the Labor Party should stand condemned.
                                     </p>

                                      But as mentioned, there are measures the government can take that can either directly reduce petrol prices, or genuinely lead to pressures that will keep it lower than it would otherwise have been.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      A cut in excise is the obvious, easy direct route in lowering petrol prices —such as the 5 cents a litre cut in excise tax as promised by the Coalition.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      This would deliver a real cut in petrol prices—and I don’t for one minute accept the intellectually dishonest argument posed by many on the other side of this place, that 5 cents is nothing and would be swallowed up by small changes in the international price of oil, or a fall in the Australian dollar.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      This trivialises the challenges faced by Australians in meeting their cost of living challenges.

                                     <p class="italic">
                                      The fact is that a 5 cent cut in the excise is the one petrol price measure that can’t be taken away by international factors.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      No matter what the international price of oil, no matter what the exchange rate, if you take 5 cents off the excise, petrol will always be 5 cents a litre cheaper than it would have been.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      This is fact and presents a 5 cent a litre saving every time Australian motorists fill up, for so long as the excise remains at the new rate - for ever—whether petrol is $1 a litre, $1.50 a litre, or $2 a litre.
                                     </p>

                                      Sure it is a costly measure in terms of the Government’s budget, but we are in Australia in a fortunate position of having had a substantial surplus—despite the current woes, we can arguably, as a government, afford the measure. But even more so, given the current economic crisis and the almost certain slowing of the Australian economy, taking a few billion out of the hands of the government and giving it back to the people is the economically responsible thing to do.
                                     </p>
                                     <p class="italic">
                                      We have been saying this for some months and the government itself finally acknowledged this with its $10.4bn plan to stimulate the economy for most of this year, the government has been strenuously arguing that we need to maintain a high budget surplus … and their approach to this was to take the money off the people so they can’t spend it, thereby cooling an overheating economy.

                                      Indeed, any of our efforts to stop them taking money from taxpayers lead to an accusation that we were economic vandals.

                                      , as the then Shadow Treasurer, has been warning the government about the potential effects on the growth of the Australian economy of rising petrol prices and the international financial crisis, since February this year he has consistently called for the government to hold back a little on its zeal for cooling the economy, because these two factors were going to have a major cooling effect and that it would be prudent to take a more cautious approach.

                                      Well, he was right, and this has been acknowledged by the Government as the likely impact of the international financial woes on the Australian economy finally sank in.

                                      It is important to understand that the objective of their $10.4bn package is the very opposite of the objective upon which their entire 2008 Budget strategy was based. It is a complete reversal of policy.

                                      We have told them all year to take it easy on their efforts to slow economic growth in Australia, because there are bigger things at play and, now, finally, they have acknowledged that —but because they had been trying to achieve the exact opposite of what is now openly acknowledged as being required, the government’s efforts to stimulate the economy have to be far more significant than they would if the government hadn’t been trying to contract the economy.
                                     </p>

                                      It also highlights how hollow the accusations levelled against us for holding up some of the budget measures are.

                                      If we had let them sail straight through, they would have been in effect out there cooling the economy, slowing economic growth and making it even harder to stimulate the economy as is openly agreed by all, now needed.

                                      Similarly, the economy would need less of a heart starter package, if two of the Coalition policies had been accepted by the Government.

                                      As has been noted by various commentators in the context of our policy to increase pensions, widespread economic stimulation is best achieved by returning taxpayers funds back to them to spend in the economy. The same principle applies to Australians and a cut in the excise tax.
                                     </p>

                                      Cutting excise tax will deliver both cheaper petrol prices and help to domestically stimulate an economy facing many factors trying to slow it down—a win win situation —but one the government has yet to adopt—despite its acknowledgement yesterday of the need to backflip on its policy of trying to slow economic growth.
                                     </p>

                                      Hopefully they will see the benefit of cutting petrol excise tax soon. Because implementing Fuelwatch certainly isn’t going to deliver economic stimulation, or cheaper petrol.

                                      Rather, it is in fact likely to increase prices through a minimisation of competition and removal of deep discounting during price cycles.

                                      The proposed Fuelwatch scheme is based on the existing scheme that has been operating in WA for some 7 to 8 years.

                                      There are varying claims about the success or otherwise of this scheme, the truth of which is clouded to a significant extent by the variable nature of other relevant factors in the price of petrol in WA and the other states that make it hard to do direct comparisons.

                                      The ACCC acknowledged that a significant part of the price increase could have been due to higher fuel standards introduced at the same time as WA Fuelwatch, but it also concluded that some of it is likely to be due to other factors, specifically mentioning the 24 hour rule.

                                      With respect to the greater transparency objective, the ACCC concluded that the publishing of petrol prices on the Fuelwatch website did increase price transparency, but also found it introduced unwanted distortions into the market.

                                      In terms of the reduction of volatility objective, the ACCC found that, contrary to wide held views, petrol prices were already relatively stable within a day —with Perth prior to the Fuelwatch scheme only experiencing an average of 1.18 changes per day, and that the change therefore had a minimal effect on volatility.

                                      And finally, the ACCC also found that the city country price differential blew out, totally in the face of the objective of reducing this differential.

                                      The ACCC concluded that on those findings, it was hard to see how that the WA Fuelwatch scheme had been successful, stating that it appeared a number of the Western Australian fuel pricing regulations may have been introduced quickly, without full consideration of their implications or the necessary administrative details for their successful implementation.

                                      Sounds eerily similar to the fast-track approach taken by the Rudd Labor Government in the face of dramatically rising fuel cost earlier this year.

                                      In their panic given the public clamour for them to live up to their promise, they announced the scheme and as petrol prices continued to rise and as the Coalition started to gain the public’s acceptance as the party capable of doing more in this regard, they rushed through legislation to implement their scheme, forcing a number of treasury officials to work 36 hours straight to meet their unreasonable and ill-considered deadline.

                                      The result was again, legislation that was introduced too quickly, and without full consideration of its implications or the necessary administrative details for its successful implementation.

                                      Since then, there have been a number of objective outside examinations of the WA Fuelwatch scheme and the weight of evidence has clearly demonstrated that it failed to deliver lower prices and may actually lead to limiting the opportunities for motorists to minimise their fuel bills.

                                      The overwhelming evidence presented to that inquiry was that there are a number of significant risks to petrol pricing as a result of this bill, that there are a number of very likely scenarios that will lead to higher petrol prices for most if not all Australians and that there is very little evidence, if any, to suggest that motorists will be any better off as a result.

                                      However, as noted in the minority report, any objective consideration of the evidence would, at minimum, have to have raised alarm bells that the scheme might actually raise petrol prices as a result of a lowering of competition and that the best that could be hoped for was that it would not harm motorists.

                                      Of course, the ACCC in its most recent report to the government, considered and written after the election of the Rudd Labor Government, takes a completely different tune to its past comments and findings.

                                      The ACCC’s methodology on its previous examinations of the WA Fuelwatch scheme were always made public and understandable by peers looking to review those results.

                                      But with this most recent consideration, the modelling upon which they base their findings has been kept secret.

                                      The reason why this is the case has been speculated on ad infinitum and I could put forward some obvious theories myself today—but I will decline to do so.

                                      Suffice it to say, the ACCC prior to the election of a government looking to nationalise the WA Fuelwatch system, had publicly panned that system as failing to deliver the benefits to consumers it was intended to deliver.

                                      As the ACCC’s modelling has not been publicly released and can’t be objectively peer reviewed, the unfortunate reality is that the weighting given to their findings must be lower than if it could be objectively tested.

                                      In its 2007 report, the ACCC pointed to a reduction in price of 1.9c per litre in WA, but also stated clearly that a lot more needed to be done before the scheme was rolled out nationally.

                                      The view of independent economists on this report suggested, even though the methodology was not released, that it was clear there were issues with it, including:.

                                       The ACCC failed to take account of the entry into the WA market of Coles.

                                      <li>
                                       The ACCC has since claimed to have adjusted for the Coles effect, but will not say how it did so.

                                       The ACCC analysis looks only at prices and not the volume sold at a particular price—for example, a service station with a price of $1.80 but selling no petrol is given the same weight as one with a price of $1.50 and selling high volumes, and.

                                       The ACCC refused to release its methodology so other economists can fully test its analysis and results.

                                      The ACCC has also been quite inconsistent in its comments about the potential benefits from a national Fuelwatch scheme.

                                      As mentioned, in its 2007 report, it talked about 1.9epl savings in WA as a justification for taking the scheme nationally.

                                      Remember, the Rudd Labor Government was elected partly on its promise to tackle petrol prices and after announcing the twin measures of Fuelwatch and a dedicated ACCC ‘petrol commissioner’ who has no additional powers, the Prime Minister said there was nothing more that could be done.

                                      And here we have the senior public servant responsible for implementing Fuelwatch and the boss of the petrol commissioner, saying that the government’s measures to tackle fuel prices aren’t intended to deliver lower prices.

                                      So given that the ACCC advice, so heavily relied upon by the government in justifying its petrol price plan, appears to be unconvincing and based on methodology that has not been released for peer review, maybe there was other advice received by the government that clearly outlined the potential benefits to Australians from implementing such a scheme?.

                                       The reality is of course, that all other departmental evidence the government received was completely contrary to that the ACCC says it provided the government.

                                      In fact, four key relevant departments, including the Prime Minister’s own department and Treasury, advised the government that the scheme should not be adopted and warned of potential negative consequences and that the scheme would push petrol prices up.

Operators with small networks are less able to employ this pricing strategy and are therefore placed at a competitive disadvantage in the market’.

                                      Also, the weekly price cycle present in Perth prior to Fuelwatch and still present in Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide, stretched out to a two week cycle upon the introduction of Fuelwatch.

                                      Evidence from motorist organisations—almost all of them—is that the scheme proposed in this bill will be detrimental to motorists and would create higher average fuel prices and remove much of the opportunity for canny motorists to buy their petrol at the heavily discounted end of the petrol cycle.

Fuelwatch was sold by the Rudd government with much fanfare as the scheme to help Australians struggling to cope with soaring fuel prices. It is no secret families need help with skyrocketing costs of petrol, but we are still unsure if Fuelwatch is the answer. Families in outer suburbs and regional areas have been hardest hit by soaring petrol prices. Lower income families and first home buyers tend to live in the outer suburbs where housing is cheaper, but because of poor public transport they depend on their cars and suffer from punishing petrol prices.

                                        understands how difficult it is for families to juggle soaring grocery prices, interest rates and high petrol prices. They deserve a fairer go from petrol companies and the government. That is why Family First has been campaigning for the past three years for a 10c a litre cut in petrol tax to help families. That is why Family First has campaigned to make sure we have a competitive petrol market. Family First believes the government can give Australians a fairer go with petrol and they can do this by providing real competition for petrol. It was very much a shame that when the Labor Party had the numbers with the Oilcode and the sites act a year or two ago they decided to throw it out and have no restrictions on who can own and operate petrol-retailing stations. What a shame. They knew they had the Family First vote. They knew they had Senator Joyce’s vote. They refused to make sure there was going to be real competition at the retail level. What a shame.

                                        When it came to predatory pricing the Rudd government went softer and weaker, not harder. Family First still believes they should go further with predatory pricing to make sure that pricing is not used to stomp out competition and to see independents disappear. We also believe that the

                                        should have greater powers when it comes to breaking up the cosy club that exists between the petrol retailers and the oil giants. We also believe that we need greater competition at the terminals and the storage facilities. These are things that the Rudd government can actually do to give Australians and their families, who are struggling to make ends meet and struggling to cope with petrol prices, a fairer go, and to bring real competition to see downward pressure on petrol prices.

                                        Family First started off as an enthusiastic supporter of Fuelwatch because we thought it would offer some relief to families. But after the events of the past six months that support is a lot more cautious. Last December the

This report found that motorists in Western Australia had saved 1.9c a litre on average due to the scheme there. On the basis of that report, which started under the then Howard government, Family First supported Fuelwatch as a scheme and a way to offer families some relief from skyrocketing petrol prices. The reported average saving per litre of 1.9c indicated that families could expect to save $300 million a year at the petrol pump.

                                        Fuelwatch sounded like it would really make a difference to struggling families. But by the time the Senate established an inquiry into Fuelwatch, on 17 June, the government was starting to change its mind about the scheme, and Family First had begun to reassess its support.

                                        inquiry presented an opportunity to again examine and consider the merits of Fuelwatch. Family First’s doubts grew as the government’s rhetoric on the Fuelwatch scheme continued to change. The government had been fully behind the Fuelwatch scheme, announcing cabinet approval for the scheme on 15 April and with the Prime Minister speaking about Fuelwatch at a press conference on 29 May. But it seems that after that date the government stopped mentioning the claimed 1.9c a litre difference in price. This significant change in rhetoric was confirmed when the ACCC fronted Senate estimates on 5 June this year and downplayed the price difference. The ACCC said that it was not the price difference that was the important part of Fuelwatch but the improved ability of families to compare petrol prices. The change of emphasis by the government was stark.

                                        Family First participated in the Senate inquiry and found a number of issues of concern arose including the question of whether independent petrol retailers are disadvantaged by Fuelwatch, why the federal government has not released its economic modelling to academics outside the federal government for peer review, whether reports of the

                                        scheme take into account the impact of the introduction of supermarket petrol retailing and whether reducing price fluctuations actually disadvantages families that go to the trouble of filling up at the bottom of the price cycle. Family First is prepared to consider the Fuelwatch scheme because it may well still help families cut their petrol bills—but no-one knows. But the government’s tap dancing on Fuelwatch and its shifting of the boundaries have failed to give Family First confidence that the scheme will do what it set out to do: save people money at the petrol pump. Given that no-one is prepared to guarantee Fuelwatch will cut the price of petrol and given the concerns raised, it would make sense to trial the scheme for a year in a market where there is some support for the scheme. Family First would support a Fuelwatch scheme if it were preceded by an open and transparent one-year trial so we could be sure that it would provide benefits to families and would not disadvantage small businesses before it was rolled out across Australia. Family First is proposing that both each state Premier and each state peak motoring body would have to endorse Fuelwatch before it would be adopted as a one-year trial in their state.

                                        So what does this mean? This would probably mean Fuelwatch being adopted in

                                        , is supportive. This would give the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission a chance to produce a detailed report after the first year of operation, when we can then properly evaluate the outcomes of the trial. If the outcomes of the trial are good, the Fuelwatch scheme can be rolled out to the rest of the country. Some argue that there has already been a trial in Western Australia. But the scheme in Western Australia was made for the people of WA and not as a test site. The effect of the WA scheme has come under question throughout the inquiry, so it is worth doing a purpose-built trial.

                                        The government has backed away from this scheme, saying that Fuelwatch is not about cutting the average petrol price and saying instead that the real benefit of the scheme is to help motorists compare prices between petrol stations. That backflip concerns Family First and should concern the Senate, because what we heard from experts at the Senate inquiry into the Fuelwatch scheme was that it may, instead, push prices up and squeeze out independent petrol retailers. Let’s be frank: if Fuelwatch is not going to cut the average petrol price, what is the point?

It’s about ensuring that the cards are not unfairly stacked against Australian motorists because of the way the retail market for petrol operates in this country.

It is estimated that the five major oil companies made a total profit world wide of $123 billion in 2007. This figure is predicted to increase significantly in 2008.

                                          Motorists are sick of the games played by the individual major petrol retailers where, if they don’t live in WA, the price of petrol can fluctuate during the day at their local petrol station for no apparent good reason.

                                          What we appear to have is a deliberate game of petrol price confusion orchestrated hour by hour, day by day, week by week, by the major petrol retailers.

                                          This is not just a strategy for individual petrol sellers to increase revenue through increased market share, it is a pricing strategy that has a much broader aim, namely to confuse the punters and to substantially take the edge off effective price competition in the retail petrol market.

                                          Before the introduction of WA’s Fuelwatch scheme, motorists in WA had to put up with intraday petrol price fluctuations at individual petrol outlets.

Fuel delivered at one price and sold at another while still in the tank? How does that work?

                                          From recent work done by the ACCC it has become evident that the marketing of petrol in Australia by the oil companies and the retail petrol chains is under pinned by a highly sophisticated system of petrol retail price monitoring and marketing techniques.
                                         </p>
                                         <p class="italic">
                                          We know, for example, that the major petrol retailer’s use a sophisticated retail petrol price monitoring service provided by a company called Informed Sources. The company is able to provide its Australian clients with petrol price information from more than 3500 retail petrol outlets every fifteen minutes across the major capital cities.
                                         </p>

                                          A service like this wouldn’t come cheap so it must be worth the money. How can it be claimed that this level of retail petrol price monitoring by the major petrol retailers benefits consumers while at the same time the major retailers infer that a national Fuelwatch scheme for consumers would somehow be bad for consumers?

                                          WA has had a highly regarded and successful Fuelwatch scheme in place for 8 years.

                                          The scheme protects WA motorists from being ambushed by petrol price changes, which in other states can occur at any petrol station at any time of the day or night. There is ample evidence that the WA scheme has consistently provided lower petrol prices compared with petrol prices in other state capitals.

                                          This is clearly illustrated by evidence given at the public hearings of the ACCC’s 2007 inquiry into the price of unleaded petrol. At the public hearing in Melbourne on 5th September 2007, Brett Davidson, the Retail Pricing Manager for

                                          Australia implied that BP didn’t like WA’s Fuelwatch 24 hour price regulation. BP thought it was a bad thing because it put BP in an uncertain position.

                                         <p class="italic">
                                          When pressed by counsel for the ACCC about this, the BP representative acknowledged that the 24 hour price regulation resulted in a little more guessing by BP and a little less guessing by the consumer.

                                         <p class="italic">
                                          Also the ACCC found that the refinery-marketers considered the WA Fuelwatch scheme as problematic because it prevented intra-day price movements.

                                          It’s apparent that companies selling petrol into the retail market would much prefer open slather with the retail price on an hourly basis if they can.

                                          Hence from the evidence collected by the ACCC Petrol Price Inquiry, it is difficult not to come to the conclusion that competition has two different meanings when it comes petrol retailing.
                                         </p>
                                         <p class="italic">
                                          For the refiner-marketers it is all about maximising profit in the market by skilful manipulation of retail petrol prices on, if necessary, an hourly basis and on an outlet by outlet basis, in order to nullify competitive forces in the market and to put the consumer on the back foot as far finding the cheapest petrol price.
                                         </p>
                                         <p class="italic">
                                          For the consumer, the expectation is that competition means he or she will be paying the fairest price that a truly competitive market can deliver. It is quite amazing that the Federal Liberal Party refuses to recognise these simple facts and is not willing to stand up for consumers.

                                          The stance by the major oil companies and the national petrol retailers, which apparently has the backing of the Federal Liberal Party, needs to be exposed for what it is, an unqualified case of commercial, if not ethical, double standards.

                                           Fuelwatch gets rid the guesswork for motorists looking to fill up the tank. It’s the best way for motorists to get the best-priced fuel. Like many people, I reckon that car-sickness is something that a motorist gets when he or she has to fill up the petrol tank. Fuelwatch may not be the perfect cure-all for this malady, but it will certainly go a long way towards easing the pain of prices for fuel.

                                           The answer is because the Fuelwatch scheme actually works! And you can bet your bippy that there would be an outcry amongst West Australian motorists if there were any move to take it away. Mr. Barnett knows Fuelwatch is a winner. Why don’t his Federal counterparts?

                                           As the majority report noted, large petrol retailers could adopt a ‘rolling price leaders’ strategy, whereby large retailers have different outlets having the cheapest fuel for different areas at different times.

                                           That particular chain would then consistently make the top 10 list of cheapest sites and then unfairly create the impression that that particular retailer had the cheapest fuel.

                                           This would put smaller operators at a disadvantage because they would be less able to employ such a strategy.

                                          <p class="italic">
                                           Consumers will be able to check which outlets of the large petrol chain is offering the cheapest fuel and not go to the more expensive ones.

                                            Furthermore, again contrary to his previous position, he said that ending the 24 hour rule would ‘undermine the integrity of the system.’

                                             … Australians are now acutely aware of the cost of petrol when deciding where they need to travel … be it the local shopping centre or a trip to town.

                                             The price of petrol is so intertwined with the daily lives of Australians that few are completely immune, it is difficult to think of life without the weekly trip to the pump.

                                             This need however fuels another reaction at the petrol bowsers from consumers. What Australians can’t stand … what they resent more than anything… is being taken advantage of … and, unfortunately, for all they face this reality weekly.

                                             Australians still and will always believe in the fair go. They feel that everyone should have an equal chance to deal with things as they find them … but what we see in the petrol market is one group of Australians with that chance and another group… a much bigger group … without the same opportunity.

                                             No one is suggesting that if a petrol retailer’s costs go up they cannot raise the price of fuel. Similarly, if the demand rises it is their choice to take the risk of raising prices and the others prerogative to follow or not. This is the essence of market driven competition…

                                             But there is another aspect of competition  it’s the ability of those at the pump to make their choices effectively and in their own best interest. Unfortunately this choice has up until now, been extremely limited.

                                             Currently, many petrol retailers in Australia subscribe to a service provided by the company “Informed Sources”. This company provides a mechanism where by subscribers can access information about petrol prices… around the country… accurate to 15 minutes.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="italic">
                                             Such information allows petrol retailers to stay on top of price shifts by competitors and react to them. Understandably this information is invaluable to them… …and they pay for it accordingly.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="italic">
                                             If a retailer raises their price they can know within a quarter of an hour whether their competitors are following. If they don’t, they can drop the price back and not risk losing market share… so far so good for consumers.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="italic">
                                             However, the reciprocal situation also applies. If a retailer sees within 15 minutes that one of their competitors has raised their price, they can do so as well. In this way as the information is passed so too does the price increase.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="italic">
                                             This leads to less competition… less transparency… and little or no benefit for consumers.
                                            </p>
                                            <p class="italic">
                                             Without the same immediate information the consumer’s choice is considerably weakened. The consumer cannot be expected to travel between service stations to compare prices… even if they did it may have change by the time they return.

                                             What this situation amounts to is a disparity of information between retailers and consumers on a daily… in fact quarter hour basis…

                                             The Fuelwatch model is not untested. It has been effectively operating in Western Australia since 2001.

                                             a motorist advocacy group has lent their voice to Fuelwatch stating that NRMA research has shown that motorists using services such as Fuel Watch can save approximately $200 per year on their fuel costs.

                                             So it appears to me that Western Australian motorists are happy with Fuelwatch… which is important… it is important because it proves the policy works-, therefore giving consumers the peace of mind and confidence that the playing field is level… like it should be.

                                             There has also been some discussion and debate especially from those on the other side of the Chamber about whether a Fuelwatch scheme will lower prices.

                                             It is important to reinforce that the purpose of the scheme is to level the playing field through dissemination of reliable information designed to encourage competition.

                                             That being said, the Western Australian example once again provides important hints as to Fuelwatch’s effectiveness in this area.

                                             The ACCC found that on average petrol prices in Western Australia were 1.9 cents lower following the introduction of Fuelwatch.

                                             Listening to the Assistant Treasurer explain how Fuelwatch will benefit motorists, he makes a sound case.

                                             The pricing spread—that is, the difference between the lowest and highest petrol price—can be around 20 cents a litre in the same areas of a city on the same day. For instance …

                                              In Perth this September, the average difference between the highest and the lowest price for unleaded petrol was 18.1 cents per litre.
                                             </li>

                                              Perth motorists, on a 60 litre tank, who used Fuelwatch, could therefore have saved on average up to $10.80.
                                             </li>
                                             <li>
                                              In Sydney, where there was an average pricing spread of 19.7 cents a litre—if we had a Fuelwatch scheme, motorists could have saved up to $11.40 for a 60-litre tank.
                                             </li>

                                             For the Liberals and the member for Wentworth who we know is out of touch this saving is no big deal. But to motorists in city areas an average saving of around $10 or $11 a tank is worth shopping around for.

                                              Fuelwatch in WA is really about transparency. It has never claimed to be an answer to the worldwide shortage in fuel that we are experiencing at present. It is really about letting consumers know about prices in the next 24 hours, and, if they choose, enabling them to make decisions about where they will purchase  their fuel.

                                              On average at the time of the hearing consumers were saving between 13c and 14c for most types of fuel in Perth.

                                              Interestingly data over the last six months in particular, as fuel prices have increased, the attention paid to Fuelwatch has significantly increased. People are increasingly using WA Fuelwatch as a source of information.

                                              Information was provided suggesting that Fuelwatch has not had a detrimental impact on pricing in WA relative to the eastern seaboard over several years. In the month of June evidence suggested that the average price for petrol was 3c cheaper than in Melbourne, 4.2c cheaper than in Brisbane without the subsidy 2.4c cheaper than in Sydney and 2.6c cheaper than in Adelaide.

If they were struggling before Fuelwatch came in and if Fuelwatch imposed unreasonable demands or costs on independents that made it difficult for them to survive, you would imagine that in the seven to eight years that Fuelwatch has been operating a significant number would have left the industry. There was no evidence presented that made us aware of that the proportion of independents in WA is any different or the rate of decline of independents post-Fuelwatch is any different from the rate of decline of independents pre-Fuelwatch.

That has not been our experience in WA. The sole operators or independents have increased in proportion in WA. Previously they were in the order of two per cent of the marketplace and are now six per cent of the marketplace. Independent chains have continued to be approximately 13 per cent of the retail marketplace. I think, importantly, it is also relevant to point out that the independent chains have continued to have extremely competitive prices, often the cheapest, and as a consequence have maintained their market position while also being very competitive in that field”.

I’ll throw that out.’ He then turns to Melbourne. He says, ‘Oh gosh, the relative price of petrol in Melbourne goes up compared to Perth around the time of Fuelwatch’s introduction. I will throw that out.’ He then turns to Sydney and he then says, `Ah, Sydney seems’, and to quote him, ‘more stable. There is a stable relationship.’ In other words, that is what he is looking for, and he then runs his tests on that.

                                              In addition to the evidence, which suggests that there is likely to be some modest price benefit to consumers most of them, but perhaps not all—the important thing about Fuelwatch, or some similar scheme, is that it promotes transparency in the market, gives consumers certainty, and reduces the search costs that they currently face in trying to work out where to find the cheapest petrol. Those costs include not just time; they also include money in the form of petrol driving to places that they did not want to be.

                                               The National Fuelwatch scheme will alleviate this intraday price movement, consumers can be safe with the knowledge that the price they see advertised at the petrol station in the morning is the price that they will be able to access at night on their way home from work.

                                               The scheme will help provide far greater transparency and competition in the petrol market. Real competition between petrol retailers can only be a good thing for many Australian consumers currently suffering under the weight of the global economic crisis.

                                               It is worth noting that on any given day there is roughly a 15 to 20 cent difference between the cheapest and most expensive petrol available to motorists in Australian capital cities.

                                               A difference of 20 cents per litre when filling up a 60 litre tank of petrol equates to a saving of $12, over time this becomes a significant amount of money, the Government’s petrol monitoring scheme will help consumers make these savings.
                                              </p>

                                               Because Fuelwatch will provide easy to access information so consumers can make the best possible decisions about where to purchase the cheapest petrol from.

The government’s policy objective in introducing a national Fuelwatch scheme is to address the existing imbalance in retail price transparency between retailers and consumers, along with reducing intraday pricing volatility.

The government considers Fuelwatch to be the only option that will address both the existing imbalance in retail fuel price transparency and consumer concerns about volatility in intraday prices.

                                                The bill addresses the existing imbalance in retail price transparency by introducing a requirement for petrol retailers to notify the ACCC of the standard retail price for each kind of motor fuel they offer for sale the next day, and for the information to then be made public. Fuelwatch allows consumers to ascertain the cheapest fuel price in their area, but it also provides consumers some certainty about buying fuel at the cheaper price. Consumers will be able to access daily price information on the ACCC’s website, or through other mechanisms to be determined by the ACCC, such as an email or

It is intended that initial coverage of the scheme will apply to all metropolitan and major rural and regional areas from commencement. These areas will be prescribed in the regulations. Further, to ensure that other regional and rural areas have the opportunity to participate in Fuelwatch, the bill enables the Minister for Resources and Energy to make further declarations to select other localities to be covered in the scheme.

                                                I want to now turn to some issues raised in the debate. Before I do, however, I want to make one fundamental point—and this is relatively unusual for any new initiative of any government—we actually do have an existing Fuelwatch scheme that has been tried and tested and has been found to have a positive impact. We actually have a working model, and it is over in Western Australia. I just want to make that point, because it is unusual in policy terms to have a working model already in existence to which we can turn to provide proof—in this case, supporting proof—of a national scheme which we intend to introduce. So, if the Senate will allow it to, Fuelwatch will deliver real outcomes for consumers. It will address information asymmetry in the petrol market and allow consumers, with certainty, to buy the cheapest fuel in their area. How, otherwise, does a consumer find out where the cheapest fuel is available? How do they do it, short of driving around suburbia and inspecting petrol stations to see where they can get the cheapest fuel, or having some sort of informal price contact system, such as ringing a neighbour who lives opposite a petrol station? Practically speaking, it is very, very difficult. Then, of course, you do need certainty, having been informed that this particular petrol station has cheaper fuel than another station, that you can purchase that fuel at the price that is advertised. This is fundamentally what Fuelwatch is doing for Australian consumers. It addresses the information asymmetry in the petrol market and allows consumers, with certainty, to buy the cheapest fuel in their area. And that has to be an improvement on the current circumstances that face consumers in this particular market. As I have said, Fuelwatch is working well in WA. There is clear evidence the scheme has reduced price margins in WA relative to those in eastern states. There is no evidence to suggest, as has the Liberal opposition, that such a scheme will increase prices.

                                                Senator Joyce went further—and this is a very unfortunate trend that is being established by some members of the Liberal-National Party opposition—and got into personal abuse and false claims about the motivations of individuals in the bureaucracy. Senator Joyce asserted that the former petrol commissioner,

Mr Walker is a big supporter of the scheme because he has seen how well it works in Western Australia, and he has experienced the real benefits of the scheme. Let me share with you a few quotations from consumers in Western Australia. Mr Jacob, in Darlington, WA, says:

                                                So we have numerous people in WA who have identified it as a benefit to consumers in WA. And interestingly, the Liberal Party in WA supports Fuelwatch.

                                                With Fuelwatch we want, in essence, to make shopping for petrol no longer a guessing game. We want to remove some of the uncertainties that I referred to earlier. If we take yesterday morning in Perth, for example, the pricing spread—that is, the difference between the lowest and highest petrol price—was 21c per litre on a 60-litre tank of petrol. That would represent a saving of $12.60 on the tank if it were replicated in eastern Australia. The option is not available to motorists outside WA. Let’s be clear: the biggest supporters of Fuelwatch are the consumers themselves. The consumers are empowered. They make the decisions. That is what the purpose of Fuelwatch is. The biggest opponents of Fuelwatch are big oil, vested interests and the Liberal and National parties—at least, at a federal level.

                                                    In our view, the opposition are being typically negative. They have a go at anything positive that this government will do, in a whole range of areas. When we put forward something that not only is positive for consumers but will benefit consumers, and where there is a good working example in Western Australia, the Liberal opposition, in typically negative fashion, oppose it for no good reason. So the only place that motorists will receive the benefits of Fuelwatch, if this bill is voted down, is WA, under a Liberal government. There is great irony in that.

It is going to be a sad day for consumers in Australia. We have advanced the arguments for Fuelwatch and its positives: the consumer power, the downward pressure on fuel prices, the advantages to consumers. We have a good, longstanding working example in Western Australia, supported by both the Labor Party and the Liberals—

They come from WA and their state political colleagues are supporting and will maintain support for Fuelwatch, but they come across the Nullarbor, get rolled by the Liberal Party over here—squashed by the Liberal Party and the National Party—and will vote against what their state colleagues in WA have done and have promised to maintain. What hypocrisy! What a negative, carping approach to a positive program to assist consumers in Australia!
