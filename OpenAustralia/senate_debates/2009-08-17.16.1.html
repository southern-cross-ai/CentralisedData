The same principle ought to apply in this chamber.

                   On the issue of compulsory acquisition, which was also part of the question, the senator would be aware that the government has made it clear that it is not minded to proceed down the path of compulsory acquisition. We have said we will purchase water from willing sellers. We believe that compulsory acquisition has associated with it a range of difficulties. The view that the government has consistently taken has been that we will take a different approach: we will take the approach of purchasing from willing sellers.

                      , I was asked directly about whether legal advice had been sought in relation to compulsory acquisition. I am responding in relation to the government’s policy on compulsory acquisition, which I would have thought was relevant. In relation to this, or any other purchase, the government is open to talking with any willing sellers of water entitlements in the basin. We have made that clear. We will assess any sell offer through our buyback program on the basis of value for money and environmental need. This is consistently the position—

In respect of the nub of the issue, the minister is being directly relevant to the question that was asked by Senator Hanson-Young. It related to the compulsory acquisition of water. The senator is being directly relevant and is answering the question. What we are now ending up with is the difficult position of people raising points of order and debating the point itself. If it is the policy issue which is being—

                           On the point of order: at the beginning of her answer to the first question, the minister asserted, quite wrongly, that she was not obliged to respond by saying whether or not legal advice had been sought. That assertion was quite wrong but, nevertheless, concededly it did directly answer the question. Everything else must be irrelevant—that refusal to answer the question having been given unambiguously.

                                 On the point of order: Senator Hanson-Young set a new record. She got up to raise a point of order within three seconds. So congratulations, Senator Hanson-Young, that is a new record; I think six was the record before that. There is no point of order. Senator Wong is entitled to answer the question in the way she chooses. Quite frankly, I do not know if people have run out of questions but this abuse of question time is ridiculous. Taking points of order within six seconds or three seconds of someone getting to their feet clearly is inappropriate and I think if people are serious about getting value out of question time they ought to allow the minister to at least have a go at answering the question before they take a point of order.

Directly relevant on this question does not mean talking about government policy; it means stating whether you have or have not got a legal opinion.

                                                I again make the point that the commitment we have made is that we will purchase water from willing sellers. We have had dialog with agricultural representatives and irrigator representatives and we have made it clear that compulsory acquisition is not the path we are going. There are those in this place who may have a different view. I accept that that is their view. Also, there are those in this place who would be vehemently opposed to compulsory acquisition. That is a different issue.

                                                   , but I am not quite sure what Senator Hanson-Young is getting at. There is a government approach of $12.9 billion, which includes some $3.1 million for purchasing water. We have made it clear that the process by which that is undertaken is to purchase from willing sellers. We have had a number of tender rounds in both the northern and southern basins, and the results of those have been made public on the website and have been announced by government. It has been done transparently.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   Again in relation to compulsory acquisition, that is a view that has been put to us previously. I think I have answered questions in this place previously about that and we have said that it is not the approach we are taking. We will purchase from willing sellers and we will assess on the basis of value for money and environmental need.
