        As an Australian observer to the 32nd General Assembly of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, it was a privilege to witness the goodwill between the countries involved in ASEAN and to see that they are committed to advancing their economies. While the powerhouse of China looms large over its neighbouring nations, it became clear that the 10—as it was, and now 11 with Myanmar—have the potential themselves to become an influential economic force. They have a population of some 600 million, there are some already powerful economies within the association and they are all going down the road to economic prosperity. Free trade agreements between the member nations have already given them a competitive edge as a production base in the world market and helped to attract more foreign investment.

        It was very pleasing to see that Australia is regarded very much as a respected friend whose aid over the years has been much appreciated. Australia was the first non-South-

        country to become an associate of ASEAN. This was noted as an indication of the sincerity of our support for the group. A highlight of the meeting I attended was the admission of Myanmar to full membership. The dialogue which occurred between the Australian delegation and the other delegations was very interesting and wide ranging and again showed how well regarded Australia is within the area. Cambodia of course has come out of a very unhappy past. I did see some evidence of that at S21, the school where the

        murdered so many people. The Cambodians are seeking to move on, and I think they have a very good prospect of having a bright and rosy future. They are certainly great friends of Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
