        the need for global collaboration on climate change and the importance of developed countries ratifying Kyoto. He also said the failure to include the effects of greenhouse emissions on climate was ‘the greatest market failure the world has ever seen’. He said the cost of not addressing climate change by emissions trading, seriously funding research and development in renewable energy and addressing energy waste could be up to 20 times greater than the cost of fixing the problem. With Australia set to exceed our Kyoto target in 2012, isn’t your government engaging in very risky economics?

             , I think you are quite right: the best treatment for Senator Brown is to ignore him; that is what he deserves. The economic management of this country has been second to none and I think that has generally been recognised.
            </p>
            <p>
             In relation to the greenhouse situation, as I was able to indicate to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_George_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
              Senator George Campbell
             </a>
             in a previous answer, 10 years ago we got started on this with the establishment of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greenhouse_Office" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Greenhouse Office
             </a>
             . In more recent times, Sir
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Stern" rel="nofollow">
              Nicholas Stern
             </a>
             also said: ‘So what we should be looking for is all countries getting involved and thinking through how we go’—listen to this—‘beyond Kyoto.’ The problem is the Democrats, the Greens and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Labor Party
             </a>
             are still stuck on Kyoto. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Nicholas_Stern" rel="nofollow">
              Sir Nicholas Stern
             </a>
             s of this world, and everybody else who is genuinely engaged in this issue, are saying, ‘Get beyond Kyoto, we’ve got to move on.’ There were genuine problems now recognised by people like Sir Nicholas Stern, because, if Kyoto were the answer, why would he want us to move beyond Kyoto? There would be no need to.
            </p>
            <p>
             The reason we need to move beyond Kyoto is very simple—that is, it did not engage China, India and other major greenhouse emitters. Therefore, we as a government said quite honestly and quite appropriately, ‘There is no sense in us signing up to targets if that makes no difference’. However, and this is a very important issue, what galls me is that there are certain governments running around at the moment alleging somehow that they have some moral superiority because they have signed up to Kyoto whilst failing absolutely in meeting the targets to which they signed up. Whereas we, I believe, have a greater degree of moral superiority in this debate, given that we have not signed up to Kyoto but will be one of the handful of countries that will actually meet or go very close to meeting the Kyoto targets.

                , I ask a supplementary question. I think the moral superiority the minister is talking about is a figment of his own imagination. Does the minister accept the economic modelling that shows that the introduction of a one per cent energy efficiency target would result in an almost 20 per cent reduction in wholesale electricity costs and that it is the lowest cost-effective greenhouse abatement measure? Why isn’t the government moving towards an immediate introduction of an energy efficient target? Why is the Prime Minister still talking today, as I understand it, about job losses when Stern shows that you can have growth and more jobs and still make major emissions cuts?

                  Nicholas Stern
                 </a>
                 said in November last year: ‘What we should be looking for is all countries.’ And that is what Australia is working towards. Sure, we can do economic modelling using all sorts of means and come up with interesting figures. But at the end of the day—and I think the vast majority of Australians accept and understand this—unless every country is involved and engaged in this issue it may well be worthless. That is why we have to move beyond Kyoto—something that even
