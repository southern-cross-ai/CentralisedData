         ELJA (â€”) (): Thank you, and I can. Our region's health, prosperity and security is absolutely vital to Australia's and we have been working closely with our partners across the Pacific to address our shared challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
         In response to the pandemic, Australia is investing more than $1 billion above and beyond our ongoing development support in our region. Despite some of the messages from those opposite, particularly the Greens, we have already shared over 9.2 million doses across the Indo-Pacific as part of our commitment to deliver 60 million doses to our neighbours by the end of 2022. In addition, Australia is investing $130 million in the COVAX Facility, which has distributed over 100 million doses to South-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_and_the_Pacific" rel="nofollow">
          East Asia and the Pacific
         </a>
         , and more than 400 million doses globally. Vaccination means more than just doses and Australia has allocated $623 million to get vaccine doses in arms, including vaccine procurement, distribution, administration, training and planning.
        </p>
        <p>
         Beyond the health impacts, this pandemic has also posed serious economic challenges across our region. In 2020-21, Australia provided $361 million in direct financing to support economic growth and social protection in our region. This investment has helped governments in our region to expand social protection schemes to support more than 150 million people. Australia is also extending loans worth more than $2 billion to Indonesia and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG
         </a>
         to help address their economic needs. That's because the economic resilience of these two great democracies is absolutely vital to Australia and to the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout the pandemic Australia has continued to invest in quality infrastructure through a lending pipeline of more than $1 billion. Already, we have finalised deals to finance renewable energy in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         , an undersea telecommunications cable in Palau and upgrades and maintenance at Fiji's airports. And, finally: through our Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme, almost 19,000 workers from the Pacific and Timor-Leste are in Australia, helping us to meet critical workforce shortages.

            In my recent visit to Fiji I saw firsthand the impressive Blackrock Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Camp that Australia is helping Fiji to redevelop. Blackrock will provide a regional hub for peacekeeper training and will bolster Fiji's capacity to respond to humanitarian crises and natural disasters. Our Defence Cooperation Program with 12 countries across our region, as well as our $2 billion-dollar Pacific Maritime Security Program, is supporting the national security priorities of our Pacific family. This combination of defence cooperation and economic development is helping to maintain security and stability across our region.

               While I was in Fiji, I was delighted to launch a new partnership between Australia and TourismFiji to help Fijian tourism safely welcome back international visitors. This certification scheme will be delivered by Aspen Medical, a great Canberra company.

               , and Australian tourists contributing over $50 million a month pre pandemic, this is a critical sector for Fiji. Yesterday, Fiji celebrated its reopening to international touristsâ€”another important milestone in its economic recovery. It was made possible due to Fiji's world-class rollout, using Australian vaccines.

              <p>
               Another key Pacific export is kava, and yesterday I was very pleased to announce phase 2 of the Morrison government's kava pilot program. Pacific kava farmers and producers will now have direct access to the Australian market. Kava has enormous potential and enormous cultural and economic importance for the Pacific. The excitement across the Pacific and here in Australia is palpable. The Morrison government is proud to be supporting business-led economic growth across our region.
