        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, in her capacity as representing the Treasurer. I refer the minister to the government’s dismissive response last Thursday to an order of the Senate which ordered the production of any advice about the requirement that changes to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        had to be agreed to unanimously by all parties to those arrangements. Isn’t it the case that the requirement for unanimous agreement is explicit in both the original 1999 GST deal and the 2008 replacement agreement negotiated with all states and territories by this government?

         I thank the senator for the question. I do recall writing to the Senate on behalf of the Treasurer in relation to this issue and setting out what I thought at the time was quite a substantive answer. I know you asked, in particular, for details of legal advice. I think the Treasurer, through me, indicated why that was problematic but gave a response in relation to the substantive issue. I have to say that I think you are asking me to give you precisely what the Treasurer indicated was not possible: legal advice in relation to the agreement. I do not have the letter which was presented to the Senate to hand, but I would refer you to that letter and if there is any further information in relation to the question I will come back to you.

           I am not in a position to agree with every aspect of that question. I have responded on behalf of the Treasurer to the issue you raised in the letter that I have described. In relation to the incoming government briefs—and, from memory, we have traversed quite a bit of this in estimates with both Treasury and Finance—the departments released the incoming government briefs in quite a transparent and accountable way. There were a range of issues in them which comprised advice to government, briefs to government, but not necessarily government decisions. These briefs were not released under your government.

            revenue away from the states and territories before any of them have signed on the dotted line to hand over any of their GST revenue?

             Now I understand the issue more clearly: this is about Senator Cormann trying to explain why the opposition are yet again determined to wreck a critical reform for the country’s future. The reality is that health costs in this country are continuing to rise. The current estimates are that, by around 2045, health costs for each of the states will exceed their own source revenue. This is a critical issue for the nation’s future and you have no answer other than to wreck. On health reform—and the Minister Representing the Minister for
