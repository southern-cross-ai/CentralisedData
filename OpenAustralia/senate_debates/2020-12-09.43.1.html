        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. A fire has been burning on the

        since 14 October—that's eight weeks—destroying some 80,000 hectares, or 60 per cent of the island, and killing the wildlife that call it home. What has the Prime Minister done to provide support to help save this precious forest, its biodiversity and the animals that live there? Or is it the case that he doesn't hold a hose, so it doesn't matter to him?

          to that degree across the table, I think it's a bit much to expect a minister to not respond in a disorderly way to a disorderly interjection, but there were lots of interjections across the table.

            fire, the government has declared a category B emergency. That results in various assistance being available for states and territories under the agreed formulation of assistance and work in conjunction with states and territories. I gather the Queensland officials have also identified the difficulties in relation to that fire. The particular difficulties are accessing the difficult terrain and the limitations that they have. Of course, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist, work and cooperate with the Queensland government where we have the resources or ability to do so. It's why the action has been taken in making the declaration already, and we will respond to any further requests that come from the Queensland government as swiftly as we can.

               What we have done in relation to climate change is, as a country—businesses, farmers, Australians—lead the world in many areas in terms of emissions reductions. That's what we've done and what we continue to do. As a country, we have delivered a 13 per cent reduction in our emissions between 2005 and 2018, compared with an eight per cent reduction in Japan or a one per cent in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
                New Zealand
               </a>
               or a 10 per cent reduction in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
                US
               </a>
               . We've led in all of those cases.
              </p>
              <p>
               As a people, as a per capita contribution, it's by far and away much greater than that. Our reductions over that period of time equate to 29 per cent on a per capita basis. That exceeds Germany at 16 per cent, Japan at seven per cent and Canada at 13 per cent. So, as a people, Australians have made contributions in reducing emissions far, far greater than the rest of the world, and in doing so have met and exceeded our commitments.
