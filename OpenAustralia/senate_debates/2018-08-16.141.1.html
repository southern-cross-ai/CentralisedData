        My question is to the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Senator Cash. Earlier today the minister said in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police

        investigation: 'You would also know that I am not being interviewed. I have not been under investigation, nor my office.' Can the minister now confirm to the Senate that she has not been interviewed by the Australian Federal Police?

          That's right—they are not interested. Senator Cameron, I have confirmed time and time again that this is not an investigation into me or my office, no matter how many times you try to say that it is. I have also stated that, as you know, the

            , this is a serious question. The point of order is direct relevance. The minister has been asked to confirm an out-of-chamber statement that she has not been interviewed. We're asking her to confirm it here in the chamber.

              . Senator Cash could not have been more directly relevant to the question that was asked. As the President often advises and confirms for the chamber, the opposition can ask questions. As long as the minister is directly relevant to the question, which she was, you are not able to direct the minister on how to answer the question.

               Quite right. I will rule on the point of order. I cannot instruct a minister how to answer a question as long as they're being directly relevant to the question. I believe, in this case, the minister is being directly relevant to the question.

                As I've stated, it's 12 months now, almost to the day—in fact, it's slightly longer—since the issue first arose of whether or not the Leader of the Opposition, when he was the head of the

                 AWU

                , actually had the appropriate authorisations in relation to a $100,000 donation to

                 GetUp

                ! and a $25,000 donation to the campaign. I would have thought those on the other side, who say they stand up for workers, would have wanted to know that the workers' money was being expended appropriately.

This is a question about legal indemnity for ministers of the Crown, as has been available to ministers of the Labor government and as is available to ministers on both sides of government.

                              , we would accept, as is my recollection, that the money and the decision may well come from the Attorney-General's Department, but I would have thought that the question of whether or not her legal advice is being paid for would be something Senator Cash might know, and that it clearly relates to matters about which she's being questioned.

                               Ministers can be questioned on statements they have made. I'm obviously not familiar with every statement the minister has made, but the minister is free to answer the question to the extent of that. The point that Senator Cormann has made is relevant, but ministers can also be questioned on statements they've made. So, to that extent, I'll invite the minister to answer that part of the question she is able or willing to provide information about within her responsibilities and public statements.

                                . I've stated before that it is common practice for legal assistance to be provided to ministers when it relates to proceedings involving their ministerial duties. Senator Wong received legal assistance via the Australian government—this is not an unusual procedure—as did

                                      My point on this is that, as I interrupted the senator there, I heard Senator Cash directly addressing part of the question. That was directly relevant. Senator Cash, have you concluded your answer or do you wish to continue?

                                       , these questions have been answered in detail at estimates. I'm going through the normal process. I'll take on notice and refer to the Attorney-General's Department any further questions.
