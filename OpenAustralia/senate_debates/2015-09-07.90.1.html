        BANKING LAWS AMENDMENT (UNCLAIMED MONEYS) BILL
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill will improve the unclaimed moneys provisions in a number of ways by:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        extending the required period of inactivity before accounts are transferred to the Government to seven years;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        exempting children's accounts and foreign currency accounts;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        removing a legislative inconsistency that can result in active accounts being transferred to ASIC; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        introducing additional privacy protections (such as ceasing publication of the unclaimed moneys gazette) to help prevent Australian's with unclaimed accounts from being taken advantage of.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes are due to commence on 31 December 2015. It is important to give industry certainty about the announced changes as soon as possible and provide them with sufficient time to adjust systems and processes prior to commencement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, there are large regulatory savings for industry and individuals associated with this bill; however a delay in the introduction of legislation could increase implementation costs as changes to systems and processes would have to be completed faster than initially expected. This could potentially erode the regulatory savings associated with this measure substantially.

        BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIMARY TELEVISION BROADCASTING SERVICE) BILL
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will implement a reform arising from the review of the digital television regulatory framework, providing flexibility for free-to-air broadcasters to deliver programming on their primary television services in either high definition (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD" rel="nofollow">
         HD
        </a>
        ) or standard definition (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SD" rel="nofollow">
         SD
        </a>
        ) formats.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures in the bill would remove provisions preventing commercial free-to-air television broadcasters and national broadcasters from offering coverage of major sporting events such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        grand finals in HD on their primary services. While removing these events from the anti-siphoning list would enable them to be broadcast on a HD multichannel, broadcasters prefer to show these events on their primary service because this service typically attracts significantly larger audiences than their multichannels.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passage" rel="nofollow">
         Passage
        </a>
        of the bill in the 2015 Spring sittings would allow but not require commercial free-to-air broadcasters to televise the 2015 AFL and NRL grand finals on 3 and 4 October, respectively, on their primary services in HD.
