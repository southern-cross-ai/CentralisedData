        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. Has the government modelled the impact of the decision to increase immigration by 715,000 people over the next two years on rental markets in Australia's capital cities?

         When I find the brief I was looking at before in relation to migration, I will respond directly on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOM" rel="nofollow">
          NOM
         </a>
         that he identifies. But, if I may, I'll go to the rental point. It is odd to get a question about housing in a week where the coalition and the Greens are going to work together to prevent investment in housing supply. Because if Senator Smith were concerned, as his question suggests he is, about rental affordability—he is somebody who I think understands basic supply and demand—he would understand that, if you increase supply, you put downward pressure on prices. So if one cares about rental affordability, how do you square that away, Senator Smith, with your opposition to more investment in the very capital investment that you say matters?
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality is that we have a higher net overseas migration forecast in 2022-23 to reflect a one-off catch-up from the pandemic and the return of international students. I know those opposite recognise the importance of that export service to our economy and to the financial and broader position of our educational institutions. So I would have been surprised—in fact, I have been surprised—at Mr Dutton's position, which seems to suggest we don't want international students to return, which is, of course, an expert earner for Australia, but at the same time is opposing the Housing Australia Future Fund.

            Reserve Bank

           of Australia in this month's statement on monetary policy that 'a shortfall in housing supply relative to strong demand from a rising population is expected to result in continued upward pressure on rents, adding to the inflation forecast'?

            I suppose the response to that might simply be: How do you reconcile your opposition to more investment in housing with the statement that you've just read out? It is utterly inconsistent. But because Senator Smith and I have served here a long time together, I will take the less political aspect of his question—oh, sorry; now you're going to be in trouble, aren't you, now I have said that?—which goes to the inflation point. It is an important balancing act that the government has had to take through the budget as we look at how you invest in support for the cost of living, given the cost-of-living pressures that Australians are facing, without adding to inflation.

                   It's quite disappointing that those opposite, who understand the backlog in terms of net overseas migration caused by the pandemic, are going down this path. It is the case that we are seeing the return of international students. It's an important sector. I remind the Senate that the population is still forecast to be cumulatively lower than pre-pandemic forecasts by June 2023, and 215,000 persons lower in June 2024. In fact, while the net overseas migration figure is higher, the population forecast is lower than was forecast previously. Obviously we understand the importance of making sure we have a sensible debate on migration—we've seen where this has gone at other times in this country. I urge those opposite to recognise that investment in housing is one of the ways we ensure that we assist in the battle against the rising cost of living that global inflation and supply chains constraints have raised—
