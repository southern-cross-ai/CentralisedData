        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, Senator Farrell. The Albanese government understands safe and affordable housing is essential to the security and dignity of all Australians who deserve the stability that having a safe, affordable place to call home provides. These are real people facing the extraordinary stress of not having a safe roof over their heads. Can the minister explain how the Albanese government is addressing housing challenges for Australians through its ambitious housing reform agenda and specifically what that means for people who don't yet own a home? How do these actions respond to the challenges left by the previous government?

         thank Senator Bilyk for her very insightful question, and I have some answers to those issues that you have raised. A decade of inaction by the former Liberal-National government left us with significant housing challenges right across the country, but the Albanese government has hit the ground running on housing, delivering immediate action along with an ambitious reform agenda. That is why the budget delivered new action to help Australian renters, expand opportunities for homeownership and bolster frontline homelessness services.
        </p>
        <p>
         The budget will help more Australians into home ownership through a significant expansion of eligibility criteria for the Home Guarantee Scheme. Under these changes, friends, siblings and other family members will be eligible for joint applications under the First Home Guarantee and the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee. These guarantees will also be expanded for non-first homebuyers who haven't owned a property in Australia in the last 10 years.

             Thank you for that protection. The Housing Accord—thousands were helped into home ownership by the Regional First Homebuyer. And, of course, our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund is to deliver 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes in the fund's first five years. This fund has supported our national peak housing bodies as well as every state and territory housing minister, because who could possibly stand in this place and vote against more social and affordable rental homes?

               Thank you for that eloquent answer, Minister. The Albanese government recognises that rental affordability challenges are putting significant pressure on Australians who need a safe, affordable and secure place to call home. Can the minister outline the alternative interventions proposed to affect the rental market? What has been the expert opinion on these proposals and their impact on people who rent a home?

                 No! Listen to this: 'and ended up with poorer quality housing'. It's something the federal government cannot force upon the states, it's something many states have already ruled out and it's something the expert advice says won't work.

                 need to decide which is more important—their campaigning or the people who need homes, because the way to help people in housing stress is to vote for the Housing Australia Future Fund and use social and affordable rentals. It would help. The delays have to stop. Australians in need can't afford it anymore.

                   Thank you for explaining that to those that need to know. Can the minister respond to the alternative interventions proposed to affect the rental market? How is the Albanese Labor government taking action to support Australians who rent their home? How is the Albanese Labor government working with states and territories to support renters?

                    Thank you for your second question. The long-term answer to rental stress is a sustained boost to the supply of homes to rent and a substantial investment in new social and affordable houses. That is exactly what the Albanese government is doing. The national Housing and Homelessness Ministerial Council has been tasked with developing a proposal to National Cabinet on options to strengthen renters' rights. The Albanese government is delivering the first substantial increase in Commonwealth Rent Assistance in over 30 years. We're also improving taxation arrangements for investment in build-to-rent homes, and, if the Greens would just get out of the way, the Housing Australia Future Fund will be the largest boost to social and affordable rental homes in a decade.
