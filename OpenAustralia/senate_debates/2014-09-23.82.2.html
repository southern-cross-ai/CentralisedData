        Pursuant to standing order 78(1), I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, I shall withdraw business of the Senate notices of motion Nos 1 to 3 standing in my name for the next day of sitting, proposing the disallowance of the following regulations relating to hard onions, mangoes and mushrooms: (1) Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2014, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2014 No. 54 and made under the Primary Industries (Customs) Charges Act 1999; (2) the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Amendment (2014 Measures No. 1) Regulation 2014, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2014 No. 55 and made under the Primary Industries (Excise) Levies Act 1999; and (3) the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment (Mushrooms) Regulation 2014, as contained in Select Legislative Instrument 2014 No. 56 and made under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to make a short explanatory statement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I gave notice of an intention to move a disallowance motion regarding the government's proposed increase in levies for onions, mangoes and mushrooms because such tax deserves scrutiny, support from the majority of levy payers in each of these industries was missing and the levy system is in need of reform. Following this, the government has agreed to the Senate inquiring into the structures and systems governing the imposition of and disbursement of marketing and research and development, R&amp;D levies, in the agricultural sector, with particular reference to the opportunities levy payers have to approve and reapprove the imposition of levies. Subject to the government acting on the results of this inquiry in good faith, this should ensure that if the levies for onions, mangoes and mushrooms are not supported by the majority of levy payers they will not continue. Given this, I will withdraw the notices. I will continue to scrutinise proposals to increase agricultural levies and welcome concerns from growers about any such proposals.
