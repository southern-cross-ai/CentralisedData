         The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

         </i>
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) As at 1 May 2011 DVA employed 2036 staff.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) As at 1 May 2011 35 staff identified themselves as having a disability.

        <p class="italic">
         The DVA Workplace Diversity and Action Plan 2011-2015 is aimed at promoting diversity and encouraging employment of under-represented groups. It reinforces the relevant legislative framework, identifies key responsibilities for the employer, managers and employees, articulates principles and actions concerning leadership and recruitment, and offers practical support in the form of reasonable adjustment to assist people with a disability in the workplace.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In addition, a work experience program for people with a disability is currently being trialled in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         and a position for a person with a disability has been identified in future graduate intakes. Complementing these measures, it has also recently been agreed that a separate Disability Employment Strategy be developed. DVA's Workforce Strategy 2010-2015 also commits DVA to "evaluating initiatives to attract and retain people from underrepresented groups" which echoes the Government's commitment in the Blueprint for the Reform of Australian Government Administration.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         DVA's supportive work environment which encourages retention of staff with a disability includes:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) A specific target for disability employment has not been adopted, except in relation to graduate recruitment (as outlined in response to question 5 above). As there is currently no
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">
          APS
         </a>
         -wide target for disability employment, DVA, like the majority of agencies, does not consider it appropriate to adopt an arbitrary target. If there is an APS-wide target adopted in the future, like for Indigenous employment, DVA would incorporate that target into its related policies and strategies. DVA is committed to increasing the numbers of, and support for, under-represented groups, including people with disabilities, as evidenced through the recent launch of the DVA Workplace Diversity and Action Plan 2011-2015, the commitment to develop a Disability Employment Strategy and other initiatives outlined above.
