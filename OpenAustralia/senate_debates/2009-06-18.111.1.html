        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Education, Senator Carr. I listened closely to Senator Feeney’s question to the minister, so I ask specifically: is the government aware that the Berwick Lodge Primary School in Melbourne was refused a $3 million six-classroom library complex under the school stimulus debacle and was then bullied to instead accept a gymnasium, even though the school already has a gymnasium, and was then finally offered a $2 million classroom multipurpose complex?

             . It is normal practice, I know, for newspapers these days to outsource work to others, but we have a situation here where the opposition and the member for Sturt are seeking to outsource their work to the

              Australian

                The reporting requirements have been made very, very clear, and in my previous answer I highlighted the detail of those reporting requirements. What each and state and territory is required to do is to ensure that they report on a monthly basis, that the program administration has been consistent with the guidelines and that there will not be tolerated any of the suggestions that you and others have been making, senator, about the administration of this program.

                    What this question demonstrates, yet again, is the failure of the opposition to understand what the impact of the global recession has been. This demonstrates, yet again, the failure of the opposition to understand how this program actually assists to build and refurbish facilities right across Australia. The opposition has failed to understand that this is a program that benefits 9½ thousand schools. It is a failure to understand that this is a program that benefits 3½ million Australian students, whether they are in primary or secondary schools. The opposition fails to understand that this is a program that benefits a quarter of a million teachers across the country. What this question demonstrates, yet again, is the failure of the opposition to understand the importance of education.
