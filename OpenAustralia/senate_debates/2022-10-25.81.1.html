        My question is for the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Last weekend Australia and Japan signed a joint security declaration. Can the minister advise the Senate on how the agreement will strengthen our relationship with Japan?

         I thank Senator Bilyk for her question and acknowledge her ongoing interest in foreign policy. I know she and others share the desire of mine and many others in this chamber to strengthen Australia's relationship in our region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Japan is a special friend of Australia. They are our special strategic partner, and we are natural partners. There are many aspects to our partnership. Obviously trade, investment, defence and security ties bind us, but we also have a deep affinity between our peoples and, importantly, shared values which go to democracy, the defence of human rights, free trade and a rules based international order. There is already a very strong relationship with Japan. I would, in a moment of bipartisanship, recognise that both sides of politics—governments of both political persuasions—over the years have invested in the Australia-Japan relationship, and I acknowledge the work of Senator Payne in the period that she was foreign minister in that regard.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is working to make that relationship stronger. It was my privilege, and my first overseas trip as foreign minister, to attend the Quad Leaders' Summit. In the first five months of the government, the Prime Minister has met Prime Minister Kishida four times and I have met the foreign minister, Mr Hayashi, four times, as well as many other ministerial engagements. Importantly, over the weekend, at the annual Australia-Japan Leaders' Meeting in Perth, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and the Prime Minister of Japan, Prime Minister Kishida, signed a renewed joint declaration on security cooperation. This is a declaration to chart a path for defence and security cooperation between Australia and Japan for the next decade.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our strategic environment is changing, and our partnership has to evolve.

            As I said, we all know that our strategic environment is changing rapidly; the circumstances that the nation faces are more challenging than at any time since World War

            </a>
            . In light of that we have to work together, and our partnership with Japan must evolve to meet the growing risks. And we have to work together to pursue our shared values and strategic interests. So the renewed declaration sets out how Australia and Japan will work together to deepen our strategic partnership as we pursue and help realise a common vision for a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific—a region that is inclusive and a region that is resilient.
           </p>
           <p>
            The declaration includes collaboration in areas such as climate change, health security, humanitarian assistance, energy transition, disaster response and maritime security. Importantly, leaders also announced that the Japan Self-

               Japan and Australia share a common goal: a region that is stable, that is prosperous and that is respectful of sovereignty, and a world in which differences and disputes are resolved by international law and norms, not simply by power and size. We also have an interest in nuclear nonproliferation. Japan's Prime Minister Kishida hails from Hiroshima and he has made clear his aim for pursuing denuclearisation. We share his ambition.

                 a very important part of the statement between Prime Minister Kishida and Prime Minister Albanese, which was the condemnation of Russia's threat to use nuclear weapons against Ukraine. It is serious, it is unacceptable and it is an unacceptable menace to the peace and security of the international community. It is important today that I repeat that condemnation here in the Senate chamber. Any use of nuclear weapons will be met with a resolute and unequivocal response.
