        The gig economy is both responding to and shaping our changing world. But, as the economy changes around us, too many workers are being left behind. Indeed, some of the global businesses benefiting most from this change have some of the worst industrial conditions of all, and some aren't just profiting from insecure work; they are actively championing it. Convenience for consumers matters, but not at any cost.

        Last Friday was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Friday" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , a huge day of spending for consumers around the world. But it was also Make Amazon Pay Day, where workers, unions and activists across our world stood together in the fight for justice and fairness within the gig economy. These workers, in partnerships with their unions like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Transport Workers Union
        </a>
        back here in Australia, are calling for an end to poor working conditions and low wages, especially for Amazon workers. Workers like Simadeep, a gig economy worker from Adelaide and a proud member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TWU" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , who recently took the time to share his story with me. Simadeep has worked in the gig economy for over a year because he wanted the flexibility the work might be able to offer him. He decided to try out Amazon Flex, attracted to their promises on working conditions, flexibility and pay. But, after just one shift, these promises have completely fallen apartâ€”and his story is not unique.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Americanisation of wages and working conditions in Australia cannot be allowed to continue. That's why I'm proud to stand alongside workers and their representatives in the SDA and the Transport Workers Union, who have been working tirelessly to protect all that workers and our union movement have fought for over generations. A secure job with a fair wage does not have to be a thing of the past for Australian workers. No degree of convenience is worth that sort of price.
