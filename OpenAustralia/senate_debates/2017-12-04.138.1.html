       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the theme of this year’s International Day of People with a Disability is ‘Transformation towards sustainable and resilient society for all’ – this reflects an ambition, grounded in the 2030 agenda for Sustainable Development Goals, to empower people with disabilities to be active contributors to society through increasing access to justice, infrastructure and accessible communities,

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) in developing countries, people with disabilities and their families are more likely to be poor and remain poor because of higher living costs, barriers to education, health and employment opportunities, and unpaid caring responsibilities,
