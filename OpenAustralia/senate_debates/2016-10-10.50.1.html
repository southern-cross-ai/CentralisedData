        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Today is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Mental_Health_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Mental Health Day
        </a>
        . Each year in Australia, one in five Australians experiences mental illness. Just recently, we learnt that the number of people taking their own lives is at a 10-year high. There is a growing concern in the mental health sector that the current changes to funding will unintentionally remove access to services for some consumers and carers. These changes are seeing some Commonwealth and state programs closing, and therefore people may miss out on access to services. Has the government done any analysis on the number of people who may lose access to services, and what steps are being taken to ensure that consumers and carers will not lose access to services?

         I thank the senator for her question, and acknowledge her very sincere interest in this issue. In relation to the specific analysis, I will take that on notice for the senator. But broadly, this government—like everybody, I believe, in this chamber—has an absolute commitment to ensuring we get the delivery of mental health services right. Indeed, that was why, after the review, the minister took the steps she did to change the policy settings that we had in place around delivery of support for mental health, from what had previously been, as I think many in this chamber would know, support directed from Canberra. What we have seen now is $371 million go out through the Primary Health Networks to ensure that we can address these issues of mental health from a regional perspective—so we can get away from the silo mentality, and move towards a much better targeted regional delivery of mental health care.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no doubt that we have seen an increase in the instances of mental illness. Some of the discussion around that is it is now something that is much more in the public awareness as an issue that is affecting many, many Australians. So I can certainly indicate to the senator, on behalf of the minister responsible, that this is something that the government will take very, very seriously and continue to take very seriously, and we will ensure we have policies in place to address those people that are in need.

           I thank the minister for her answer, but the minister did not specifically address the issue that I asked. I understand that she has taken it on notice, so I appreciate that. But, to be specific, there are a number of programs that are closing and will leave service gaps, because those programs are closing, because not everyone will get a package, for example, through the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           —if the minister could take that on notice, when she is providing the information. But, because of that, there is going to need to be an investment in further mental health services. Is the government going to provide further money?

            Could I perhaps start by indicating that there has been an expansion of funding to the sector. We have seen in June just this year $192 million over four years extra to strengthen mental health care in Australia. I think that is indicative, as I said earlier, of the seriousness with which this government addresses this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we have also seen now are 12 suicide prevention trial sites, comprising four of the Primary Health Network led sites, and an additional eight regional trial sites in identified priority areas. I do recognise that the senator has not directly asked about suicide. But I think, when we are talking about mental health, it is very important to acknowledge that the suicide rates in this country are something that have to be addressed, and that is why I have specifically noted the extra funding that is going to that issue.

              The minister has, in fact, pre-empted somewhat the question I was going to ask on suicide prevention. My question specifically is: is the government prepared to introduce suicide reduction targets?

               What the government is absolutely committed to doing is reducing the suicide rate. There is no doubt that to do that we have to be able to not only have the right policies in place but ensure the funding is there to support those policies, which indeed we have done. I acknowledge the work that the Minister for Health and Aged Care has done in this area over a considerable period of time now. This is not an issue that I think anybody wants to play politics with. This is something across this nation that we on all parts of this chamber are acutely aware of. So, we will continue—
