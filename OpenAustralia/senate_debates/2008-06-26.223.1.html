        I rise tonight to speak of someone named Mr Cleaver Elliott, who will be swapping jobs in the Senate and leaving his position as Clerk Assistant. That job title did not mean much to me before I got here and it probably does not mean much to most Australians, but I cannot speak highly enough of Cleaver Elliott. It did not matter what time of the day I phoned or what the request was, Cleaver was always willing to assist in drafting amendments that sometimes may have seemed like strange requests. Cleaver would always assist in that area. Before I got here there were reports about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Smith
        </a>
        going to Washington. Well, Mr Smith teamed up with Mr Elliott, and on a number of times we have gone to town on a few issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would really like to say to Cleaver: thank you. I am glad you are in the chamber tonight. I sincerely thank you. I do count you as a friend. We have had many funny moments, and I want to sincerely thank you for your professionalism. You have made me feel more than welcome in this place, but you have probably done that for everybody else as well. That is a credit to you and your professionalism. I cannot speak highly enough of you. You have really gone out of your way to serve Australia, this parliament and this Senate extremely well. I wish you the very best in your next role. Thank you.
