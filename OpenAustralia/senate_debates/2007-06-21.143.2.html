        The government does not propose to respond to this report. The recommendations of this report which was in 2000 have been overtaken by subsequent developments. In particular the provisions relating to personal privacy have been strengthened in the co-regulatory codes of practice for all media sectors, with each having a comprehensive complaints framework in place. In relation to enforcement, the passage of the government’s media reform package in 2006 included a range of new powers which have strengthened the broadcasting regulator’s capacity to effectively regulate the broadcasting industry and to ensure that industry sectors and individual organisations respond appropriately to complaints. The government also intends to introduce legislation in 2007 that will extend the regulatory regime governing content to new and emerging services and devices such as 3G mobile phones and on subscription-based internet portals.
