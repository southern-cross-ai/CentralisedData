        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Senator Wong. Late last year, Minister Plibersek justified granting nearly $10 million of taxpayers' money to the Environmental Defenders Office by saying it was to 'help poor little farmers and local groups saving threatened species'. Given the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDO" rel="nofollow">
         EDO
        </a>
        is now actively threatening, jeopardising and stopping a series of projects of critical importance to Australia, will Minister Wong not only admit that Ms Plibersek's excuses for the grant were wrong but also quantify how many jobs and how much investment in Australia has been lost because of the activities of this Albanese government funded organisation?

         First, I would first make the point—and I'm not sure which matters Senator Duniam is referring to—that, if decisions are made in relation to environmental legislation which have an effect on development, they are decisions made by a judicial authority. What he seems to be suggesting is that we should avoid having the law of the land apply, by making sure we don't fund people.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are times, I'm sure, where I may not, others may not and members of this Senate do not agree with actions the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDO" rel="nofollow">
          EDO
         </a>
         takes, but this is a body that provides legal advocacy. We do believe in the system of the rule of law. We do believe that individuals and entities have a right to be heard in our legal system, and this enables them to do that. I know those opposite want to shut down different voices. I know that's the approach you take. We all remember the gag clauses, don't we, that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
          NGO

           That was part of your question, but you also had quite a substantial lead-in to that question that went to the funding of the Environmental Defenders Office. I believe the minister is being relevant.

            That's an interesting interjection, because the point is: if there are decisions made in relation to development applications, they are made in accordance with the law. These are made in accordance with the law. So what are you saying, Senator? The point is that in our democracy we do have a system in which people can take action, pursuant to the law, even if we don't agree.

                EDO
               </a>
               in relation to the resources sector. But, unlike you, we don't feel the need to shut people down. Unlike you, we actually think that there is a legal system in place which ought protect the interests of all. If there are loopholes, as you assert, then they should be brought to the attention of the legislature and the executive.
              </p>
              <p>
               Essentially, your position is: 'We want to make sure that people with whom we don't agree don't have the capacity to take action.' We simply don't have the same view as you do about our judicial system and our legal system. My recollection is that those opposite put gag clauses into various
