       <p>
        Yesterday I raised in this Senate life and death matters regarding high-level official corruption, crime and misconduct in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        , which involved the deliberate targeting and harming of two veterans and their families by a number of high-ranking Defence officers and officials. Yesterday, retired Lieutenant Colonel Dubsky and retired commando Mick Bainbridge sat in the Senate as I detailed their stories and described the sneaky, malicious, vindictive and illegal behaviour of high-ranking Defence officers and others which caused so much harm to both veterans and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        I used a secret and damning New South Wales police report, as well as testimony from Lieutenant Colonel Dubsky and retired commando Mick Bainbridge, to build my argument for the establishment of a royal commission to properly investigate these matters, to bring the guilty to account and to deliver justice to the many victims. Many powerful and influential people would be witnesses before a royal commission should it be established, including the

        , former General Hurley; Australian of the Year and former Chief of Army David Morrison; senior police detectives from New South Wales and from other states; and prominent members of the Australian media, including Channel 7 television reporter
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Ovadia" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Ovadia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Ovadia's initial report into the so-called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedi_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Jedi Council
        </a>
        sex scandal was based on false information illegally leaked to him by unknown criminals in the Defence Force, causing significant harm to retired Lieutenant Colonel Dubsky and his family. In effect, Mr Ovadia initially produced an unbalanced, sensationalist and factually incorrect report after he was played for a fool by people in Defence who illegally leaked information about the Jedi Council and Karel Dubsky to him. He went on to correct the record in other award-winning reports, but the damage was already done. You will recall that Karel Dubsky has survived two suicide attempts and six months of electroshock therapy, takes 24 tablets a day and is fighting hard to make a new life for his family after being used as a scapegoat and a career stepping-stone by General David Morrison and, to some degree, journalist Robert Ovadia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, I referred to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        an email from journalist Robert Ovadia that one of my staff members received late last night. The unsolicited email contains a cryptic, ambiguous message that could be interpreted as a veiled threat. Its reads, 'Words spoken today will not be forgotten.' I will let the Federal Police assess whether or not it is a veiled threat from Mr Ovadia—but I am not playing games with the safety of my staff. The Lambie staff have all been subject to a number of threats to our physical safety that we immediately referred to the proper authorities. Nor will I allow anyone to improperly interfere with the free and fair performance of a member of this Senate. Yesterday, Mr Ovadia also sent a terse email to Mr Dubsky, a man in fragile mental state, after I used information from a secret
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police
        </a>
        report, Strike Force Civet—which found lies, cover-up and corruption in Australia's military—to support Mr Dubsky's claims he was unfairly targeted by high-ranking corrupt officers for appalling treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do not want my office to have any further communications with Mr Ovadia, except if he wants to tell me the names of the criminals in the ADF who illegally released the names of Karel Dubsky and other innocent victims of the Jedi Council scandal to him. If Mr Ovadia tells me the names of those criminals in the military, I will refer those people as well to authorities for a proper investigation. I will also use Mr Ovadia's information in this Senate in order to force this government to establish a proper, independent judicial investigation into the systemic corruption and crime that has infected the upper ranks of our Australian Defence Force. In relation to retired Lieutenant Colonel Dubsky and retired commando Mick Bainbridge, I ask once again that this government establish a special mediation process to hear and remedy the considerable harm and injustice suffered by both veterans and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        I turn to cuts to pensions. With Christmas just around the corner, it is time that this chamber consider the cuts to pensions that this government has guaranteed. As recent reports in the media, such as in
        <i>
         The New Daily
        </i>
        ,remind us:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government’s forewarning to pensioners to expect letters in the mail warning of pension cuts has triggered widespread concern.

       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Centrelink will send about one million letters in coming weeks to pensioners potentially affected now or in the future, the office of Human Services Minister Alan Tudge confirmed to
        <i>
         The New Daily
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In December, a second letter will be sent to about 313,500 (8 per cent) of pensioners telling them their part pension is about to be cancelled or cut. About 225,000 will be told to expect less money, and about 88,500 to expect cancellation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's politicians and political parties have forgotten that the age pension is not welfare—it is a right and reward for working hard and paying taxes for 40-odd years!
       </p>
       <p>
        I will now address the issue of euthanasia. Euthanasia for the terminally ill has been debated for decades, with no real progress. Only last week,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        voted down the 15th dying with dignity legislation in 10 years. And the Tasmanian state opposition announced they would try again next year. Victoria is currently considering whether to put up legislation. I have been told that around 70 per cent of Australians support euthanasia for the terminally ill, which raises the question as to why it has yet to be legalised in any Australian state. A plebiscite to determine that the majority do support euthanasia for the terminally ill would provide state governments the confidence they need to move forward with legalising this sensitive issue. This plebiscite will not be an additional burden to the taxpayer, as it would be held in conjunction with a plebiscite on same-sex marriage and a referendum on Indigenous recognition at the next federal election. The current environment is ripe for a renewed debate as to whether Australia should follow in the footsteps of the Netherlands, Canada, Germany, Japan and some states in the

       </p>
       <p>
        I presume you have heard the pro-euthanasia argument that you would not let your dog suffer, so why would we allow our loved ones to suffer? For decades the response to this has been one of fear—fear of a slippery slope if euthanasia for the terminally ill is legalised. But I am here to tell you that we have evidence to refute the arguments brought by the 'no' camp. Producer and comedian

        , and the Dean of the Law Faculty of the University of Tasmania, Margaret Otlowski, who completed her PhD on this topic, have spoken to me regarding the details of euthanasia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Turning to another matter, I have received a very concerning brief from the Australian Federal Police which shows this government is cutting back on resourcing, funding and staffing of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        by $112 million, despite our nation being on high terrorist alert. While the government has grandly announced an additional $1.2 billion of counterterrorism funding for keeping Australia safe and secure, none of the money is finding its way to the Australian Federal Police. The brief reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 2015-16 Budget Papers indicate the AFP's fiscal position through the forward estimates will deteriorate to the tune of $112 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As an operational agency, the brunt of this deterioration will be borne within employee ranks, with funds available for employee benefits reducing by $61 million. By straight division, this represents a reduction of 450 staff, though the actual number will be higher. Of an organisation numbering 6500, this reduction is approaching ten percent of total personnel.
