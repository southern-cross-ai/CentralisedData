         I thank Senator Ruston for her question. I think the most important thing to emphasise about the government's higher education package is the way—in fact, several ways—in which it will make higher education more accessible. For example, by 2018, over 80,000 students will be receiving Commonwealth support for the first time in higher education diploma and similar courses, and in whatever registered higher education institution they choose to study. Many of those students will be coming from low-socioeconomic backgrounds. Each year, another 80,000 students will benefit, on average by $1,600 a year, from the abolition of the 20 per cent loan fee on

         loans. As well as that, another 50,000 students will benefit from the abolition of the 25 per cent loan on FEE-HELP itself.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then there is the Commonwealth scholarship scheme. It will be the largest scholarship scheme in Australia's history. It will provide support, including with living costs, for many students from disadvantaged backgrounds around Australia. These are reforms that promote accessibility for students. They will also ensure that Australian students have access to high-quality education in this country. As Belinda Robinson, who is the

         It is simply not possible to maintain the standards that students expect or the international reputation that Australia's university system enjoys without full fee deregulation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The higher education reforms that Senator Ruston asks about will give Australian students access to high-quality education and it will be affordable.

           That is actually a very interesting question from Senator Ruston. While we have been working very hard to promote access to high-quality higher education for tens of thousands more students, the Labor Party, the Greens and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTEU" rel="nofollow">
            NTEU

           are continuing to try to run their pathetic scare campaign. Do you ever hear them remind anyone that no-one needs to pay a cent upfront? No. Do you ever hear them seriously discuss the need for reform of the higher education industry in Australia? No. What they do is they roll out absurdly inflated fee levels as part of their scare campaign. But the facts put the lie to that.
