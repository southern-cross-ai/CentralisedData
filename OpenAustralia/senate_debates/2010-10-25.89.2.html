        Let’s put this in layman’s terms. Everybody is always very happy to buy a washing machine with a number of stars on it. The number of stars basically represents how efficient that washing machine is. You would presume that if it has been given the accreditation of star markings—that is what I believe they are called—it is all right for a plumber to install it. However, that is not the case. A water efficiency labelling scheme also has to be applied. Because the star marking scheme did not comply with the water efficiency labelling scheme, we had a bit of an anomaly, and the process of the

        was to remove that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The whole rating scheme, as Australians well know, is to make sure that when you buy something you have a capacity to determine which things are more efficient than others. It is a very good scheme. My wife uses it and manages to buy the most expensive washing machines—because, apparently, they have more stars than the others. I, on the other hand, do not really care that much. I would prefer to pay less money, but that is another story. The issue is that, with the passage of this legislation, we have the capacity to make sure that the stars match up with the efficiency labelling scheme. Now, when your plumber comes to install the washing machine, with the water efficiency labelling scheme it already has a star marking. Apparently, that is very good. It is a quite non-controversial issue.

        I will have to give a little bit of a plug to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Washer" rel="nofollow">
         Mal Washer
        </a>
        , who brought this up in one of his inquiries—I think it was recommendation No. 2—and, as such, it is a great day for Mal Washer. It is funny that a person with the name ‘Washer’ would be involved with something to do with water efficiency labelling of washing machines, but that is the way this place works! Isn’t it a peculiar and wonderful place! I commend the bill to the Senate.

         I thank Senator Joyce for his contribution in the second reading debate. The

          Water Efficiency Labelling and Standards Amendment Bill 2010
         </a>
         was prompted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Heritage, which issued its report
         <i>
          Managing the flow: regulating plumbing product quality
         </i>
         in Australia. It is about providing water saving cost-effectiveness and deals with the ability of the scheme to aim at conserving water supplies by reducing water consumption, providing information for purchasers about water use and water-saving products, and promoting the adoption of efficient and effective water use and water-saving products. It does this by requiring registration and efficiency labelling of specified products when they are offered for sale. It is also able to set minimum water-efficiency standards. With that contribution, I commend the bill to the Senate.
