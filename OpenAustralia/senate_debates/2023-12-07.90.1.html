        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry and Science, Senator Farrell. Minister, the vast majority of businesses do the right thing by their employees and ensure that they are safe at work. However, there is a small number of businesses that do the wrong thing to attempt to get an unfair competitive advantage by putting their workers' safety at risk. In those instances, workers across Australian industries look to the government of the day to ensure that they are safe at work. How is the Albanese government standing up for the safety of Australian workers?

         I thank Senator Sheldon for his question, and I know he has made his life's work the safety of Australian workers. It shouldn't have to be said, but every worker should be safe at work and return home at the end of the day. As Senator Sheldon noted, some employers, sadly, do the wrong thing and risk their workers' safety.
        </p>
        <p>
         Earlier today, Senator Cash rose in this place and outlined how, on their side of politics, they stand with employers. But, on this side of politics, we stand with employers who do the right thing by their workers. The Albanese government wants to see the Australian industry, especially vital ones like manufacturing, grow from strength to strength, and we've delivered the policy settings for them to do so. But, more importantly, we stand by workers' rights to be safe at work. That's why we have acted to improve worker safety by introducing new criminal offences of industrial manslaughter, expanding the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to include silica and are better supporting first responders with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
          PTSD
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         We stand with workers. We stand with employers who do the right thing. And employers who do the wrong thing by their workers should take this as a warning: if they risk the safety of workers through unsafe practices, we will take action.

            I thank Senator Sheldon for his first supplementary question. Sadly, far too many Australian families will be missing a family member this Christmas due to their loved ones passing away due to a workplace incident. This year, Safe Work reports that to 23 November there have been 144 workplace deaths. Last year there were 195 workplace fatalities due to the traumatic injuries sustained in the course of work related activity.
           </p>
           <p>
            Everyone has the right to be safe at work. Thanks to the changes that we have passed today, workers can be reassured that, when there are workplace deaths due to employers failing to keep workers safe, those employers will now be held to account.

              Sadly, too many workers have suffered also from silicosis as a result of work related exposure to silica dust. What steps is the Albanese government taking to tackle silicosis to ensure workers are safe at work?

               I thank Senator Sheldon for his second question. Silica related diseases, like silicosis, are cruel and untreatable, but they are preventable. After an alarming increase in the number of workers developing silica related diseases, the government is taking the necessary action to protect Australian workers. The government is working in a cooperative and coordinated way with states and territories to work through how we act on the recommendations of Safe Work Australia. Today's legislation will now allow the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency to lead a whole-of-government and industry approach to ending the dangers of silica dust diseases. We're keeping workers safe and ensuring industry has the tools to keep them safe.
