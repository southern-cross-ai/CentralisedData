        Today I rise to pay my respects to and remember the life of a fellow
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        , Nick Way. On Friday, Nick lost his brave two-year fight against motor neurone disease. I'm proud to have known and to have worked with him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nick was dedicated to fighting for what was right, in every aspect of his life. There was a wonderful summary of Nick's life in the
        <i>

        </i>
        on Monday, by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Butler" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , which I encourage everyone who knew him to read. But I'd like to refer to another aspect of his life that wasn't mentioned in the article, and that is Nick's tireless efforts on behalf of Bali bombing victims and their families, his coverage of the bombings and his passion to fight for families and victims since that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was chairman of the Bali Peace Park Association. In that role, Nick was committed to delivering a peace park at the site of the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Sari Club
        </a>
        at Kuta, which was destroyed in the 2002 Bali bombings, the 20th anniversary of which we're coming up to next month. He was absolutely committed to this cause and he passionately believed in its importance for all Australians, particularly for those who lived and for the families of those who did not.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, Nick was one of the more than 2,000 people in Australia every year who contract motor neurone disease. This is a truly evil disease, with no cure yet and a life expectancy of less than 2Â½ years from diagnosis. Nick fought this disease with absolutely everything that he had, with every fibre of his being. I offer my sincerest condolences to his beloved wife, Karen, and his family. It was a life of many great contributions, but, Nick, we've lost you too soon. Rest in peace.
