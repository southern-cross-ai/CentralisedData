        After discussion with the

         Leader of the Government in the Senate

        , I seek leave to make a short statement in response to the additional information that Senator Brandis provided.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the Senate and I thank Senator Brandis for adding to his answer. I would make a few points. The first is that it has taken him some time to respond to the questions asked. I would have thought that, for something as important as the state of mind and the information and knowledge provided to government ministers in relation to the execution of a search warrant, the Attorney might have been a little more prompt in providing information to the Senate.

        I have asked on two occasions whether or not the Prime Minister was aware of Mr Brough's statement on
        <i>
         60 Minutes
        </i>
        when he was asked, 'Did you ask James Ashby to procure copies of Peter Slipper's diary for you?' and Mr Brough said, 'Yes, I did.' I have now asked on two or three separate occasions whether or not the Prime Minister was aware of that statement prior to appointing Mr Brough to the ministry, and this minister representing the Prime Minister has not answered that question and he did not do so in the answer he just provided to us.

         The answers that were provided to my office from the Minister for Justice's office were finalised in time for question time today. In relation to the second point, I have been asked about this matter twice by senator Wongâ€”today and yesterday. Today I took the question on notice because, as I said in my answer, I do not know whether the Prime Minister was aware of that particular
         <i>
          60 Minutes
         </i>
         broadcast. I do not know but, as I said, I will inquire.
        </p>
        <p>
         When the Leader of the Opposition sought to raise this issue in a somewhat different way yesterday by not actually quoting the words that had been used I said, as I repeat, that I disputed the premise of the question. I have been asked the question in a proper fashion today and I have said I will take it on notice and I will.
