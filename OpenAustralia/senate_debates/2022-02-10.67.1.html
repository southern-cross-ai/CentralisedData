        [by video link] I have to speak about the millions of Australians that feel that they are being discriminated against with regard to COVID. At present, we have thousands of Australians that are congregating outside the halls of parliament and on the lawns, yet how many of you politicians have been down to actually speak to them? I tried to move a bill last year that it was discrimination; it's a person's right to say whether they want to have a vaccination or not. You voted it down.

          According to the standing orders, senators must attend in person. There is a resolution of the Senate, which was adopted on 13 May 2021, which gives senators the right to appear remotely but only under circumstances that enable them to participate in Senate proceedings while they are prevented from physically attending the Senate because of COVID-19-related travel restrictions, quarantine requirements or personal health requirements. I just ask Senator Hanson to elaborate on whether or not she meets that requirement. Otherwise I ask that she not be heard.

            Senator Hanson, can I just consult with the clerks. There is no point of order, Senator Patrick. When the rules for remote participation operate, the system is available to senators prevented from attending the Senate because of COVID-19 related travel restrictions, quarantine requirements or personal health advice. While the basis for the rules applying to an individual will sometimes be readily apparent, particularly when border restrictions or quarantine requirements are in place, it is not the practice of the President and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
             Deputy President
            </a>
            to inquire into the nature of the personal health advice an individual senator may have. By seeking to participate remotely, individual senators are representing to the Senate that they fall within the ambit of the rules, and the chair takes that at face value. It is for individual senators to determine the extent to which they wish to explain the basis on which they are participating remotely.

             Just responding to that: I'd invite Senator Hanson to make a declaration as to why she's sitting remotely. I would just like her to turn up to work!

               [by video link] That just shows how low Senator Patrick will go. My speech to this parliament is on behalf of millions of Australians who feel they have been discriminated against, and he wants to shut that down like I'm not doing my work. I am damn well doing my work!
              </p>
              <p>
               The fact is they feel discriminated against. What makes me so angry is that yesterday, in the lower chamber, 11 hours were spent debating a bill about religious discrimination. The fact is: we've spoken about transgender people, we've spoken about gays and lesbians, but you're standing up fighting for an issue that doesn't really come into the equation when we have millions of Australians being forced to have injections against their will, losing their jobs, losing their homes and who are suiciding. This has actually happened to Australians. But you gutless wonders in that place there have not taken the chance to actually go out and talk to them and listen to them. You've shut down debate in that parliament on behalf of many Australians, and I will continue to fight for them on their behalf. Talk about discrimination! You are pathetic because you haven't given them the chance to have their voices heard. Listen to their concerns; that's what it's about. Yet you pick and choose what you want to say is discrimination. It is a shame. Shame on all of you!
