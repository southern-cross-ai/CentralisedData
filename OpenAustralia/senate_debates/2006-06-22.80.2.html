        My question is directed to Senator Vanstone in her capacity as Minister for Immigration and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        . If the minister is still the minister responsible for immigration matters, can she explain to the Senate what the government’s immigration policy is today? Is it the policy announced by the Prime Minister on 17 June 2005, is it the policy announced by the minister on 11 May 2006 or is it the bill rejected by the party room last night? Is the minister confident that the Prime Minister will be able to explain to the Indonesian president the rationale for the government’s current position if their meeting goes ahead next week? Given that the changed announcement last night did not remove the retrospective elements of the bill, is the minister able to provide a definitive explanation of what rules would apply if a boatload of Papuan asylum seekers were to land on mainland Australia today?

        <p>
         The policy in this respect is perfectly clear. The bill was introduced some time ago into the House of Representatives. The Prime Minister and others made it clear that we would be discussing with our colleagues some concerns that some colleagues had, and that we would also look at what the Senate committee report says. Yesterday, the party room looked through a number of amendments that the government has indicated it is prepared to make to take account of both the Senate committee report and some views expressed by my colleagues. I understand those amendments are being distributed today so that everyone can look at them and digest them. Consistent with that which I indicated earlier in the week—that the government had no desire to push this bill through quickly—we indicated that we would distribute the amendments today and the bill will be debated when we come back so that everyone will have plenty of time.
        </p>
        <p>
         What the Prime Minister says to President Yudhoyono is a matter for the Prime Minister. I have no doubt that, being the longstanding good friends with Indonesia that we are, a range of matters will be discussed. I do not think that the opposition need have any concern in that context. If a boat comes in the meantime that lands on the mainland, depending on the time taken for processing, it might be covered by the existing law. But if the subsequent bill is passed then it would have retrospective action back until the date of the announcement.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I am not sure what the minister meant at the end of her answer. She seemed to imply one option and then another option. It did not seem to be clear what she was actually saying. What policy would apply if a boat were to land on mainland Australia today? If she could be clear about that, I would appreciate it. Given that the amendments have been distributed today, do we take it to mean that those amendments proposed to the current act are today’s policy? Given the total disarray of the government on this issue, does the minister agree with the view of the member for Canning,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Randall" rel="nofollow">
           Don Randall

          , that the immigration policy is subject to the control or veto by backbenchers whom he describes as ‘heretics and anarchists’?

               You will find that. I feel sure, Senator, that, even to you, that will happen. As to the remarks by colleagues about other colleagues, it is a free country and various people express various views. My own view is that people are entitled to express their views. That includes people who have concerns about the bill. But, I might say, it also includes people who would prefer the bill as it stands now—that is, before the amendments are formally moved. There are people who have that view and who are very concerned that some people would seek to have a time limit.
