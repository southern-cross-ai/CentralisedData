        Launceston is more than a pitstop or gateway to other attractions; it is a destination in its own right, the kind of place you want to spend a weekend, not just pass through. I think it is time to let the mainlanders in on the secret. We have done a good job marketing Launceston as a regional hub, as a launching pad to explore the east and west. People fly in, rent a car and hit the road. They either head to

        or to the east coast. But, believe it or not, there is more than that. We are missing a trick here.

        Launceston itself has so much to offer. It is perfect for those who want to enjoy laidback weekend without the need for hiking boots or a rental car. We have a vibrant food and drink scene. Black Cow is one of my favourites, as is Bar Stelo. Rhubarb gin—yes! It has stunning parks, a rich history and a thriving arts and culture scene. It is a place to unwind, explore and maybe indulge. I can't think of anything better than spending a weekend visiting the world-class wineries along the

        wine trail. Jinglers Creek and of course Josef Chromy and, if you really want, the

        cruise—a four-hour lunch and couple of bevvies.

        But we're not selling the story well enough. We are directing people towards the exits when we should be inviting them to stay and soak up all that Launceston has to offer. How many of you have heard of

        ? I have people in my office, believe it or not, who had never heard of before. They were imports to the state, though, so I will let them have that. We should be putting it on postcards and shouting about it. It should be a Tasmanian icon. I don't want Launceston to remain a hidden gem. Launceston punches above its weight, and we should let the rest of Australia know about it. It is time to shift our marketing focus and show off Launceston as a destination worth lingering in, not just passing through.
