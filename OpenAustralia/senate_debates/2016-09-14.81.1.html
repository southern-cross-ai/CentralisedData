         I thank Senator Smith for that question. It is a very important question, because all of us in this place recognise the challenge in front of us to deliver better outcomes for Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has placed Indigenous affairs at the heart of government, and that is the focus that it needs. As the Prime Minister said in his Closing the Gap speech earlier this year, it is important that we listen to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when they tell us what is working and what needs to change. It is time for governments to do things with Aboriginal people, not to them. That is why we are working in partnership with Indigenous business to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have access to the opportunities they need to drive jobs and growth. Our procurement policies have seen Commonwealth contracts with Indigenous owned companies increase from around $6 million in 2012-13 to over $200 million in the 2015-16 year. Let me repeat: $6 million to $200 million, and growing. For the benefit of those opposite, that is 33 times more in one year than what was achieved in your entire term.
        </p>
        <p>
         So why is this important? Indigenous owned companies are 100 times more likely to employ first-nations people. We are supporting the creation of jobs across the country for Indigenous jobseekers through national employment programs in my portfolio, along with jobactive. Having supported
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         into around 47,000 jobs, the lives of these people have been turned around by the ability to get off welfare and to start building a future for themselves, their families and their communities. Our Community Development Program is now getting people into positive activities, making remote communities a better place to live. Over the last 12 months, the Turnbull government has made tremendous progress. Eighty per cent of participants in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDP" rel="nofollow">
          CDP
         </a>
         are now engaged in meaningful activities, and there has been a sevenfold increase in attendance since the end of Labor's failed Remote Jobs and Community Program.

            From early childhood to tertiary education, the Turnbull government is ensuring that Indigenous children are fully equipped to enter the workforce or progress into university and training. During the last 12 months, the Turnbull government has substantially increased the support being provided to students through its $24 million Indigenous Youth Support Package. The new investment is supporting more than 10,000 Aboriginal and

            You should all be aware of our efforts to address the declining rate of school attendance, particularly in remote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. That had been ignored before we on this side of the chamber took over. In the 2016 budget, we announced our Indigenous Students Success in Higher Education measure, which will ensure higher education support that we fund is better tailored to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students complete their studies. We are working with communities to ensure education is a successful pathway for young

                Indigenous Australians
               </a>
               is the best approach to deliver long-term change that we need for our

                First Australians

               . Under the Prime Minister's leadership, we are working in partnership with communities. In the senator's home state of

                Western Australia

               , I can report there are some outstanding examples of the outcomes the Turnbull government has delivered.
              </p>
              <p>
               As I have said, through Indigenous procurement policy businesses have won over $200 million worth of contracts, including some great examples in Western Australia. Kulbardi, based in Perth, has won $160,000 in contracts to provide furniture and office equipment. Pindari Building Solutions, out in the Pilbara, has won almost $600,000 in contracts. For the first time, the government had allocated funding direct to native title holders to ensure Indigenous landowners have the opportunity to maximise the benefit coming from owning their own land. In the Kimberley, we are supporting the Gooniyandi to consider opportunities for commercial development, including in the cattle industry—a great opportunity for communities to work with government to deliver better outcomes for Indigenous people.
