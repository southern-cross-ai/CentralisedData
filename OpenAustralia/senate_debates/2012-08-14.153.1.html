         The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Since 1 January 2008, there have been 18,685 irregular maritime arrivals taken into immigration detention (as at close of business 24 June 2012).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) (a) The very detailed information sought in the question is not readily available in consolidated form and it would be a major task to collect and assemble it. It is not considered that the considerable human resources required to obtain the information can be justified.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) The number of persons granted a Global Special Humanitarian Visa (Subclass 202) where the proposer was an irregular maritime arrival, by program year of grant 2007 – 2008 to 2011-12 year to date
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Notes:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         1. The 2011-12 program year to date is to 31 March 2012. Data for the 2011–12 program year was extracted from departmental systems on 08 June 2012.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         2. Data for 2007–08 to 2010–11 were extracted from Departmental systems on 30 June 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         3. Includes immediate family of former subclass 447 and 451 holders as well as immediate family of subclass 866 (Protection Visa) holders and may include immediate family of a small number of unauthorised air arrivals.
