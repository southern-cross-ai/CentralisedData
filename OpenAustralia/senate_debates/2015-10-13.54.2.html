         As Senator Wong would know, having been a cabinet minister, within a ministerial portfolio, members of the portfolio take responsibility for certain elements of that portfolio and of that ministry. My understanding is that those arrangements are still being finalised between minister—

             I withdraw. As I understand it, the charter letter from the Prime Minister has not been finalised yet, but the arrangements between Minister Joyce and Assistant Minister Ruston will be finalised. As we all understand, a cabinet minister ultimately has responsibility for all elements of the portfolio, and in that context ultimately Minister Joyce is responsible for the elements of the water portfolio that are within his portfolio. I am not sure what all the excitement is from Senator Wong. The important thing for water and for Australia is that water is under the responsibility of the coalition and not the opposition.

              I ask a supplementary question. Does the minister agree with Senator John Williams, who says that the only interpretation of the coalition agreement is that water must go entirely to the agriculture minister, Mr Joyce, and not to his assistant minister, Senator Ruston?

              <p>
               As I said a moment ago, ultimately the responsibility for water within the agriculture and water resources portfolio is with Minister Joyce. Whether Minister Joyce and Senator Ruston have agreed to some arrangements about the overall management of water within the portfolio is a matter for them and the Prime Minister. I am sure that those arrangements will be finalised in due course. I said yesterday that we are a very contented coalition, and we are. I had the great fortune to spend two years in the agriculture portfolio working with Minister Joyce. I got on famously with Minister Joyce. He was great to work with. He was a very good senior minister to work with. I do not expect that he will be any different with Senator Ruston. In fact, I am sure he will be the same.
