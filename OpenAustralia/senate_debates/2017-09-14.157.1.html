        My question is for the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne, representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. Today is the 70 anniversary of Australia's involvement in peacekeeping operations around the world, and we thank them for their service. In the case of Lebanon, in 1983-84 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        observers were at risk of being shelled by artillery or killed by militia on a daily basis. Indeed, the Australian embassy in Beirut was closed down in 1984 because of the security situation in Beirut, according to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        . Some UN peacekeepers and observers were evacuated with gunshot wounds and others were subjected to physical harm from hostile forces of the

        , reacting to UN sanctions and militia opposed to their presence in Lebanon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, can you please advise the chamber on what basis unarmed ADF members and police deployed into a hostile environment or an environment that becomes hostile might be recognised for war-like service and receive the

         I thank Senator Burston for some prior notice of his question. I also thank him for a question of this nature on a day when we are honouring our proud Australian peacekeeping tradition that goes back seven decades to our first
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         deployment in 1947. Today, a new peacekeeping memorial was unveiled on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anzac_Parade" rel="nofollow">
          Anzac Parade
         </a>
         to commemorate the courage, the sacrifice and the valour of Australian peacekeepers from the ADF, the police services and the civilian community. The memorial honours the close to 80,000 Australians who have served in more than 60 UN and multinational peacekeeping operations. Senator Burston asks me about nature of service, of which I have several contemporary examples. The ADF is contributing 59 specialist personnel across multinational and UN peacekeeping missions to provide niche capabilities and expertise in areas such as operations and logistics. This currently includes 19 ADF personnel to the UN Mission in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Sudan" rel="nofollow">
          South Sudan
         </a>
         , 12 ADF personnel to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Truce_Supervision_Organization" rel="nofollow">
          UN Truce Supervision Organization
         </a>
         in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         and 28 personnel to the multinational force and observer mission in the Sinai. I acknowledge those men and women and thank them for their service.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, it is important to note, in relation to Senator Burston's question, that matters of nature of service will differ from deployment to deployment. Over those 60 operations I referred to earlier, they have been very different over the years. War-like classification requires the authorisation to use force to achieve a military objective and the expectation of casualties.

            I thank Senator Burston. I can. The ADF personnel in Rwanda who took part there took part in armed operations to clear armed militia from internally displaced or

             IDP
            </a>
            camps. While initially deployed without an expectation of a need to use force beyond self-defence, this nature of service was reviewed after deployment. It was found that the use of force beyond self-defence was integral in achieving the objective of the deployment; namely, the clearing of armed militia from the IDP camps. Consequently, the

               Defence has recently completed a comprehensive review of ADF service with the

               STO. It confirmed that there is no period of service with UNSTO from 1956 to 2010 that warrants classification as other than peacekeeping or non-war-like service. Defence, of course, acknowledges that the role of an unarmed observer can at times be hazardous not only during periods of increased conflict but also when carrying out the routine day-to-day tasks in support of the UN mission. This was the case with unarmed military observers who served in Beirut in 1983 and 1984.
