         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a)   AusAID's Civil Society Engagement Framework addresses commitments made in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         's aid policy An Effective Aid Program for Australia: Making a difference—delivering real results.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Framework" rel="nofollow">
          The Framework
         </a>
         is an overarching policy statement that sets out, among other things, how Australia will work more effectively with civil society organisations in Australia and overseas to increase the impact of aid for the world's poorest.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i)   In formulating the Framework, AusAID drew on a range of sources including the National Compact between the Australian Government and the not-for-profit sector, AusAID's Head Agreement with Australian non-government organisations, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Council
         </a>
         for International Development's Code of Conduct and the Office of Development Effectiveness' report Working Beyond Government: Evaluation of AusAID's engagement with civil society in developing countries.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii)   Legal advice was not sought by AusAID in the formulation of the Civil Society Engagement Framework because it is an overarching statement of purpose and strategy for the Government to broaden and strengthen ties with civil society organisations. Compliance with international and treaty obligations is built in to all AusAID agreements with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
          NGO
         </a>
         s, which follow the Commonwealth Procurement Rules and the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines. Legal advice is sought on all AusAID contract and grant agreements with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs" rel="nofollow">
          NGOs
         </a>
         , including advice on whether the organisation is listed as a terrorist organisation under Australian law or under
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         regulations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b)   See (a) (ii) above.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c)   AusAID conducted a broad consultation process during the development phase of the Civil Society Engagement Framework. The draft Framework was made available on AusAID's website for public consultation in March 2012. Nineteen submissions were received.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i)   The Framework draws on whole-of-Government policy statements, including the National Compact between the Australian Government and the not-for-profit sector and An Effective Aid Program for Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii)   AusAID discussed the draft Framework with donors including the United Kingdom's Department for International Development (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFID" rel="nofollow">
          DFID

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_International_Development_Agency" rel="nofollow">
          Canadian International Development Agency
         </a>

          CIDA

         ). The Framework was informed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development—Development Assistance Committee's How Development Assistance Committee Members Work with Civil Society Organisations report and the Office of Development Effectiveness' Working Beyond Government report.
