        We have recently returned from the winter recess, and a lot of us enjoyed the time back home in our electorates. One event I was particularly pleased to take part in was a ceremony in Geraldton as part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC" rel="nofollow">
         NAIDOC
        </a>
        Week celebrations. I congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        in Geraldton, which hosted and organised a special dawn service at the commencement of NAIDOC week to place on record their recognition of the Indigenous men and women who died serving our country. I thought that was particularly moving from a community that, as Senator Ellison knows, is sometimes, though not always, seen as being a bit more conservative than other communities in our home state. It was particularly moving that they acknowledged the important contribution that their local Indigenous community has made in serving our nation in overseas conflicts. I want to place on record my appreciation of that event and say that, although it was quite cold at 6 am in Geraldton in the middle of winter, it was a real honour to attend.
