        COMPETITION AND CONSUMER AMENDMENT (COUNTRY OF ORIGIN) BILL

       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will amend the country of origin safe harbour defences in the Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 to the
        <i>
         Competition and Consumer Act 2010).
        </i>
        The amendments form part of a package of country of origin labelling reforms announced by the Government in July 2015, and subsequently agreed by

       <p class="italic">
        The bill will amend the country of origin safe harbour defences in the Australian Consumer Law (Schedule 2 to the
        <i>
         Competition and Consumer Act 2010).
        </i>
        The amendments form part of a package of country of origin labelling reforms agreed and announced by the Government on 21 July 2015 and agreed by all jurisdictions through the Legislative and Governance Forum on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

        ) on 31 March 2016.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The key element of the package, the Country of Origin Food Labelling Standard 2016, was made and registered in April 2016, and commenced on 1 July 2016. This bill was originally introduced on 4 May 2016 with a view to commencement at the same time as the Information Standard, but lapsed when the Parliament was dissolved prior to the 2016 Federal Election.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Introducing the amendments contained in this bill as soon as possible will ensure that all elements of Australia's new country of origin labelling system are aligned with minimum delay. This will provide consistency, clarity and certainty for businesses and consumers, and deliver the full benefit of the Government's reforms as soon as practicable.
