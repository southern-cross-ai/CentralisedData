       <p class="italic">
        (ii) reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes, and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women and girls, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) violates women and girls' rights to health, security and physical integrity, their right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and their right to life when the procedure results in death;

       <p class="italic">
        (b) recognises that a commitment to promote the abandonment of FGM will require:

        (ii) FGM is mostly carried out on young girls sometime between infancy and age 15 and that girls 14 and younger represent 44 million of those who have been cut,

        (iii) FGM can cause severe bleeding and health issues including cysts, infections, infertility, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths,
