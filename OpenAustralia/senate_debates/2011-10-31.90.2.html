Victoria is the only state that has implemented more competitive demand driven reforms into their VET sector, at this point in time, and a recent audit by the Victorian Auditor-General did not find any discounting of capital in its examination of the financial accounts of any of the 14 Victorian TAFE Institutes.

         NSW

        has announced its intention to consider reforms to its VET sector, including the introduction of a more competitive environment between private and public providers for Governments' funding dollars. NSW has recently released a discussion paper on possible reform directions and is currently undertaking stakeholder consultations as part of their deliberations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All states have indicated that they are considering moving to a more flexible and demand-driven training systems, and looking at greater contestability of funding for public training and greater competition between providers.

        ' (COAG) recent consideration of VET reform also indicated quite clearly through its publicly available communiqué the value that all governments place on TAFE institutes within any competitive market. COAG recognised and supports TAFE's role providing high-cost technical training (so as not to lose the public value of that capital investment), encouraging participation of disadvantaged students and offering services in regional and remote areas.
