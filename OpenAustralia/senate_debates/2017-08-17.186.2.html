        I would like to put on the record that this is an extremely complex area of public policy. The chair of the committee, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Andrews
        </a>
        ; other members of the committee; and I ,as deputy chair, are extremely effective in a bipartisan way. What we've been able to do in our examination of the implementation of the national disability scheme is take quite specific segments, in this case the area of people with psychosocial disabilities, and produce an interim report about how the implementation of the scheme is going in that particular area. There will also be an interim report on the area of deafness.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we're finding is that it is extremely complex public policy. There is a vital sector which is advocating for their representative groups, their constituents, so to speak. We're able to take their evidence in public hearing, reduce it to recommendations and, hopefully, allow the full implementation of the scheme across the whole gamut of Australians with disability, with the view that they'll be able to enjoy a more productive, a more compassionate spend, if you like, on their particular plansâ€”and have more control over that spend.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to conclude by saying that we have a silo-type approach in respect to each area that is coming up with particular concerns. They are enjoying the opportunity to present at public hearings. We are taking evidence and making recommendations as we go. I commend the report to the Senate and highlight the good work that the committee is doing in an extremely bipartisan way.

        Debate adjourned.
