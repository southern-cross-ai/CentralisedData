        I often end my speeches with the words, 'We are one community, we are one nation,' for a reason. Oneness is a fundamental teaching of Christianity. I quote

        For the body does not consist of one member but of many. If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.

        Verse 26 says:

       <p class="italic">
        If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.

        , and we embrace those who have come since. All are important. All make each of us greater than we could ever become by ourselves. Indeed, all have made us greater than we once were.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a community, we do face evil. That battle is as old as time itself. That's why humanity has evolved to consider community the basic building block of safety and prosperity. Those who seek to divide do so because they seek to destroy. Instead, together we can overcome the ravages of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_Nature" rel="nofollow">

        in a harsh but bountiful land. Together we can achieve abundance for all Australians. Surely, if our bounty is not being shared fairly, we must correct that. Together we can defeat predatory billionaires who believe they should own everything and we should own nothing. Together we can change the lives of First Australians in remote communities who deal with conditions that, today, no human being should ever have to. We can and must start on that today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Evil is fought together, not apart. One Nation will continue to hold our hand out to those captured by intolerance and hate. I live in hope that one day our hand will be taken. In the end, love and courage will win. Most Australians feel the same way.
