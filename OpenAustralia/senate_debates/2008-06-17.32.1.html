        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Wong. I refer to clause 12(2) of the National Employment Standards. Will the minister define how many hours constitute ‘reasonable additional hours’?

         As I outlined yesterday, Labor is delivering on the National Employment Standards. Yesterday, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister released the National Employment Standards, which will come into effect in January 2010. Unlike those opposite, we in this government will provide a guaranteed safety net of 10 minimum conditions of employment. I remind the chamber that it is double the number of conditions guaranteed by the former government’s Australian fair pay and conditions standard. Again, this is the Rudd Labor government delivering on its election commitments to provide a fair and flexible industrial relations system of which the government can be proud and which was promised to the Australian people prior to the election. Over the last 24 hours we have seen the opposition asking: ‘What about this?’ ‘What about this?’ ‘What about this?’ What the Australian people will be asking is: where was this opposition, when in government, when people were having their conditions and wages stripped away by Australian workplace agreements under

          Work Choices
         </a>
         ? Where was Senator Fisher then? Was she asking the minister for workplace relations then what the impact was on low-paid workers of the award-stripping Australian workplace agreements?

If the question is referring to maximum weekly hours, I would refer the senator to the provisions of the National Employment Standards which deal with that—they are quite lengthy—notwithstanding the fact that—

                 , I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister’s ill-defined definition. I refer the minister to clause 12(4)(b) of the National Employment Standards, which requires an employer to take into account an employee’s family responsibilities when considering ‘reasonable additional hours’. Does the government, as an employer, consider that requiring a working mother of two to work 37 hours straight constitutes reasonable additional hours? In the light of this, will the minister guarantee that no Australian worker will be worse off under the government’s proposed National Employment Standards?

                  , to Senator Fisher that we on this side can guarantee that Labor’s workplace relations system will be balanced and fair. We can guarantee that there is nothing about the operation of Labor’s workplace relations system that will disadvantage employees. Unlike the other side when in government, we can guarantee that every employee in the federal system will be protected by Labor’s 10 legislated minimum standards and will not be subjected to the wage-stripping, conditions-stripping Australian workplace agreements that Senator Fisher and every other member of the opposition over there voted for and imposed on the Australian people prior to the last election. And no amount of questioning now about guarantees will allow the Australian people to forget that, Senator Fisher.
