        I rise to again speak on the government's response to the Community Affairs References Committee report,
        <i>
         Grandparents who take primary responsibility for raising their grandchildren
        </i>
        . As I have previously highlighted, this response was tabled last month, nearly 15 months after the committee presented its report, and even then the government's response only came after a motion was moved in this place calling on the government to respond.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a seven-month inquiry undertaken by the Community Affairs References Committee that took evidence from across the country. Senators on the committee heard many personal accounts from grandparents and grandchildren. The committee heard evidence of the often difficult and sometimes tragic circumstances under which grandparents had come to take on the caring role. We heard about the considerable financial impact that taking on the care of their grandchildren can have on grandparents, and we heard from grandparents about the physical and mental toll the caring role can take on them. We also heard of love, of devotion, of deep concern and of unending gratitude. And, based on all this evidence that the Community Affairs References Committee took over those seven months, the committee made 18 recommendations in its unanimous report.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the government obviously did not hear this evidence or take note of it, as they have largely seen fit to dismiss and ignore the issues identified by the committee and the recommendations in the report. But I will not dismiss this evidence, and I am sure those who were on the Community Affairs References Committee or participated in this inquiry, as Senator Smith did, will not dismiss this evidence. We will not dismiss the growing number of grandparent-headed families across the country, and that is why I have again risen to speak on this issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the time of the tabling of this committee's inquiry report, I urged the government to consider the recommendations in the report and to join with state and territory governments to develop a collaborative response to the needs identified throughout the report. I again urge the government to adopt a collaborative approach to supporting grandparent-headed families. And that is why I am standing here today, calling on the Turnbull government to show some leadership by addressing the overall findings of the report by initiating a robust
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">

        discussion on the recommendations of the Senate report and of how to support the many grandparents raising their grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ensuring that grandparent-headed families have the support that they are going to need will require a national effort. That is what we heard throughout the evidence to this inquiry. It is going to require genuine and constructive engagement from governments, child protection, social security and health systems and sectors, and the Family Court system—something that is lacking in the government's response.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every grandparent-carer has a unique experience, and we heard many of those experiences. But what the committee found was that there were also many similarities in these struggles they faced. There are, undeniably, and thankfully, a number of very successful services across the country—services that provide vital support to these families. However, it is clear that these supports are too few and far between. Many grandparent-carers slip through the gaps, struggle to navigate the maze of services and support, or are simply unaware of what is out there or how to access the help they need. Providing lists of existing programs that do not address the committee's recommendations or the specific needs of grandparent-headed families is simply an insufficient response.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the government's response to this report was tabled, I acknowledged the government's commitment to extending grandparent advisers and strengthening support for grandparent-carers through investment in a new initiative to provide national information, resources and support for the target group. However, grandparent-carers and their families have waited more than a year for this response and they simply cannot wait any longer for the government to take action. The government's response lacks information about funding for these initiatives or time lines for then they will actually be made available. I have to say that I have no further clarity on these measures following Senate estimates. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Human Services
        </a>
        were unable to provide basic details about the extended grandparent advisers, including when these positions were due to start.
       </p>
       <p>
        When asked about the enhanced outreach capacity of the grandparent advisers that was mentioned in the government's response the department told the Senate committee that they did not think that they had, and I quote 'looked at it to the level of detail yet'. When I asked the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        for information on the new initiative to provide national information, resources and support they were equally unable to provide any level of detail. The department indicated that they were in the planning phases at the moment. It seems that there is still nothing sitting behind the government's response—no additional support of assistance for grandparent headed families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the course of the inquiry many grandparents told the committee that they felt their role and their contribution was not understood or acknowledged. The government's response to the committee inquiry largely confirms that. At least within the government there is no awareness or recognition of the challenges faced by grandparent carers. The government should make no mistake, my colleagues and I on this side—and those coalition members that took part in the inquiry—will continue to stand up for grandparent headed families against a government who clearly does not understand or appreciate the contribution of grandparents raising grandchildren. Labor believes that grandparent carers are unsung heroes. These heroes need a government that is willing to support them when they take on this caring role.
