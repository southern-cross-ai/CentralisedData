         I thank Senator Molan for the question. Australia is proud to be offering full COVID-19 vaccine coverage for the Pacific and Timor-Leste in close partnership with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         , the United States and France. We are committing $523.2 million over three years to a COVID-19 vaccine access health initiative for the Pacific and South-East Asia. This funding complements the $80 million we previously committed to the multilateral Covax Facility Advance Market Commitment for developing countries. In South-East Asia we will work with partners, like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          World Bank
         </a>
         , to meet the needs of much larger populations in our region.
        </p>
        <p>
         This initiative will provide safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines and support health security in our region. Safety and effectiveness are critically important. We will only support the rolling out of vaccines to our neighbours once the vaccines have been approved by a stringent regulatory authority and countries are adequately prepared to administer the right vaccines for their local conditions. Senator Payne and I are in regular contact with our counterparts in the Pacific and South-East Asia to underline our commitment and to progress the next steps of our cooperation on vaccine access and rollouts in their nations. We expect that vaccines procured by the Covax Facility
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMC" rel="nofollow">
          AMC
         </a>
         will be the first available to countries in our region. Gavi and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
          WHO
         </a>
         's best estimate is the AMC will begin to supply before the end of March 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, I'd like to recognise that our Pacific partners have handled this situation extremely well so far. This is a testament to the incredible leadership across our region. Our focus is on trying to save lives and livelihoods. Access to WHO-approved COVID-19 vaccines will help economies reopen and ensure stability. Our regional vaccine initiative will enable the purchase of vaccines by our neighbouring countries and will provide them with the necessary technical support to prepare for vaccine introduction.

            I again thank Senator Molan. Our response is comprehensive in that it delivers not only access to vaccines but also critical economic support to countries in our region that have been profoundly affected by COVID-19. Our vaccine access initiative will deliver a holistic package of end-to-end support. It's not just for the procurement of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
             WHO
            </a>
            -approved vaccines; we're providing technical assistance and logistical support, such as training of health workers and cold-chain storage, as well as the development of national immunisation policies. Economic measures will support health security and social stability and help drive economic recovery across the region. They're also designed to protect the most vulnerable, who are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, including women, girls and those with a disability.
           </p>
           <p>
            These targeted initiatives will meet the urgent needs of our neighbours and enable the region's recovery from COVID-19 in the longer term. It's not just delivering vaccines; it's about making sure that we work with our partners to maintain essential health services and enhance security for those who need it the most.

               I thank Senator Molan for the question. I am pleased to inform the Senate that all Pacific island nations and Timor-Leste will be provided with the support to achieve full vaccine coverage in line with their own national priorities, and that process has already started. We're working closely with

               compact states. This coordination is critical to ensure our Pacific family can have access to vaccines that are safe and effective and can be accessed to support the economic recovery of the region. We believe that Australia and the region will not be safe until everybody is safe. That is why we are making a significant global contribution to ensuring that all of our close partners have access to safe and effective
