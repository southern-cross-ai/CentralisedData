           The government has not made a decision to privatise aged-care assessments. It's disappointing that claims to that effect are misleading the community and parliament. The government made a commitment in the 2018-19 budget to streamline the assessment process of aged care in line with the 2017 Tune review recommendation, which goes as follows: 'That the government integrate regional assessment services with aged-care assessment teams.'
          </p>
          <p>
           The royal commission in the interim report stated:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
            The Government
           </a>
           has announced that it will implement this recommendation and will integrate the two assessment workforces from 2020. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Commission
           </a>
           considers that this integration needs to be progressed urgently.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government is committed to creating a better experience for senior Australians entering aged care, and our position remains unchanged: we're committed to ensuring that Australians seeking to enter aged care receive timely, consistent, high-quality needs assessments.

              I speak in support of this motion. These assessment teams play a vital role in connecting everyday aged Australians with the health care and support they need. What is truly important is that the care package that the assessment team delivers is the right one, because it affects the health and happiness of people in need. These are real people with real needs which should not be ignored. So we support this, and we call on the government to consult with the state health ministers on the issue of
