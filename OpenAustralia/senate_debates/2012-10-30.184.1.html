         The Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The net financial effect on the Departments' 2012-13 budget of:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) the original 1.5 percent efficiency dividend was $0.160 million
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) the additional 2.5 percent efficiency dividend was $2.095 million
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) other saving measures as introduced in the 2012-13 Budget paper was $0.127 million
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The Department has set a balanced budget for 2012-13, which is regularly analysed and reported to senior management for their information and review. The Department will undertake budget reviews as required during 2012-13 to ensure the Department operates within budget.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) In 2012-13, staff costs represent approximately 65 percent of budgeted expenditure.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The Department expects a small reduction in staff numbers in 2012-13. It is not possible to quantify at this time whether or not the Department will reduce its engagement of consultants, and/or contractors in 2012-13.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) In 2012-13, the Department is not expecting to execute any voluntary or involuntary redundancies.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
