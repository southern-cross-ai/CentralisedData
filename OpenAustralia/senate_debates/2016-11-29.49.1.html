        representing the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, Senator Sinodinos. Noting that the government has already delivered unmatched preferential market access to the three northern Asian powerhouse economies, can the Cabinet Secretary outline what other opportunities the government is delivering for Australian exporters?

         I thank Senator Williams for his question and for his ongoing interest in tourism, trade and investment. During the Prime Minister's first head-of-government visit to Indonesia, he and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
          President of Indonesia
         </a>
         , Joko Widodo, agreed to revive negotiations for a free trade and investment partnership between our two countries. Now, this is an important priority for both countries, which is why, when Mr Ciobo, in the other place, was appointed Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, his first trip of this parliament was to Indonesia to meet with his Indonesian counterpart.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia and Indonesia's trade and investment relationship is underdone, despite us being large G20 economies in close proximity. Australia's two-way trade with Indonesia was valued at $14.8 billion in 2014-15, making it our 12th largest merchandise trade partner. With a growing population of more than 250 million people, Indonesia really is the economic superpower of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         region, and for us it presents a tremendous opportunity. Examples of this can be seen in the beef sector, as well as in food manufacturing. Our wheat is sent to Indonesia and then turned into noodles and biscuits, which Indonesia exports to nations in the region. It is a great mark of our partnership. Like our landmark agreements with China, Korea and Japan, a bilateral trade agreement with Indonesia would be hugely beneficial to Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I hope on this occasion that the Leader of the Opposition will be more supportive of this agreement than he was when we brought the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement to this parliament. He was left rather isolated on the Labor side of politics.

            There are cattle stations right up and down Australia which will benefit from exporting capital to Indonesiaâ€”cattle to Indonesia; I spent too long in the banking sector! This includes Consolidated Pastoral Company, one of Australia's biggest beef exporters, with its head office in Brisbane.

You judge countries and governments by their actions, not just by their words, and many in this place will remember how Labor in government treated the great country of Indonesia. Labor shut down the entire cattle industry overnight, leaving Australian farmers devastated, exacerbating Indonesia's food security concerns and undermining Indonesia's confidence in Australia as a trade partner. The big mistake Indonesia made was not having the
