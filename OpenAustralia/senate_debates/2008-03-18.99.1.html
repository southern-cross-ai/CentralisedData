        <p>
         I thank the senator for the question. The report in today’s
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         refers to a strategic review. It was initially requested by the commissioner over two years ago. The report indicated that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         needed additional assistance to fund its core capabilities. Savings measures were also suggested. The new government has committed to additional police for the Australian Federal Police. The 500 new police over five years will assist the Australian Federal Police to meet these core commitments.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every agency that spends public money has been called to account by this government. The Australian Federal Police has been asked to examine where it may make savings or improve its financial performance. Of course, the government will consider any savings measures in the context of its commitment to increase the Australian Federal Police capacity and our ongoing commitment to police assistance in our region.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also had the opportunity of looking at the press release that was issued by Senator Brandis with Mr Christopher Pyne. Within that there are a range of allegations which are clearly incorrect. It makes a number of wide claims. What I can say is that the government has enjoyed good relations with the Australian Federal Police. We are pleased to be able to work with Commissioner Keelty in respect of the operations that the Federal Police commit to and we are also pleased to be able to provide the 500 new police to be able to work effectively within our community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Community safety is one of the concerns the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor
         </a>
         government have in this area, and we are concerned to work with the Australian Federal Police to ensure that the community is safe across all areas. As I indicated, the Len Early review occurred some two years ago, but it is the Rudd Labor government that is responding to it today.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister’s inability to provide the assurance sought by my question and following hard on the heels of the government’s announcement last week of a mickey mouse sub judicial inquiry into the Haneef affair, what steps will the government take to arrest its rapidly collapsing relationship with the

          <p>
           Again we hear the slur that is made against Mr Keelty and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Federal Police
           </a>
           . The Rudd Labor government supports the Australian Federal Police in its endeavours across the wide range of work that it does, both internationally and domestically and in working with interagencies such as
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
            ASIO
           </a>
           and local and state police right across the board. The Rudd Labor government is supportive of that.
          </p>
          <p>
           The real issue is that we have announced an inquiry into the Haneef matter. What the opposition did not do prior to the election, during the matter, was to have an inquiry. What is now clear is that the opposition does support an inquiry into the Haneef matter, and that, quite frankly, is welcome. It is necessary to have a look into that matter. Unlike the opposition, the Rudd government believes playing politics with national security is irresponsible and completely counterproductive.
