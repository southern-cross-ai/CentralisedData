        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Senator Wong. Minister, considering the shambolic and disastrous impact of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        n Labor government's Aboriginal cultural heritage laws, particularly on farmers, local councils and environmental groups, will the minister now abandon the Albanese Labor government's promise to change cultural heritage laws at a national level?

          The first point I would make is it appears that the first question on both days this week from the opposition has been about the actions of a state government. I'm pleased that they are so supportive of what this government is doing that they don't appear to be able to ask questions critical of what our policy is. But, as the minister well knows, the issues around the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          n legislation are matters for the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australian
          </a>
          government. I would make the point that I understand that the shadow Attorney-General, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, is amongst those who wish to conflate those issues in her opposition to the Voice. Anybody who has been to Western Australia or who has spoken to any Western Australians will know that that is a political tactic because you oppose the Voice.
         </p>
         <p>
          I've been in politics for a while, and I think we all understand the scare campaign, and Senator Cash is good at those.

            In relation to the second point I am surprised, given the comments of your own deputy leader, Ms Ley, in relation to Indigenous heritage protection, that you would ask me whether or not we should abandon them. The minister and now Deputy Leader of the Opposition told the
            <i>
             Australian
            </i>
            in November 2021 that Indigenous heritage protection remains all too complex, and it needs to be addressed through a national conversation. The options paper you're asking me about was commissioned by you. The options paper you are writing a scare campaign on was commissioned by you, and if you ever wanted an example of why those opposite use every argument they can to oppose the Voice—

                       This is a bit like 'electric vehicles will end the weekend', isn't it? Was that you too—that was Mr Morrison. Senator Cash, those matters that you put to me are state government policy. They are not our government's policy. Our government's policy position is to go through the options paper and the conversation that you called for.

                         What I can say is this: the government is not proposing any Commonwealth takeover of state laws. We will not be adopting or duplicating existing state and territory regimes. If the senator would like to recall, this is all about ensuring that a tragedy like Juukan Gorge does not happen again—something that both parties of government, I thought, supported.

                            Again, I remind those opposite that the options paper they're running a scare campaign on was issued by their government and that the propositions which have been put to me by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate are about state laws. I suggest she put them to the state government. Finally, I remind the opposition of this: there was once bipartisan support for updating national laws to better protect
