          NBN
         </a>
         is an historic nation-building project, the positive economic and social effects of which will be felt for generations to come. Last week we released in full the implementation study into the NBN. This study was undertaken by McKinsey and Co. and

         . It is highly rigorous and detailed, at over 500 pages and with 84 recommendations for government. It covers a range of critical areas including issues around the technology, financing, ownership, policy framework and future market structure.
        </p>
        <p>
         The study confirmed that high-speed broadband over a wholesale-only network for all Australians is achievable and can be built on a financially viable basis with affordable prices for consumers. In fact, the study finds that in a number of areas it is possible not only to meet but also to exceed the government’s original objectives. It finds that the original $43 billion total capital cost estimate is conservative and at the high end of the plausible range and identifies a number of opportunities to reduce the bill’s cost. It recommends taking the fibre footprint further than the government originally intended from 90 to 93 per cent and covering the 1.3 million new premises expected to be built to 2017-18. In effect this means the study recommends taking fibre to an extra 1.6 million premises.

            , I ask the minister a further supplementary question. Given the importance of high-speed broadband for strengthening the Australian economy and providing critical infrastructure for consumers, small business and our regional areas, is the minister aware of any alternative policies to deliver enhanced broadband for all Australians?

             Regrettably I must advise the Senate that I am not aware of any alternative policies to ensure that all Australians have access to high-speed broadband. Even before the implementation study was released the opposition announced they would scrap the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
              NBN
             </a>
             . This took opposition for opposition’s sake to a whole new level. After two-and-a-half years in opposition those opposite still do not have an alternative broadband plan, which is no surprise, given they are on their third shadow minister. The opposition plan to stop building the NBN would risk Australia’s economic future. The NBN is crucial economic infrastructure. Without it Australian companies will not be able to compete with the likes of Japan,
