        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. Will the minister please update the Senate on recent initiatives to strengthen relations between the

         It is an important story which involves the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         working internationally with other law enforcement agencies in the fight against transnational crime and terrorism. Just last week the

         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Keelty" rel="nofollow">
          Mick Keelty
         </a>
         , signed an agreement with Europol. It is a timely question from Senator Parry, who was over there last year, I understand, and had talks with Europol officials in relation to such an agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         The AFP has 80 offices around the world in 27 different countries. It is extremely important, for a number of reasons, that we engage with Europol. We have seen increasing criminal activity from organised crime in Europe, particularly in eastern Europe. When you look at the fact that Europol brings in 27 member nations in Europe, that gives you an idea of the extensive coverage in relation to law enforcement. This will give us access to the databases of Europol and it is especially significant when you realise that the AFP are the only police force in the Asia-Pacific region to be granted this status. In fact, there are only a limited number of countries which have what we call third-party status with Europol.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also have the universal issue of illicit drugs, but importantly we have seen amphetamine-type stimulants emanating increasingly from Europe, and that is another reason to have access to Europol. Europol is also involved in the fight against terrorism. Senator Minchin said quite correctly earlier that terrorism is striking at the heart of major cities in the Western world, Spain being an example. We have seen
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Brigitte" rel="nofollow">
          Willy Brigitte
         </a>
         with his ties to France, and that is why it is so important that we have this forward engagement with organisations such as Europol. The signing of this agreement is a significant step forward not only in recognition of the AFP internationally but also in relation to the extensive cooperation that we have with overseas law enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am also pleased to report that, while the police commissioner was overseas last week, we opened an office in Dubai. That is an important area of the world. When the nearest office that we have open is in Islamabad, it gives you an idea of the immensity of the challenge in that region, not only geographically but also in relation to the security risks which are posed. It is anticipated that, early in the new year, we will be opening an office in Guangzhou in southern China and we will also look to open one in New Delhi in India. Those are two important areas for Australiaâ€”southern China for a number of aspects in relation to drug related matters, and India, where we have to engage in law enforcement assistance in relation to both counter-terrorism and transnational crime.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last week was a good week for the AFP. It was a great step forward in our international cooperation and again demonstrates how highly our AFP is held in esteem and in regard by other countries. These agreements do not happen overnight; they come about by hard work and as a result of recognition by overseas law enforcement agencies of the great work that the men and women of the Australian Federal Police are doing. This is just part of the work in progress in the fight that we are engaging in against transnational crime and terrorism.
