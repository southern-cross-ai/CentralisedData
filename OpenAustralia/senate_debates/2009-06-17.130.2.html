         Senator Brown, it is not normal to start debating it when you are getting up to ask for a motion to be taken as formal. We are aware of the notice of motion. You could ask for leave if you wanted to.

          It is my right and responsibility to explain the nature of a motion in very brief terms, if the Senate is going to consider it, and that is what I just did.

                   Section 255A of the Water Act 2007 requires independent expert assessment of groundwater impact prior to considering any approval for mining. Approval of mining proposals within the Murray-Darling Basin is a state government responsibility, including the settling of any conditions to protect the environment. The Australian government considers that before such proposals with potential to impact on water resources are approved, they should be properly assessed, including their potential impact on third parties. This position is adequately reflected in the Water Act 2007, and it is very important here to distinguish between exploration activity on the one hand and mining activity on the other hand. Exploration activity in itself is unlikely to have any significant water resource impacts.

                    by leaveâ€”We have serious concerns with this. Why? First of all, this is a wedging motion. Reference to the member for New England and the consequence of that being in this motion means that it is more of a political statement, with political purpose, and that would go beyond their desire to actually achieve something here. This was foisted upon us without any chance of proper lobbying and proper consultation. This is an extremely important issue. We regard it as having the utmost importance. But we do not want to play this political game where people run into the chamber on something that there is obviously a wealth of concern about and then play wedging politics over a couple of days.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Also, it talks about Caroona, as if Caroona in the

                    </a>
                    is extremely important. But it is not the only important place. There are other parts of our nation that have the same concerns, which also deserve to be considered in motions such as these. So this issue is being taken to a form of base politics. This is an issue where we are trying as best we can on both sides of this chamberâ€”from the Labor Party to the Liberal Party to the National Partyâ€”to collect a group of people to go forward and achieve something and deliver something back. This has been turned into a wedging issue, taken to a very base form, which is detracting from the people who feel so exposed at this point in time on this issue. I think it is improper of the Greens to start playing with the lives of the people at Caroona and on the Haystack Plain without being genuine and authentic in the way that they would go about collecting support. It takes 39 votes in this chamber to get something through, not five.

There was an allegation made, not against Senator Joyce but against the whole of the National Party, that they were in the pockets of the mining industry. That is offensive, it is untrue and it is unparliamentary. Unless the leader of the Greens can substantiate that motion, I ask you to ask him to withdraw it.

                              I have seen some fairly robust debates in this place and I would consider that if you consider that to be unparliamentary then you should raise the issue at another time.

                              say that in this case, although Senator Brown is making a statement, that is purely a debating point and so there is no point of order. I call Senator Brown.

                               ; that is a very good ruling. There is a bit of thin skin amongst some colleagues sitting on my right in the National Party. Let me make this absolutely clear. I did not say that they were in the pockets of the mining industry. I said that they had collaborated with them on this issue. That is a problem for them. The difficulty with their motion is that they took the teeth out of itâ€”and this motion from the Greens puts them back in. It says that the federal government has the powers to ensure that this inherently dangerous mineral exploration under these prime crop lands in the

                                , I raise a point of order. Once more, Senator Brown has asserted that a notice of motion does something which has legislative effect. It does nothing of the sort. It is a notice of motion.

If you wish to correct the record and state your position there are other opportunities. Senator Brown is making a statement and he is entitled to use that sort of language in making a statement.

                                  Yes, and that is because it is appropriate, and I draw the attention of Senator Joyce and his colleagues to the standing orders. They might acquaint themselves with them. The fact is that we stand here in defence of the food producing regions of the whole Murray-Darling Basin. That is what the Greens are doing here. It is an important stand and this motion will determine whether other members of this Senate make such a strong stand themselves.
