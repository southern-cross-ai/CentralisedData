         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the bill is two-fold.  Firstly, it amends the
        <i>
         Federal Financial Relations Act 2009
        </i>
        to increase the general drawing rights authorising debits from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        Reform Fund.  Secondly, it amends the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Local Government
         </a>
         (Financial Assistance) Act 1995
        </i>
        to provide a mechanism for Government to pay additional amounts of the financial assistance grants to local government in the current year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Other government decisions taken in the 2009-10 Budget will require an increase in the general drawing rights limit for the 2008-09 financial year for the purposes of section 9 of the
        <i>
         Federal Financial Relations Act 2009
        </i>
        so that the necessary payments can be made. To do this, the bill will increase the general drawing rights authorising debits from the COAG Reform Fund for the purposes of making grants of general revenue assistance to the States in the financial year starting 1 July 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also seeks to amend the
        <i>
         Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1995
        </i>
        to increase the Commonwealth’s flexibility to provide additional funding in a particular year, including by, in effect, bringing forward funding from a future year, should economic or other special circumstances warrant such measures. This will enable the Government to bring forward one quarter of the years payments from 2009-10 to 2008-09, providing immediate funding to assist local governments address the impact of the global economic recession.

        <b>
         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Provide a temporary business tax break for Australian businesses using assets in Australia
         <i>
          .
         </i>
        </li>
        <li>
         Encourage business investment and economic activity.
        </li>
        <li>
         Build confidence in the Australian economy in the face of the global recession.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures in the Bill apply from 13 December 2008.  For many taxpayers, an enhanced incentive —in the form of a deduction at 30 per cent rather than 10 per cent —is available where they commit to investment before 30 June 2009.  A delay in delivery will create uncertainty in respect of business planning decisions, undermining the effectiveness of the measure in stimulating investment, economic activity and confidence.
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Purpose of the Bill
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill gives effect to a number of 2009 Budget measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill introduces a new $600 payment for carers, known as carer supplement.  Carer supplement will be an ongoing supplement available to a range of carers.  A person may receive more than $600 as his or her payment of carer supplement, if the person cares for more than one person, or receives more than one qualifying payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2008-09 financial year, carer supplement will be available to carers who were qualified for a qualifying payment on 12 May 2009.  From the 2010-2011 financial year, and on an ongoing basis, carer supplement will be available to carers who are qualified for a qualifying payment on 1 July.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also amends the indexation arrangements for the higher income free area for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTB" rel="nofollow">
         FTB
        </a>
        Part A, the FTB Part B income limit and the baby bonus income limit so that these threshold amounts are not indexed on 1 July of 2009, 2010 and 2011.  Indexation will again occur in accordance with the usual rules on 1 July 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage in the 2009 Winter sittings would enable the first payments of the new carer supplement to be made by 30 June 2009, as intended, and would ensure that the relevant threshold amounts are not indexed on 1 July 2009.
