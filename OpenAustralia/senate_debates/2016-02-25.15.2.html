         I move the following amendment that has been circulated in the chamber:

         (a) the Transport Security Amendment (Serious or Organised) Crime Bill 2016 the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation

         (b) the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill 2016, the provisions of the bill be referred immediately to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 12 May 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the first bill, there was a disagreement in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection" rel="nofollow">
          Selection
         </a>
         of

          Bills
         </a>
         Committee about the reporting date. We seriously believe that there needs to be a longer time for the consideration of an important bill, which we have had concerns about. It went through the House of Representatives very quickly, and we believe, because of the importance of the bill, that there should be an opportunity for it to go to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for what is not an extensive inquiry and for report back to the Senate by 11 May 2016.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other element—and I am sure that we will hear a lot of debate around this issue over the next period of time—relates to the important Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill. We know that there is a serious need for this particular process to be considered effectively by the Senate. We do not have the ability in the Senate to call for a further inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We know that there has been a proposal put before the Senate that there be a joint standing committee inquiry. Well, maybe it could be called an inquiry. It is a short-term discussion on Monday where a few people get together to have a chat about this process.
        </p>
        <p>
         No-one, including the senators who will be sitting around this chamber looking at legislation that will impact on our community in the future, could seriously consider that having a half-day chat on Monday will in any way give people the opportunity to have a full discussion about the important issues that are on the record about the way people in Australia will vote for the senators who will represent them. They will have no opportunity to look at the impacts and weigh up whether the process that was undertaken in the earlier meetings of the joint standing committee will be exactly the same as the attempt to rush this bill through this chamber next week, or whether, in fact, there are more arguments that should be taken into account.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whenever we move these amendments to the Selection of Bills Committee reports, I come back to the same point: what is this chamber about? This chamber should be about getting fulsome information, having the opportunity to hear from the community about how they feel about an important bill or regulation that has come into this place and then allowing, with the benefit of that information and the views of the people who wish to share in the debate, come to this chamber with the opportunity to exchange views, have debate and come up with a resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are many times when we will not agree—and this, I believe, is probably one of them—but that does not take away the need for effective consultation and discussion. Our position is very clear. The process that has been given to the Senate to consider this piece of legislation is inappropriate. It reflects the worst type of arrangement—the worst type of concern. We will hear discussion today and next week about shabby deals that are done, about motivations and about what will occur. But the best way to ensure that the community believes that this is the way we do operate is to not have the opportunity for further discussion on this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know—and I expect to hear this argument from the government—that the joint standing committee tabled reports in 2014 and earlier in 2015. However, we did not know, at that time, when this piece of legislation was going to be placed before either the House or the Senate. We only found out through the media that the minister was going to bring forward this piece of legislation. There was no form of effective discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
         This bill is important and, because there is a degree of confusion in the community, as there often is when people are looking at voting practices, the least we can do is have the opportunity of putting the legislation out to public comment again, putting the details of the legislation out there, so that people will understand exactly what their government is proposing that they do in relation to voting practices. That is not too much to ask. It is a simple request. It means that there is still an opportunity for consideration of the process in an effective way through the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee.
        </p>
        <p>
         If there had been a process of a longer, extensive discussion with the community through the joint standing committee, that would have been a good result. But that has been taken away. The opportunity has been removed. The only way that we can have the kind of consideration of the true details of this proposed process is to have an inquiry that would report by 12 May this year. That is the intent of our amendment, and we think that that would allow time for appropriate consultation.

          What we see here today is an attempt by a deeply divided Labor Party to frustrate the democratic process of this parliament. Let's be very clear. There is a part of the Labor Party, the backroom operators in the Labor Party, who do not like people across Australia to have the power to determine what they want to happen with their vote, what they want to happen with their preferences. The Labor Party is completely inconsistent in relation to this, because, as Senator Macdonald pointed out, we have a unanimous report from the Joint Standing
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Committee
          </a>
          on Electoral Matters asking the parliament to make these changes, to make these improvements—unanimous—which was delivered back in May 2014 and confirmed again in May 2015—the Labor Party members on that committee have actually been calling on the government to get on with it, to get it in place before the election.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is not just the shadow minister—who, when I last looked, was still the spokesperson for the Labor Party; the spokesperson for the Labor Party as recently as yesterday—asking us to go ahead and make these changes, even though his party had decided not to go along with them. The spokesperson for the Labor Party, the shadow minister with responsibility for this area, is telling us to get on with it—but it is also the member for Bruce, who, I understand at the time, if not anymore, was the deputy chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. This is what Mr Griffin said on 18 April 2015:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The government should be acting on these recommendations and, if they’re going to, they need to hurry up because they’re running out of time.
         </p>
         <p>
          Essentially, what is before the parliament is, for all intents and purposes, as
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gray" rel="nofollow">
           Gary Gray
          </a>
          himself says, about 80 to 85 per cent of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommendations. What we as the government have done is taken the recommendations, we have consulted widely in relation to them and we have formed the view on the best way forward. It is not 100 per cent of what was recommended, which is, of course, why the bill is going back to the committee for inquiry. It has already been referred to a parliamentary committee for inquiry and for report by 2 March. The Labor Party is deeply divided, so the Labor Party is keen to push this out.
         </p>
         <p>
          The reason we need to act now is that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Electoral Commission
          </a>
          have made very clear that they need about three months to manage an orderly implementation of these changes between the passage of this legislation and implementation on election. We think it is sensible to have a bit of spare capacity in relation to this. On 12 May 2015, Mr Gray, the official Labor Party spokesperson on electoral matters, said:

            , I think it is very important for the parliament to deal with these reforms, in responding to a report by the committee of the parliament that has inquired into these matters, and to put these reforms in place in an orderly fashion, in a timely fashion, and in a time that will enable the AEC to inform the community about the effect of the changes and how they empower them to direct their votes and their preferences according to their wishes, instead of having parties direct what happens to these preferences as a result of secret deals behind closed doors. That is what this reform is all about.

When he was faced with the considered advice of a highly regarded shadow minister for this area, on one hand, and the pushing and shoving of the backroom operators in his party, he went with the pushing and shoving of the backroom operators. He did not go with the public interest. He did not go with empowering voters to determine where they want their vote to go. He went with the backroom operators like Senator Conroy, and that is not a good reflection on Mr Shorten. He has failed his test of leadership and today is just another demonstration of it.

               I enjoyed that. No wonder Mr Morrison refers to you as the chief bedwetter, Senator Cormann, after that performance. What we are seeing today is the first serious attempt to disenfranchise Australians—the first serious attempt. That is exactly what is happening today. By Senator Cormann and the coalition and Senator Rhiannon and the Greens opposing this motion, it will be the first of what will become many times that Australians will be disenfranchised by this filthy deal. We all know the time frame for JSCEM. I went to the meeting the other day. The deal had been done. I walked in, sat down and was told: 'Here is what the agenda will be. It will be completed after a couple of hours. People have got a couple of days to put in submissions.' Many Australians would like to have their say on this proposed bill. Although the majority in this chamber have decided that they are not going to get a chance to submit and they are not going to be invited to have their say, I say to those Australians, 'Unfortunately, get used to it.'

                        I am very disappointed to see Senator Seselja completely mislead the Australian public on television this morning, just like Senator Cormann attempted to do a few seconds ago by

                        </a>
                        . Let me read to you the analysis circulated by Mr Gray from the Parliamentary Library in the last few days, because it bells the cat. It actually backs up the arguments of those of us opposing this legislation. So I am very disappointed to see completely misleading analysis about the impact of this bill being put forward by those opposite and some others.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Let me be very clear. It says: 'The obvious way to approximate the new system is to first look at how many quotas were achieved by each party as a primary vote. This will indicate how many seats the party is guaranteed to win, and may account for four or five of the six vacancies at a normal half Senate election.' There is nothing remarkable about that. But—and this is where it really matters that people do not just listen to the misleading commentary but read the document itself—'the remaining seats will be determined either via preference flows or by whichever party has the largest remainder after the full quotas are allocated to elected candidates.' So in other words: whatever preference flows happen or who has the highest remaining votes. It then goes on to make the following observation: 'The only parties that could reasonably be expected to transfer preferences at sufficient numbers to elect another candidate are the larger parties, the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
                         ALP
                        </a>
                        , the coalition and the Greens. Directing preferences consistently under the new system is only possible through how-to-vote cards, and only the larger parties have the infrastructure to distribute these to their supporters across the state.'
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        This is a ganging-up by two major parties in this country to exclude 3.2 million voters, who did not vote for us. So get used to being disenfranchised. This idea that these votes become informal is complete and utter bunkum; it is a complete and utter mislead of the Australian public, because what this paper says is that those votes will exhaust because they cannot pass through the system, and the only parties that can get elected are those who have machinery all across the country. So let us be very clear: this paper backs up the analysis that 3.2 million voters are going to get no representation in this chamber. The only people who will are: the Greens, who want 12 bums on their seats in this chamber; the opposition, and we do get an increase but we do not believe—

                                                            We heard Senator Cormann on his feet talking about the democratic process. Well, there is nothing democratic about the biggest changes to our electoral laws in 30 years being rammed through the Senate in a matter of days. There is nothing democratic about a sham inquiry—a show trial—that the government and Senator Rhiannon want to stage. There is nothing democratic about that.

                                                            I look forward to it because I anticipate and hope that everybody listening and watching will watch as the Greens—the great champions of transparency; the great champions of our democracy!—will vote with the Liberals to ensure this does not go to a proper inquiry. And, for all their fine words over years and years about the need for this chamber to properly inquire into legislation and to properly consider all of these matters, what we will see is Senator Lee Rhiannon, who has done this deal, and all of her colleagues walking over to this side to vote with the government to do over a proper inquiry.
                                                           </p>

                                                            The amendment moved by Senator Moore simply wants an inquiry to report by 12 May. This is not an unreasonable proposition.
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p>
                                                            This is the largest change in 30 years. They keep going on and saying, 'This has been debated and debated.' When was this legislation introduced into parliament? Was it Monday or Tuesday? It was this week—and they want to ram it through. They have rushed this so much that they have not even got the legislation right. The government had to bring amendments into the House because they forgot to put a provision in that the votes be counted on the night! 'Oops! No voting on the night—no counting on the night!' That is how rushed this is.

The government, of course, has made it perfectly clear what its agenda is here. The government wants to limit the level of scrutiny and debate about the biggest change this country has seen to the electoral act in a generation. It wants to do it in such a way as to maximise its opportunity to inflict their purge upon this Senate and it does do so in the name of democracy. It demonstrates just the sheer hypocrisy of these arrangements, which of course were entered into as a result of what the minister describes as 'secret deals behind closed doors'. They are an epitome of the secret deals done behind closed doors.
                                                                                 </p>

They are the words that the minister used in here. He wanted a bit of 'spare capacity', but what he really wants to do is to tell you the date of the election and he wants to tell you the date on which they can bring forward their purge of this parliament. The purge of this parliament is aimed at removing dissidents from this government's agenda. But, of course, the truth of the matter is that they are not just trying to get rid of the dissidents, they are trying to get rid of people who have been very loyal to this government, people who have in fact voted with this government for 99 per cent of the time. But their loyalties, their acquiescence to this government's agenda, is treated with a contempt—the contempt that this government have always had. Their purge is about removing people that actually have been voting with this government as well as those that are opposed to their rhetoric. Well, so be it, but we will not be going along with that proposition.
                                                                                 </p>

The minister himself says that this is not the same measure. I have just had a look at the bill and the general outline of the explanatory memorandum which clearly acknowledges that it is not the same proposition as the joint house committee. But then the minister says, 'Well, we'll have another joint house committee'. Of course, that committee would effectively be a morning tea so that they can endorse this quick and dirty arrangement that has been entered into between institutionalised Greens, who want to institutionalise their position within this parliament, and a conservative government that want to purge dissidents in this chamber. Of course, this is exactly what this is about.
                                                                                 </p>

It is not about openness and transparency. It is not about allowing people to have a look at the details of these measures. It is about exercising a political agenda that the government have in place so that they can pursue a political agenda to get rid of those that have a different view about the nature of the conservative policies that they are pursuing. Now, of course, we have the Greens to tell us how virtuous they are. They tell us how pure they are. Senator

He has sought to misrepresent himself as something pure and above the political fray. He has done nothing but to seek to ingratiate himself as the moderate voice of the Greens in this country. He has become a quisling of the Liberal Party, who is determined to do anything necessary to suck up to this government and to behave in a way which I think is quite dishonourable. What we have here before us is the raw exercise of political power. It does not have anything to do with transparency. It does not have anything to do with democracy. It is about exercising a purge of this chamber to secure the future political agenda of the hard right wing of the Liberal Party, and the Greens should be ashamed of themselves for being associated with it.

I think I probably qualify as a preference whisperer. I think a preference whisperer is somebody who actually understands how the system works. Those who do not know how the system works want to change it. I know who the preference whisperers are for the Labor Party, for the Greens, for the minor parties and, yes, indeed, for the Liberals. They are the ones who ring me up when I am doing preference deals for my party and say, 'Would you like to do a deal on preferences?' I can name names, if you would really like me too. I can name the names of the other preference whisperers.

It resulted in the Democrats votes going to Bob Brown and the Greens winning in Tasmania instead of the Labor Party. That is how it works. The point about it, of course, is that we are debating how much time the committee should take to understand what is being proposed. The assumption that even the government knows what it is proposing seems to me to be contradicted by the evidence. The evidence would suggest that they do not know.

Let me just recap where we are to try to limit any confusion in the chamber. Senator Bushby has moved a motion, Senator Moore has moved an amendment to the motion, Senator Fifield has moved an amendment to Senator Moore's amendment and there is a request to split the amendment to the amendment and put it into two questions. So the first question will be to substitute—

But I in fact do have a copy of the amendment to the amendment in writing, and it is signed and it does comply with the standing orders. As I have indicated, it has been requested that the question be separated. The first question is that, in paragraph (a), '11 May' be substituted with '10 March'. The question is that that motion be agreed to.
