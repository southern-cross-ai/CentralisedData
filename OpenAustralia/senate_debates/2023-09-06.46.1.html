        Fearmongering about climate change in schools and in the media is nothing short of child abuse. A study published in the
        <i>
         Lancet
        </i>
        about climate anxiety in children and young people surveyed 10,000 people aged from 16 to 25 years in 10 countries, including Australia. Everywhere, they were miserable and fearful. Three-quarters said that the future is frightening; 60 per cent were very worried or extremely worried about climate change; and more than 50 per cent reported feeling sad, anxious, angry, powerless and guilty.

        Climate alarmists should be ashamed. Not only do they exaggerate and mislead about the facts but they cancel anyone who corrects or questions them. Take Dr John Clauser, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize" rel="nofollow">
         Nobel Prize
        </a>
        laureate for physics in 2022. He was scheduled to present a seminar on climate models to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMF" rel="nofollow">
         IMF
        </a>
        in July, but his talk was 'postponed' after he said he didn't believe there is a climate crisis. Dr Clauser won the Nobel Prize for groundbreaking experiments with light particles, which have paved the way for quantum computing. You would think that, if someone this brilliant says that there is a problem with climate models, we should sit up and take at least some notice. But no. According to the activists, the science is, as we keep hearing, settled. Let me tell you something: science is never settled. It's always changing and it's always moving. If they had their way, these activists would have cancelled

        . Enough with the fear. Carbon is just plant food. Carbon is the very building block of life. People at home, you are the carbon that they want to reduce.
