        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research representing the Minister for Education, Senator Carr. Can the minister inform the Senate on the development of Australia’s new national curriculum, including the origins of this initiative, progress made to date and which learning areas are covered, and what the next steps are?

         I thank Senator Lundy for the question. Earlier this month, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education launched Australia’s first ever national school curriculum. This is the culmination of a process that began in 2008, when all Australian governments agreed that, if we want to maintain Australia’s productivity and living standards and if we are to ensure that each and every young Australian has access to a quality education, one of the most important instruments of delivering quality education is the Australian curriculum. This is another critical milestone in the education revolution.

             because the real problem is that you are much more comfortable burning them. And that is your attitude when it comes to education. We hear from the book burners their constant refrain—they are not in support of education in this country. So it is not surprising that they would resent any measure—

                     This is a reform for young Australians. It will increase their choices and their chances in life. It will enable them to discover their talents and to develop their skills. But it is also a major economic reform. It will help us accelerate innovation and lift productivity. It will give us the capable and adaptable workforce which we need to meet the competitive challenges of the decade ahead. It will mean that 80,000 students who move from state to state each year will no longer have to absorb a new curriculum. It will take us one step closer to creating a seamless national economy, a strong and efficient economy that can thrive in the global market place. It will provide the basis for this country to go forward and I would urge conservative parties of this country to come on board this major reform.

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister advise how the Australian curriculum will advance the government’s social justice agenda, and in what ways it will increase equality of opportunity and promote more equitable outcomes?

                       This government has made education a priority because we understand just how important it is for Australia’s prosperity. We also understand how important it is to create a just and equitable society. The Australian curriculum gives every student a fair go wherever they live. It gives every student a chance to acquire the skills and the knowledge needed to secure a decent job, to participate fully in community life, to develop their creative interests and to be an active citizen. It will increase opportunities and support for the quality outcomes in both teaching and learning. The net result will be a fairer, smarter and more prosperous Australia. This is an opportunity—which I know is available to all of you—for you to actually look at, study and make comment upon. I think you will find that, when you do, you will see the enormous benefits.
