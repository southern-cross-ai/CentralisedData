          Sorry, Senator Patrick; I was speaking with the minister for trade. I think I heard you ask if I have any response in relation to the matter on contracts. I don't have it in front of me, Senator, but let me just seek some advice from my virtual advisers and come back to the chamber when I'm able.

           -safe advisers, Minister! On top of that, I really would like to understand, when that contract comes around to being renewed, whether it would be opened up to Australian companies. There are, of course, provisions in the Commonwealth Procurement Rules to simply stick with the limited tender on the basis that you're already in contract.

                          I'll seek some advice from the Minister for Health on that, Senator. As we were discussing yesterday in the chamber, the process of contact tracing is a very intensive and time-consuming process. The officers who are engaged in that now are doing an excellent job, but this will most certainly enhance the ability for Australia to engage in that contact-tracing process.

If you wish to raise specific issues—and I'm not familiar with the code name that you used at the end of your question there—then I'll certainly raise that with the appropriate ministers.

                                I'll just briefly explain these amendments. As I said in my contribution on the second reading, we do acknowledge that there are significant protections on privacy contained in this legislation. In fact, it ought to set a minimum standard for government in terms of protecting people's personal information and private data. It's quite shameful that a number of other sets of data collected by the Commonwealth government are not protected to the extent that data collected by this app will be. However, as ought to be obvious by our amendments, we still believe that this bill could be strengthened and more robust protections placed around the data collected by the app, and that is what our amendments seek to do.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                The first amendment relates to the definition of COVID app data. I acknowledge the improvements that the government has made in the legislation that we're considering compared to the exposure draft which was originally released publicly. As a result of those amendments, the bill now covers registration data and has narrowed significantly what de-identified information is carved out from the definition. But the bill doesn't seem, on our view, to cover phone numbers, and it really should, because mobile phone numbers are in themselves personal information, because of the separate requirement under telecommunication laws for proof of identity when someone becomes a mobile phone subscriber. So our first amendment on sheet 8954 adds the person's phone number into the bill's definition of registration data.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Our second amendment, around decrypting the data store, will also extend prohibitions in the bill on decrypting data on communications devices to include all data that is stored in the national COVIDSafe data store and is not required for the purpose of tracing contacts of verified COVID-19 carriers.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                The next amendment is the creation of an additional COVIDSafe offence. Proposed section 94H makes it an offence to require someone to download the app, have the app operating or consent to uploading data from their communication device to the national COVIDSafe data store. This amendment will make it an offence to require someone to show you whether they have downloaded the app onto their communications device or not. This will further reduce the potential for this app to be used for discriminatory purposes.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                The next amendment is in regard to a breach of the biosecurity determination. This amendment would ensure that the protections from interference with privacy that will be provided by part VIIIA of the

                                 There is strong public interest in putting these privacy protections in place as soon as possible, so Labor will not be supporting any amendments that will further delay the passage of this bill. Prior to its introduction into the parliament, as I indicated yesterday in my speech on the second reading, Labor worked constructively with the government to improve the bill, and many of our suggestions to improve privacy protections have been incorporated into the version of the bill before us today.

                                  I indicate that Centre Alliance will be supporting the bill, but I will call out the logic of Senator Watt, in that there is no delay if you simply indicate support. You don't have to wait to make something perfect if something is made better by the movement of an amendment. We have also agreed amendments and worked constructively with the government in relation to this bill. But that shouldn't fetter this chamber trying to go a little bit further to make it a little bit more perfect.

                                     We are not supporting these amendments by Senator Patrick. But let me refer briefly to the second one, because that has been a genuine concern raised by Senator Patrick and others. I can advise that, since the release of the exposure draft, the government has in fact made amendments which we believe deal with this issue and achieve that balance between privacy and law enforcement investigations. The recent inclusion of clause 94U (4) allows that, where the police commissioner or the

                                     is satisfied that a privacy investigation will not jeopardise or otherwise affect a criminal investigation or proceeding the

                                     may continue their own investigation. Those amendments were developed in consultation with the office of the Australian Information Commissioner, and we believe that they do strike the right balance.

                                     I note there's also a time period proposed in the amendment—a 14-day time period. In our view it's not appropriate to place time restrictions on the DPP or a police commissioner to determine whether a separate investigation would have a prejudicial impact on a criminal investigation or proceeding.

                                        As I indicated previously, Labor will be opposing these amendments and further amendments. I refer to the comments I made in respect of the previous amendments. Labor believes that there is a strong public interest in putting these privacy protections in place as soon as possible. So Labor will not be supporting any amendments that will delay the passage of this bill, including these amendments.

                                         These amendments range across a number of provisions contained in this legislation. The first of these amendments creates an additional coercion offence. A number of behavioural economists and others have proposed making things like government payments, tax breaks and other financial rewards and financial disincentives dependent on people using the app. The exposure draft bill would not have captured these issues, but the bill, as changed by the government from the exposure draft to the one that we're currently considering, will catch many of those coercion concerns that the Australian Greens and Centre Alliance have.

                                        <p>
                                         However, the current provisions on coercion would still fail to capture non-commercial forms of coercion, such as those relating to, for example, family violence and abuse, and our amendment would make it clear that no form of coercion is legal or lawful under the act. This includes discounts, payments or other financial incentives that may be contingent on a person downloading or using the app, and it would also make it clear that people aren't allowed to be asked to show that their mobile device has the app loaded, in order to avoid discriminatory or abusive treatment.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The second of these amendments relates to privacy verification of data deletion. As an independent regulator, the Information and
                                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
                                          Privacy Commissioner
                                         </a>
                                         has discretion as to how and what duties they execute under the powers of this bill. This means that the Information and Privacy Commissioner's final report may or may not contain or report on whether they are satisfied that the data store administrator has complied with the legislation regarding compliance and deletion of the COVIDSafe app and its data. So this amendment will include provisions requiring that the Information and Privacy Commissioner inspect and verify that the data deletion obligations at the end of the app's period of operation have been complied with by requiring the data store administrator to confirm and report to the commissioner that the data has been deleted as required by the app. The amendment provisions will also require that the Information and Privacy Commissioner provide a report to the minister on compliance with deletion obligations as soon as is practicable and for this report to be tabled in both houses of parliament by the minister within three sitting days of receiving it.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The next amendment goes to the end of the COVIDSafe data period. This is quite a significant amendment because we do have concerns with the way that the government has approached the sunset provisions of this legislation, which is effectively to leave it in the hands of the health minister in terms of when the operation of COVIDSafe ends and the data is deleted. This amendment will ensure that the act and all activities covered by the act—including, use, communication and storage of COVIDSafe data—sunset as soon as the human biosecurity emergency declaration ends or by the trigger currently in the act, whichever is sooner and also provide that the collection of data for the COVIDSafe app and the state of emergency under the Biosecurity Act all cease at the same time. This is aimed at ensuring the app and the collection of data do not exceed the declared state of emergency under the Biosecurity Act.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         I just want to speak to this at a little bit more length because the dataset collected by this app does, I think everyone would acknowledge, contain potentially very sensitive personal information. We're obviously living through a global pandemic, and this bill, I believe, will pass through this chamber with unanimous support. But if the pandemic has eased off to the extent that the declaration of a human biosecurity emergency is over, there is simply no reason for this data to still be maintained. The minister can extend the declaration if he wishes, but if we're through this pandemic to the extent that the declaration ends, I cannot possibly see how the government has an argument to keep this app in operation and to retain the extremely sensitive personal information that is collected by this app. So this amendment is critical, in our view, and it links the sunset of this bill, once it becomes an act, to the end of the declaration.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         I'll say again: if the emergency declaration lapses and if we're through the pandemic to the extent that the government does not believe we need to be living under a human biosecurity emergency declaration, the Australian Greens—and I won't speak for Centre Alliance, but they are co-sponsoring this amendment—believe that there is no reason that the data that is collected by this app should remain. We believe that it should be deleted in order to minimise the chances of this information being hacked or the information otherwise being made public or provided to people that it should not be provided to.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The next amendment is around the privacy verification of data deletion, and, again, as an independent regulator, the Information and Privacy Commissioner has discretion as to how and what duties they execute under the powers of this bill. That means that the Information and Privacy Commissioner's final report may or may not report on whether they are satisfied that the data store administrator has complied with the legislation regarding compliance and deletion of the COVIDSafe app and its data. This amendment will include provisions requiring the Information and Privacy Commissioner to inspect and verify that the data deletion obligations at the end of the app's period of operation have been complied with by requiring that the administrator confirm and report to the commissioner that the data has been deleted as required by the app and for the Information and Privacy Commissioner to provide a report to the minister on compliance with deletion obligations as soon as is practicable and for this report to be tabled in both houses of parliament by the minister within three sitting days of receiving it.

                                        <p>
                                         The final amendment on this sheet relates to the reporting period. In the version of the bill that we're debating, the government has introduced biannual reporting on the operation and effectiveness of the COVIDSafe app. Given the relatively short lifetime planned for this app—or, we hope it will be a short lifetime—and the understandable concerns people hold regarding the privacy of their data being held in the national data store, we think it appropriate that this data be reported on every three months or within one month of making a determination under section 94Y.

                                           Again I refer to the comments I made in respect of the previous amendments. Labor believes there is a strong public interest in putting these privacy protections in place as soon as possible, and so Labor will not be supporting this or any other amendments that will delay the passage of this bill.

                                            I won't unduly hold up the Senate but I just wanted, as Senator Patrick has done, to respond to Labor's position. I note and pay credit to them that they haven't been disparaging of these amendments in any way. If the Senate was minded to amend this legislation, it could just be put down to the other place today. I think it unlikely in extreme that that would cause any significant or even meaningful delays to the passage of this legislation. I've seen this approach by the

                                            I would urge the Labor Party to not close its mind to further amendments on the floor of the Senate. That's the job that we're chosen to do by the people that vote for us. It is part of our job as legislators to try on the floor of this Senate and of the other place to make improvements to legislation which comes to this parliament. We genuinely believe that if our amendments proposed today were accepted by the Senate it would make this a more robust piece of legislation. It would allow the many people in this country who have concerns about how this app will operate to have an increased level of confidence and may in fact lead to an increased rate of download of this app. We do commend our amendments to the Senate.
