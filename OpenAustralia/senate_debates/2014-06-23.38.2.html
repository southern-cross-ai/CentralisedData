        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Will the minister inform the Senate why it is important that the government disrupts the evil trade of people smuggling by removing the incentive for people to board leaky boats and attempt to enter Australia illegally?

          When you capitulate to the people smugglers you do exactly what those opposite did, and that is why we had the interjections coming to me before I stood up, saying, 'You want to talk about the boats.' Yes, we do, because we made a commitment to the Australian people that we would stop the boats, and that is exactly what we have done.
         </p>
         <p>
          When you capitulate to the people smugglers you end up with the disaster that was the former Rudd and Gillard government's border protection policy. Let us remind ourselves again of that disaster: in excess of 50,000 people coming here illegally by boat and in excess of 1,000 people confirmed dead at sea. At the height of the Labor Party's policy failure in July 2013, there were 10,201 people in held detention and that included 1,992 children. Of course, there is the financial cost to the Australian taxpayer: in excess of $11.5 billion. If you want to talk about the budget, there is a figure that you do not want to talk about. In stopping the boats, we have managed to save the Australian taxpayer and to save the budget in excess of $2.5 billion in this portfolio. That is something that those on the other side in their dreams would never be able to do. As a result of 186 days since there was a successful people-smuggling venture to Australia, we are stopping the boats. This government has the resolve to do that and that is exactly what we are doing.

           , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister advise the Senate what the coalition government is doing to address Labor's legacy case load of more than 30,000 asylum applications left unprocessed by the former government?

            Step 1 is you actually stop the problem. That is exactly what we have done by implementing Operation Sovereign Borders. Despite everything that the other side said could never be done, we have done it.
           </p>
           <p>
            Step 2 is that you end up dealing with the legacy case load left by the former Rudd and Gillard Labor governments. Many in Australia do not know that approximately 30,000 people were dumped into the community by the former government and left to languish there with their claims not even being processed. That is right: they were dumped into the community by those on the other side. Labor and the Greens, in rejecting or disallowing the temporary protection visas that we brought in to deal with the legacy case load, have caused nothing more and nothing less than needless worry to those who just want their claim processed.

                   Senator Cash, resume your seat. I have asked Senator Cash to resume her seat. She is entitled to be heard in silence, senators on my left. Senator Cash, continue.

                    You resort to personal insult when you cannot debate policy. Those on the other side are left with nothing more and nothing less than attacking us on this side personally. Guess what? We are big enough and we are ugly enough to take on board your attacks. We will not be deterred.
