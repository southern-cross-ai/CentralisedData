        My question is to the Minister for Women, Senator Gallagher. In asking it, I acknowledge the early educators, disability workers and hospo workers from the United Workers Union in the gallery today. Welcome. Can the minister give an update on how the government is working across the parliament to progress recommendations from the

         I thank Senator Walsh for the question and welcome those representatives from the unions joining us today. I also acknowledge Kate Jenkins, Kerri Hartland and the team supporting the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce. Of course, Kate Jenkins is the author of the

         report and its findings that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament House
         </a>
         was lagging behind the rest of the country when it came to a safe workplace for staff and for women in particular. It was all there: gender inequality with a lack of women in senior roles; a lack of accountability in systems; a work hard, play hard culture that left some, particularly young staff and young women, vulnerable to exploitation and sexual misconduct; and high levels of power indiscretion in relation to employment, combined with insecure employment. I would like to thank all of those current and former Parliament House staff who came forward to talk about their experiences working in parliament. Many of those experiences are harrowing, and speaking out must have required enormous strength and bravery.

         A centrepiece reform from the report is the establishment of a new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR" rel="nofollow">
          HR
         </a>
         entity body for parliamentarians and their staff to provide independent advice and support and drive an agenda of professional development and best practice, training and continuous improvement for staff. The recommendation flowed from the
         <i>
          S
         </i>
         <i>
          et the standard

         report, and staff across the parliament have been consulted on how this new HR body should operate in practice. I would like to acknowledge the work of Meg Brighton and her team in the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, which has made such a difference in such a short amount of time. We know staff trust it, they like using it, and it's been a really welcome addition to the infrastructure here.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cultural change in parliament will only happen when we all work together. I would like to acknowledge Senators Farrell, Hume, Davey and Waters for their work and joining us on the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce.

            I thank Senator Walsh for the question. Ensuring our parliament reflects the community we serve is critical to becoming a model workplace. The parliament is a different place from a year ago, with the highest number on record of women across both houses: 38.4 per cent in the House of Representatives and 56.6 per cent in the Senate. There are now 10 women in cabinet, the highest number ever to hold positions in an Australian cabinet. At the heart of the continuing work to become a model workplace is the experience of staff. Thank you to all who continue to advocate for change and to your respective unions. Labor strongly supports the creation of a staff advisory body to support the multiparty Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce and is committed to ensuring that staff voices are heard.
           </p>

            Yesterday the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Standards tabled their report on codes of conduct. This represents a historic milestone for the parliament, and I acknowledge the Deputy Speaker in the other place for her leadership as chair of the joint select committee.

               We strongly believe that parliament, and the workplace in parliament, should lead the country on culture and standards. We also want to attract the best and brightest to work on

               , we want to retain them and we want to ensure that they have a positive work experience in this building. Too many bright and hardworking people have left with their careers cut short and their mental health affected after experiencing bullying and sexual harassment when working in Parliament House. We will only achieve the best outcomes for the Australian people if we have a safe and supportive workplace for those who serve the public.

              <p>
               The parliament has already passed laws to clarify workplace protections and make clear that the age discrimination and disability discrimination acts apply to
