        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, prior to the election, Labor MP Josh Burns promised Jewish Australians' interests would be protected 'irrespective of who forms government', and the now Attorney-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Dreyfus
        </a>
        , claimed on matters to do with Israel that Australia 'spoke with one voice'. Yesterday, though, Australia Israel Labor Dialogue co-convener Adam Slomin said your unilateral decision to change Australia's longstanding position on Israel and the disputed territories:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … places Australia as an outsider and not a cooperative supporter for both parties to reach a two-state solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         Zionist Federation
        </a>
        of Australia and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Council
        </a>
        of Australian Jewry jointly described your decision as 'inaccurate, ahistorical and counterproductive' and that it put a peace agreement further out of reach. Minister, can you cite precisely what motivated your government to make this unilateral change at this time other than to appease Labor's factions ahead of next week's party conference?

         Thank you, Senator Birmingham, for the question. I would say to him, first, what I said yesterday—that we are guided in our approach to the

          <p>
           That's actually my view. What I outlined yesterday to Senator Fawcett—and I appreciate Senator Fawcett would have different views about some of the issues—is the set of positions that we have ensured. The government has international fora, and domestically, which are consistent with that principle.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government was also deeply concerned—and I would hope that all in this place would be—about the alarming trends we have seen in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
            Middle East
           </a>
           in recent times. I would make the point that these trends are significantly reducing the prospects of peace. We are seeing escalating violence and the loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives, civilian lives.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_UN" rel="nofollow">
            The UN
           </a>
           reports that more Israeli and Palestinian civilians have died as a result of violence in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank" rel="nofollow">
            West Bank
           </a>
           this year than in any full year over the last decade.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
            NGO
           </a>
           s also report—and this is relevant—that more settlement units have been advanced in the first half of this year than in any full year in the last decade. I would've hoped that Senator Birmingham and the opposition would share our concerns that have been expressed about changes to the judicial system and to the planning regime which would enable further settlements. So I make those points. That is the context and those of the overriding principles of how we approach these issues.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Birmingham also said this is inconsistent with longstanding Australian policy. That is simply incorrect. If you look at policy as articulated by previous governments—until, most recently, partway through the last government—our position is consistent.

              government and an Australian Labor minister who moved the motion, that you would recall, in terms of the establishment of Israel—or, if not moved it, spoke to it. I would make this point about consistency. Consistency is important. What we will not do is tell one thing to Australians and another thing to the international community, which is what you did. On the one hand you continued to support

                 Before I call the minister I'm going to remind both sides of the chamber to—

                 Senator McKenzie, I am addressing the chamber. I've asked for silence while the minister continues her response.

                  (—) (): I think anybody who has observed the way I have approached national conference on these issues over five years would know I am very consistent on these issues and I will be continuing to assert the same position to all parts of the Labor Party that I have asserted since pre 2018. I think people know that. Some people do not like that position and some people do but that is the view I have. But in terms of consistency, I would like to remind you that in relation to the phrase 'occupied territories' in 1981 Fraser's foreign minister,
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Street" rel="nofollow">

                  </a>
                  , expressed the government's opposition to annexation of occupied territories including

                  </a>
                  . The same position was articulated by Foreign Minister Hayden and Prime Minister Keating. Foreign Minister Downer also stated Australia's support of UN resolutions on the applicability of the

                  </a>
                  to the occupied territories and it goes on. We are consistent and we are principled on this issue and on all issues.
