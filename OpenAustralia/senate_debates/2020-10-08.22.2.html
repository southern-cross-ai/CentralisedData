         I think Senator Gallagher will respond that the opposition wishes to vote against the guillotining of the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020, but thank you for your confidence. I propose that items (1)(a)(v) and paragraphs (b) and (c) be put separately, noting that if the opposition succeed in defeating those, it would require an amendment to paragraph (d).

            I'll just speak briefly following Senator Wong's contribution. Subject to what Senator Wong has outlined, the opposition's position on the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COV" rel="nofollow">
             COV
            </a>
            ID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, which is part of this motion, and sitting on Friday to deal with those bills, is that the opposition will be supporting that.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our view is that the government has decided to wrap up a range of tax measures in one omnibus bill and required that it all be put together. That does not allow us to separately deal with the rather significant tax measures that are included in this bill, which we would prefer to have the time to work through. However, we will not stand in the way of the income tax cuts, which we have been calling for since August last year, to be brought forward and for that money to flow as quickly as possible into the pockets of working Australians around this country. As I said, our preference would be that the government didn't choose to play politics and we are able to deal with these bills separately and allow for longer consideration of the large tax measures, including those that cost $27 billion, but that isn't possible. We're not in a perfect world; we're not in a world where we can choose some of these elements. As such, we will support the passage of those bills as outlined in the motion through debate on Friday.

We will not even have time to go to the committee stage and debate the ream of amendments that this government sent through just an hour ago. Shame on Centre Alliance and shame on

             for some petty deals that they've done, which Minister Birmingham defined as 'minor technical amendments to this legislation'. You've been taken for a massive ride, you know? You've fallen hook, line and sinker for government spin. You've been totally duped. There's nothing else to say about this. Some of the things that you want are not even in the legislation, so you've said, 'Fingers crossed, and hope for the best.'

              I do know what I'm talking about. There might be some secret deal that this government is not letting us in on, but it doesn't even have the decency to let us talk about something which is going to affect all future generations of Australians, which is going to take away the right of education from generations of Australians.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is how bad you are. If you think this bill is so great, then let's talk about it. Let's talk about the amendments that you're putting up. Let's talk about our amendments that we want to put up to this bill. Yes, it's a terrible bill. There are some absolutely horrific aspects of the bill that we want to move amendments to. Why won't you let us talk about this? Because you know that this is a bad bill. You know that this bill is going to disadvantage Indigenous people. It's going to disadvantage women. It's going to disadvantage first in family. It's going to disadvantage regional Australians. It's going to disadvantage people living in the cities. It's going to disadvantage every single person in Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              The amendments that you're moving to this bill are in the same vein as the budget that you have delivered—putting more money into the pockets of rich people. One of the amendments that I quickly had a look at—I haven't even had a chance to look at the others—gives a discount to people who pay fees upfront. Who are those people who are going to pay fees upfront? I think Senator Lambie said it exactly like it is: it is the rich who can afford to pay $14,000 a year. You're giving a tax break to them yet again. That's what it is.

              Absolutely! That's what democracy is about. You are sitting here crushing the democratic rights, the democratic freedoms, of people in this country. But you're also crushing democracy overall when you try and guillotine us from speaking on things, from debating things, that will actually put up a very bleak future for Australians. That's what this bill is going to do. You don't even understand that. It's cutting research funding. You know that the money that you announced in the budget goes nowhere near the billions of dollars of research funding that this bill actually cuts out. These are the people who have already lost their jobs in droves. They're not coming back. Our researchers are not coming back, and we need those people to come out of this recession, to come out of this pandemic—

                  . Thousands upon thousands of students and uni staff have contacted all of us sitting on this side, and all of you sitting on that side, telling us how horrible, how bad and how horrific the consequences of this bill are going to be. Yet obviously, on that side, it's fallen on deaf ears. Well, it hasn't fallen on deaf ears on this side. So we still want to continue on and talk about these things and try and change some of the things that are in this bill. We want to debate your amendments. We want to see what you are amending. We want to have a chance to look at what they are and give you the chance to defend them. But you can't defend them—that's what the issue is here. You cannot defend a single thing in this terrible bill. It is indefensible what's going on in this bill. Shame on all of you! We will absolutely be opposing your guillotine motion. Shame!

                   Here we go: the fix is in—a dirty, secret deal between the government and the Labor Party to jam the tax cuts through this Senate with no inquiry whatsoever. What we can tell from this dirty deal is that $18 billion of government expenditure, based on a flawed, trickle-down, neoliberal model that we know is not going to work, is now going to be jammed through this Senate with no opportunity to scrutinise the details whatsoever. Labor isn't even bothered to go through the motions of being an opposition party in this place. What is actually the point of the Labor Party anymore?
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Bringing forward the stage 2 tax cuts will mean that the millionaires get $2,500 a year, the working poor get 250 bucks a year and, if you haven't got a job, you just line up for your regular kick in the teeth from the neoliberals in this place. The Labor and Liberal parties are trying to con this country and con Australian people into thinking these tax cuts are going to trickle down. Well, I'll tell you something: it's been 40 years since Hawke and Keating, while we've been waiting for trickle-down to work, and the people at the bottom are dying of thirst.

                    My contribution to the discussion on this motion will be very brief. This is quite a lengthy motion. It's clearly been prepared in advance, but not much notice was given. I just point that that is a little bit disrespectful. In relation to the gag motion, I'll quote a tweet from Rebekha Sharkie from the other place on 3 September 2020. She said:

                   <p class="italic">
                    Earlier this week Govt gagged debate on the Higher Ed Bill which meant few of us got to speak. … This is not democracy.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I ask Centre Alliance to reflect on that when they vote in relation to this gag motion on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I point out that, having formerly been a member of the Centre Alliance party, the rules in relation to gagging of debates were basically that they would never gag a second reading and they would only gag the committee stage in circumstances where there was obvious filibustering. What this gag will mean is that genuine questions that were to be asked will not be asked. We will not be able to get clarification on elements of the bill where there is uncertainty, and that may also affect later interpretations in any proceedings. It's an awful thing to do. We should not be gagging debate on the higher education bill.

                       I will now put the motion moved by Senator Cormann, except for the following clauses, which will be put subsequently at the request of the opposition: clauses (1)(a)(v), (1)(b) and (1)(c).
