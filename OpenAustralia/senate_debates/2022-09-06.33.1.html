       <p>
        I got into politics to help people through good government, not to judge them. However, there are some things that government should not be involved in, and that is especially so when it comes to parenting. If my children have issues with their sexual identity, my wife and I will deal with that, either by ourselves or with a properly trained psychologist outside of the classroom.
       </p>
       <p>
        The legal age of consent in this country is 16. There is no need to be discussing or promoting sexual orientation or identities in the classroom. I don't pay taxes for the government to fund the education system to push indoctrination. Don't kid yourself. Indoctrination does influence our children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once you get to 18, you can do whatever you like. It's your business. But the government doesn't get to co-parent our children. That is solely the role of the parent. So I was surprised the other day when I was told that my son, who has only just turned 10, can wear purple socks to school to show his support for diversity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had another constituent contact me to ask further questions about this and he wants to promote the point of this. It was to promote supportive, safe, empowering and inclusive environments for lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and gender diverse, intersex, queer and questioning young people.

         Thank you, Senator Rennick. The time for two-minute statements has expired. We're now going to move to questions without notice.
