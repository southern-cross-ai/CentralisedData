        In moving these amendments, the opposition are not in any way seeking to impede the passage or introduction of the government scheme. As we have flagged in the second reading debate, the opposition are concerned that the government is seeking to give business in effect the role of being the PPL paymaster. We are therefore seeking these substantive amendments to extend the role of the Family Assistance Office in administering the Paid Parental Leave scheme indefinitely. This measure would make ongoing use of the taxpayer investment in the establishment of the necessary payment and operating systems beyond the initial six months. We urge the government to embrace the coalition’s amendments in order to avoid the imposition of unnecessary and unjustified cost, additional regulatory burden and the compliance risks to the small business community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think anyone who has been watching the debate in this chamber about the PPL legislation would be well aware that the opposition have been very responsible in the approach we have taken to amendments that have been put forward. Where amendments have been put forward which may have given effect to part of the coalition’s own policy but where it is clear that there was no prospect of the government agreeing with such amendments in the House, we have not supported those amendments. We have been at pains to do everything we possibly can to facilitate the passage of this legislation. However, the Senate, and the opposition in particular, has an important role to scrutinise legislation, and where we see what we feel to be a genuine problem that can easily and readily be addressed then we think it is the responsible and appropriate thing to move an amendment to that effect. It is the opposition’s hope that the government will seriously consider the amendments we are putting forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        In moving these amendments I want to acknowledge the ceaseless advocacy in this area—that being the impact of the government’s legislation on business—of Mr Billson, the shadow minister for small business, and Senator Boswell, who is also a ceaseless advocate in this place for small business. We genuinely hope that the government will consider these amendments.

         I was hoping a quorum would have been called as a common courtesy. These amendments are similar to the amendments
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_First" rel="nofollow">
          Family First
         </a>
         put to this chamber. This is all about making sure that small businesses and businesses are not inconvenienced. The Family Assistance Office is already involved in handling paid parental leave payments for people who have worked fewer than 12 months in one business. They are already handling it, they are already taking care of it, and they are already doing this sort of stuff, so why would you duplicate and have another set of people worrying about how to make these payments? The Family Assistance Office is already going to have to do it for some. I think it is unnecessary red tape that will be placed on businesses, especially small businesses. These amendments obviously make sense and, seeing as they are Family First amendments, and the opposition’s ones are similar to ours, I am hoping common sense prevails. These amendments make sure that the Family Assistance Office is doing the hard work and not leaving the burden and red tape to small businesses. I think it is an impost that we can certainly do without placing on them. The Family Assistance Office is the right place for it to take place in.

            for their contributions. Unfortunately the government does not support removing employer involvement in the Paid Parental Leave scheme. We want to ensure that women maintain a strong connection with the workforce by receiving their government funded parental leave pay through their employer, as they would receive any other work entitlement. Only nine per cent of all businesses will be involved in Paid Parental Leave in any given year and only three per cent of small businesses. To help employers prepare for the scheme, the role of employers in providing government funded parental leave pay will be phased in over the first six months to align with the new financial year. Parental leave pay will be paid in accordance with an employer’s normal pay practices and the employees’ usual pay cycle. The design of the government scheme as recommended by the

              <p class="italic">
               An obligation of an employer to pay a person parental leave pay under this Act is in addition to any other obligation the employer may have in relation to the person, however that other obligation might arise (including, for example, under another law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, or an industrial instrument (however described)).
              </p>
              <p>
               This amendment seeks to address a question raised at the Senate inquiry as to whether the government scheme was offering entitlements that were additional to those that already exist or whether employers could use the government funding to offset their own schemes. This amendment removes any possible uncertainty over the issue. It makes it clear that an employer cannot use parental leave pay under this bill to meet their obligation to provide employer funded paid parental leave under an industrial agreement. This amendment simply confirms that the government’s

                   249. The amendment which was circulated today was, in fact, drafted on the 11th of this month, so I am just wondering at the outset if the minister could explain what the delay was between the drafting of this amendment on the 11th, as is printed at the bottom, and its circulation today, the 16th—some five or six days later.

                     That is not particularly illuminating but, given the delay and our concerns about this amendment, this amendment really gives rise to a fear that we had, which was flagged in the second reading debate, that the government would ultimately try to set up small business to pay for and fix up the shortcomings of the government’s own flawed scheme—that this is the top-up amendment, if you like, to try to top the scheme up. As indicated, we do not want to be difficult on this but, as there were five days between the drafting of this and its circulation, and it was only circulated today, I ask the minister if this particular amendment could be pushed down the list and a briefing provided for the opposition so that we can get a better understanding as to the working of these proposed amendments.

                           has concerns about the amendment, and had concerns at the time that they had the amendment relayed to them just before lunch time today. I find your reassurance somewhat at odds with my understanding of ACCI’s position. I look forward to hearing with whom the minister did consult at ACCI and the basis of the minister’s reassurance that ACCI and, indeed, AiG are not concerned about the amendment.

                            The government is happy to withdraw the amendment. This amendment was put in place to provide certainty to employers. It came out of the recent inquiry, but it is not legally required. So if coalition senators wish to oppose it then we are happy to withdraw it.

                              I did indicate earlier in this committee process that the Greens would withdraw our amendment relating to these issues because the government had subsequently adopted their own solution to the issue and put forward their own amendment. If the government are now going to withdraw their amendment then I will recirculate the Greens amendment. This is a very important issue and I do not want to see the government backtrack on this. This is a clear indication—it was spoken about in the Senate inquiry, and it has been spoken about since by the minister—that there needs to be a much clearer direction given in this legislation to ensure that employers do not cut their existing entitlements simply because this parental leave scheme is coming in. Please, Minister, I would urge you not to withdraw; otherwise, I will put mine back on.

                               As I indicated previously, we are not looking to cause a difficulty here. This amendment was only circulated today. There may not be an issue with it, but I think it would facilitate the deliberation of this chamber if the government were prepared to agree to a briefing for the opposition on this amendment. If this amendment can be pushed down the list then I think that would expedite matters. There is only another five minutes before we finish dealing with

                                I get the feeling that we are heading towards a filibuster from coalition senators which I think government senators find disappointing, especially given some of the earlier comments from Senator Fifield. Considering the comments from Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Fifield, we are happy to leave the bill on the table, provide a briefing to coalition senators tomorrow at 9 am and continue with the debate.

                                 I would like to respond to the minister’s suggestion that the opposition is filibustering. In case there be any concern about that I am happy to take whatever time is provided to ask the minister questions of substance about this amendment if he needs to be reassured of our genuineness in wanting to be briefed about it.

                                   I thank the minister for offering a briefing and I want to indicate that if this amendment had been circulated in good time or a briefing had been provided previously then we could have avoided this situation. If the opposition were seeking to cause difficulty here then we would have said that we would oppose and divide on the amendment until such time as a briefing was provided. We are not doing that. So, Minister, thank you for the offer of a briefing and we look forward to that tomorrow.

                                     I was going to announce that I would be withdrawing this amendment based on the fact that the postponed amendment from the government deals with it. The third issue that the government has picked up on that the Greens have been talking about is the importance of having a legislated review of the scheme. I am thankful that the government has taken this on board. I hesitate to withdraw this amendment because I would hate to think that tomorrow morning we might come back and the government’s amendment has changed. I seek leave to postpone Greens amendment (11) on sheet 6111.

                                     This amendment goes to the fact that we want some data collected through this process so that once the review happens we have access to data to see how this scheme has impacted on workplaces, women who have taken the leave and parents who have access to the scheme, and we ensure that we can track how the scheme is rolling out. There have been a lot of comments made about the fact that this scheme is not perfect; that it is a block which needs to be built upon. The best way of us ensuring that we get that right is to have an audit of the issues it faces.
