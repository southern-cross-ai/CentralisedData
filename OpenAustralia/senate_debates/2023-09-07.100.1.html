        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. In defending the government's policy of protecting a certain carrier and slugging travellers with high-cost airfares, the Prime Minister has repeatedly claimed, 'In Australia we have the most open aviation market in the world, bar none.' He said that on ABC radio on 31 August. Again, on Sky News, he said, 'It, in fact, is the most competitive market in the world.' The government's two-month-late

         for the question, and I don't see any inconsistency in those statements at all. But I am happy to talk about the issue of aviation and competition and the fact that we are cleaning up a mess that we've inherited, yet again. Let's think of all of the areas that we are actually having to deal with after a decade of failure. I don't even know what you were all doing when you came to work, but it obviously was not very much, because we inherited an energy crisis, we had pressures in health, we had pressures in infrastructure and we had pressures in aviation.

          President, I think this is a very clear case of direct relevance and I'm sure—I could almost feel it in your body language—that, if I hadn't stood when I did, you were about to draw the minister to the question. In the first 30 seconds, she decided to pivot purely to a commentary on the previous government, having been asked a question that solely covered statements of the Prime Minister about the aviation market and a quote from the
          <i>
           Aviation green

          </i>
          and sought clarification of the consistency between those statements. The question was entirely, exclusively about the aviation market and its competitiveness or its concentration.

              To Senator Watt's point: it is not in order for a minister if they have answered the question to then speak about any other topic of zero relevance to the question they were asked. An answer to a question in its entirety needs to be directly relevant. Context, as previous Presidents have ruled, can be provided, but the minister was very plainly not providing context to a question specifically about the aviation market and its competitiveness.

                      As I said, this aviation green paper is to essentially look at how we create and deliver the best aviation sector that we can both internationally and domestically. It's because of the failure of the former government that we are starting this work now, because it hasn't been done and it wasn't done in their term. It is right that we have the green paper, we go out and have further consultations, and then there will be a white paper to ensure that we get the best outcomes across the board. That's for the aviation industry itself. It's for consumers. It's to ensure that we are ensuring competition and promoting competition where we can in a complex industry that operates—

                        on 29 August 2023 the assistant minister for competition, Dr Leigh, said: 'I look to Europe with its range of low-cost carriers and see what looks like an even more competitive ecosystem. So moving us towards that I think is a long-term goal.' Minister, who is correct? Is the Prime Minister right when he says that Australia has the most competitive market in the world or is the competition assistant minister correct?

                           Well, they are. I know you can just put them together and put your spin on it. We are looking at ways to improve competition. That's why we've got the work that the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer are doing in the Treasury. It's why we're looking at the green paper and then the white paper. There are clearly and obviously areas where everyone in the aviation industry wants to see if there's room to improve.

                           This government will actually talk to people. We will negotiate, we will consult and we will deliver a plan—unlike those opposite, who for two years sat on reports and reviews that they inherited, did nothing and provided no direction. That is not the position this government takes. We're doing the work. We're talking with all of those involved. And we will deliver the best aviation system that this country deserves and expects.

                             I'd like to thank the minister for giving some context that she actually backs the green-paper commentary—that there is room for improvement, that we are a concentrated aviation market and that we do need to get more competitive—in direct contrast to the Prime Minister's public statements. Minister, why is the Albanese government protecting a major airline whilst punishing Australian travellers with high-cost airfares in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis?

                              We're doing no such thing. I think you allude to the decision by the transport minister that she made around Qatar's request for extra flights. I would point out—I know it's convenient to ignore it, and we've gone through it in this place and we've gone through it in the House—that we have numbers of flights being increased by a number of international carriers. We have had over 1,800 international flights coming in and out of Australia in the last week. Flights are increasing, capacity on those flights is increasing and we have existing international carriers that are adding flights and adding capacity on those flights. So I completely reject the assertion in Senator

                              's question. The aviation industry is recovering post-COVID. More flights are coming, more seats are available and we will see prices come down.
