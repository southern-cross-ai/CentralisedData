        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Over the last three months, the Iranian regime has been accused of killing more than 300 civilians standing up for human rights, particularly Iranian women and girls. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Iranian Australian
        </a>
        community has been calling for weeks for the Australian government to hold the Iranian regime to account. Has the government now applied any targeted sanctions, such as those imposed by like-minded nations, and, if not, why not?

         Thank you to Senator Chandler for her question.

          She and I

         had a discussion about this in estimates, and I would refer her, in terms of the action we have been taking, to the answer I gave in the Senate last week about this issue. We have taken action against Iran. We've consistently called out the regime publicly for its egregious actions, and I think everybody in this place—
        </p>
        <p>
         as much as you might like to play a bit of politics with this, Senator Van—would stand united in our condemnation of the brutal repression of civil and political rights in Iran, following the tragic death of Mahsa Amini.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would make this point. In relation to sanctions, the senator does know that I have not, nor has any foreign minister before me, including Senator Payne—notwithstanding her interjection—ever speculated publicly on sanctions. No foreign minister would publicly speculate on sanctions, for very good reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand the calls from the community in Australia. I met with some representatives last week and I said to them I understand why it is that people feel so strongly about this and why people are so angry. In a world in which Australia and other like-minded countries, such as Canada, the

           Last week after cancelling a division on my urgency motion calling on this government to take concrete action against the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Iranian government, both the opposition and the Greens clarified their positions as in favour of the motion. What was the government's position on the motion? In support? Or against, as Labor senators called out at the time?

             Well, I'm advised that she did. I would say that I think we have been very clear about our position in relation to Iran. And I find it disappointing that those opposite are playing politics with an issue when we see people being killed because of their actions and their beliefs. I find it extraordinary. You think that a procedure in the chamber, where there was obviously an issue where an explanation had to be given in relation to a vote, is somehow the main issue? No. Do you know what the issue is? It is the repression of women, men and children in Iran for standing up for their rights. That's the issue.

                I'm aware of that protest. I discussed it with members of the community with whom I met last week, and I support their right to protest and I understand their calls. I do understand their calls. As I said to members of the community and as I've said previously to them, if I were in their position—I perfectly understand why they're calling for it. The person who holds this office has to make a range of decisions and go through a range of processes and make a judgement in Australia's best interests—I presume the same judgement as the coalition government made when Iran was elected to the
