         I thank Senator Molan for his question and also for his service to our nation. This year has challenged all Australians as individuals but also as a nation. In many ways 2020 has also been a year like no other for Defence, but Defence adapted very quickly in February and continued to work COVID-19 safe. Vital exercises and engagements have continued. There have been 4,800 ADF personnel deployed overseas this year. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         completed more than 53,000 hours of flying. We've had 25 ships at sea throughout the year. The Army undertook more than 100 international engagements and activities involving 900 personnel. We've supported our Pacific family, including during humanitarian emergencies. Our largest regional presence deployment involved five ships and engagements with 11 regional partners. In 2020 we've concluded mentoring and training missions in both Afghanistan and Iraq. We continue to contribute to coalitions dedicated to defeating terrorism, including in Iraq and Syria, and we are supporting our

         </a>
         partners by contributing to peacekeeping efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         I most sincerely thank all Defence and ADF members who have served domestically and internationally in what has been such a challenging year. I especially thank all their families, whose support allowed those in uniform and in the department to serve our nation with such great distinction this year. I ask all Australians to spare a thought for our personnel deployed away from home both domestically and internationally this Christmas. I thank them all for their service.

            This has been an extraordinary year for the ADF and Defence here in Australia. We conducted the two largest-ever domestic operations to support our nation in our nation's history. We have assisted thousands and thousands of Australians throughout the year. First of all, Operation Bushfire Assist involved more than 8,200 ADF personnel. It was the largest-ever mobilisation of the ADF in response to a domestic disaster. This included thousands of evacuations, transporting emergency service personnel, setting up shelters, delivering meals and so much more. While the embers were still burning, however, Defence started Operation COVID-19 Assist, which has now become our largest-ever domestic assistance operation. So far, as of today, over 11,000 Defence and ADF personnel have deployed.

               's No. 34 Squadron for its work supporting the parliament and executive government during the pandemic. More than 1,400 passengers—members of parliament and staff predominantly—were transported over 267 legs. In the early days of the pandemic we simply would not have been able to start the parliament without their safe and efficient service, their sense of humour, their adaptability and their commitment to this nation. So, on behalf of us all, I thank No. 34 Squadron for their service this year. They have kept our federal parliament and the government running this year. Thank you.
