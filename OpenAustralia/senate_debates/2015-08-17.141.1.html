        With the two minutes available for this debate this evening, I will make some brief points on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers, Offences and Other Measures) Bill 2015, which contains a range of measures to improve Commonwealth criminal justice arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill includes amendments to improve the operation and effectiveness of the serious drug and precursor offences in part 9.1 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Criminal Code
        </a>
        Act 1995—the Criminal Code. It includes amendments to the Criminal Code to clarify the war crime offence of outrages upon personal dignity in a non-international armed conflict and to expand the definition of forced marriage in the Criminal Code to include circumstances in which a victim does not freely and fully consent because he or she is incapable of understanding the nature and effect of a marriage ceremony. There are amendments to increase the penalties for the forced marriage offences in the Criminal Code to ensure that they are commensurate with the most serious slavery related facilitation offences.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill includes amendments to rectify administrative inefficiencies, address certain legislative anomalies and clarify provisions in part

        1914 relating to federal offenders. It includes amendments to allow the interstate transfer of federal prisoners to occur at a location other than a prison and amendments to facilitate information sharing about federal offenders between the Attorney-General's Department and relevant third-party agencies.

        . There are also amendments to allow the Integrity Commissioner to perform his or her functions more efficiently and effectively while improving the general operation of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. The bill includes amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the Australian Crime Commission's special operations and investigations. The bill amend the
