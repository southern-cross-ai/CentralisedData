         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        , Senator Wong. I refer to the proposed parliamentary sitting schedule for 2023 that has been widely distributed by the government and which shows that the government wants to scrap additional budget estimates for early next year, a departure from practice in place since the 1990s. Minister, when Labor was elected, the Prime Minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian people deserve accountability and transparency …
       </p>
       <p>
        Why, then, is this government scrapping additional estimates and reducing Senate estimates scrutiny from the conventional four weeks in a normal year to just three weeks?

          I do love a question on accountability and transparency from the coalition, and I particularly love it on a day where we know that the House is preparing this week to debate a censure of your former leader for the double-up ministers that he invented. I'm asked a question by a man who probably knew about Mr Taylor covering up the price increase ahead of the election. Where was your interest then, Senator Birmingham?

            Senator McKenzie, it is a not a debating point. You raised your point. You're not in a debate with me. You raise a point of order. I ask you to resume your seat. That is what I expect you to do. I will draw Minister Wong to the substantive nature of Senator Birmingham's question.

             I was responding to the request to talk about transparency and accountability. Isn't it interesting all of a sudden, now he's on the other side of the table? He was happy to protect Senator McKenzie. He's happy not to condemn the former Prime Minister. He's happy to defend Mr Taylor hiding a price increase in electricity before the election. All of those things he's happy to do, but now he cares about Senate estimates. If the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate would like to have a look at what is actually happening, you've still got estimates going. We've still got estimates going. Last night Senator Gallagher was again there, answering Senator Hume's questions. There was an air of great repetition about them, but we're very happy to keep answering the same questions over and over again.

              A point of order on relevance: the question went to the sitting schedule, in relation to estimates, being reduced by 25 per cent, and Minister Wong has gone nowhere near the estimates schedule. I don't think the minister has mentioned estimates at all.

                  Will the government drop its outrageous proposal to cut Senate estimates in 2023 by a full week, and instead commit to programming additional estimates hearings early next year, as has been the practice on both sides of this parliament for decades?

                   As I've said, I understand that the proposal involves a recognition that we have just had a budget; therefore, there is not intended to be a MYEFO. It is usual that additional estimates would follow MYEFO. I would anticipate that the usual pattern of budget MYEFO, with additional, supplementary and budget estimates would be returned, as we said post the election, to the normal MYEFO and budget process. Again I say no-one on in this place—I suspect, even on that side—believes it when you talk about transparency, Senator Birmingham, because we lived through nine years of your government refusing to legislate an anticorruption commission—

                     The government's proposed sitting schedule for 2023 also proposes four additional Senate-only sitting days on a Friday. However, the Senate standing orders provide for no established routine of business on a Friday. In the interests of accountability and transparency, Senator Wong, will the government commit to having a question time on any scheduled Friday sitting?

                        Of course we will work with the Senate on how Fridays would be arranged, just as we worked with the opposition and the crossbench on how we would deal with this sitting week and as we dealt with last sitting week.

                        Senator Birmingham, Senator Gallagher has been very consultative, including with your colleague, on the Friday sitting this week. I would anticipate the same degree of consultation would be engaged in by the government—which, of course, is very different to what we saw from those opposite when in government. And on that basis, President, I ask that further questions be placed on notice.
