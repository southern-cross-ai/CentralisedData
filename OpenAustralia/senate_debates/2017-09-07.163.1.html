        My question is to the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Sinodinos. Evidence presented to the current Senate inquiry into non-conforming building products has revealed the existence of widespread importation of dangerous flammable panels into Australia, panels that were described in the committee's report as being more flammable than petrol. Can the minister confirm that these products have been installed and continue to be installed on thousands of buildings in Australia, including large public hospitals in several states?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. It's a very serious question in light of the Grenfell fire recently, which we are aware of, and of course fires that we've had here in Australia, including the Lacrosse fire in Victoria in 2014. I can confirm that, in response to what happened in Grenfell, the Prime Minister wrote to the premiers and chief ministers on 20 June, encouraging them to put in place the necessary mechanisms for a greater level of auditing of high-rise buildings to ensure that these buildings comply with the National Construction Code. All states and territories have announced the measures their respective jurisdictions are taking to address and identify non-compliant cladding.
        </p>
        <p>
         In line with the Prime Minister's request to premiers and chief ministers, all Australian government departments that oversee building works on Crown land, such as airports and defence bases, will also be undertaking audits to ensure that the external cladding products comply with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCC" rel="nofollow">
          NCC
         </a>
         . On 24 August 2017, the Building Ministers' Forum, chaired by the Hon. Craig Laundy MP, the assistant minister in my portfolio, announced that Professor Peter Shergold and Ms Bronwyn Weir would examine the broader compliance and enforcement problem within the building construction systems to ensure the effective implementation of the NCC. The Building Ministers' Forum has also directed the Australian Building Codes Board to expedite the implementation of a comprehensive package of measures to prevent the non-compliant use of all cladding on high-rise buildings.

           The minister did not answer the question. However, I would ask him this. Evidence presented to the inquiry reveals that much of the installation that has occurred has been facilitated by inappropriate certification. Is the minister aware of the allegations of certification forgery, counterfeiting of imported products and building certifications as being fit for purpose that are, in fact, not fit for purpose? Will the minister accept the report's recommendation and establish a national licensing scheme to stamp out these abuses?

            Let me make this point: regulation on use is a matter for the states and territories. We're working with the states and territories to clarify these enforcement and compliance obligations. It's not a matter of stopping stuff at the border, because at the border it's not necessarily the case that you can predict that the cladding will be used for a particular non-compliant or non-conforming purpose. The point here is to work with the states and territories to have adequate controls and enforcement. It is a matter for the states and territories. I have indicated a number of the mechanisms we've put in place to work with them in order to enforce the appropriate regulation.

              This is extraordinary. After the Grenfell disaster, the Prime Minister called on the states to ensure that a similar incident could not happen in Australia. Based on the evidence before the committee, there are over 10,000 buildings in Australia with this material on exterior walls. Will the Turnbull government now show some leadership, accept the report's first recommendation and ban this dangerous product?

               We're all concerned about this matter. I will look very closely at the report with my colleague Mr Laundy, and we will take whatever action is necessary, in concert with the states and territories. But I say again: these are matters of enforcement, compliance and making sure that products are used for the right purpose. We will work with the states and territories, we share the concern of everybody and we thank the committee for the report that they brought forward. At this time I note that it's an interim report, but we will look closely at it.
