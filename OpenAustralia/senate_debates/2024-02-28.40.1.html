        Walking around this building, one could be excused for wondering what sort of alternative Australia they'd walked into. The Australian parliament is the legislative body of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth of Australia
        </a>
        and the building housing those employed and elected to represent the interests of all Australians. From Bundaberg to Townsville, this building is meant to be the most representative building in the land. Why then does walking around this building feel quite like it could possibly be the least representative building in this land?
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason is that this building is populated by the hard left at the moment. Whether it's a woke politician, someone who works for a woke politician, a woke lobbyist speaking to woke politicians, or a woke journalist writing favourable stories about woke politicians, in 2024 this building has as much in common with the real Australia as the ABC headquarters at Ultimo. The truth is that this has happened because we let it happen. If you ever want to answer the question of how this country has gone so far off the rails in the last two years, come to Canberra, walk around this building and see for yourself, or do yourself a disservice and listen to five minutes of some of the nonsense coming out of this chamber. By the way: just like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , that's a two-minute statement in 60 seconds!
