        I seek leave to make a personal explanation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

       <p>
        On Tuesday during debate on a matter of public importance, Senator Arbib made certain comments in this place. I have now had the opportunity to have a look at the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        and review a tape of that debate. Senator Arbib made a comment which is reported, and it says, ‘The hardliners are here in the Senate holding the flag.’ Indeed, the record is not correct because the tape shows that Senator Arbib’s comment was, ‘The hard Right is here in the Senate, holding the flag.’ Therefore, we have an incorrect record, and I am happy to provide that tape to the President, through you, Mr Deputy President.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would appreciate it if the record could be corrected. I found offence with Senator Arbib’s remark. I raised that at the time and I would appreciate it if Senator Arbib could withdraw that comment. If Senator Arbib is not prepared to withdraw that comment now on the information that I have provided, I would be happy to tender the tape that I received this afternoon and a copy of the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        and would appreciate it if you could ask the President to review this matter and rule on it accordingly.

         I take notice of what Senator Fierravanti-Wells just raised. We had a discussion about this last night. I have not seen the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         or the tape. I did not realise at the time that she had taken such offence to the term ‘hard Right’. If that has caused such offence, I am happy to withdraw and apologise.

          Mr Deputy President, that is sufficient. Thank you, Senator Arbib, for dealing with it this way.
