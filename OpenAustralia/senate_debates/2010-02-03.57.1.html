        My question is to Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. In making his apology to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_people" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous people
        </a>
        at the beginning of parliament two years ago, the Prime Minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … unless the great symbolism of reconciliation is accompanied by an even greater substance, it is little more than a clanging gong.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 3April last year, the Rudd government subscribed to the international
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declaration_on_the_Rights_of_Indigenous_Peoples" rel="nofollow">
         Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
        </a>
        providing amongst other things for ‘the right to own, use, develop and control’ their own lands. In view of this, Minister, will the Labor government be supporting Mr Abbott’s private member’s bill to overturn the Queensland Wild Rivers Act and so give Indigenous people the right to own, use, develop and control their own lands?

         I thank Senator Macdonald for his question, although it was not really a question; it was more of a diatribe, I think. We are committed to the rights of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_people" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous people
         </a>
         and the senator is correct in pointing out the action we took in joining the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         instrument and expressing support for the rights of Indigenous people. It is also the case that in making the apology to Indigenous people we were supported by the Liberal Party at the time, I am pleased to say. That was a very helpful development in the Liberal Party attitude to our Indigenous people.
        </p>
        <p>
         When made the apology we also indicated that our clear policy commitment was to closing the gap in Indigenous disadvantage, and that is where the rubber hits the road. We are absolutely committed to that task. I have urged those opposite to join with us in that effort because I think that, until we get bipartisan support for these measures, we are not actually going to make progress. Over the years, we have seen governments, with the best of intentions, try and assist Indigenous people to take their rightful place in this society—and we have all failed. We are absolutely committed to the closing the gap targets. That is why on 11 February this year, the closest sitting date to the anniversary of the apology, the report about our progress on closing the gap will be delivered to the parliament. We will address the practical issues as well as recognising the symbolic significance of the apology. We accept entirely that practical progress is absolutely necessary, not just the very important symbolic statement that was involved with the apology.

              There are a range of issues there. We are obviously considering the legislation but I think our view is that it is a very serious step to invoke Commonwealth powers to overturn the laws of a state. It has always been a traditional Liberal Party position, as I understand it, not to do so. So I think it is noteworthy that Mr Abbott is now in favour of Commonwealth intervention to overturn state laws. I wonder how Senator Bernardi and the others from the right-wing branch of the Liberal Party feel about such steps. I do respect the views of Mr Pearson and other Aboriginal leaders in the

              area. They have a right to express their views and, clearly, they have a knowledge of the area that makes it that those views should be taken seriously. We think that engaging directly with the Queensland government on these issues is the best policy response.

                  . I was here during the native title debates and you were certainly not the voice of the Indigenous people then. In fact, you sought to deny them their rights to native title in this country. So I will not be lectured by you, Senator, about who is the voice of Indigenous people. I will not be lectured by you—

                     I need order on both sides. Senator Macdonald, you have asked your question. You are entitled to hear the answer but you are not entitled to come back during the answer. I have asked Senator Evans to address his comments to the chair and not to the individual senator.

                      We are very interested in Indigenous views on the cape, as elsewhere. We are very engaged with the Queensland government and them on these issues, but we do not think blundering in with legislation to overturn the Queensland legislation is the appropriate response in resolving this matter.
