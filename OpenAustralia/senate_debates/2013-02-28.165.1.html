        I rise to take note of document no. 16, Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSC" rel="nofollow">
         CSC
        </a>
        )—Report for 2011-12—Military Superannuation and Benefits Scheme (MilitarySuper), including financial statements for the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. This document of course talks about military superannuation. Today, Madam Acting Deputy President Stephens, as you would be aware, this chamber, on the voices, passed the following motion:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes That the average annual Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme military superannuation pension in 2011-12 was $24 603;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) condemns the Gillard Labor Government for its ongoing and stubborn refusal to grant 57 000 Australian military superannuants and their families a fair go;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) denounces the

         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        for misleading veterans before the 2007 election into believing that Labor would actually deliver fair indexation, a point highlighted by Senator Lundy and the then Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support (Mr Kelly) in their letter to the former Minister for Finance and Deregulation (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Tanner" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Tanner
        </a>
        ) of 14 September 2009; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) criticises the Government for its ongoing failure to schedule a time for the Senate to consider the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 thus denying the Senate the opportunity to debate and vote on the Coalition's amendments to provide fair indexation for these men and women who have served their nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendment that is already on the table in relation to the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill is a second reading amendment moved by me as the shadow minister for veterans' affairs.

          Thank you very much. At the end of it, it says: 'But the Senate declines to consider this bill further until the government introduces legislation to index military superannuation pensions for Defence Force Retirement Benefits, DFRB, Scheme members, and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits, DFRDB, Scheme members aged 55 and over in the same manner as aged and service pensions are currently indexed.'
         </p>
         <p>
          These are men and women who have served this country. They have served this country, but they are being treated unfairly. As the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Go" rel="nofollow">
           Fair Go
          </a>
          campaign, run by the ex-service community, quite rightly says, how can you treat people who have served this country differently from the way you treat age pensioners? Age pensioners have not been on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
           CPI
          </a>
          as the method of indexation for increase in their age pensions for about 12 years.
         </p>
         <p>
          They have not been on that system for 12 years because 12 years ago it was clear that CPI was not a natural reflection of the cost of living. We have tried since the last election to get this chamber, and indeed the other place, to provide fairness. I will go through those who supported this motion. There was the coalition. There was the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Greens
          </a>
          and, quite remarkably, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Labor Party
          </a>
          , who are so embarrassed about their failure to provide fair indexation that they actually passed a motion condemning themselves. I was in the other place for about 12 years and I have been here for about eight and I have never seen a political party pass a motion condemning themselves. It is quite extraordinary and that must show their level of embarrassment in relation to this issue. When will the veterans affairs legislation amendment bill come on? It has been on the
          <i>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_Paper" rel="nofollow">
            Notice Paper
           </a>
          </i>
          on half a dozen occasions and for some reason, mysteriously, it keeps on being taken off. I wonder whether that is because the Australian Labor Party does not want to have to vote down fair indexation again as they have in the past. That may be a little bit too cynical, but I do not think it is.
         </p>
         <p>
          So if this matter is indeed listed then the Australian Labor Party and the Greens have the opportunity finally to give fair indexation to these military superannuants. If they fail to do so again they will stand utterly condemned again.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
           The Australian Greens
          </a>
          , who talk the talk but will not walk the walk, have got a big decision to make in relation to this matter. They can keep on running and flapping around and making all the right noises to the ex-service community but no-one actually believes them. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
         </p>
         <p>
          Leave granted.

           I will speak to this motion very briefly to make a point of clarification. The way Senator Ronaldson portrayed it was that the

            ALP
