         I think Senator Wright for her question. I am aware of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Society_International" rel="nofollow">
          Humane Society International
         </a>
         and four other conservation groups which are calling for immediate cessation of gillnets in the southern and eastern scalefish and shark fishery in Commonwealth waters. Australia has some of the best managed fisheries in the world. The Gillard government is committed to ensuring the long-term protection of biodiversity in the marine environment. Interaction with which protected marine species in all fishery sectors are taken seriously by this government. The Australian Fisheries and Management Authority,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
          AFMA
         </a>
         , has initiated new arrangements to better protect and monitor Australian sea lions, dolphins, seabirds and nontargeted shark species.
        </p>
        <p>
         Turning specifically to sea lions, AFMA implemented the Australian Sea Lion Management Strategy on 1 July 2010 to reduce the risk of and improve the level of information about sea lion interaction in the gillnet hook and trap fishery. Advice on the implementation of the strategy is provided by a working group which comprises marine mammal experts and environment and fishing industry representatives. The strategy was strengthened in May 2011 to provide enhanced protection for sea lions and other threatened endangered and protected species. The strategy now includes significant area closures around each of the 48 colonies in South Australia totalling 18,500 square kilometres, a requirement that all boats fishing within the sea lion area are always independently monitored through either a camera system or an on-board scientific observer, regular reviews to assess the effectiveness of the strategy and closure of large areas of the fishery if predetermined levels of female sea lion mortalities are reached.

           Australian Fisheries Management Authority

          seems unwilling to share clear information about the number of dolphin deaths—13 dolphins apparently within the first three months of this year—and they are concerned that the failure to provide that information means that the scientific expertise is not necessarily available to adequately protect those creatures as well. Does the government have a response to that?

              , I have a further supplementary question. Returning to the sea lions, given that the federal environment minister gave fisheries managers and the industry until 30 June 2010 to implement measures, including voluntary closure of fisheries, to enable the recovery of all Australian sea lion subpopulations, what measures to protect these animals, which are protected under the

               I thank Senator Wright for her second supplementary question. As I said in my primary answer to the question, I have outlined the strengthening of the strategy from 1 May 2011. In addition this strategy recognises that breeding females are the most important part of the population in terms of population growth.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
                AFMA
               </a>
               is reviewing the acceptable mortality levels for each colony given their varying size and status. AFMA remains proactive in ensuring and maintaining this species. And to ensure appropriate protection of sea lions, AFMA is also reviewing interaction thresholds in the fishery that would see access closed to gillnet fishers if predetermined levels were met. Since the start of the strategy in mid-2010 there have been three reported Australian sea lion mortalities. AFMA continues to work with marine mammal experts, other scientists, fisheries and, of course, environmental experts and industries to ensure that the Australian sea lions are properly protected.
