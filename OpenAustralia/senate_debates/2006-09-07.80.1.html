         Health and Ageing

        . Will the minister outline to the Senate measures the Howard government is putting in place to deal with wide-ranging demographic change in our communities? Further, would the minister acquaint the Senate with how state governments are addressing this issue, particularly in my home state of Queensland?

          Hansard source
         </a>
        </small>
        <p>
         I thank Senator Brandis for his question and I recognise the important points that he made regarding the Queensland health system during his excellent speech yesterday. For those who did not hear him, I urge them to read the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         , because he demonstrated in there the perverted priorities of the Beattie Labor government when it comes to looking after the health needs of Queenslanders and, in particular, elderly Queenslanders.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Howard government is taking a coordinated approach to the key issues of demographic change, and I want to summarise that particular approach. Treasurer Costello’s first
         <i>
          Intergenerational report
         </i>
         recognised the need for developing policies across government to address the needs of an ageing population. For the care of our elderly we increased the availability of community care—and that is a very important point to note—to give people greater choice. We also made some very significant changes to the aged care legislation in 1977 to lay the foundation for a high-quality aged care system in our country.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is well known that Queensland is undergoing significant demographic shifts. In fact the Beattie government’s own public hospitals inquiry reported:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Queensland has the highest level of population growth in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         And that it had:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … the largest … increase … in age-weighted population between 1999 and 2004.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a consequence of these massive demographic changes, the health needs of older Queenslanders have increased markedly. From a federal perspective, in the year 2004-05, the Howard government provided $982.4 million for aged care places in Queensland, an increase of 157 per cent over the 1995-96 Queensland funding when Labor was in power.
        </p>
        <p>
         While the Howard government has taken this issue and its implications seriously, I am saddened to report to the Senate yet again that the Beattie Labor government has not. A closer examination of the disgraceful Queensland health surgery waiting list—and figures that I mentioned to the Senate earlier this week—reveals that the Beattie government has again failed those older Queenslanders in an extraordinary way. While the waiting list figures do not include age information, they do reveal that on 1 July 8,403 people were waiting for orthopaedic surgery such as hip and knee replacements, and 3,286 were on ophthalmology lists waiting for cataract operations and similar procedures. The overwhelming majority of these 11,689 people will be older Queenslanders who have paid taxes all their lives and are entitled to medical assistance when they suffer illness, injury or pain.
        </p>
        <p>
         What is disgraceful in this place is that every time I get up to talk about the neglect of the Beattie Labor government when it comes to the health needs of Queenslanders, and today specifically older Queenslanders, not one Labor senator opposite stands up for the health rights and needs of Queenslanders. It is up to Senator Brandis, Senator Ian Macdonald, Senator Trood, Senator Mason and me to stand up for the rights of Queenslanders.
