         <p class="italic">
          Example: When Hannah's van was allocated to her general small business pool for the 2023-24 income year, she estimated that it would be used 50% for her florist business. Due to increasing business, Hannah estimates the van's use to be 70% for the 2023-24 year, and 90% for the 2024-25 year. She makes an adjustment under section 328-225 for both those years.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Hannah sells the van for $20,000 at the start of the 2026-27 income year. She must now average the business use estimates for the van for the year it was allocated to the pool and the next 3 years to work out the taxable purpose proportion of its termination value. The average is worked out as follows:
         </p>
         <ul>
         </ul>
         <ul>
         </ul>

         <ul>

         <p class="italic">
          The taxable purpose proportion of the van's termination value is, therefore:

         <p class="italic">
          75% of $20,000 = $15,000

          Repeal the example, substitute:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Example: Alice's Landscaping is a small business entity for the 2023-24 income year and chooses to use this Subdivision for that year. The business has an opening pool balance of $25,000 for its general small business pool for that year.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          During that year, Alice acquired a new car for $40,000. The taxable purpose proportion of its adjustable value is:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          $40,000 x 80% business use estimate = $32,000
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Alice also sold her truck for $39,600 during that year. The truck was used 100% in the business.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          To work out whether she can deduct an amount under this section, Alice uses this calculation:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          $25,000 + $32,000—$39,600 = $17,400
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Because the result is less than $20,000, Alice can deduct the $17,400 for the income year. The pool's closing balance for the year is zero.
