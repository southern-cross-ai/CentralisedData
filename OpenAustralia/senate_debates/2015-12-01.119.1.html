       <p class="italic">
        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the Committee's tenth and final report for 2015. This report deals with three projects for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        , referred to the Committee in August and September.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first project concerns facilities required to support ten new C-27J Battlefield Airlifter aircraft.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Amberley is Defence's preferred operating base. However, the current layout is not conducive to managing the new fleet. Defence have developed a plan to facilitate the efficient use of space at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Amberley
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Proposed works will include Training System Facilities such as classrooms and a flight simulator and Operational Facilities including hangars, workshops and an aircraft apron. In order to construct the new facilities in the most efficient layout, some existing facilities will be removed or relocated. This includes the fire station, court house, transit accommodation and Air Force Cadet buildings. The estimated cost of the project is $307.4 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        conducted an inspection at RAAF Base Amberley followed by hearings at Ipswich on 3 November. At the public hearing, the Committee noted that some of the facilities marked for removal or relocation are heritage-listed. Representatives for Defence told the Committee that, in managing heritage-listed items, they would abide by all conditions set out by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment" rel="nofollow">
         Department of the Environment
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee sought assurances that the works would provide value for money. Defence responded that the minimum life-expectancy of the proposed facilities would be 40 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the next project concerns facilities to support twelve new Growler aircraft, to be operated from RAAF Base Amberley. Works will include an aircraft apron, storage and refuelling facilities, as well as a flight simulator. Upgrades to base services and infrastructure are also proposed, along with constructing a multi-storey carpark.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Facilities to support a mobile threat training emitter system are also required at the Army Aviation Centre in Oakey, Queensland and the Delamere Air Weapons Range in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . This system will allow the Growler aircraft to detect and classify communication signals sent by Defence personnel. The project will be delivered in two phases and is expected to cost $348.6 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee conducted an inspection at RAAF Base Amberley on 3 November, followed by hearings at Ipswich the following day. The Committee expressed some concern that the new purpose-built carpark might be under-utilised. At the public hearing, Defence noted that the lack of public transport options to the base and the 24 hour shift cycle will ensure the multi-storey carpark will be fully utilised.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence's submission noted that two threatened bird species, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gouldian_Finch" rel="nofollow">
         Gouldian Finch
        </a>
        and the Crested Shrike-tit, have been identified at Delamere Air Weapons Range. To avoid disturbing the birds' habitat, some works were moved to alternate sites. At the public hearing, the Committee heard that bird spotters would be engaged during construction, to ensure the birds' continued safety.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Due to the scale and phased approach of the project, the Committee requires that Defence provide it with a status report, on completion of the design phase. The Committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, the final project I will speak about today concerns redevelopment works at Delamere Air Weapons Range. These are separate to the works associated with the previous project. Delamere is the primary weapons range for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Air Force
        </a>
        . It has been in service since 1988, with most of the facilities dating back to that time. It is currently used for air weapons, special operations and ground defence training for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        units and foreign forces.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A review in 2012 identified major deficiencies in the site's boundary fences, infrastructure and roads. It also noted that existing facilities are located within weapons danger areas, thus limiting the space available for training activities. Therefore, the proposed works will include improving boundary security, upgrading infrastructure and relocating facilities to increase space for target and weapons training. The estimated cost of the project is $74.4 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee received a briefing from Defence and conducted public and in-camera hearings on 4 November 2015. The Committee conducted the hearings for this project in Ipswich, while it was there in relation to the two Defence projects I have just reported on.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence's submission noted that Delamere includes a number of sites significant to the Wardaman people. As such, it is subject to an Indigenous Land Use Agreement. Under this agreement, Defence has requested a capability statement from the traditional owners, to ensure that those with relevant skills are aware of contractual opportunities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the public hearing, the Committee heard that Defence are also operating under a new Indigenous procurement policy and have been liaising with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_Development_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Economic Development Committee
        </a>
        in Katherine. Mr President, all of these measures are in place to ensure Indigenous participation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Bill Harney, a member of the Wardaman people, attended the public hearing. Having participated in previous construction works himself, Mr Harney told the Committee that the Air Forces' presence in the Northern Territory has been beneficial for the local community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, I commend this report to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In concluding, I would note that 2015 has been an extremely busy year the Public Works Committee. During the year, the Committee has reported on 22 separate projects, tabling 10 reports and an annual report. Eleven of the projects, with a combined value of over $2.6 billion, have been for Defence involving works at various Defence bases across the country. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Brigadier Noel Beutel and Mrs Andrea Barrett from Defence's Capital Infrastructure Division for their cooperation and efforts to facilitate the work of the Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I will report on the Committee's activities for 2015 in greater detail early next year, when I present the Committee's annual report.
