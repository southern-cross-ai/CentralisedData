        My question is to the Minister for Finance in his capacity as shareholder minister of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        , Senator Cormann. I refer the minister to his answer on Tuesday when he refused to commit to the government's pre-election promise of providing every Australian with access to broadband speeds of at least 25 megabits per second by 2016. I again ask the minister: will the government stand by its pre-election promise?

         Senator Lundy is essentially repeating the same question she asked the other day. Given that she is just asking the same question, I am going to give her the same answer. The answer is that the

          NBN
         </a>
         Co project that we inherited from the Labor Party was in an absolute mess. In fact, what we have been doing since the election is exactly what we said before the election—that is, go through a proper, careful and methodical process and go through a strategic review, which is about to be released.

                          My point of order is relevance. The minister was asked a very specific question as to whether or not the government stood by its pre-election promise. He has not even referenced the promise—the policy commitment that was made. Whilst I understand that there are times when ministers in the chamber will want to add context and make a political point, he has not even referenced the promise.

                             Co corporate plan submitted to the government in September include cost savings worth billions of dollars? Or, as you seem to be alluding, is the government refusing to release the corporate plan because it contradicts the strategic review prepared by the communications minister's mates?

Of course we had a special ministerial visit for just about every single connection in the

                                 Co, there is no evidence that the costs of Labor's NBN plan are materially higher than those set out in the draft corporate plan for 2013-16? And I suggest you think very carefully before you answer.

What it will show is what a costly mess you left behind—how much taxpayers' money you wasted on delivering hardly anything at all, failing to meet every single one of your targets and wasting lots of taxpayers' money along the way. That is what it will show. You already know this because, of course, Senator Conroy had in front of him a report by Lazard which found that the NBN Co project would have a negative value to taxpayers of $31 billion. That is after you had sunk billions and billions of taxpayers' dollars into it. How recklessly and irresponsibly have you treated taxpayers' dollars!
