         by leave—I certainly do not want to labour the point, but are we getting a meal break? Staff work around here as well. It would be good to get a break for at least half an hour. I have made this point many times before in this chamber. Having a half-hour meal break within those changed hours would make sense. I am sorry that I have picked this up late, but it is a point that I constantly raise and I think it is a fair point.

          is absolutely right, and the break should be an hour. I have told the

          that we will not agree to hours like this being set again without a decent meal break. This is the end of it. Senator Fielding is right: there should be a meal break when there are extended sitting hours like these. We will not allow this to happen again unless the Senate votes otherwise.

           I would like to indicate that I think there is an opportunity to strategically plan a meal break around the documents period from 6.50 pm. I do not want to upset senators’ meal plans. I think there is an opportunity. I understand your warning, Senator Brown, but I also know that senators are keen to be in here for the committee documents, and there is a possible opportunity to partake of some food.
