        My question is for the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Urban Infrastructure, Cities and the Arts, Senator Hume. Glen Eira council revealed that their future funding was threatened by Minister Fletcher when they questioned the benefit of two car park projects based in the Liberal seat of Goldstein. Mr Fletcher's letter states: 'Such a decision could well have the long-term consequence of reducing the chance of future applications for Commonwealth funding for the

         City of Glen Eira

        being successful.' Why did the minister threaten the council?

         I thank Senator Walsh for her question. I am not familiar with the correspondence to which she is referring. Perhaps she could table that correspondence so that we can all become familiar with that correspondence.

         What I can say is that the provision of commuter car parks under the Urban Congestion Fund was an important commitment and part of the Australian government's budgeted more than $5 million towards busting congestion, reducing time that people spend going to work and coming home from work, and spending more time with their families. We know that this is an important election commitment. It was not just an election commitment; it was a budgeted commitment. We know how important it was because it was a very similar program to that of the Labor Party. In fact, the Labor Party park-and-ride fund was almost identical. It was announced the day after it was announced by then opposition leader

           A point of order on direct relevance. The question went to why Minister Fletcher threatened the council. The minister said she's not aware. I have, here, the letter from Mr Fletcher, in which the threat is made. I seek leave to table it so the minister can respond directly to the question.

            Is leave granted? Leave is granted. Minister, I'll just rule on the point of order. I will bring you back to the question. It was a reasonably specific question. I'll bring you back to the question, and you have the call for 35 seconds.

             I thank, very much, Senator Wong for obliging the government with a copy of the letter. It would have been much handier if we'd had that at the beginning of the question. If you would like us to respond to a piece of correspondence it would be very handy if we actually had the correspondence in front of us while we were answering the question. But that's alright, you can do a little bit of political pointscoring. What I can tell you is that in 2018 Glen Eira council provided the member for Goldstein with a set of project proposals that included commuter car park upgrades in Bentleigh and Elsternwick. As is the prerogative of all members of the House—

               An independent report found that the proposed commuter car parks wouldn't remove cars from the road but would increase congestion around the car parks. How many car parks will the Morrison-Joyce government fund for their own political purposes, against the advice of their departments and the wishes of state and local governments who deliver them?

                What I can say, and was continuing to say, is that, as is his prerogative—and as is the prerogative of all members of the House—the member for Goldstein advocated for his community and successfully secured funding for those projects in Glen Eira. On those projects, in August 2020 the mayor of the council said, 'Substantial federal government funding—

                          suggest that Mr Wilson has absolutely no problem beating whatever candidate you put up in Goldstein. What I can say is that what we are seeing is nothing more than a petty partisan stunt by Labor and, dare I say, by the Greens councillors in Glen Eira, who are determined to strip their own constituents of hard-won funding to generate a headline and score a cheap political point. I wonder who they learned that from.
