         I think it's disappointing that Senator Sheldon would seek to make such a direct comparison between the circumstances of the very tragic bushfires last year and the circumstances of the pandemic right now. Clearly in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         the situation is extremely difficult. The New South Wales government has placed significant lockdowns on large proportions of the New South Wales community and across all of New South Wales in an attempt to manage the current outbreak and suppress the spread of the virus. Suppression of the spread of the virus has been part of the national strategy on COVID-19 since the outset of the pandemic in 2020.
        </p>
        <p>
         We value the contributions of all medical providers in relation to the management of the outbreak. And at all times, both at a state level and a national level, we have relied significantly on the medical advice from our health professionals at a national level to guide us in establishing the national plan for COVID-19, and we know that the chief health officers have played an absolutely pivotal role in the advice to the states and territories with respect to the management of the virus. I am certain that they will continue to do that. They provide very valuable information and advice with respect to the management of the pandemic and, through national cabinet, the states and the territories are working together with respect to the management of the virus and the pandemic across the country. We'll continue to do that: to take the advice that's been provided to us by the professionals who are leading the pandemic response and continue to work with them on managing the particular outbreaks in all the jurisdictions.

           [by video link] It has been reported that the Morrison-Joyce government is only now seeking urgent advice from intensive care doctors about the pressure on hospital wards. Why has the Morrison-Joyce government, despite being more than 18 months into the pandemic, waited for a looming crisis to seek advice?

            I completely reject the insinuation of Senator Sheldon. In fact, in March last year we established a national agreement with the private hospital sector that provided us with the capacity to supplement public health capacity across the country.
           </p>
           <p>
           </p>
           <p>
            As the circumstances of each of the outbreaks have come into place, those measures have been put into place. They were in Victoria last year, and they can be and they will be in

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the very first things that this government did was to ensure the hospital capacity available to treat Australians who were suffering with COVID-19. For Labor to be just coming on board now is a bit late to come to the game.

               I first pay tribute to all of those paramedics and ambulance workers across the country who are doing such a great job. I'm happy to concede that at the current time, particularly in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

               , they are under severe pressure. There is significant transmission of COVID-19 in the community at the moment, and I know that they are working very hard and very diligently to meet the demand.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have put significant additional resources into the national health system, across the country, particularly focused on COVID-19. In fact, on 13 March 2020 the Australian government and all state and territory governments signed a national partnership to respond to the virus. We have been working on this and ensuring the capacity was there for a long time.
