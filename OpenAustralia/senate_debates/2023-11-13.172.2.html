         We have heard for five days and I don't know how many hours in here—
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Duniam has sat there listening and contributing. We were asking the minister about what this legislation meant for the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. We were assured for five long days that it wasn't in fact related to that. It was about everything else. It was about the London protocol, about ratifying international obligations, about years of drafting, about experimentation that may need to happen and about having a framework for the safety of that. On Friday we learned what the minister could have told us on Monday: that this is in fact for Santos,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INPEX" rel="nofollow">
          INPEX
         </a>
         , Woodside, Japan and Korea. It's about gas. The sea-dumping bill is about facilitating the expansion of the gas industry, of the fossil fuel industry, at a time when we cannot afford to do so, at a time when we're being warned and urged by climate scientists about this narrow window to act decisively. This is not decisive action. This is delay.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've heard over the last six months in here from communities across the country about the impact that climate change is already having on them at 1.2 degrees of warming. For many it's disastrous. We've seen towns flooded multiple times in a season. We've seen traditional owners from the Beetaloo come to Canberra to make their case, to argue why they matter, why their connection to the place that they live, love and have looked after for thousands of years should matter to the Labor government. They've urged this parliament to take decisive action on climate, to stop the fossil fuel subsidies, to stop the $1.5 billion to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Arm" rel="nofollow">
          Middle Arm
         </a>
         , which will help facilitate the expansion of the gas industry, which is related to Santos's call to expand their operations with Barossa, where we've seen Tiwi Islanders raise their concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
         Labor is all about listening to Indigenous communities and the concerns of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         people, but when it comes to things like Santos in the Pilliga or Santos in the Tiwis, they don't want to hear about it. When it comes to court, the environment minister is very happy to join fossil fuel companies and argue that she shouldn't have to take into account the emissions of individual coal mines. This kind of politics in 2023 is disastrous. We need better. After a week of listening to the minister explain the bill before us, this amendment would deal with the biggest concern for anyone who cares about our future, anyone who cares about the people and places that we love and, it seems to me in this place, anyone who's not taking donations from Santos, INPEX and Woodside. It would rule out this Environment Protection (Sea Dumping) Amendment (Using New Technologies to Fight

          Climate Change

         ) Bill 2023 from being able to facilitate new fossil fuel facilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would urge the government to support this. They've indicated that they won't be—even given what we know about climate change, given what we're hearing from our climate scientists, and noting that we have some of the world's leading climate scientists here in Australia. We have scientists like Dr Joelle Gergis, who was one of the lead authors of the recent sixth
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
          IPCC
         </a>
         report. She's written openly about her struggles in the context of what we're facing—of spending years and years of her life researching, compiling evidence, creating a compelling case for bold action. You'd think that, when she presents that to the world, the parliament would sit up and think: 'This is serious. We've got a window to act.' Yet what do we get? We get this sea dumping bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         What a response to Joelle Gergis and others: the sea dumping bill—'We hear your concerns, but hey, Santos and Inpex and Woodside really need this, and Korea and Japan want it, so we should really get on with delivering this bill for them,' with the support of the coalition and despite Australians voting for more climate action and despite having a crossbench that's urging you to take this more seriously, urging you to do what is, I would argue, the morally right thing in the face of what we know about climate change. And that is to act, to truly get on with the transition, to not approve new fossil fuel projects when climate scientists and many others are telling us that we can't afford to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
         After a week of asking questions—and its questionable as to how many answers we received—I think we got our answer on Friday from Minister Wong. It's very clear what this bill is about. I would remind the Senate that what we're dealing with here is our futures. We make decisions in here, and those decisions should be good for our futures.
        </p>
        <p>
         I read something over the weekend that I thought was maybe relevant to where we are. It is said that the Buddha told this story as a warning. A couple were travelling across the desert with their only child. Their food supply ran low and they grew hungry. But, driven by an insatiable ambition for their destination, they refused to change course. As if in a trance, they decided to kill and eat their child to sustain them. When they arrived at last on the other side, when the destination had lost its allure and the trance had lost its grip, they were utterly hollowed with grief and regret.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have an opportunity to act, and we're heading down the path that climate scientists are warning us not to go down.

          ) Bill 2023 is deeply flawed. The whole premise of this bill is deeply flawed. Far from protecting the environment or acting on climate change, it is an attempt at greenwashing the fossil fuel industry and the expansion of, particularly, the gas industry.
         </p>
         <p>
          Every leading organisation around the globe focused on climate action, the

          and many foreign governments acknowledge that we cannot continue to expand fossil fuels if we are to arrest the most dangerous elements of climate change.

It's simply not, and Antonio Guterres says it bluntly. It is dubious science. It is all about the fossil fuel industry with their foot on the throat of government, and they are the ones calling the shots.
         </p>
         <p>
          The only reason a government or a parliament, in our instance, would be facilitating a piece of legislation like this is if either we are blind to the fact that this is what the fossil fuel industry needs to and wants to pretend that it can continue, as business as usual, or we are wilfully willing to facilitate it. It's only one of two options. Either you think the fossil fuel industry has a right to continue to burn and cook the planet, or you've been hoodwinked by the fossil fuel industry. Which one is it? Could the minister please explain to the chamber whether the Albanese government has been hoodwinked by the fossil fuel industry, or are you just doing their bidding for them?

           I'll offer a response to the contributions from Senator Pocock and Senator Hanson-Young in relation to the amendment that's before us. We don't support the amendments on sheet 2151. Narrowing the application of this legislation would actually prevent Australia from meeting its obligations under the London protocol.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_London" rel="nofollow">
            The London
           </a>
           protocol doesn't distinguish the source of carbon dioxide that might be transported from one jurisdiction to another. It applies to any such transport, and our obligation, if we're to meet the requirements under the treaty, would be to create a framework that would allow environmental impact assessments and a range of other risk assessments in relation to all such movements.
          </p>
          <p>
           Both Senator Pocock and Senator Hanson-Young have reprised the arguments that they've already made over the last six days of debate. I think the clear thing is that the Greens and Senator Pocock have a view about how we should get to net zero by 2050. These arguments, incidentally, were canvassed in the safeguard debate and have been canvassed regularly at estimates as well. The government has a very clear pathway by which we seek to reduce the emissions in the Australian economy. It is the safeguard mechanism—

             I'll take the interjection from Senator Rice. Senator Rice is correct that the safeguard mechanism hasn't worked very well, because under the previous government it was a mechanism that didn't in fact create an obligation for the covered entities to reduce their emissions. That is what has changed under this government, and this chamber went through an extended debate to put in place binding emissions constraints on large facilities right across the economy. We will expect those facilities, those covered entities, to reduce their emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
             We know that, for some kinds of activities, carbon capture and storage may be a commercially viable solution for them to reduce their emissions. If that's the case, that's an activity that should be properly regulated. It's already subject to regulation, of course, when it takes place in Australian waters, and that's been the case for a very long time. Our government wants to make sure that those regulations are fit for purpose and actually meet the robust requirements that Australians would expect to be in place for activities like this; that's why there is a review going on across the range of legislative arrangements that are in place to manage

             projects when they're in Australian waters.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is part of that effort. It represents an attempt to meet our obligations under an international treaty but also to establish arrangements that are sufficiently robust to meet the expectations around carbon capture and storage projects when they take place. The decision about whether or not to initiate them will be one for project proponents. And so, for the reasons I've explained, we don't support the amendment on sheet 2151, but I thank senators for their contributions to the debate.

              Thank you, Minister. It is very disappointing that the government won't rule out using this for the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. You referred to the safeguard mechanism as binding emissions restraints, and I'd be interested in hearing from you how creating a loophole for the safeguard mechanism fits with binding emissions restraints.

                This bill creates a loophole within the safeguard mechanism for companies to effectively ship their emissions to our neighbours and somehow claim that they are meeting their scope 1 and 2 obligations. We've now heard from the coalition and the Labor government that gas companies are clamouring to see this passed and are lobbying hard. Minister King has written to Senator McDonald, urging her and the coalition to pass this. And yet I'm meant to believe that this isn't a loophole to the safeguard mechanism. The gas companies are just really keen to see this! Why would they be keen for this if it is not a loophole, a way for them to make good on these binding emissions restraints—plus loophole—and continue to expand?

                I will move on to an actual question. Potentially this is one for the

                , Fisheries and Forestry as well. What has been the assessed potential economic impact to our fisheries industry in the event of a spill or leak? What consideration has been given of the economic impact to the fisheries industry, and is there a plan being formulated to ensure that this doesn't happen and that the fisheries industry will be compensated in the event of a spill or leak?

                           Senator Pocock, I have already addressed this, but I'm happy to do it again. The government is undertaking a review of the environmental management regime for offshore petroleum and greenhouse gas storage activities. Those are the arrangements that are in place in Australian waters, and that review seeks to ensure that the regulatory regime for offshore

                           projects manages risk to the marine environment and workplace health and safety. It, amongst other things, will look at the regulatory requirements relating to the long-term liability and monitoring of sequestered carbon dioxide. In relation to projects that took place in the waters of another country under the London protocol, the way that that jurisdiction managed the carbon dioxide in its own territory could be one of the matters considered in the agreement that would need to be struck under the London protocol between Australia and the receiving country.

                            Thank you, Minister. Sometime last week we were asking about, I think, Timor-Leste not being a signatory to the London protocol. My understanding was that you said it would then essentially be on us to ensure that it was up to standard and that everything was adhered to. I'm interested: once it's under Timor-Leste, how long does Australia have that requirement? Is that indefinitely? If there's a leak in 50 years and Timor-Leste hasn't upheld the London protocol obligations, is that then a liability on the Commonwealth? What happens?

                                Senator Hanson-Young, I am not going to speculate or provide comment on the approach taken by sovereign governments to environmental management. I have previously explained the steps that would be required to establish a permitting arrangement should this legislation pass, and the first of those is treaty ratification. We would need to submit an instrument of ratification and a declaration of provisional application. We would then need to establish a bilateral instrument or agreement with another party, even if that country is not a member of the London protocol, and the receiving country must be supportive of accepting any carbon dioxide for sub-seabed sequestration and have the necessary regulatory and legal frameworks in place to manage the monitoring, compliance and verification of

                                 I'll take that as a nonanswer. I understand that it's a difficult question if you haven't actually considered the responsibility that Australia has in our region as a wealthy nation that has access to resources and scientific data and that has a much larger reach in terms of the ability to monitor these types of issues. I would like to know, if it's a matter of these protocols or regulations needing to be put in place before a proponent can apply to dump their toxic climate-change-inducing pollution in the ocean: what does the Australian government understand is the expected time frame in which any such laws in any of these other countries will be in place?

                                  The timing of any agreement-making between Australia and another regional partner is really not entirely in Australia's gift, is it? It's a consequence of negotiations and discussions between parties. But, if your question is whether it can happen quickly, of course such consultations and discussions would take time.

                                    Senator Hanson-Young, I think I have answered your question. And in responding to the contribution, I will say that we just don't accept the characterisation that you've used in describing what's proposed here. Actually, the arrangements seek to ensure that any kind of carbon capture and storage arrangement that's in place in Australian waters or elsewhere is required to meet the stringent requirements that are set out in the London protocol.

                                        Senator Pocock, I don't accept the premise of your question. This bill that's before us simply sets out the regulatory environment for proponents who seek to establish a project that involves the transborder movement of carbon dioxide.

I understand the desire of senators to have a much more wide ranging conversation about climate change and pathways to net zero. I have engaged in good faith over a long period of time in that broad discussion, but I draw your attention to the bill we are actually contemplating and the amendment before us.

It is very disingenuous to now suggest to Senator Pocock that this bill is doing anything that would further the expansion, and therefore reduce the transition time frames, of other types of technologies, because, if we're not spending $30 billion on

She has pleaded with the Dutton opposition spokesperson to let it through on that basis.

                                               Look, we have had hours of debate on this and we don't seem to be getting anywhere. I don't feel the government is really answering the questions that we are putting to it on how dangerous this legislation is to our waters in Australia. The question was asked of the minister, and she said:
                                              </p>
                                              <p class="italic">
                                               I have indicated to the Senate already that the purpose of this bill is to establish a regulatory framework that would operate in the event that a proponent sought to establish arrangements for the trans-border movement of carbon dioxide.

                                               I've also indicated that, from the Australian government's perspective, projects of this kind will need to stand on their own two feet commercially. If a proponent in Australia seeks to establish a project in the territories of another country, we would, of course, seek to establish a regulatory regime that was effective and appropriate and consistent with our international obligations, and this bill does that.

                                               Minister, you refer to carbon dioxide. A carbon dioxide equivalent, abbreviated as
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">

                                               -eq, is a metric measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases on the basis of their global warming potential,
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GWP" rel="nofollow">

                                               , by converting amounts of other gases to the equivalent amount of carbon dioxide with the same global warming potential. Carbon dioxide equivalents are commonly expressed as million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents abbreviated as
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MMTCDE" rel="nofollow">

                                               . The carbon dioxide equivalent for a gas is multiplying the tonnes of the gas by the associated GWP. So, for example, the GWP for methane is 25, and, for nitrous oxide, 298. This means emissions of one million metric tonnes of methane and nitrous oxide respectively is equivalent to emissions of 25 and 298 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide. Minister, if you are going to make regulatory guidelines for dumping in our seabeds, how do you know it is only carbon dioxide? How are you going to guarantee the people of Australia that any other dumping may include other gases and methane, and how are you going to regulate that?

Two have been raised in this chamber that do actually leak, so there is no guarantee. As you said, you are not interested in commercial arrangements that these countries may have. So what this government has done is put people in this country in fear about climate change and about what is happening. You have actually brought in transmission lines. Everything is happening in this country because of carbon dioxide. But here you bring a bill to this parliament, where you are going to allow commercial enterprises to actually buy carbon credits for whatever reason to make commercial arrangements with other countries to bring their rubbish to our nation, dump it in our seabed, and you can't even guarantee the Australian people what the make-up of that rubbish may be. I note that Senator Pocock has put up an amendment about a bond. He's raised here only carbon dioxide streams, but I'd like to go beyond that, Senator Pocock. I think other dangerous gases should also be included in this, not just carbon dioxide. I think it should go further than that, with methane, nitrous oxide and other gases that may be brought into Australian waters, and there should be a bond. Also, I'd like to see the Labor government have an investigation into this in a couple of years down the track, with a report that must be done on it. Minister, what guarantees are you going to give to the Australian people that you will not allow methane or any other poisonous gases into this if a commercial arrangement has been done? What regulations are you putting into place?

                                                  Senator Hanson, from your question I think that you are asking about projects that occur in Australian waters. You're concerned about impacts on Australian waters. I indicated earlier in the debate that the government has initiated a review to ensure that the regulatory regime for offshore
                                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCS" rel="nofollow">

                                                  projects manages risks to the marine environment and to workforce health and safety. Amongst other things, the review will examine opportunities to provide greater regulatory and administrative certainty and efficiency for carbon capture and storage projects in Commonwealth waters. I raise this because the bill before us deals only with carbon dioxide. That is the scope of the matters considered by the London protocol. But you are raising questions about other environmental impacts associated with offshore activities. I am pointing you to other work that's going on elsewhere in government in relation to ensuring we have a comprehensive and robust regulatory arrangement for offshore sequestration.

                                                   Honestly, I was completely lost with what you were trying to tell me there—completely lost. The other day, when I said, 'Minister, will this bill allow companies operating in our waters to buy carbon emissions from other countries and pump them into our seabeds?' you said:
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p class="italic">
                                                   … I can't comment on whether commercial arrangements for Australian companies or companies operating in our waters would involve buying carbon dioxide. However, I can indicate that the purpose of this bill is to establish the regulatory arrangements that would be necessary if a company wanted to establish a project to do this, and it sets out a series of things that would need to occur, including a country-to-country agreement between Australia and the other country that was involved in such a project, and then a series of steps that the proponent would need to take to demonstrate that it meets the stringent environmental and other regulatory requirements that are set up in the London protocol.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   So you have virtually said that you're going to allow this. You have said that, if they come to a commercial country to country arrangement, you are going to allow it. I'm saying to you: it's not just about carbon dioxide. We talk about the environment and the concern for our seabeds, marine life and everything there. As I said to you, it's been proven that leaks do occur from this pumping into our seabeds. There is absolutely no guarantee that you can give the Australian people that it has not occurred, that it's a safe project. You have failed to actually answer us about the safety of this in our Australian waters. You have given me no guarantee that it's not going to be anything other than carbon dioxide. So I am asking the minister: if you're going to allow this to happen and you are going to allow commercial arrangements to be done between Australia and other countries, what guarantees are you going to give to the Australian people that it's going to be nothing other than just carbon dioxide?

Earlier in the debate I stepped through the things the environmental impact assessment needs to include. I don't intend to do that again. I can, however, advise that Australia's approach would put limits on other materials, such as contaminants, that could be present, depending on the source of the carbon dioxide capture.

It's really fascinating that minor parties and Independents are pushing the major parties on behalf of the people they represent—from very different perspectives, but clearly many Australians have had a gutful when they look at the major parties, when it comes to climate.

I'm interested—to Senator Hanson's questions—is that ratifying it in its current form? If there's any update to the London protocol, will you have to bring back legislation? Or does this have provisions for if the London protocol is updated to include anything else? What then happens to this legislation?

                                                        The way the legislation functions is that it interacts with the protocol and its associated guidelines or documentation. That's why, as I previously explained, the government considers that there may be unintended consequences if you replicated aspects of the protocol guidelines or guidance as it's currently presented. The legislation as it's currently framed makes a general reference to the requirement to observe the provisions of the protocol.

The heart of my question, though, is: if it's having regard to the London protocol, are we here in the Senate today giving a rubberstamp to the London protocol, which could be updated and changed? And then this legislation basically says we've just got regard to this updated London protocol in the future?—if that makes sense.

                                                          Thanks for your patience, Senator. This is a sort of technical question about the operation of treaties, so I wanted to ensure that I was providing correct advice. The process we're going through now seeks to implement legislation that would allow us to ratify amendments to the protocol. Any subsequent amendments may well be considered as requiring treaty action in the same way that this amendment process has. However, having ratified these amendments to the treaty, the guidance document and policy documentation that sits underneath it within the London protocol is applicable to Australia. We agreed to participate in it, and that would allow updates to that guidance material to then also be incorporated into Australia's obligations.

                                                            Senator Pocock thank you for waiting again because I wish to give accurate advice to the chamber. Updates to the protocol and treaty text itself are considered a treaty action and require consideration within Australia's treaty-making framework. Updates to the guidance material attached to the protocol don't, and, if that guidance material was updated, Australia would be obliged to incorporate that into our own practices. That ensures that the parties to the protocol collectively keep up with advances in the way that the protocol is to be implemented.

But a carbon dioxide stream is the circumstance where carbon dioxide is generated and taken to a different geographical point to be sequestered.

I raise this issues because carbon dioxide is not going to be captured only as carbon dioxide; there are other additives to its equivalents that could be in it. This is really a dog of a bill.

You can't even give a guarantee that it will not be anything other than carbon dioxide. You can't give this parliament or the people of Australia any guarantees whatsoever.

I've just read out to Senator Hanson what the environmental impact assessment would require. This would apply to any proposal, including the one you referred to in your question.

Projects or activities that require approval under current legislation would continue to require approval and assessment under legislation. I have on many occasions during the course of debate also made reference to the review that is being undertaken at the moment by DISR.

I have here, from the London protocol, 'Specific guidelines for the assessment of carbon dioxide for disposal into sub-seabed geological formations'. You've spoken about the London protocol. This is directly from it. In the introduction, at 1.2, it says:
                                                                            </p>

In general, there are different levels of concern regarding potential leakage that range from the local to the global over both the short- and long-terms. These Specific Guidelines deal with risks posed by carbon dioxide sequestration in sub-seabed geological formations over all timescales and primarily at the local and regional scale and thus focus on the potential effects on the marine environment in the proximity of the receiving formations.

Why did I have to bring it to your attention that there is more to this, because of the substances? Even to capture the carbon dioxide, they have to use substances, and we don't even know what they are. As I said, this is a dog of a bill, and you are not giving the people any guarantees at all. This bill is allowing people to send their rubbish to us and dump it in our seabeds. You can't guarantee anything.

It's not just carbon dioxide; it can contain many other substances.

That's because parties agree that they will need to manage any impacts that might arise if the project were allowed to proceed. That's why that information would be sought as part of the environmental impact assessment.

You wouldn't answer that until Senator Wong came clean on what this bill is actually about. It's about Santos,

Yes, there are legitimate places and roles for it, but the legitimate place for it is not to allow the expansion of the fossil fuel industry. To come back to the amendment, which we have been debating now for a little bit of time, it is simply to rule that out, to say: 'We're totally on board with the London protocol. This is about ensuring that there is international agreement about what can and can't be done when it comes to sea dumping, but as a country we're going to listen to scientists and we're going to say, "You can use this technology and you can experiment on all of these other things, but this cannot be used to expand the fossil fuel industry."' This is because, as you said, we have the safeguard mechanism, which is binding emissions restraints.
                                                                                   </p>

We've got that in place, and now you're creating a loophole for the fossil fuel industry. It's very curious that it seems like everyone out there understands what this is about.

That includes the direction to close off wells and remove property, to carry out operations for the monitoring of the behaviour of the greenhouse gas substance and to undertake such activities for the purpose of eliminating, mitigating and managing or remediating the risk of a greenhouse gas substance injected into a formation if there is a risk it will have significant impact on the surrounding environment.

It also sets out a site closing certificate procedure, which involves a monitoring program that's paid for by a mandatory security. Sections 571A and 391 of this same act provide provisions to maintaining insurance and a security for a precertificate notice, and there are other discretionary securities which can be imposed.

They should have captured 3.4 million to four million tonnes per year but have only captured a total of 6.5 million tonnes since 2016. That sounds like serious underachieving—through you, Chair, to Senator Pratt. If we're happy to allow them to continue to promise things and get approvals and then not follow through with them, then keep voting for Labor and the coalition. That's what's going to happen.

We hear stories of fossil fuel companies getting approval. Whitehaven's Maules Creek coalmine got their approval based on an offsets plan. A decade later, it's still not implemented. A decade later they still haven't met their offset requirements. We then hear Whitehaven argue that it's too expensive to recycle their tyres, so they get a variation to bury their tyres on the site.

It simply seeks to create the regulatory framework if an entity sought to use this technology to reduce the emissions from their operations and that their technology solution involved a transborder movement of carbon dioxide. It simply sets out the regulatory tests that would be necessary to permit such a technology solution to be put in place.

The government is not here to assert that we have the answers to the questions that would ordinarily be addressed in such a business case. The risks, cost, technology solutions necessary to implement a project of this kind are all a matter for proponents. From an Australian government perspective, we seek to ensure that, if this is a technology solution that people seek to implement, there is a regulatory framework around it. I think a fair assessment of the government's broad climate agenda would recognise that this is one such technology that we are contemplating. The government is providing substantial financial and policy support for other technologies. As a subject of broad discussion often in this chamber and estimates, our budget indicates something in the order of a $40 billion commitment to the transition towards a renewable energy super power. These investments are across a wide range of technology possibilities. I'd suggest that you point constituents who are talking with you about these questions to those broad aspects of government policy.

But they're also saying that we cannot afford to open up new fossil fuel projects, that simply burning all the current projects is enough to blow 1.5 to two degrees. So I find it troubling and a little bit disingenuous to cherrypick that from these bodies, where they are talking about a legitimate use of CCS, but not also saying that while they say that they also say that we can't allow new fossil fuel projects.

But this is not my view. I'm not a climate scientist, but I do my best to listen to them. We're doing them a great disservice when we have this type of legislation before us and we're not willing to rule out the use of this legislation and the London protocol to allow the expansion of the fossil fuel industry in Australia. What does it mean for us as a country to be in this place in 2023, given what we're seeing, what we're living through, and the concerns that have been raised? The

I do not understand how we can have that knowledge and pass this sort of legislation without an amendment to ensure that this doesn't do what climate scientists are urging us—begging us—not to do, and that is to expand the fossil fuel industry. That's then on us as a parliament. That's on us.

Being able to say, 'I told you so' in a few decades time—what is the point? We surely have to be better than this as a Senate. We cannot continue down this road, Minister. We have a small window in time to truly transition. And I will continue to call the government out when they talk about the transition and point to $40 billion on transition and other things and at the same time put $1.5 billion towards

Please, we've got to do better than this. I'd urge the government, the Labor Party, to reconsider your position on political donations from fossil fuel companies. The thing that I hear from people is, despite what may be said about that not having an influence, it's very hard to understand why we're getting this kind of legislation in 2023 if it doesn't have some sort of effect. It's a bad look, and I'd argue that it's not good for our democracy.

You're going to have to live through some pretty horrific climate fuelled disasters. We're sorry, but we're going to do absolutely everything we can do from here on in.' This legislation is not it.

We want better from our government. There's too much at stake here. I'd urge the Labor Party to rethink their approach on climate. I commend you for the work you're doing on the transition. There is a huge amount of good work that's being done. There are some very good people in your party. But, when it comes to this kind of legislation, at the behest of the fossil fuel industry, it's not good enough. I really fear that future generations will not look kindly on us when they look back and they say, 'In 2023 the Australian parliament passed legislation to expand the fossil fuel industry.' How are we here debating this bill?

We had the Prime Minister visiting the Pacific—and again I want to give the government a lot of credit for the work that they've done in the Pacific. Minister Wong has done a huge amount of travel, meeting with Pacific island leaders. But we had the

We are going to commit to a just transition and support for the Pacific. We are going to invest more in adaptation.' We've got to be careful in the way we talk about climate change as the thing that is affecting the Pacific, because in doing so we wash our hands a little bit, as Australians, because the thing that's causing climate change is the burning of fossil fuels. As one of the biggest fossil fuel exporters in the world, we need to start talking more about that.

That will have an outsized effect on the rest of the world. There's a huge opportunity here for us to get on with developing the solutions and then being able to export them, rather than just exporting fossil fuels. I urge the Labor government to do better. Australians want you to do better. They need you to do better.

But I have to commence by paying tribute to this minister and how well she's done over the course of now six or seven days of debate on a bill—hung out to dry by an incompetent government. The government could have avoided all of this, but instead they've sent their minister out to man the port and make sure that everything is in order. Unfortunately, though, it has been one of the most unfortunate displays of incompetence by any government. They have the numbers in this place yet can't move a bill through, because of incompetence colliding with intransigence. We've had a full week of debate on what I think is one of the most innocuous bills we've ever seen before this place.

It was quite the startling revelation, because every time I say that in the context of any debate relating to the environment I get pooh-poohed. But it was great to hear them express concern that perhaps other jurisdictions aren't quite up to the same mark that we are when it comes to regulatory arrangements around the environment, so I welcome that development, and I look forward to making sure that claim is repeated down the track when we debate other issues of a similar nature.

I think that is a fair point to make. I think they do say one thing to one group of people and then say something else to another. This does bring that home. A week-long justification of what they're doing here does rather expose what they're up to.

It was built to force heavy emitters into paying a penalty if they couldn't reduce their emissions or access credits. It would have driven business offshore, along with the jobs and the emissions. We established that fact. It was ignored. The bill passed in this stitch-up we talked about on the first day of debate of this bill. They've come back with this legislation, which is necessary to assist some businesses to be able to continue to operate here at world's best standard, not going offshore, as was acknowledged by the Greens, to do business somewhere else, which is worse for the environment. That's why we support this legislation. But, as I said before, we are here because of incompetence colliding with intransigence. A modest request made by a party that could have facilitated the passage of this bill probably within half a day was ignored, because heaven forbid we have an inquiry in a references committee to look at a matter that is of importance to many people across Australia!

Just for context, I will list bills that haven't quite made the 16-hour mark. The National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill 2023, a significant, hallmark piece of legislation and an important part of the Labor Party's policy, had 12 hours and 13 minutes of debate. The Family Law Amendment Bill 2023 had 11 hours and 11 minutes of debate. The

The Aged Care and Other Legislation Amendment (Royal Commission Response) Bill had seven hours and 38 minutes of debate. The debate on the legislation around the National Anti-Corruption Commission was only five hours.

One of the bills that had a longer debate was the Constitution Alteration (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice) 2023. It was a pretty significant piece of legislation, warranting a lengthy debate. That had 24 hours and nine minutes of debate. That makes sense to me. The debate on the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill went on for 17 hours and 40 minutes. Again, that was an important piece of legislation and a big part of the government's agenda, and very different to the bill we're dealing with here. So, again, it's odd that we are up to roughly 16 hours. We talked earlier about the safeguard mechanism bill, which I believe will be disastrous for the economy. It had 17 hours and 30 minutes of debate. And here we are, on something that the majority of people in this place support and will back in.
                                                                                                            </p>

I think it is further demonstration of the incompetence of this government. Their inability to manage to secure the numbers for fast passage of pretty straightforward legislation speaks volumes for where we're at, particularly when it comes to the environment portfolio. I won't go back through the problems the government is having with reforms to the

I suspect we won't see any reforms relating to those laws pass this parliament this side of an election. The Nature Repair Market Bill is off on the never-never. The committee won't report back to this place until April of this year. Heaven knows how the government will respond. We probably won't deal with the standalone cultural heritage legislation before the next election. All these things are incredibly important, but now, like this, because of incompetence, we won't get anywhere. As I said, the opposition won't support this amendment, and we just hope the bill will pass sometime soon.

It is essentially because we need to ensure that there is alignment across various regulatory regimes governing these activities, and officials are working through the way that that would be organised and would support organising briefings for interested senators on this process.
