         I thank Senator Fawcett for his question. Australia is of course firmly committed to deepening our longstanding and robust defence relationship with the United States, and this commitment is no better exemplified than in the Force Posture Initiatives. Last week I met with the United States
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          Secretary of Defence
         </a>
         , Ash Carter, in Washington and I am pleased to advise the Senate that at that meeting we welcomed the in-principle conclusion of cost-sharing negotiations. This is an important milestone for implementation of the initiatives.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Force Posture Initiatives contain two very important aspects: the annual six-month rotational deployments of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Marine_Corps" rel="nofollow">
          US Marine Corps
         </a>
         , and enhanced air cooperation, both of which occur in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         . To support the full implementation of the initiatives, a substantial infrastructure development program will be required, including upgrades to airfields, to aircraft parking aprons, to living and working accommodation, and to messes, gyms and training ranges. These are upgrades which will benefit both Australian and US forces. Australia and the United States will share the costs for more than $2 billion in infrastructure investment in Northern Australia, as referenced in the defence white paper, as well as the ongoing costs of the initiative over the full 25-year life of this very important agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         The marine rotations have grown from 200 marines in 2012 to 1,250 this year just gone. This year's rotation, which is the largest to date, participated in a number of exercises with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         and regional partners, including 600 marines participating in Exercise Hamel in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         , the Army's main national exercise. The marines have also participated in Exercise Southern Jackaroo with Australia and Japan, and recently in Exercise Kowari with Australia and China. I am very much looking forward to seeing the rotation grow in coming years to around 2,500 marines, and to the further strengthening of ties between us and the United States.

            Again, I thank Senator Fawcett for that very important aspect of this question. Australia's alliance with the United States is clearly our most important defence relationship, and it remains central to our strategic and security arrangements. Australia has benefited from more than 70 years of peace and stability in our region, underpinned by the strong US role in the region. What the Force Posture Initiatives do is to strengthen the ability of Australia and the United States to work together in the interests of continuing regional peace and stability, and also afford new opportunities for engagement with regional partners, many of which are involved in increasingly modernising their own militaries. The initiatives will expand our cooperation, increase opportunities for combined training and exercises, and deepen the interoperability of our armed forces. They also position both nations to respond to contingencies in the region, such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. They are a tangible demonstration of Australia's support for the US rebalance to the Indo-Pacific—

               I know that senators will be very pleased to understand the extent of the impact of the investment in infrastructure of over $2 billion dollars in the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                Northern Territory
               </a>
               . Northern Territory businesses, whether they are retail trade, transport, or recreational and other business services sectors will also strongly benefit. There was a 2013 study which indicated a rotation of 1,100 marines contributed an additional $5.6 million per year to the Northern Territory gross state product. In 2016 alone, it is expected over $7 million will be spent to support the marine rotation, and that will only grow as we progress and increase the initiatives in coming years.
