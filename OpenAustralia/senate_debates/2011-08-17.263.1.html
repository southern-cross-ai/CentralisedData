        <p>
         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Sixty nine companies have been offered proof of concept funding from Commercialisation Australia since it was established.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Participants are required to report progress against the milestones as outlined in the funding agreement. The funding agreement requires participants who receive a proof of concept grant to provide regular reports to the Departmentâ€”including a baseline data report; quarterly progress reports; an end of project report and audited financial statement; and periodical and annual post project reports. Participants are also required to complete a survey or provide information to assist with an evaluation of the program.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) One hundred and thirty five applicants have been considered for proof of concept funding.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Unsuccessful applicants are provided with constructive feedback on why their application was not successful for support under Commercialisation Australian. Where appropriate they are referred to other suitable Commonwealth, State or Territory programs. Many applicants also benefit from the application process itself. The application form requires them to consider key business questions and they also receive constructive feedback from Case Managers.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) As outlined in response to Question 4, applicants are referred to other suitable Commonwealth, State or Territory programs which may include tools or mentoring services.
