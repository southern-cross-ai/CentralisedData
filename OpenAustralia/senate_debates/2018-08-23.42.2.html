           The government does not support this motion. The government's industrial chemicals legislative package delivers on our election commitment to place a ban on the use of animal test data for cosmetics, in line with the European Union approach. We will continue to work constructively with the opposition and crossbench to see that these bills are passed. However, the government does not support any amendments to the primary legislation, which would take the measures beyond the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
            EU
           </a>
           model. The EU permanent representative to Australia has confirmed EU support for the bills as they currently stand. It is up to the Senate to now deal with the bills, and the government would urge all senators to support the measures in their current form.
