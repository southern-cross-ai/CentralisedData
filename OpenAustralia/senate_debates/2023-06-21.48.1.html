        I rise today to address the present economic challenge that's hitting hardworking Australians right in the pocket: the relentless rise in the cost of living and inflation. Those in the corner, the Greens, when they could actually do something about the cost of living and give relief to those who are homeless and families that are struggling to pay their mortgages and their rents, have decided to block the Housing Australia Future Fund legislation and put that off to October.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike the former Liberal-National government, the Albanese Labor government has a deliberate three-point plan: relief, repair and restraint. We are doing everything we can in these uncertain global economic times to ensure Australians are best placed to deal with this. Let's start with the relief because—let's face it—Australians could use some respite. The Albanese Labor government has provided desperately needed support in the face of the rising cost of living. Direct energy bill relief has prevented energy costs from skyrocketing for hardworking Australians and those most in need. Cheaper child care comes into effect on 1 July, in a matter of days, and cheaper medicine will ensure people are able to participate more readily in employment and are able to keep more of their own hard-earned money. Despite what those opposite would like you to believe, we've heard from the Governor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">

        himself that these measures do nothing to stoke the flames of inflation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not just about fixes. It is time to repair the supply-side constraints that keep driving prices up. If we are permitted to by the axis of evil, the Albanese Labor government will establish a $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund designed to build 30,000 new social and affordable housing properties for those most in need. What did we see on Monday in this very chamber? We saw the Liberals, Nationals and the Greens cosying up in bed with one another to block that legislation and to stop that legislation from being voted on. That's what they did. So through the winter people in my home state of Tasmania, particularly where I live in Launceston, will continue to live on the streets. They will continue to couch surf. Why? Because of the crocodile tears of the Greens that want to come in here and beat the drum that they are for the underdog, they are for those who are in most need and they are for the socially disadvantaged. When they had an opportunity to do something they failed at the first hurdle. We are about supply. But the Greens are just using it for their social media platforms when they know very well that it is not the remit of the federal government to put a price cap on rent. What we want to see is more investment in rental properties to help provide those houses that are so desperately needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we have seen in this place is taking me back, because we have heard this song by the Greens before. We have seen them dance before around the

        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Greens

        rejected that legislation because they want to be the creators of utopia and they want to have perfection in everything. What did they do? They voted against that. That's what they did. So what they did in their clever university politics was put off any real addressing of climate change in this country by a decade. That's what they did. They were welcomed very cosily at that time by the Liberals as well. That's what they did. When it suits the Liberals, they will get in bed with the Greens. When it suits the Greens, they will get into bed with the Liberals. When they go home tomorrow night to their cosy homes, which we in this chamber are all fortunate to have, they should think of those families who are living in cars, on the streets or in tents. I can tell you that's really tough.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we want to talk about changing Australia, the first step is to guarantee secure homes and safe places to live, to have secure well-paid jobs and to be able to support skills and training in this country. Those are all the things that those on that side failed on when they were in government. Unfortunately, they are very capable of getting into bed with the Greens and stopping a real investment in housing that is going to help so many Australian families and women and children experiencing domestic violence—
