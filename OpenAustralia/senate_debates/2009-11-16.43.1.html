       <b>
        Senator Cormann
       </b>
       to move on the next day of sitting:
      </p>
      <dl>
       <dt>
       </dt>
       <dd>
        That the Senate—
        <dl>
         <dt>
         </dt>
         <dd>
          a)   Notes that:
          <dl>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            1)   the Rudd Government is ignoring the accelerating crisis in aged care, in particular the serious financial viability challenges faced by aged care providers involved in the provision of high care beds;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            2)   the Government appears to justify its inaction by pointing to advice from the Department of Health and Ageing, also submitted to various Senate committees, that “efficient” aged care providers are financially viable;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            3)   the Senate has sought to verify those claims by seeking access to the de-identified data from the audited General Financial Purpose Accounts, which the Department of Health and Ageing has been collecting from aged care providers since the 2004-05 financial year;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            4)   on 13 August 2009, in answer to question on notice 1688, the Minister indicated that the de-identified data from the General Purpose Accounts was available on the Department of Health and Ageing website – when in fact it wasn’t;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            5)   on 19 August 2009 the Senate ordered that the de-identified data from the General Purpose Accounts and associated reports from the years 2005-06 to 2008-09 be laid on the table;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            6)   the Government eventually made the 2006-07 de-identified unit record data available;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            7)   the Government refused to table the remaining information part of the Senate’s order, providing the following reasons in a letter dated 20 September 2009:
            <dl>
             <dt>
             </dt>
             <dd>
              a)   information from 05-06 was of ‘poor quality’ and ‘could be misleading and not contribute to the public understanding of these issues’;
             </dd>
             <dt>
             </dt>
             <dd>
              b)   Access Economic and KPMG reports of the 2006-07 data were to ‘inform the Cabinet’s deliberations’; and
             </dd>
             <dt>
             </dt>
             <dd>
              c)   information from 2007-08 is incomplete, awaiting some late returns.
             </dd>
            </dl>
           </dd>
          </dl>
         </dd>
         <dt>
         </dt>
         <dd>
          b)   Considers that the above grounds are either not supported by precedent or insufficient justification for the refusal to provide the requested information and documents to the Senate, noting in particular that:
          <dl>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            1)   the Senate has previously explicitly rejected the proposition that information that may ‘confuse the public debate’ is a sufficient ground not to release information;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            2)   not every document placed before Cabinet reveals the deliberations of Cabinet, and only if the reports in question revealed Cabinet deliberations would they conform with the recognised ground; and
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            3)   incomplete material can (and should) be tabled with a caveat as to its incompleteness.
           </dd>
          </dl>
         </dd>
         <dt>
         </dt>
         <dd>
          c)   Rejects the Ministers grounds for withholding the national de-identified data and associated reports.
         </dd>
         <dt>
         </dt>
         <dd>
          d)   Considers publication of the national de-identified data from the audited General Purpose Accounts and associated reports to be in the public interest.
         </dd>
         <dt>
         </dt>
         <dd>
          e)   Again orders that there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Ageing by no later than 12 pm on 18 November 2009, the following documents:
          <dl>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            1)   National de-identified data from the audited General Purpose Accounts of aged care providers for:
            <dl>
             <dt>
             </dt>
             <dd>
              i)   2005-06;
             </dd>
             <dt>
             </dt>
             <dd>
              ii)   2007-08, including any report/analysis by the department and/or any third party consultant; and
             </dd>
            </dl>
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            2)   the report/analysis by Access Economics and KPMG based on the 2006-07 de-identified unit record data from the audited General Purpose Accounts of aged care providers.

           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            1)   the Health Insurance Amendment (Revival of Table Items) Bill 2009 passed the Senate on 28 October 2009;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            2)   the Clerk of the Senate provided advice that there was no constitutional barrier to the Senate introducing (and passing) this bill;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            3)   the Minister for Health and Ageing told the House of Representatives on 29 October 2009, that the Government had legal advice that this bill was unconstitutional, that it should not have been introduced in the Senate and had not been appropriately passed;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            4)   the Minister also told the House of Representatives that the Government, was “happy to provide that legal advice” (9.59am, 29/10/2009);
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            5)   subsequent and repeated requests to obtain a copy of the legal advice the Minister relied upon to make her claims on 29 October 2009 that the bill passed by the Senate was unconstitutional have been unsuccessful;
           </dd>
           <dt>
           </dt>
           <dd>
            6)   eventually a copy of departmental advice dated 4 November 2009 was provided, advice which clearly had been drafted well after the Minister made her claims based on ‘legal advice’ on 29 October 2009, and after requests for a copy of that legal advice had been put to the Minister.

        I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 2 standing in my name for today for the disallowance of schedule 2 of the Fair Work Amendment Regulations 2009 (No. 1). I seek leave to make a two-minute maximum statement to deal with the reasons for the withdrawal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The withdrawal by the coalition of this disallowance is done with mixed feelings. The disallowance did force the hapless Deputy Prime Minister to change the regulatory framework in relation to the modern seafarers’ award. The attempted change—might I add, by stealth—by Ms Gillard highlights Labor’s complete capture by the extreme elements of the trade union movement on industrial relations policy. Recently we saw in the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper the way that the maritime union’s unacceptable behaviours are coming back into practice. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUA" rel="nofollow">
         MUA
        </a>
        seems to be back in town. The simple fact is that the modern seafarers’ award, as it was being promoted, would have discouraged trade, hurt the economy and cost jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The withdrawal by the coalition should not be seen in any way, shape or form as an indication that we think all things have been resolved. Indeed, we will continue to monitor, and monitor very closely, the developments in this area, especially in the area of productivity. We as a coalition have a very strong record in being able to break through on the waterfront and seeing our waterfront become the most efficient of waterfronts—world standard, in relation to container movements and the like. We, unfortunately, see the modern seafarers’ award going back to the bad old days. Some movement has been made by the minister, which we welcome, but we believe that further movement will be required in due course, and we will continue to monitor the situation. I thank the Senate.
