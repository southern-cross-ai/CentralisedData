       <p>
        I seek leave to make a brief statement in relation to allegations of sexual assault reported in the media today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the Senate. Allegations in the media today reporting on comments by former parliamentary staff members on bullying, harassment and assault are deeply concerning and distressing. Electorate and personal staff are employed by their senator or member under legislation that allows employees who face workplace bullying and sexual harassment to have their claims heard confidentially and investigated thoroughly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an incident occurs, staff or an employer can contact the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance
        </a>
        to seek advice, request counselling, lodge a complaint, request a formal investigation or seek advice on a workers' compensation claim. If a complaint of bullying or harassment is made by a former employee, they can still contact the Department of Finance, and relevant policies continue to apply to the extent possible. My department would register the complaint confidentially and follow normal processes to advise a relevant member or senator about the complaint, with the consent of the complainant. This allows the parliamentarian to address any concerns about remaining risks in their workplace or consider other appropriate action that could and should be taken.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an employee believes they have been subject to a criminal assault, these matters should be referred to the police for investigation. Employees in this circumstance can continue to access support and counselling through the Employee Assistance Program if the matter has been referred to police.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no place for any form of bullying, intimidation or sexual harassment in any workplace, and the Australian parliament is no different. That is why we have strict protocols to eliminate or minimise the risk of such acts. All members and senators should ensure their staff are aware of these policies and the opportunities that are available to them to have any issues addressed. The government encourages staff of any member or senator from any party to make use of these policies and services and assures them that their confidentiality and privacy will be respected at all times.
