        The Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2013 seeks to amend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Marriage Act
        </a>
        1961 to provide equality for same-sex couples. The Bill removes the existing discrimination in the federal Marriage Act that confines marriage to between a man and a woman. It redefines marriage as being between two people regardless of their sex, sexual orientation or gender identity.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         The Australian Greens
        </a>
        share the view of the majority of Australians that the time for marriage equality has come. The call for marriage equality has huge community momentum and it is growing day by day. The most recent national survey found that 62% of Australians believe same-sex couples should be able to marry, and 75% of Australians believe federal reform is inevitable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is the fourth time I have introduced a bill for marriage equality.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        conducted in-depth inquires into two of my bills which highlighted the significant community interest in marriage equality. In 2009, the inquiry into my bill received more than 25,000 submissions. The senate inquiry into my second bill in 2012 set a new record of 75,000 submissions, the majority of which were supportive of the bill. It is clear there is enormous community passion for this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The inquiry into my bill recommended that, with a few small amendments, the bill should pass.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sadly, in 2012 we saw votes in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate on government marriage equality bills that were carefully orchestrated to fail. The Leader of the Opposition chose to buck the traditional approach of his party by refusing Coalition members a conscience vote. Meanwhile the then Prime Minister failed to have her members support the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        's own policy of supporting marriage equality by insisting on a conscience vote.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In Australia, the states and territories are continuing to show the way, with Greens and non-Greens bills for state marriage equality across the nation. States such as Tasmania,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        have shown cross-party cooperation and are closer to achieving marriage equality than ever before.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since I introduced my first marriage equality bill, many state Parliaments have acted to deliver human rights for Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender and Intersex Australians. While no substitute for marriage, Tasmania has legislated for civil unions and New South Wales has legislated for same-sex parenting rights.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These are important and historic reforms and the efforts of MPs and advocates in our states and territories are to be admired and acknowledged. But it is federal marriage equality that the community wants most of all.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why today I stand to introduce this Bill, to assure gay and lesbian Australians that there are people in this place who believe all relationships should be recognised as equal under the law.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Marriage provides couples, families and the general community with a universal language for love, commitment and relationships. It is also one of the universal legal and social institutions through which we find connection and belonging, not only with our partner, but with our families and communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is time for Australia to join comparable countries like the United Kingdom, France and our neighbours,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , and legislate for marriage equality.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I know that there are good people in this place that support equality for all Australians, and that is why today I am calling on those members to co-sponsor my Bill. It is now time for parliamentarians from across political divides to work together and deliver on federal marriage equality. It is only through the combined efforts that we can really achieve equality for all.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to make a very short statement.

           Mr President

          . At the exact same time that I have introduced this bill, we have just heard reports that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
           ACT
          </a>
          marriage laws have been overturned by the High Court. This means that this bill is more important than ever for people living not just in the ACT in Canberra but throughout our entire nation who want to see progression towards marriage equality. It is an important day but obviously a very sad day for people who have only just had their marriages celebrated over the weekend and the days following. There will be a lot of broken hearts here in Canberra this afternoon. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

          Leave granted; debate adjourned.
