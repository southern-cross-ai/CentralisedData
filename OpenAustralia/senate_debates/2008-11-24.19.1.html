         I thank Senator Minchin for his renewed interest in the national broadband network. Those opposite have spent many months attempting to downplay the importance of the national broadband network. It is back to the future. Senator Minchin has decided that he does not want to do any hard policy work on the national broadband network. What he wants to do is go back to the easy road of just readopting the Howard government’s failed policy agenda. What the Rudd Labor government has been doing is systematically and methodically moving to implement Labor’s national broadband network election promise.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have gathered the information necessary. That required legislation. We have issued a request for proposals so that we are able to have a truly competitive process—a truly competitive process which those opposite just are embarrassed by because of the many attempts that they made: 18 failed broadband plans in 11½ years. The Rudd government is systematically moving to deliver its national broadband plan.

           , I ask a supplementary question. Could the minister inform the Senate whether it was simply naivety or incompetence that led him to promise to start construction before the end of this year, or did the minister deliberately mislead the people of Australia?

               RFP
              </a>
              , so I heard interjections there saying, ‘Where did “indicative” come from?’ Well, it is written there in black and white. The fact that those opposite are too lazy to actually do the hard yards to try to come to understand the process is an indictment on them. But we made it quite clear when we issued the RFP that it was an indicative timetable. It required us to gather information that was critical.

               , I ask a further supplementary question. I note that, in relation to Labor promises, one has to read the fine print. Could the minister tell us whether he still believes that he can keep his promise of completing construction of his fibre-to-the-node or fibre-to-the-premises national broadband network to 98 per cent of Australian homes and businesses within five years?

                I again thank Senator Minchin for his question, because it was only a few weeks ago in this very chamber that Senator Minchin fell for the old three-card trick of quoting a misreport in a newspaper to claim it was a 13-year build. He took eight years and five years and added them together for a 13-year build. Those opposite may think this national broadband network is never going to be built, as they are indicating, but this is a commitment that the Rudd government made. We said it was a five-year build. We said it would reach 98 per cent of Australians. That is absolutely clearly stated in the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFP" rel="nofollow">
                 RFP
                </a>
                . Those are the objectives that they are tendering against.
