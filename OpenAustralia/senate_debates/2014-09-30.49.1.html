        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. Can the minister update the Senate on the government's reforms to ensure job seekers attend their appointments with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Services_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Job Services Australia
        </a>
        providers? How many appointments are being missed by job seekers each year?

         I thank Senator McGrath for the question. Mutual obligation means that when Australian taxpayers help out a job seeker it is expected that the job seeker do something in return. Mutual obligation is best exemplified in the new Work for the Dole program. In return for taxpayer funded income support, job seekers can participate in Work for the Dole, which gives job seekers the opportunity to gain new skills and reconnect with the labour market whilst at the same time giving something back to the community. Work for the Dole is already having positive effects for many participants and local communities right around the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also important to note that when job seekers receive taxpayer funded income support they also have a mutual obligation to work with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Services_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Job Services Australia
         </a>
         providers to connect with new jobs and, where necessary, training and access to other government support programs. As part of their obligation to work with Job Services Australia providers, job seekers are expected to attend appointments with providers to discuss progress and look at what options are available to the job seeker.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government knows that the vast majority of job seekers do the right thing when it comes to their mutual obligation requirements. The majority of job seekers want to find work and do not want to rely on the taxpayer to support them. However, unfortunately, when it comes to keeping appointments with Job Services Australia providers, which is a condition of job seekers receiving taxpayer funded support, some job seekers are not sticking to their side of the mutual obligation bargain—and that is what we are seeking to address.

           Yes, I can. In 2013-14, nearly 4½ million of the 12¾ million compulsory appointments were not attended by job seekers. That is a non-attendance rate of 35 per cent. This problem grew from over 238,000 job seekers in 2012-13 who had at least one participation failure applied to almost 280,000 in 2013-14.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSA" rel="nofollow">
            JSA
           </a>
           providers have heard myriad excuses for job seekers not turning up to appointments, including hangovers and sleeping in. In the first three months of this year, nearly 20,000 job seekers chose not to participate in appointments. In the same period, nearly 12,000 job seekers did not turn up because of an unproven medical issue. Very simply, it is not good enough and we intend to make the system more robust.

             The government knows that most job seekers do the right thing by the taxpayer, but the problem of nonattendance at appointments is not fair on the taxpayer and nor is it fair on the provider who has to spend time chasing up the job seeker to reschedule appointments when they should be focused on getting the job seeker a job.
            </p>
            <p>
             Last week, the government introduced legislation which will make the requirements for job seekers fairer for the taxpayer, fairer for the provider and, indeed, better for the job seeker. The legislation provides a much stronger incentive for job seekers to either attend their scheduled appointment in the first place or to pick up the phone ahead of time and explain why they are unable to attend. This is what happens in workplaces around the country each and every day. It is only fair, it is reasonable and it is a similar standard to that applied to those in work. When the legislation arrives in the Senate I will look forward to the support of honourable senators.
