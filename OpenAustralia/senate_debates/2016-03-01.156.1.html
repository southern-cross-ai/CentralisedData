         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Purpose of the Bill
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The changes proposed in Schedule 1 of this Bill (to the
          <i>
           Export Market Development Grants Act 1997
          </i>
          ) allow the Export Market Development Grants (EMDG) scheme to continue beyond 1 July 2016, by amending the definition of a grant year. At the same time, a number of other minor policy and technical amendments will be made to ensure the continued effective and efficient operation of the scheme. Some of these changes introduce cost-saving measures that will help to bring scheme demand closer in line with the Budget.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The changes proposed in Schedule 2 of this Bill seek to change the name of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Trade_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Trade Commission
          </a>
          to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission, and the consequential changes required to other
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acts_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
           Acts of Parliament
          </a>
          resulting from this change.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Reasons for Urgency
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Schedule 1: The
          <i>
           Export Market Development Grants Act 1997
          </i>
          , as it currently stands, does not make provision for a grant year past 30 June 2016.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Act" rel="nofollow">
           The Act
          </a>
          must be amended if the EMDG scheme is to continue to operate past this date.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          A number of the measures in this bill are cost-savings, and they are being introduced to help bring scheme demand closer in line with the budget. Failure to have these measures in place by 1 July 2016 will mean that they are introduced and communicated retrospectively. As they reduce an applicant's entitlement to a grant, this would not be a satisfactory outcome.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Delaying passage of this bill would cause unnecessary uncertainty for small businesses, and undermine the purpose of the scheme. Having the amendments passed during the Autumn Session will provide certainty for Australian small and medium-sized exporters, who will be planning their 2016-17 marketing strategies at that time.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Schedule 2:
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
           The Government
          </a>
          has placed increasing priority and importance on attracting foreign investment into Australia to help secure Australia's future prosperity. Changing the name of the Australian Trade Commission to the Australian Trade and Investment Commission highlights this importance.
