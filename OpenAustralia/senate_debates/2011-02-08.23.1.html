        The Victoria Cross for Australia is awarded to those who ‘in the presence of the enemy display the most conspicuous gallantry; a daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice; or extreme devotion to duty’. On Sunday 23 January 2011 the Governor-General, Her Excellency Quentin Bryce, invested Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith, of the Special Air Service Regiment, with the Victoria Cross at

       <p>
        Corporal Roberts-Smith’s citation award reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the most conspicuous gallantry in action in circumstances of extreme peril as Patrol Second-in-Command, Special Operations Task Group on Operation SLIPPER.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 11 June 2010, Corporal Roberts-Smith demonstrated extreme devotion to duty and the most conspicuous gallantry in action in the face of a very determined and aggressive enemy. With total disregard for his own safety, Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith initiated an assault against an elevated fortification consisting of three enemy machine gun positions and superior numbers of heavily armed insurgents. With members of his patrol pinned down by the three enemy machine gun positions, he knowingly and willingly exposed his position in order to draw fire away from his team mates and enabled them to apply fire against the enemy. Fighting at ranges as close as 20 metres, he seized the advantage and, demonstrating extreme devotion to duty and the most conspicuous gallantry and with total disregard for his own safety, Corporal Roberts-Smith stormed two enemy machine gun positions, killing both machine gun teams. His selfless actions in circumstances of great peril served to enable his patrol to break into the enemy’s defences and to regain the initiative, thereby resulting in a tactical victory against an enemy more than three times the size of the ground force.

Through his actions, Corporal Roberts-Smith has brought great honour upon himself, his family, the Australian Defence Force and our nation. On behalf of the government, I extend to him warm congratulations and the thanks of a grateful nation for his continuing service.

         In an early morning raid on a Taliban stronghold near the village of Tizak in Afghanistan, Corporal Roberts-Smith and two other special forces soldiers were lying in a horribly exposed position just 20 metres in front of an insurgent machine-gun post. According to one report, he was part of a force of 25 up against 100 Taliban. From the cover of a small pile of rubble, Corporal Roberts-Smith saw gunfire tearing up the ground around his friends and realised that they would soon be killed. He stormed the machine gun, drawing fire away from his comrades, silencing it at point blank range. He then moved on to silence another machine gun and then moved on in company to silence a third.

         Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith has the words ‘I will not fail my brothers’ tattooed across his chest. To him, it is not just a slogan; to him, it is a commitment. His words on receiving our highest military honour tell us a lot about this man:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I saw my mates getting ripped up, so I decided to go forward. I wasn’t going to sit there and do nothing. I thought I’d have a crack. I’m not going to let my mates down. It just got to a point where we had to stop the fire. Someone just had to move forward, and I think that if it wasn’t me it would have been someone else. That’s what it’s about: to complete the mission, get the job done.
        </p>
        <p>
         Corporal Roberts-Smith is a giant of a man and soldier, but he is also extraordinarily self-effacing. He also said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I saw a lot of brave men do a lot of brave things that day. I am wearing it—

         , as he is known, described this action as ‘just a busy day’. More than saving the lives of his comrades, Corporal Roberts-Smith’s conspicuous gallantry in perilous circumstances was instrumental to the success of the troops against a numerically superior force. This decisive engagement caused the Taliban to retreat from the

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         His obvious heroism aside, Corporal Roberts-Smith is dedicated to his mission in Afghanistan:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I want my children to be able to live as everyone does now without the fear of getting on a bus and having it blow up.
        </p>
        <p>
         …         …         …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I will definitely deploy again … Being a father … I think about my children every second of the day and that is what I do it for.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I do what I do because I believe in the country that we live in. I believe that we are making a difference and stemming the flow of terrorism.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am just very proud to do my job I do so that my kids will grow up and know that.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition pays tribute to this soldier’s sense of purpose. We stand in awe of his selflessness. It should be noted that his VC follows a Medal for Gallantry that Corporal Roberts-Smith received in 2006. The account of his gallantry near Chora Pass on that occasion—disregarding his own personal safety and maintaining an exposed sniper position under sustained fire, with a risk of being surrounded by the anticoalition militia—is truly inspiring. At one point, while alone in an exposed position, he used his sniper rifle to stop the advance of 16 insurgents and held his position while under fire from other militia until air support arrived.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our country and his comrades owe a great debt to Corporal

          I rise to concur with the remarks of Senator Conroy and Senator Abetz about Corporal
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Roberts" rel="nofollow">
           Benjamin Roberts
          </a>
          -Smith, who now forever more will have the postnominal

           VC
          </a>
          . He is a person of absolutely exceptional character. The thought of approaching one machine gun is beyond what most people would ever contemplate, but the thought of approaching three is absolutely incredible. This person is also not a small target. Corporal Roberts-Smith is two metres tall. I do not know what that is in the old measurements, but I think it is about six foot seven or six foot eight. The other thing about Corporal Roberts-Smith is that this was not the first time he has done this. He has already received a citation for gallantry. So this person is of exceptional character. To emphasise what the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
           Victoria Cross
          </a>
          means, I note that during the

          and Corporal Roberts-Smith are the three recipients that we have. So it is not something that is ubiquitous; this represents the absolute pinnacle of gallantry.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is an interesting day today, in that we are talking about three servicemen. We have offered condolences and basically celebrated the life of former Flight Lieutenant Maunsell, who has died at 88 years old, and offered condolences on the tragic passing of Corporal Atkinson. Now we come to this presentation for gallantry for Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith. It should be noted that this is the ultimate statement of someone who is willing to lay down their life for their friends. Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith’s friends—his brothers, as he has noted—were in a position where they were in dire requirement of being relieved of the fire they were under. Corporal Roberts-Smith at that point made a movement forwards that would most likely mean that he would be dead. He did it not because he was suicidal; he did it to put himself in a position which would give the people serving in his section the capacity to be relieved. The action was not done in a sense of insanity; it was done with a full calculation of what the likely consequences would be to him. It was not done by a person who was intoxicated or lacking their faculties; it was done by a person who was completely cerebral and knew exactly what they were about to do. That action, that exhibition of the highest form of character, of the highest form of bravery, recommends Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith as a human being of immense worth. His action is part of a catalogue of similar actions by this person, so it was not a one-off; it was the kind of thing for which he had already received a citation and, in other instances, been noted in dispatches.
         </p>
         <p>
          We in this chamber commend his character and we have the greatest sense of gratitude for Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith, VC,

            Corporal Roberts-Smith, like all of his fellow soldiers, particularly those down at Swanbourne, would not invite accolades and awards and would just believe he was simply part of a team engaged in a difficult and challenging mission. However, as a nation we would be remiss not to recognise his incredible courage with the highest decoration a soldier in our

            Corporal Roberts-Smith has been totally supported in his ADF career by his wife, Emma, and his twin daughters, Elizabeth and Emma. In addition, he is the proud son of a highly acclaimed

            citation states—we have heard something of it already but I do wish to repeat it:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Immediately upon the helicopter insertion, the troop was engaged by machine gun and rocket propelled grenade fire from multiple, dominating [Taliban] positions. Two soldiers were wounded in action and the troop was pinned down by fire from three machine guns in an elevated fortified position to the south of the village. Under the cover of close air support, suppressive small arms and machine gun fire, Corporal Roberts-Smith and his patrol manoeuvred to within 70 metres of the enemy position in order to neutralise the enemy machine gun positions and regain the initiative.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Corporal Roberts-Smith and his patrol members fought towards the enemy position until, at a range of 40 metres, the weight of fire prevented further movement forward. At this point, he identified the opportunity to exploit some cover provided by a small structure.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            As he approached the structure, Corporal Roberts-Smith identified an insurgent grenadier in the throes of engaging his patrol. Corporal Roberts-Smith instinctively engaged the insurgent at point-blank range resulting in the death of the insurgent. With the members of his patrol still pinned down by the three enemy machine gun positions, he exposed his own position—

           <p>
            at great personal risk—

           <p class="italic">
            in order to draw fire away from his patrol, which enabled them to bring fire to bear against the enemy. His actions enabled his Patrol Commander to throw a grenade and silence one of the machine guns. Seizing the advantage, and demonstrating extreme devotion to duty and the most conspicuous gallantry, Corporal Roberts-Smith, with a total disregard for his own safety, stormed the enemy position killing the two remaining machine gunners.
           </p>
           <p>
            …         …         …

            The citation concludes by saying:

           <p>
            I certainly endorse that comment.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a fellow Western Australian I am particularly proud of the fact that Corporal Roberts-Smith is only the 14th recipient of the Victoria Cross from my home state of Western Australia and just the 98th to be invested in Australia. I sincerely congratulate him. All of us from Western Australia are very proud of him. We wish him every success in the future.

             -Smith and his size. He is an enormous man, and, in seeing the most wonderful photograph of him with his two young twin daughters, one on each arm, on the day that he received his citation, I could not help but be concerned for any young fellows in 15 or 16 year’s time who might actually have some interest in those daughters, because not only the size of the potential father-in-law but his track record would cause them to think more than once.

             </a>
             may, I just want to quote from Ben Roberts-Smith himself because I think this is the significance and the depth of the man. He was asked to describe in exact detail the incident for which he had been recognised and he simply likened the situation to a football match with his mates. ‘I saw my mates getting ripped up and just decided to move forward because I was not going to sit there and do nothing,’ he said. ‘I thought I’d have a crack. I didn’t want to let my mates down. It was certainly an amazing squadron effort and a good result. We are always hearing these stories about ambushes and losing good Australians but we won and we hurt the insurgency.’ He said again, ‘It’s just like being on a football team. You don’t let your mates down. You go as hard as you can until the game is won.’
            </p>
            <p>
             I will conclude with the reaffirmation of those comments. He is an old boy of

             was playing Hale, because he played in the second row and they did not need anybody else in their scrum. He was invited last week to Hale School to present the prefects awards to the prefects for this year and he reiterated this theme. He urged the next generation of students to strive for the pursuit of excellence, integrity and the team. He told the prefects, ‘We are representatives of Australia in all we do and must represent these values.’ ‘Remember,’ he said, ‘it is not a single act nor the grand final that you win and lose nor the exam that you pass or fail and not the Victoria Cross that defines you. It is who you are all the time that matters. You need to give 100 per cent always, however daunting it may seem and, to coin a phrase, have a crack at it, fellas.’
            </p>
            <p>
             I join with my colleagues in congratulating Ben Roberts-Smith, his wife, their children and the family. As Senator Johnston has said, it is a very august family in Western Australia. All Australians are rightfully proud of this man’s contribution and the award that he has been offered.

              </a>
              for his conspicuous gallantry in action in circumstances of extreme peril in Afghanistan. I preface further comments by saying that war is extraordinarily horrific for those who are faced with enemy fire and the consequences of that. It is brutish, it is nasty and it is deadly. The memories of circumstances like those that this very brave corporal have been through do not leave one this side of the grave. I hope he will remember that he was in these circumstances at the behest of this great country and he served this great country in that role in an extraordinary way, which has led to him receiving the Victoria Cross.

             <p>
              I will not reiterate the circumstances of that, as good senators have done that before me, but it is notable that this special man not only was prepared to get in the line of fire to defend his Australian comrades but is prepared to remove himself from the spotlight to honour those comrades who will not come back from Afghanistan. I quote:
