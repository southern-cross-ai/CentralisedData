        is one of the youngest members of the entire team and will be bringing home gold to the Hunter after winning in the Australian women's sevens rugby team. She's also a mighty Newcastle Knight. Rose Davies, from Newcastle, has been running since the age of 12, and boy is she tight—nah. But she'll be competing in the women's 5,000 metres and 10,000 metres. As someone whose fitness struggles to drive that far without being a little bit tired, I'm envious of her!

        Sam Fricker is 20 years old and one of Australia's most exciting divers. After his Olympic debut in Tokyo, the men's 10-metres platform, he's one to watch out for in these games, including his signature dive an inward 3½ somersault. Maitland girl Natasha Van Eldik has represented Australia in lawn bowls from a club in

        These people from the Hunter are doing their very best, playing with passion and doing everything they can to represent Australia. I hope to do the same thing here. With Australia clocking 106 medals, including 42 gold, after day six, I'm excited to see more competition and success.
