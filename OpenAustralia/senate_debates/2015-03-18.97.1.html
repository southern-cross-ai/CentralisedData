       <p>
        During question time yesterday, in an answer to a question from Senator McKenzie, Senator Abetz misrepresented me and my conduct in recent budget estimates hearings. Senator Abetz referred to the conduct of an organiser from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
         CFMEU
        </a>
        and suggested I was a defender of the conduct and of thuggery in general. No observer of my conduct as an official of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
         AMWU
        </a>
        , and as a senator in this chamber and in committees of the Senate, can conclude that I am a promoter or defender of criminal or thug-like behaviour. What I have done is examine the conduct of the head of Fair Work Building and Construction, Mr Hadgkiss. That is the right and proper thing for me to do. What is not right and proper is for Mr Hadgkiss, and now the minister, to use allegations of criminal conduct to pursue a political campaign against the Labor Party and me personally.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have never tolerated intimidation and bullying, and I will not bow to the attempt by the minister to intimidate me in relation to Fair Work Building and Construction. If Senator Abetz has evidence that crimes have been conducted by any person, he should report those crimes to the police, not trot them out as political fodder during
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_Time" rel="nofollow">
         Question Time
        </a>
        . If the criminal conduct alleged by Senator Abetz has taken place, I condemn it and urge Senator Abetz to refer his allegations to the police so they can be properly investigated.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to table a document.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you. This document is a media release from the CFMEU under the name of its national secretary, Mr Michael O'Connor, in response to allegations made under parliamentary privilege. The CFMEU have called on Fair Work Building and Constructionâ€”

         Senator Cameron, personal explanations have to relate to you personally. If you are now going to introduce a defence or an explanation on behalf of another entity, that is not in order.

          I am happy for that advice,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
           Mr President
          </a>
          . I simply table the document. I will go back to where I was. If the criminal conduct alleged by Senator Abetz has taken place, I repeat: I condemn it and urge Senator Abetz to refer his allegations to the police so they can be properly investigated. Senator Abetz has grossly misrepresented my conduct. I reject that misrepresentation, and I thank the Senate for allowing me to correct the record.
