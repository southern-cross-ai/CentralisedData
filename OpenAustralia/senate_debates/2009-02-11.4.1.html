         Once again, the Greens do not endorse the notion that question time should be set aside because of the bushfire crisis. In fact, it is our belief that, when there are times of great national tragedy or other matters of great national moment, question time is all the more relevant. I think there is a concern that there could be some untoward behaviour during question time which would reflect on the chamber at this time of national tragedy. That is a matter for senators to properly address themselves on. We believe question time should proceed, but we are not going to stand in the way of the motion by opposing it.

          Once again, I acknowledge Senator Brown’s proper interest in the chamber engaging daily in question time, but the events that have struck Australia this week are completely unprecedented. I think the parliament should act in accordance with and in acknowledgement of the unprecedented nature of the events surrounding us. For reasons that do not need to be particularly articulated, it is appropriate—as the government has suggested—that in recognition of these circumstances question time itself should be suspended this week. We should proceed with other business. We have plenty of other business before us and we can usefully exploit the time made available by the suspension of question time. I think it is more than appropriate that for this week—that is, for today and tomorrow—there be no question time, so we are in support of the government’s motion.

           As I said yesterday, I am very reluctant to let question time go. But, as a Victorian and knowing exactly what has happened in Victoria, I would find it offensive to hold question time and I find what Senator Brown said very offensive, frankly. I think we should hold off question time this week. These are exceptional circumstances, and I think it is more than appropriate that we suspend question time for this week.
