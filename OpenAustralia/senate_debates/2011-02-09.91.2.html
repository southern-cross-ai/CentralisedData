         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        State Territory Disability Agreement (CSTDA) provided a national framework for the delivery, funding and development of specialist disability services for people with disability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the previous three Agreements all parties were responsible for funding specialist services for people with disability:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The Commonwealth Government had responsibility for the planning, policy setting and management of specialised employment assistance
        </li>
        <li>
         State and Territory governments had similar responsibilities for accommodation support, community support, community access and respite, and
        </li>
        <li>
         Support for advocacy and print disability was a shared responsibility between the Commonwealth Government and State and Territory governments.

        Intergovernmental Agreement for Federal Financial Relations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        ) reaffirmed its commitment to cooperative working arrangements through an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) which provides an overarching framework for the Commonwealth’s financial relations with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
         States and Territories
        </a>
        . The IGA represents the most significant reform of Australia’s federal financial relations in decades. It is aimed at improving the quality and effectiveness of government services by reducing Commonwealth prescriptions on service delivery by the States, providing them with increased flexibility in the way they deliver services to the Australian people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the reform provides a clearer specification of roles and responsibilities of each level of government and an improved focus on accountability for better outcomes and better service delivery. This is accompanied by a major rationalisation of the number of payments to the State and Territory governments through Specific Purpose Payments (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPP" rel="nofollow">
         SPP
        </a>
        s), reducing the number of such payments from over 90 to five.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new arrangements commenced on 1 January 2009 and superseded all previous agreements, including the CSTDA. All aspects will be actively monitored through COAG. The National Disability Agreement (NDA) and Disability Services SPP are both covered by schedules to the IGA.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        National Disability Agreement
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The main differences under the new financial framework that impact the new NDA are:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         The NDA is based on agreed outcomes and objectives as determined by all
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_governments" rel="nofollow">
          Australian governments
         </a>
         and does not specify input controls, which provides greater flexibility for State and Territory governments to implement solutions that will meet the agreed outcomes for people with disability.
        </li>
        <li>
         The NDA does not specify funding amounts. Funding from the Commonwealth is provided through a separate Disability Services SPP to contribute to the States and Territories efforts to achievement of outcomes under the agreement.
        </li>
        <li>
         Delivery of funding through the Disability Services SPP is now the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government Treasury.
        </li>
        <li>
         Under the NDA the Commonwealth Government is responsible for the provision of employment services and income support, the State and Territory governments are responsible for the provision of other specialist disability services.
        </li>
        <li>
         The NDA is an ongoing living document and does not specify an end date. The NDA is subject to periodic performance and funding reviews to examine funding levels and the relevance of the agreed objectives, outcomes and outputs.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Summary of government response

       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government has implemented, or is implementing, a number of reforms which were developed in response to the Community Affairs Senate Committee Inquiry. These include:

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         That State and Territory governments provide a specific service that assists people with disability transferring between jurisdictions to negotiate programs and services to achieve a comparable level of support.

       <p class="italic">
        Although portability of support for people with disability is principally a State and Territory issue, the Commonwealth Government continues to be a strong advocate through Commonwealth-State forums and supports the principle of interstate portability of disability services and work undertaken by states and territories to achieve improvements in this area.

        Under the National Disability Agreement (NDA) jurisdictions have agreed to concentrate efforts in several priority areas to achieve the outcomes of the agreement and reform of the disability service system. Under the “Improved Access to Disability Care” priority, jurisdictions will look at systems to improve access to disability care, and ensure people are referred to the most appropriate disability service and supports. This includes consideration of single access points and nationally consistent assessment processes in line with nationally agreed principles. This work will help to ensure that people moving between jurisdictions receive a comparable level of support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the “Access to Aids and Equipment” reform priority of the NDA, jurisdictions have agreed to more consistent access to aids and equipment by the end of 2012.

        The National Disability Agreement (NDA) includes Commonwealth, State and Territory government agreement to reform the disability service system and create a system which enhances the social and economic participation for people with disability. This includes the need to identify, plan and respond to the development and support needs for people with disability at an early stage and at key life transition points, to ensure services are person-centred and provide timely access to supports based on assessed needs. Over time this will mean that service delivery will change to meet the needs of a person with disability.

        The Commonwealth, State and Territory governments are in the process of developing a National Disability Strategy under the auspices of the Council of Australian Governments. The Strategy will drive future reforms in both mainstream systems and disability services for people with disability including those with complex needs and multiple disadvantages. As part of the National Disability Strategy, the Commonwealth Government has commissioned an Inquiry into a long-term care and support scheme for people with disability in Australia. It will examine a social insurance model on a no-fault basis, reflecting the shared risk of disability across the population, as well as other options that provide incentives to focus on early intervention. While Australia’s social security and universal health care systems provide an entitlement to services based on need, there is currently no equivalent entitlement to disability care and support services.

        Through the National Disability Agreement, the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments have agreed to concentrate national efforts of reforms in several key priority areas to focus on providing person centred approaches to service delivery and simplifying access to specialist disability services. The reforms will mean: a system comprising single access points; nationally consistent assessment processes and quality assurance systems; and more consistent access to disability aids and equipment. Service providers will be better able to develop, train and employ care workers; and governments will work together to better measure the level of unmet demand for disability services. The reform areas include:
