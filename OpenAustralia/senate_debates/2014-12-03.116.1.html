       <p class="italic">
        ACT GOVERNMENT LOAN BILL 2014
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT_Government" rel="nofollow">
         ACT Government
        </a>
        Loan Bill underpins the Government's decision to provide a concessional loan to the ACT Government of up to $1 billion to undertake a loose-fill asbestos remediation programme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ACT Government faces significant challenges in dealing with the remediation of loose-fill asbestos across the Territory.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The one-off size and cost of dealing with this issue represents about a fifth of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        's annual budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Without the Commonwealth's assistance, the ACT's capacity to deal with this issue would have been significantly curtailed and put at threat its own credit rating.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The loan will ensure that the ACT Government is in a position to deliver a well-structured remediation programme in the coming years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill provides authority for the Commonwealth to enter into a loan agreement with the ACT for an amount that must not exceed $1 billion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The terms and conditions of the loan will be set out in the loan agreement. The Minister administering the
        <i>
         Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988
        </i>
        may enter into the loan agreement on behalf of the Commonwealth. The Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development has responsibility for that Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also appropriates $750 million from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        in 2014-15 for the purposes of making payments under the loan agreement. The appropriation will be brought into existence on the day after it receives
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Assent
        </a>
        . The remaining $250 million will be appropriated through the 2015-16 Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ACT Government has also introduced legislation this week seeking to appropriate funding for the remediation programme reflecting this split across years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A Portfolio Supplementary Estimates Statement will be tabled in the Parliament.
