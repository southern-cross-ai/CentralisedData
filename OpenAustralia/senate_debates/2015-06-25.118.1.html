        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        's confirmation that the information on display during yesterday's photo opportunity at ASIO headquarters was for official use only and that ASIO requested that it not be published. Can the minister confirm that intelligence material was on display during yesterday's photo opportunity; and can he explain why he and the Prime Minister staged this event at the expense of Australia's national security?

          If I
         </a>
         may say so, Senator Conroy, even by your standards that is an extraordinarily foolish question. I attended, along with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection and the Minister for Justice, a briefing at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">

        <p>
         In relation to the reports, I have seen in this morning's media and on the television last night that maps were displayed. They wereâ€”I was there, as you may have seen from the television pictures. I can do no better than to acquaint you with what the Director-General of Security has said about the matter today. This is what General Lewis has said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There has been reporting in some quarters of the media regarding the sensitivity of documents used in briefing the Prime Minister yesterday.

         -General of Security confirms the documents used in the briefing were not the subject of a national security classification. The documents were carefully edited and were unclassified. The content of the documents did not compromise national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those are not my words; they are the words of the Director-General, General Lewis.

           I can confirm that I did and I can confirm that the Prime Minister did, because I was in company with the Prime Minister when we surrendered our mobile phones. I know, because I was present, that that request was made of all present and I have no reason to believe that it was not complied with.

                ASIO
               </a>
               , who hosted the briefing. There was a media opportunity at the start of the briefing. The media were then excluded from the room and a detailed briefing, which touched on very sensitive national security information, was then conducted. I have read to you what the Director-General of Security himself has said. Let me read it again:
