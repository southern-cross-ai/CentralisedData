           Suicide can affect everyone and is the leading cause of death for Australians aged 15 to 44. Current and former Defence members are not immune, and the government is determined to support those at risk. Suicide prevention and improving mental health support is a high priority, and we invest significantly in it. Each year, over $200 million is spend on veterans' mental health support, which is needs based and uncapped. We introduced free treatment for any mental health condition for anyone with a single day of defence service and some reservists. We've also invested $31 million to improve support for veterans and their families, including new payments to ensure vulnerable veterans have financial support while their claims are being assessed. In addition to treatment, we know that recognition of our veterans' service through commemorations can support good mental health and wellbeing. Over $275 million has been spent to reform the

               Scott Morrison
              </a>
              ripped $40 million of funding from veterans', critical, allied and dental health services from our veterans, which Senate estimates confirmed in October will result in fewer services for veterans. This comes on top of the repatriation medical schedule freeze, which was already seen as a reduction in access to critical medical services for our veterans. Labor has said that, if there is more we can do to bring more support to our veterans, we should be doing it. Today Labor has announced a number of policies to assist our veterans and provide tangible support, including $4.9 million for the Scott Palmer Service and Veterans' Support Hub in the

              , $1 million to a veterans' recovery centre for the Ipswich and Somerset region, commitment to signing Australia's first military covenant and announcing $121 million for a comprehensive veterans' employment program. We will develop a family engagement and support strategy, will establish the Western Front Fellowship Program and have established the Senate inquiry into the use of antimalarials in the ADF.

                   In 2015, the Greens initiated the first Senate inquiry into veteran suicides in this country.

                   have opposed the money going to the War Memorial because we don't want to see Operation Sovereign Borders, for example, being given its own exhibition in the Australian War Memorial and that kind of cruelty and inhumane treatment of refugees being normalised in this country as part of a propaganda war that this government is fighting. So we support parts (b) and (c) but not part (a).
