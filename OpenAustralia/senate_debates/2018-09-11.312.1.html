         Thank you, Senator Brockman, for that very important question. Everyone on this side of the chamber understands that our No. 1 priority is to help get our fellow Australians into a job if they don't have one, because we know a job is the very best form of help that we can offer. Jobs and economic growth have been our record: one million jobs since we came to government; a record 412,000 jobs last year; an unemployment rate of 5.3 per cent—the lowest since the mining boom; an economy that grew by 3.4 per cent—the best in any G7 country; and the lowest number of Australians on welfare for 25 years. That doesn't happen by accident. It happens because we have been reducing taxes to Australian businesses so they can invest in more staff; but, most importantly, we have brought the budget under control. We can make job-creating investments like the $75 billion in transport infrastructure that's supporting 50,000 jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most pleasing, we are able to reach our most disadvantaged communities. We've got 40,000 out of 400,000 Indigenous jobseekers. We have had a 23.3 per cent increase in

         employed since we came to the Treasury bench. We have done this because we've had initiatives like the WEX program that brings in young Aboriginal and

               . VTEC, the Vocational Training and Employment Centres program, has broken the cycle of training for training's sake and the churn that's plagued previous governments' employment programs. Under the VTEC program, we have stopped paying providers for just having a bit of a crack and we are paying providers on a 26-week outcome. We know that, if people are there for 26 weeks, 82 per cent of them will be there two years later. That's a fundamental change. Unfortunately, many sneered at this new model. Former Indigenous affairs spokesman Mr Neumann said a model that paid on a 26-week outcome just wouldn't work and that we wouldn't get 5,000 jobs. Well, he was right—we got 9,000 jobs! It has been such a success that we are moving the program into the most difficult places, which are prisons. So we've started working in the

Labor are a risk to the 69,000 jobs that we have created through our Indigenous employment programs. You couldn't trust them with the Indigenous procurement policy. Remember our record is of a thousand companies and a billion dollars in contracts. They had 30 businesses and $6.2 million. Can you trust them to stand up to providers and maintain the integrity of the
