        I have additional information to provide in relation to two questions I was asked earlier in the week. Yesterday Senator Sterle asked me questions without notice regarding the resignation of Mr Brian Martin as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        er into the Child Protection and Youth Detention Systems of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . As I said in my press conference on Monday, 1 August, and as I told the chamber yesterday, Mr Martin told me on the morning of Saturday, 30 July, of his wish to resign. The transcript of my press conference, which has been online since 1 August 2016, the day of the press conference, begins with me saying that. The original transcript, issued by my office, was drawn from a live captions service, tveeder, which did not include the opening remarks of the press conference. When my office was made aware of the fact, the full audio was immediately checked, and the transcript was amended and published online. As I said, it has been online since 1 August.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can also confirm that, following Mr Martin's indication to me on the Saturday morning of his wish to resign, the Administrator of the Commonwealth, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Council
        </a>
        attended by Senator McGrath and me on the afternoon of 1 August, revoked Mr Martin's letters patent as royal commissioner and issued letters patent to Justice Margaret White and Mr Mick Gooda to serve as royal commissioners.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well, on Tuesday Senator Gallacher asked me about consultation with Mr Mick Gooda, and I provided certain information to the Senate. As well as that, at my request, one of my senior advisers, Dr Susan Cochrane, also contacted Mick Gooda and spoke to him for approximately 45 minutes in order to seek his views, and she reported those views to me. So Mr Gooda was consulted both by me and, at greater length, by Dr Cochrane.

         In relation to the Attorney-General's follow-up on questions taken on notice during question time this week, I also asked a question this week about when the Solicitor-General first sighted the legal direction, including the reference to section 10B, the new insertion of section 10B; on what day was he made aware of that; when did he first sight it; and whether he was given the opportunity to consult or provide feedback. I am just following up on whether there might be an answer to that question.

          Not at the moment, Senator, because I have not made that inquiry yet. By the way, Senator, if my memory serves me correctly, I did answer part of that question. What I took on notice was the first of the two matters that you have referred to.
