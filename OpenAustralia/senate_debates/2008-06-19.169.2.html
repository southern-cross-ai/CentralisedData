       <p>
        The first amendment on our sheet goes to the issue of objectives. As was known to the government, Liberal senators on the very good inquiry that was conducted into this bill, which again highlights the virtue of Senate committees of inquiry, noted that there was no objects clause at all, which is unusual, and the government in its wisdom inserted an objects clause. We support that objects clause in every respect but one, and I will detail our objection. It refers in clause 3(a) to the objective of promoting ‘the development of a bulk wheat export marketing industry that is efficient, competitive and responsive to the needs of wheat growers’. The effect of amendment (1) is to delete the words ‘responsive to’ and insert the word ‘advances’, because we believe that this act should not simply be about responding to the needs of wheat growers but be about advancing their needs. It should be seen as much more proactive in its objectives—that this is an act about advancing the needs of wheat growers. So that is amendment (1).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (2) on page 6 of the bill is a definitional amendment that is required as a result of our view that this bill, as outlined again by Liberal senators in their very good comments on the report, should not prevent individual wheat growers, whether incorporated or not, from selling their own wheat in bulk, and therefore we need in the definitions clause a definition of ‘individual producer’, and that is the effect of amendment (2).
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendments" rel="nofollow">
         Amendments
        </a>
        (3) to (6) relate to this proposition of ours, which I am delighted to say has the support of the National Party—as do all, as I understand it, and as do, I hope, our amendments tonight—and gives effect to the wishes and recommendations of Liberal senators in the Senate committee report that individual wheat growers should not have to undergo the full accreditation process in order to directly sell in bulk their own wheat to a third party. They articulated the virtues of that, and we do not believe that the bill should be structured in such a fashion that it makes it very difficult for individuals. I know that the government says, ‘If an individual incorporates then they can get accreditation and then they can be part of this bill.’ We do not believe that an individual wheat grower who wants to sell his or her own wheat in bulk should be subject to those sorts of requirements. There is no fundamental philosophical or policy requirement for that to occur and therefore we seek to move amendments (3) to (6) to give effect to those propositions. They are all of that kind—in other words, ensuring that an individual producer, for example in clause 4, exporting wheat produced by that individual producer is exempt from the other requirements of the bill in respect of accreditation et cetera. So they are amendments (3) to (6), which we commend to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (7) is simply to take from previous acts governing the export of bulk wheat a very important clause which relates to the, as it says, operation of certain state and territory laws. It has long been the case that, under the Commonwealth regime governing the export of bulk wheat, these provisions have been in place to ensure that no state or territory laws can interfere with or subvert the performance of contracts involving the growing, storing and transport of wheat. We have simply proposed that we take those provisions from previous acts and insert them in the new act. We do not quite understand why they have not been there and we believe it is important that it is made explicit in this act that state or territory laws cannot interfere with the proper implementation of the federal regime in a way that has always been the case with respect to the governance at a federal level of the export of bulk wheat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, our amendments (8) and (9) go to the issue of the proposed review of the legislation. We are pleased that the government has put in place a proper review regime in the bill. It currently provides that before 1 January 2011 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        must begin to conduct a review. I am delighted to see that the Productivity Commission has not been completely locked out of the business of review and analysis by this Labor government, and the government has acknowledged the proper place of the Productivity Commission in this sort of legislation. While we strongly support their role and the need for a review, our amendments seek to specifically provide that the review by the Productivity Commission commence on 1 January 2010 and conclude by 30 June 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        We do think that it is important to put specific start and finish dates in this review. The dates provided for in our amendments will ensure that there are two full wheat growing seasons upon which the Productivity Commission can base its review—that is, between the start of this legislation and the start of the review. The amended dates that we are proposing would then provide ample time in which to amend the act in any way that was recommended by the Productivity Commission and accepted by the parliament. So you could get those amendments in place by the end of 2010 and growers could then operate on the basis of any amended legislation for the 2011 season. That date also allows for a comprehensive and early review of the activities of the bulk handling companies, which I know is a matter of concern for some in this chamber, to ensure that advancing the needs of growers is also the net effect of the activities of the bulk handling companies.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will be closely monitoring the impact of this legislation on growers, and we want to know that the formal review process will be completed on time so that any refinements or amendments can be made in such a way as to facilitate grower certainty. So that is our package of amendments. As I say, we by and large support the bill. These amendments are not fundamental but we do believe that they improve the bill and put the focus much more on the needs of individual growers. The changes to the objects clause provide for individual wheat producers to export their own wheat in bulk, translate into the act those standard provisions with respect to the operation of certain state and territory laws and refine the specifications of the review. I commend the Liberal senators’ amendments to the chamber.

        <p>
         From the outset, in discussing the objects, I believe that this bill neither responds to—as it certainly ignores the overwhelming view of Australian wheat growers—nor advances the position of Australian wheat growers. I cannot see how we can claim that it is responsive when it does not actually acknowledge the overwhelming sentiment of Australian wheat growers, who do not want to lose the single desk. They do not want to lose it because they believe losing it will not advance their position.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is well and good to talk about individual producers, but we have to find out the full proposition with regard to their access to ports. There has been some conjecture as to whether, if this goes through—and I do not want it to—some individual traders will have access to ports, and the proposition with regard to individual producers I imagine falls into the same category.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also seriously query the technical capacity of this act in regard to some of the major exporters who currently have agreements pertaining to ownership of ports—I specifically refer to ports in Melbourne. I query whether this act, as it currently stands, is technically correct or whether it has a fundamental flaw in its drafting. I specifically refer to whether the

         will have clear and unambiguous access to their port. I understand that, although this is a technical inadequacy in this bill, we can live with that technical inadequacy until a later date, but I call into question the competency of a government that would put forward a piece of legislation that has a huge and gaping hole in the middle of it. This is an issue that I think has not even struck a feature tonight. It is amazing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not only are we about to vote on a bill that is technically inadequate, but no-one has proposed an amendment to fix that inadequacy up. That is something that I find peculiar in the extreme. I know for a fact that there are people running around this building tonight desperately trying to fix this hole. Now we arrive in the chamber to vote on it and, rather than fix the hole, we have just forgotten that the hole ever existed. I would like to clearly put on the record that I and the other National Party members do not support this in any way, shape or form, although it is a matter of conjecture where voting on every issue would lead. It is quite clear and apparent that this bill is neither responsive to nor advances the issues of growers. It is technically inadequate in its drafting, it comes here as a pack of toilet paper tickets and now we are going to vote on it and we are all going to look sombre and perplexed as we go forward with a piece of legislation that we know in the end has a huge, gaping hole in it that no-one wishes to talk about.

          I will make what is likely to be a preliminary response. Firstly, we are debating the amendments as a whole. Some the government will be supporting, others we will be opposing. So when the time comes for the vote I will indicate those. Perhaps we will put them in two groups.
         </p>

          The first amendment—and I am hesitating because I am about to say ‘opposition amendments’; I am not sure whether they are amendments on behalf of just the Liberal Party—

           It is just the Liberal Party. I did not want to suggest that the National Party are supporting the amendments, given that you have different positions.
          </p>
          <p>
           Firstly, in respect of the first amendment as to the objects, I indicate the government will be supporting it. The use of ‘interests’ rather than ‘needs’ is a more positive expression of intent to improve the situation of growers. The use of ‘needs’ implies a basic level, whereas ‘interests’ is broader and more proactive. It is a bit like the use of personal needs versus personal wants. We will be supporting the first amendment.
          </p>
          <p>
           My next comments go to amendments (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6), which we will not be supporting. They go to definitions—‘individual wheat producer permitted to export’, ‘grain receivals’, and ‘individual wheat producer permitted to export’. The government has consulted extensively on the legislation, including those handful of growers who are large enough to be able to supply a hold in a bulk export ship. The government has been assured by those growers that the particular amendment that the Liberal Party has presented is not necessary. The government accepts that growers who are large enough to participate in the bulk export market prefer to operate as companies for risk management purposes. The legislation as it currently reads does not prevent individuals from applying for accreditation. The government is also concerned that allowing individuals to escape the accreditation provisions would create a major compliance difficulty for Wheat

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEA" rel="nofollow">
            WEA
           </a>
           would have to put in place a rigorous compliance and monitoring regime to assure itself that a grower is exporting his own wheat and not that of any other individuals. This compliance problem would create additional costs which would be passed back to growers. Whilst the government is sympathetic to the argument, the government does not support this particular amendment, on the basis that individuals are not prevented from exporting. In practical terms very few if any growers will be affected. Those that are required to seek accreditation are not concerned about that, and the cost of compliance would be a burden passed back to other growers through the accreditation schemes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Amendment (7) goes to the operation of state and territory laws. ‘Transport WA’ might be the correct title to give to amendment (7). The government will be supporting it.

            Amendments
           </a>
           (8) and (9) go to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Productivity Commission
           </a>
           review. The government will be supporting them, but I will put on the record some remarks about amendments (8) and (9). The start date of January 2010, as proposed, will mean that only one crop will have been marketed since the new laws will have taken effect and only two crops will have actually been harvested, as crops are harvested from October to January each year. This will mean that the review will not be able to make judgements about the effectiveness of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
            ACCC
           </a>
           access test provisions which commence in October 2009. The Productivity Commission could make some observations about storage and handling, but they would be unable to make firm judgements about the full effect of the legislation in relation to marketing of the crop. Therefore having the review too early will deny the Productivity Commission the benefit of being able to make proper judgements and in all likelihood will only result in the need for another review.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">
            The Liberal
           </a>
           opposition have argued that the January 2010 start date is necessary to ensure a ‘fair dinkum’ review. But the effect of the amendments is actually that it would ensure that the review would not be ‘fair dinkum’, for the reasons that I have already stated. The government would consider a review with a start date which allowed the Productivity Commission the benefit of being able to consider the effect of at least one season of marketing a crop, and therefore a start date of July 2010 and an end date of January 2011 would be acceptable. Having considered the issue, to those comments I add that we will support the amendments.
          </p>
          <p>
           They are all the amendments we have before us. An issue has been raised by Senator Joyce. Firstly, I have to make the point that this is a matter on which, I understand, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Wheat_Board" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Wheat Board
           </a>
           has been making representations to some members of parliament very recently. It is a matter that has come to the government’s attention only very recently and it has been considered. The government does not believe that the change that is being suggested by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
            AWB
           </a>
           , as suggested by Senator Joyce, is warranted. The issue that has been raised by the AWB is a commercial matter between the joint venture partners. It is unreasonable to assume that a joint venture partner who relies heavily on access to a port terminal facility would have no control over its operation. Therefore the Labor government believes it should be resolved between the partners themselves. It is not up to the government to intervene by legislation in what we see as a commercial issue. To allow an accredited exporter with a significant interest in a port terminal facility an exemption from the access test would undermine the integrity of the scheme; therefore there is no amendment before the committee and the government has not proposed an amendment. But I have made those comments in response to the issue raised by and the comments made by Senator Joyce.

            I want to respond to the government’s elucidation of their position on our amendments and welcome the government’s support for most of our amendments. I note with respect what the government have said on the review, but I think that, from the point of view of growers—and we know, as I was able to experience earlier in the week, there are some growers who are not happy with this—a review at the time that we have proposed does make a lot of sense. Ensuring, for their confidence, that this will be looked at at an appropriate time is important. It may well be that further reviews are required—I am sure they probably will be—in order to ensure that Australian wheat growers are satisfied with the continuing operation of this new system, but I do not think that is a reason to further delay the review as proposed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am disappointed that the government are not able to accept our amendments with respect to individual wheat growers. We do not accept their arguments. We do think individuals should be able to market and sell their own wheat without having to comply with this regime, and we will be pursuing those amendments.
           </p>
           <p>
            With respect to the matter Senator Joyce raised and to which Senator Sherry responded, from the point of view of Liberal senators we think this is a matter for the government. We are not at this stage persuaded—as, it appears, is the government, from Senator Sherry’s remarks—that further amendments are required. I am certainly sympathetic to the arguments put by Senator Sherry that this is a matter between the joint venture partners. It is a commercial matter for them, and we are not persuaded that further amendments are required.
           </p>
           <p>
            However, can I say to the chamber that, from a procedural point of view, if the government does not accept our amendments with respect to individual growers and the chamber nevertheless passes those amendments, the bill will inevitably have to go back to the House of Representatives, where the government will have to consider its position on the amendments made by the Senate that it does not agree with. That would be an opportunity for the government to further consider this matter if it so chose. Then of course the bill will have to come back to this chamber, where this chamber will have to decide what its position will be on the amendments in the event that the government indicates in the lower house that it is not prepared to accept those amendments. So I suspect we will be talking about this bill once more next week—through you, Mr Chairman, to Senator Joyce. In the meantime, the government will have the opportunity to further consider its position with respect to the joint venture matter. But certainly at this stage, it is the position of Liberal senators that we concur with the remarks of Senator Sherry on that matter.

             I understand completely the tactics. We certainly want the ability to ventilate this issue further. I personally would support amendments that I think are not so much non-controversial as inconsequential, but they are consequences only in that they make the issue go to the other place and then return here. I understand that completely. However, I ask this question of the government: did you consider an amendment to deal with the issue that pertains to the obvious technical inadequacies of the bill in dealing with the access regime between

                  is outlined in the bill.

                                   does not apply. Now, within two minutes, we have an answer that the ACCC does apply. In the meantime, I am in a complete quandary as to who is the determinant body to work out what are fair and reasonable commercial terms because, under your legislation, there will be inevitable discussion as someone tries to get access to a port.

                                     is involved prior to 1 October 2009 and after October 2009. So they are involved. That being the case, can you please inform me of the dispute resolution process and how it is currently utilised in Australian trade practices law for the determination of commercial terms? Do you believe that this will be a fluid and immediate resolution process or do you think it will reflect the current resolution process, which on issues like the Telstra access regime has meant seven years now in the courts?

                                       This is getting more interesting by the minute. They are involved, they are not involved, they are involved, they are potentially involved, and we are still waiting for the answer as to how you can believe that they will have the capacity for an immediate resolution to a problem, when under the current trade practices laws it is an elongated and confused process? How is that going to be an operable process for the people who are going to currently want to get access to ports?

That is what I mean by potentially. As to your question around speed and response time and fluidity of the ACCC, I cannot give any undertakings as to that. They are an independent organisation required to handle disputes. If they are handled by the ACCC, I cannot give any undertakings as to the response time. That is up to them.

You argue that there will be X number of disputes. I simply do not know. How do we know?

You may speculate and believe there may be disputes, but I cannot give an undertaking that there will not be disputes. But if there are, it is a matter for the

                                           In the past minute you have once again completely contradicted the statement you made previously to the Senate. You said that you assume that there will not be disputes. Then in your next answer you say that you do not know, that there could be a number of disputes. Can you not see that in this process we are getting a different answer to every question we pose?

                                                        I would like to put on record the Greens’ position on these issues. I have a number of questions for the minister and also, if it is appropriate, for the opposition, because I seek clarifications on a couple of points in their amendments. I will firstly go through our comments on the various amendments.

                                                        will be supporting amendment (1), which is a change to a clause. We think it reads a little bit clumsily but we will support that amendment. We do not support amendments (2) to (6), dealing with individual growers, for many of the same reasons as the government, in fact. We believe the accreditation system has been developed to put in place some surety for the system so that the system has some integrity. Firstly, we are concerned that individual growers on their own are not likely to be able to produce enough for bulk export. Secondly, without accreditation, we are concerned about the integrity of the system, quality control and also, as the government has already articulated, the need to put in some sort of checking system to ensure that it is the growers’ wheat that is being exported. So we have some concerns around those amendments and will not be supporting them. In terms of amendments (4) to (6), I will come back and ask Senator Minchin some questions. We question whether they are in fact necessary.

                                                        I understand item (7) regarding the operation of certain state and territory laws is largely driven by my home state of

                                                        , which still has laws in place. I would like to confirm whether this item is there not only to deal with that issue but also to deal with any future state governments who may introduce laws restricting transport by road. We have some concerns there. Obviously we are keen to see as much grain being transported by rail as possible, and into the future this is going to be an increasingly important issue. We are a little bit concerned that that may restrict an orderly approach to rail transport.

                                                        In terms of timing of the review, in particular we support item (9), which sets a reporting date. That should be required; when starting a review you obviously need a reporting date. We also share the concerns about the limited time for the review. It only allows for one season of a properly functioning market. Obviously, if it turns out that there are major problems with this system we want to pick them up as fast as possible, but I suspect we would pick them up anyway, even without this review. We would have preferred to see the date for the beginning of the review remain 1 January 2011, but with a reporting date of 1 July 2001. Having said that, we will not oppose this amendment.

                                                        I will now go to my questions of both the government and Senator Minchin. I will deal with the accreditation process first. I have a few general questions around the accreditation process for the minister. As I understand it, the government has allocated $1.15 million to an information program. Is the minister able to provide any details on what that program will look like so that growers have an idea of the services that will be provided? Will it provide financial education and counselling in marketing and risk management, which were recommendations of the committee inquiry? Will the government guarantee that the program will be extended beyond one year? As I understand it, resources have only been allocated for a year. Will it guarantee that, if the program is needed and there is demand from farmers, it will be extended beyond the first year?

I have just consulted with the officials. Discussions are being finalised at the present time as to details of delivery. I am informed it will be approximately two weeks before the final details are ready. I am able to indicate that as soon as they are available in detail we will be able to provide them to you or, for that matter, to any senators who require them.

Obviously I was referring to the accreditation process. Minister, I appreciate your answer that the details are coming, but I am particularly keen to know whether it is just information about the new regime or whether it is in fact information on financial counselling and risk management support, which were clear recommendations. Those issues were teased out during the committee process.

I presume you are being cautious because of that, but I think this is a much bigger issue. I think there are bigger problems here, and I am keen to know if the government is prepared to make sure that there is funding available if it is necessary to go beyond the 12 months of the program.

                                                             It is important that all industry participants are fully informed about the new arrangements and how they can take advantage of the opportunities available. For the sessions to be most effective they need to be completed before the upcoming harvest. The department is working with state farmer organisations to develop an information program which covers all bases and is accessible to industry stakeholders across Australia. We are confident the program will address industry needs. But, if it is found after the first harvest that further assistance is required in this area, that will be considered.

For example, exporters may need to provide in their application evidence of sufficient liquidity to meet the estimated maximum wheat tonnage they intend to export. WEA will also regularly review the financial conditions and activities of accredited exporters to make sure they are complying with the conditions of their accreditation.

When growers deliver wheat to AWBI they receive an advance from AWBI which is actually a loan. This loan is paid up as AWBI sells the wheat. Not only do they not own the wheat; they have to repay AWBI. The financial exposure of growers to marketeers of wheat that may go broke will be the same as for other agricultural commodities and the same as for AWBI at the present time.

You premise your answer around the liquidity process that would be part of the accreditation process under the

Do you not acknowledge that that could affect, even at an initial stage, the liquidity of any accredited exporter unless you get that accredited exporter to come into the WEA office with a signed-off access regime on commercial terms?

                                                                             I am not sure if Senator Siewert is going to ask me any questions as she indicated she might, but I am happy to answer any questions she may have. I will just pick up a couple of points particularly with respect to the security of payment in the matter that Senator Joyce raised. Senator Sherry said that there is currently no formal security of payment arrangement. Of course, what is contemplated here is simply that wheat growers, like every other person in business in this country, will rely on the operation of the ordinary laws of this country, as they do now in effect and will in the future. There are laws governing the enforceability of contracts, and that applies to you whether you are selling your wholesale bananas to the local retailer or whether you are selling to an accredited exporter. I point out to Senator Joyce that growers, like any other producer of any widget or any other product or service in this country, will of course have recourse to the ordinary laws of this country which, at a state and federal level, provide a greater degree of security in the law than those of virtually any other country on the planet. So I do not think that, out of this debate tonight, we want any sense among Australian wheat growers that suddenly they are being thrown to the wolves by this bill. That would be so far from the truth as to be ridiculous, so I do not think that that furphy should be allowed to run.
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p>
                                                                             With respect to Senator Siewert’s remarks, I express surprise and disappointment that the Greens are not able to support our amendments with regard to individual growers, and I do not think that it is a sufficient argument against these amendments to surmise that there will not be individual growers who will have the quantities of wheat to export in bulk. That is not a sufficient reason to oppose the right of an individual grower who has or may have the opportunity to export their wheat without going through this process. Much of the purpose of the accreditation scheme is to give growers who wish to export their wheat through an exporter a considerable degree of confidence in the financial wherewithal and capacity of that exporter. That is part of the reason for the accreditation. That is obviously, by definition, not necessary if the wheat grower chooses to export their own wheat. As our amendments make clear, with respect to whether someone might cheat the system by exporting somebody’s wheat, they would, by definition, be breaching the act, because our amendment very specifically refers to an individual producer exporting wheat produced by that individual producer. Were they to seek to export wheat produced by somebody else, they would automatically not be covered by our amendments but would be covered by the requirements of the act with respect to accreditation. So I do not think that that is a legitimate argument either.

We agree with the government on that issue in particular—of putting in a compliance regime to find out whether it is the grower’s wheat or somebody else’s wheat. Could Senator Minchin explain how the opposition envisages that that would happen? And while I have his attention, I might as well ask about items (4) to (6), and that issue in particular. I seek further explanation on that amendment because it seeks to exempt individual exporters from the requirements to produce the export report and the annual compliance report. As they are exempt from the accreditation system anyway, why would those amendments be necessary?

In our view, an individual who is capable of producing wheat in sufficient quantities to export their own wheat and not be reliant on an accredited exporter should, by definition, be able to do so. We fundamentally believe in free enterprise and we do not see any need for unnecessary regulation. Indeed, I thought that was one of the mantras of this government. They renamed my old department the

Nevertheless, we also agree that regulation should only be imposed on Australians where it is absolutely necessary, and we see absolutely no necessity to impose on an individual grower, exporting their own wheat, the necessity to comply with provisions that are in there for the purpose of ensuring that growers who use accredited exporters, rather than export their own wheat, are properly protected.
                                                                              </p>

That is the purpose. To ensure that those relevant provisions do not apply to a grower exporting their own wheat, we have followed the expert advice of the draftsman and attached (4) to (6) to proposed clause 86A, because, by definition again, the act does not apply to someone exporting wheat in bags or containers. We think, therefore, by definition, that the same exemptions from the operation of the act should apply not only to someone exporting wheat in bags or containers but also to an individual producer exporting their own wheat. Of course, with respect to the matter of whether it is their own wheat, any grower who tries to cheat the law by setting themselves up as an exporter to get around the act and export somebody else’s wheat is, by definition, breaking the law, and they will bear the full consequences of so doing—just as anybody else who breaks the law in this country does. We do not believe that you should set up some sort of police-state mechanism to check everybody’s wheat, but the individual wheat grower will know that they will be breaching the law should they attempt to export anybody else’s wheat other than their own.

Firstly, Senator Minchin—through you, Chair—I am presuming that, in response to my question about how we guarantee an individual is in fact only exporting his or her own wheat, you are not proposing any checking mechanism, which I have some concerns about. My second question was about amendments (4) to (6). As I understand it—and I can totally understand why this is—you have individual wheat growers who are exporting who are exempt from the accreditation process. I would have thought that they were then automatically exempt from compliance with the accreditation process. That is why I am questioning those particular amendments. I am presuming that the other amendments in there dealing with bags or containers are because wheat exporters who are exporting bulk wheat may also export in bags and containers, and therefore this bill is saying, ‘You don’t have to report against those but you have to report the rest.’ Maybe I am confused. I am asking why we are putting the individuals in there when quite plainly if this amendment goes through they will be exempt from the requirements of accreditation.

Of course, as you know, Senator, for quite some time the current regime regarding bulk wheat export has not applied to the export of wheat in bag or containers not capable of holding more than 50 tonnes of wheat. That has been the case for a very long time. The government, properly, is ensuring that such exports continue to be exempt from this operation. We want to exempt not only that sort of export of wheat but wheat exported by the producer of the wheat. Based on advice, the best way to do that and ensure they are not caught up in the accreditation process is to include these amendments.

We do not accept that; we do think they are honest farmers.

I do not quite know who to pose this question to but I think I will pose it to the minister. It has been stated here tonight that the passage of title in wheat is the same as the passage of title in other goods—such as cattle, I presume. Do you believe that to be the case?

For goods such as cattle, the title passes with the payment for the goods, which is generally underwritten by the stock and station agent. However, with the passage of wheat you become an unsecured creditor, so the farmer is an unsecured creditor for the product. It is intrinsically different. So to put the proposition that the law that you use to claim recourse for nonpayment for such items as cattle and sheep is the same law that you use to claim recourse for the nonpayment for such items as wheat is intrinsically wrong. With one you can redeem your property and with the other one you stand in line as an unsecured creditor. Do you believe that to be the case or not?

I should note that in the bill it does not say the WEA will regularly review; there is just a requirement for annual reports from exporters and powers to direct audits and seek information. I would like to see a clarification of what ‘regularly review’ means, and does the minister have something broader in mind than what the bill says?

I am sure wheat growers would like to know that there is going to be a guarantee the minister will keep an eye on what is going on and take appropriate action. Last time, as you are aware, that did not seem to be the case.

The two I am most familiar with are APRA and ASIC. The minister will be keeping a very close eye on things, I am sure, given the nature of the changed arrangements that are being debated tonight and will follow once the legislation is passed. Knowing the minister as I do, he will be keeping the entire process under very, very close check.

That is the position. I think it is a very robust and considered process. It does not seem to me to be in any way an unreasonable process of consideration then recommendation to the minister—I think it is very sound.

Thank you for answering the question, Minister. You have now confirmed that no-one on the board need necessarily have any experience in wheat, and the board could be totally selected without anyone having any experience in wheat. Yet this is the body that is going to have the Australian wheat industry in its hands. Do you propose to review this legislation in the future to have more of a nexus between the

I suggest you wait until you see the individuals that are appointed and take your considered view then as to whether you believe they are appropriate or not. We have a very sound group of three individuals who make the assessments against the criteria and give them to the minister. I think that is as robust a process as I have seen anywhere in any appointment process in terms of an authority. If you wanted X nominee on, you could have prepared an amendment. We do not have an amendment before the chair. Or you could have convinced the Liberal Party to put that. As I understand it, this has not been an issue of contention and has not been raised so far. I am not surprised because we consider the selection process analysis is robust.

In fact, I will be voting against the legislation and have done so so far. Seeing that the selection panel does not include a wheat grower and the board that it will select might not necessarily include a wheat grower either, can you please tell me what qualifications you see as being essential, or is it the case that no qualifications will be required? If qualifications are not required, are there going to be any criteria to ascertain experience, and are you going to table them so that we can have a transparent look at the selection criteria process by which the board members will be selected? That is a good enough start.

I suspect that they might in the short term, because it might be politically prudent. We have also determined that there are no criteria for experience or qualifications set out in the selection of this board. So, in the selection panel’s recommendations to you, how will you ascertain what is appropriate and what is not?

At the beginning of your questioning I drew your attention to clause 41. Your claim is not correct, Senator Joyce. I do not know whether you are forgetting the response I gave to the first question—that is, that it is in clause 41. Then I went through and gave you an outline of the process and the individuals involved. I also gave you the background of Dr Laker, to my knowledge. I think we have fully answered the question. I do not see this process as being any different from the appointments to most boards that I am familiar with in the Commonwealth government sector.

I do not agree, but I understand why, because I have seen you questioning ABARE at estimates. I cannot give you the final survey forms or criteria for collection or the way in which the data will be presented. I cannot give you that tonight. I would be confident with respect to the ABS and the work that it will do with the growers. ABARE will be involved. But ABS has always done a first-class job with statistical data gathering and presentation. Beyond that commitment I cannot give you any further information on it tonight.

This was identified during the inquiry as a critical element and a critical need. So I am seeking the clarification that the government is not just going to set this in place and then not worry about it until the review process is undertaken.

Having some understanding of the way in which ABS collect data, and the way they have done it in other areas, I would have great confidence in their ability to collect the correct data and to design the form in which the material collection is presented—some of it may be electronic—because this would be a new data series, presumably. And then they may change the way that it is collected. That is part of their normal process for any data collection. I cannot give you any detail beyond that. Perhaps I could give you more information. We could approach the ABS to give us a report about where they are up to at this point in time, how they believe the data will be collected and the form it will be presented in. It is probably a bit early. We are halfway through the year, and it is due for completion in December. The consultations with the wheat industry are not concluded. But we have confidence in the ABS to do the work. If we get some further update about how it will be done and the form it will be presented in before December then I will be very happy to provide that.

If it is just noted on the record, I do not mind, but I am noting now that I see amendment (1) as intrinsically different to the following amendments. Amendment (1) goes to the whole substance of the bill. I feel the bill is not responsive to nor does it advance the interests of wheat growers, and we have proved tonight that it is technically inadequate. It certainly does not reflect the overall sentiment of wheat growers. So I would not be supporting amendment (1). With the following amendments, though I feel they are not so much non-controversial as inconsequential, I will support them as a mechanism to ventilate this issue further.
