         I thank Senator Madigan for his question on our climate change policy. I will start by indicating that wind farms are a very cost-effective form of renewable energy and they are already cutting carbon pollution.

           I will not take the interjections from those opposite because Senator Madigan does deserve an answer in this area. The Waubra wind farm is a significant local investment in rural Victoria and it is having a positive effect on the regional economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Waubra wind farm was accredited under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_Energy" rel="nofollow">
            Renewable Energy
           </a>
           (Electricity) Act 2000 on 10 March 2009 by the Renewable Energy Regulator. Like all applications for the accreditation of a power station, it was required to submit extensive documentation and to demonstrate compliance with state or territory planning laws. The regulator then takes that information into account in accrediting power stations and gets regular information from power stations about a range of issues, including ongoing compliance. However, it is important to remember that the Clean Energy Regulator is not there to enforce state and territory planning requirements. States and territories do have a wide range of powers to ensure power stations comply with the wide-ranging requirements that they are subject to under state and territory laws. To require, as seems to be the premise of the question, the Clean Energy Regulator to enforce state and territory legislation would undermine the proper allocation of jurisdictional responsibility between state and federal governments and add unnecessary red tape to clean energy investments. A duplication of regulation and confused lines of responsibilities would in fact ensue. Clearly, there are—

               The regulator is aware of the allegations which you have raised and is investigating the issue further, including talks with state authorities to that effect. However, to date, the Clean Energy Regulator has not made any determination that the Waubra farm has breached the

                Renewable Energy

               (Electricity) Act 2000 and it is important in those circumstances not to prejudge. The regulator has thorough processes for ensuring compliance with his legislation and investigating any potential breaches. The act was comprehensively reviewed by the

                 What we should not do is get ahead of the investigations or prejudge in these circumstances. To date, nothing has been proved about the accreditation of the power stations and there is no evidence of widespread fraud in the renewable energy certificate market. The regulator takes the integrity of the renewable energy certificate market very seriously and has strong enforcement powers for matters within his responsibility. The scheme has been highly successful over the last 10 years and during its time it has continued to maintain bipartisan support. However, it is not the regulator's responsibility to enforce state and territory planning legislation. But, as I indicated earlier in my answer to the first supplementary question, it is a matter that is being looked at by the regulator and they do take it very seriously.
