        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing in the Senate, Senator Farrell. Minister, two-thirds of renters are experiencing rental stress. For many renters, one more unlimited increase to their rent will mean that they have to leave their home, and some will be priced out of the private rental market altogether. If there are no limits to the amount that rents can be increased, it won't matter how much public and affordable housing is delivered through the Housing Australia Future Fund. Unless we stop rents skyrocketing, wait lists for public housing will blow out and we won't be able to tackle the housing crisis. On the weekend, the government put money on the table through the National Cabinet in return for changes in planning laws. Minister, do the government accept that they can also do this to coordinate a rent freeze, just as the Greens have proposed?

          I thank Senator Faruqi for her question. I have to say, Senator, on an historic day in this place, when we pass a piece of legislation that allows for, finally, a referendum on recognition of

We know that after their nine years of failing to do anything about it we're finally doing something about it. We're proposing to spend $10 billion on fixing this problem—

                                           It's good to be back here after a week on the sidelines. My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and Minister for Homelessness, Senator Farrell. All senators in this place would be aware of the housing affordability challenges currently facing Australians. Thankfully, after a decade of inaction, the Albanese Labor government has an ambitious agenda to deliver more affordable homes. Can the minister, please, update the Senate on the immediate steps that the Albanese government is taking to deliver on more social housing rental homes for Australians who need them?

                                            I thank Senator Ciccone. It's good to see you back. Unlike the Greens, I know that you are serious about dealing with the issue of housing costs and homelessness. And, of course, the Albanese government wants every Australian to have a roof over their head.

                                            Fundamental to tackling the country's housing challenges is increasing the supply of new housing. Just this week, we announced $2 billion in social housing accelerator, which will deliver new social, rental homes right across this country, including in Victoria, your home state. This money will be flowing to the states and territories within weeks and must be committed within two years to deliver thousands—I repeat, thousands—of new social housing homes to rent right across the country.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            Funding has been to ensure a minimum of $50 million for each state and territory. States will have the flexibility in how to permanently boost social housing stocks, including new builds, expanding existing programs or renovating or refurbishing existing but uninhabitable stock to bring it back to supply.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            This investment will mean life-changing new homes for Australians currently on social housing waiting lists right across the country. This $2 billion social housing accelerator is in addition to our ambitious housing reform agenda that builds on the commitment of the Albanese government to deliver the housing that Australians desperately need.

                                              I thank the minister for the very comprehensive answer, and it is reassuring to hear that the Labor Party is taking serious action on housing affordability in this country. It is a pity that the same can't be said of those opposite and those on the crossbench. Minister, can you, please, update the Senate on some of the other important measures that make up the ambitious housing reform agenda of the Albanese government and how they are addressing housing challenges for all Australians?

                                               Yes, I can, Senator Ciccone. The Albanese government has hit the ground running on housing, delivering immediate action along with an ambitious reform agenda. As well as the $2 billion social housing accelerator and the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund—which was rejected by the Greens today—in the budget we increased the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent. We've added an additional $2 billion in financing for more social and affordable rental housing through the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, we've created new incentives to boost the supply of built-to-rent accommodation and we've expanded eligibility criteria for the Home Guarantee Scheme. We've also delivered a $67.5 million boost to homelessness funding to states and territories—

                                                   I know you're embarrassed! I know you're both embarrassed in the Greens-coalition coalition. Sadly, there is a cost for these actions, and it's a cost Australians will pay for the Greens teaming up with the coalition. For every day of delay, more than $1.3 million does not go to new social and affordable rental housing for Australians. But the greater cost is to the Australians who need these homes—the women and children trying to escape family violence.
