         I thank Senator Ludlam for his ongoing interest. The Gillard government is extremely disappointed that the tender process was compromised by leaks. This was a significant commercial contract involving up to $223.1 million of taxpayers' money and it was important that both cabinet and the general public could have confidence in the process. This is why the Gillard government has called in the

           to investigate the leaks which have necessitated the termination of the tender process. I would like to emphasise that at all times the government has acted within the terms and conditions of the tender process. The

           On 23 November 2010 the government announced it would put out the Australia Network to open tender for a 10-year contract. The contract was for a maximum of $223.1 million, excluding

            GST
           </a>
           , which represented the current contract cost of $94.2 million over five years, with an adjustment for inflation. The request for tender was released on 4 February and closed on 25 March 2011. On 24 June 2011 the government announced an extension to the tender to ensure the national interest would be addressed more broadly. Among these changes were the importance of key emerging markets on the global economy, significant political transformation occurring across the

              (Victoria—) (): The need identified during a recent consular crisis is for strengthened information services. Both tenderers were given an equal and reasonable opportunity to respond to the additional criterion. At that time, cabinet also decided to appoint me as the approver and that the decision should be referred for cabinet consideration. The amended request for tender closed on 27 July 2011 and on 17 October an article appeared in the press which contained significant leaks of information from the tender process. On 27 October the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet wrote to the

               Australian Federal Police

              requesting an investigation into the leaks. As a result of the leaks, the government sought advice from the

               Australian Government Solicitor

              who indicated there is a possibility that the current process may in some way be tainted or corrupted such that it is not possible that a fair and equitable outcome can be achieved. The advice went on to say that it was open to the government to decide—

                     , on the point of order: the minister could not be more directly relevant to the question. The minister is making a statement to parliament. He is taking the Senate through the steps and explaining the process quite thoroughly. If those opposite, including the Greens, did listen to Senator Conroy, they would find he is taking us through this circumstance in great detail.

                       As I was saying, the advice said it was open to the government to decide to terminate the tender process on public interest grounds on the basis that a fair and defensible tender process outcome now may not be able to be achieved. The government will now consider the full range of options for the awarding of this contract and will make a decision no later than March next year. As I have said, the government is extremely disappointed that these leaks have occurred and that the tender process has been compromised. However, the government has taken the decision that it is in the public interest that the process be terminated. Put simply: it is no longer possible to be certain what each bidder knew about their rival's bid. This decision has not been taken lightly, but the government acted on the legal advice it had received from the

                         The government received the advice that the tender had been potentially compromised and decided to act accordingly to terminate the tender process. We believe it is the right decision in the national interest and in the interests of both bidders. The tender process has been cancelled and is now the subject of an

                         To the point that has been raised—and I think Senator Birmingham also added this in the series of questions he asked—the first reports concerning the details of the tender process contained significant inaccuracies, which did not justify a referral to the AFP for investigation.

                            , I have further supplementary questions. Like Senator Ludlam, I will ask some other questions and hope to get an answer on this occasion. Firstly, I again very directly ask the minister: will you release the advice from the Solicitor-General that you have referenced in the Senate today with regard to the cancellation of this tender? Secondly, will you now support the longstanding calls from the coalition for this farcical tender process to be investigated by the Auditor-General?

                                , my point of order is on the question of direct relevance. The minister has used the first quarter of the time available for his answer merely to ridicule the person who asked the question and to ridicule the opposition. He was asked a specific question about the tender process. He was asked a specific question about how the government proposes to proceed from here. He was asked whether or not the Solicitor-General's advice would be made public. He has not approached any of those matters and you, Mr President, should direct him to the question.
