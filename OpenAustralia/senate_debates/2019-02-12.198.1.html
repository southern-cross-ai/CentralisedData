        I rise this evening to offer my most sincere and heartfelt congratulations to this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        Honours recipients. Those recognised by these honours are Australians from all across our great nation who have selflessly dedicated their time in pursuit of a better Australia. Coming from all walks of life, they are exemplary in leadership, commitment and resolve—three virtues animating the Australian spirit. These Australians have taken to heart the words of the old proverb which exalts us to be the change that we want to see in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        As all members of this chamber well know, I am an immensely proud Victorian and, as is the case year-in, year-out, Victorians are once again very well represented in this round of

More specifically, I'd like to single out my congratulations and thank the following Victorian recipients who have so significantly contributed to and strengthened the fabric of our society. To the recipients of the

       </p>
       <p>
        I also have a couple of particular friends that I would like to mention—personal friends—including Ms Patricia Vejby, Trish, for her service to her local community. Trish has held a number of board positions, including Commissioner to the board of the Legal Aid Commission of Victoria and Director of the Royal Victorian Association of Honorary Justices board. She's very proudly from the western suburbs of Melbourne and has made an extraordinary contribution to Victorian public life. Trish, thank you very much for your extraordinary work. I'd also like to recognise a very good friend of mine, Ms Felicity Frederico, for service to her local community. I've known Felicity for the better part of a decade now and through that time she's been a passionate advocate for women's sport, particularly women's football. She was the mayor of Bayside Council and, while she was there, she launched a program called the Grass Ceiling campaign to address the lack of female change rooms within the municipality's sporting facilities. This resulted in a series of redevelopments through the Bayside Council's sport clubs to provide women's change rooms. Felicity truly has been a tireless advocate of female participation in sport. She's been effective even in motivating me to be more active, which is no small feat. She got me into stand-up paddleboarding, something I will never forgive her for! I assure you, Mr Acting Deputy President McGrath, it is, in fact, a real sport. Nonetheless, I'd like to congratulate Felicity and all the OAM recipients. Congratulations again to all of these recipients.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to congratulate those that have been awarded membership of the Order of Australia for their outstanding and selfless public service. To the recipients of the

        , or the AM, in the general division—there are too many to name all of them individually, but I want to make mention of just a very special few. They are the Hon. William Robert Baxter of Rutherglen for his significant service to the people of the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Surrey Hills
        </a>
        for significant service to art conservation and restoration as a leading practitioner, scholar, teacher and mentor; and Professor David George Wood of Tawonga for his significant service to chemical engineering as a researcher, mentor and academic. Congratulations to all those AM recipients.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would now like to recognise Professor Caroline Finch of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldiers_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Soldiers Hill
        </a>
        . On this Australia Day, Professor Finch was welcomed as an Officer, AO, of the General Division of the Order of Australia. Professor Finch was recognised for her distinguished service to sports medicine, particularly in the area of injury prevention, as an educator, researcher and author and for her promotion of improved health in athletes and all those who exercise.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to extend my warmest, personal congratulations to those awarded the Companionship of the Order of Australia, General Division. This is an extraordinary honour, recognising our most outstanding citizens and the extraordinary work they do. Professor Rhys Jones of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_North" rel="nofollow">
         Blackburn North
        </a>
        received the award for eminent services to mechanical and aerospace engineering. Professor Jones has been the head of the

       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge and congratulate those most recent recipients of military crosses, medals and commendations, many of whom cannot be publicly named due to their ongoing operational commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is, finally, one more person who I would like to mention, and that is Mr Stuart Wood QC. I have known Stuart a very, very long time—since we were at university. He received an AM this year for significant service to the legal profession, particularly in the area of industrial relations. Stuart is one of this country's leading workplace relations QCs. He is gifted with an extraordinarily fine legal mind and a terrific sense of humour to boot. I have known Stuart for such a long time. He was slightly more successful in his classes at university than was I. Stuart, congratulations on your award. It is much deserved.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two special times of the year in which the government and the community can express our sincere gratitude to those exemplary citizens who represent the very, very best of the Australian spirit. It is an absolute honour to be able to stand here this evening to name and honour these dedicated and conscientious Victorians. I thank the chamber for its indulgence.
