       <p>
        I am pleased to table the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission on the annual report 2008-09 of the Australian Crime Commission and also to have an opportunity to speak. As you know, government senators do not have that opportunity all that much at the moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee is pleased to report that the Australian Crime Commission continued to deliver efficient criminal intelligence and operational services during the past financial year. For example, during 2008-09 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACC" rel="nofollow">
         ACC
        </a>
        made nearly 6,000 disseminations of intelligence and other products to partner agencies—an increase from approximately 4,000 the previous year. In addition, the ACC produced more strategic intelligence reports and more operational intelligence reports in 2008-09 than in the previous financial year. What is more, the commission has continued to refine and improve its intelligence and information systems and services which are well received by clients of the commission. This reflects the ability of the commission to appropriately target the dynamic and changing nature of criminal activities throughout Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commission has significantly disrupted and deterred serious and organised criminal activity with its continued conduct of six special intelligence operations, six special investigations and two taskforces in the period 2008-09.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ACC" rel="nofollow">
         The ACC
        </a>
        recorded a surplus of $8.17 million for that financial year. The annual report states that these savings arose from rationalisation of ACC accommodation across the country;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        initiatives, including contract negotiations and a reduction of contractors; reduction in staffing; vehicle fleet optimisation; and reductions in spending, including on travel and capital purchases. While the committee generally welcomes these efficiencies, one issue of concern is the continuing downward trend in staffing numbers at the commission, which began several years ago and resulted in a decline in staffing numbers during 2008-09 from 573 to 518. In particular, the committee has noted that the number of secondees from state and territory police forces fell from 103 to 74 during the period.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee believes the effectiveness of the Australian Crime Commission board has been improved by the implementation of the committee’s previous recommendation to include on the board the Commissioner of Taxation. While the board had functioned effectively, the amount of work requiring financial expertise and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        cooperation made the commissioner’s appointment a sensible one. The committee welcomes this change. Having conducted a thorough inquiry, the committee also notes the high quality of and compliance with the annual reporting requirements and the dedication of the people working for the commission. It is apparent the commission has worked in an effective and professional manner with oversight bodies and other law enforcement agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee thanks Mr Lawler and all officers of the Australian Crime Commission for their contributions to this inquiry. The committee looks forward to continuing its productive working relationship with the Australian Crime Commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to express the gratitude of the committee to two staff members of the parliamentary joint committee who have moved on to other committees: Nina Boughey and Danielle Oldfield. I commend the report to parliament.
