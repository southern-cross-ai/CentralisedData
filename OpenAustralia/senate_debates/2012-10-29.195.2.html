        I would like to speak further to the amendment, if I may. By way of explanation, I was speaking just prior to question time. To reiterate a little, just so we all know where we are at, I was quoting directly from the US Export Administration Regulation. I do need to say that having used the exact words of the legislation in the amendment, I acknowledge that the department, and therefore the government, is most concerned about the use of the term 'fundamental research'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having said that, I want to be persuaded as to why you think, in the face of what I will deal with in a minute regarding United States legislation, we should be more restrictive than they are. This is complex and I think everybody needs to come to this debate with an open mind, but having read those clauses out—and tell me if there is something I am missing here—I do not for one second want to see our research situation be any less competitive or be more restricted by this legislation than would be the case in the United States as I have set out using the words in their legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of people in the research institutions—and here I have taken from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Universities Australia
        </a>
        's submissions—have said that adopting this amendment brings Australia's system of export control into alignment with the laws in place in the United States pertaining to university research. Complementary resolutions would ensure implementation proceeds transparently in accordance with the transition arrangements through the round table process and endorsed by the committee. That is their words. That is what they see as fundamental. I take it the Greens are probably going to support the opposition in this amendment. That is why I think, Minister, it is really important if you see it as fatal, then let us put it on the record now, let us have the discussion.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also mention that in looking at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congressional_Record" rel="nofollow">
         Congressional Record
        </a>
        —and I had a little bit of time today to go through some of these elements—there is quite a detailed assessment of how the treaty should work and what compliance threshold and gates there are to it. At S7722 the Congress specifies that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the President shall certify to Congress that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Government of Australia
        </a>
        has—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (A) enacted legislation to strengthen generally its controls over defence and dual-use goods, including controls over intangible transfers of controlled technology and brokering of controlled goods, technology, and services, and setting forth:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) the criteria for entry into the Australian Community …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the record-keeping …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) the requirements for Exports and Transfers of United States Defense Articles outside the Approved Community—
       </p>
       <p>
        and so on. I am pretty comfortable with all of those threshold/gate type issues for us to comply with what the congress has intended. I do not think there are any problems there. All I am saying is that their regime appears to be reflective of the exact terminology we are using in this amendment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will finish this part of the debate by trying to deal with some of the material that Australian researchers have given me. They say to me:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        US researchers in accredited higher education institutions enjoy broad exclusions from export control under the relevant Export Administration Regulation (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAR" rel="nofollow">
         EAR
        </a>
        ) and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations" rel="nofollow">
         International Traffic in Arms Regulations

        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITAR" rel="nofollow">
         ITAR
        </a>
        ), for fundamental (basic and applied) research in science and engineering that is ordinarily published and shared with the scientific community.
       </p>
       <p>
        And here is that expression again that you see in the amendment. They continue:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our Defence department has taken a much narrower view of what can be left out of their proposed regulatory net. They only concede exemptions that are already written into the DSGL—
       </p>
       <p>
        the Defence and strategic goods list—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        items in the public domain and the results of basic scientific research.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the nub of the issue that we are seeking to ventilate. They say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian government’s investment in research, like the private sector’s, is largely driven toward achieving outcomes for Australia’s national priorities to support economic prosperity, health and innovation. As a result, the great majority of Australian research is pursued with some application in mind. The narrow definition of basic research in the DSGL thus captures a large swathe of research activities where there is low-risk and arguably no-risk for the transfer of information that would lead to harm and where the risk can be managed more appropriately and effectively at the institutional level with benefit of the disciplinary expertise in the university and in accordance with established academic codes of practice.
       </p>

        The paper goes on to say:

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Tertiary_Education_Union" rel="nofollow">

        They also have been talking to opposition senators—

        in its letters to members of parliament recently:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         “We are dismayed that the Government would seek to legislate such a radical reform without completing a regulatory impact assessment, or consulting with those likely to be affected by the change. The implications of this amendment must be thought through carefully before it is passed, and not left to be considered after the legislation has been formalised.”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        I am forced to say that an awful lot of material in this bill is left to regulations which are yet undrafted. There are no regulations but we refer to them constantly, and you will see that in further amendments and in further matters. It troubles me that we are doing this important legislation in this way. In other words, we are flying blind.
       </p>
       <p>
        The researchers go on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the US and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , and in other advanced western economies, export control over dual-use technologies is not entrusted to defence departments; in the US it is the Department of Commerce and the Department of State, in the UK the Department of Trade and Innovation.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are the departments that have oversight and regulatory power.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, in the US and UK we see that open academic research is explicitly protected from the type of restrictions contained in our Bill. The introduction of export controls in the US and the UK was also the subject of considerable public debate prior to their passage.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For example, in the UK, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baroness_Miller_of_Hendon" rel="nofollow">
         Baroness Miller of Hendon
        </a>
        spoke eloquently in the House of Lords when export controls on intangibles relating to controlled technology were introduced in the UK.
       </p>
       <p>
        She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         “The extension of the control of export of goods to the control of intangibles—the control of thoughts and ideas—is a radical step, unheard of in a democracy. It has serious constitutional implications. Goods are exported if they are physically moved out of the country. It is physically impossible to control ideas. But that is what the Government are trying to do. By virtue of Clause 2(2)(c), they are even attempting to control the exchange of ideas within the United Kingdom. It is for that reason that a solid body of academia is totally opposed to some of the Government's proposed provisions
        </i>
        <i>
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        I think we are in a very similar situation here—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         which are inappropriate in a country where universities have been centres of learning, research and discovery for over 900 years.”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the baroness's speech, section 8 was inserted into the UK Export Control Act, seeking to protect certain freedoms for academics. I will revisit and recite section 8.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State" rel="nofollow">
         Secretary of State

        may not make a control order which has the effect of prohibiting or regulating any of the following activities—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the communication of information in the ordinary course of scientific research;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the making of information generally available to the public; or
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the communication of information that is generally available to the public, unless the interference by the order in the freedom to carry on the activity in question is necessary (and no more than is necessary).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2: The question whether any such interference is necessary shall be determined by the Secretary of State by reference to the circumstances prevailing at the time the order is made and having considered the reasons for seeking to control the activity in question and the need to respect the freedom to carry on that activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is where we are seeking to take the legislation, because I really believe that the two examples—the UK and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
         USA
        </a>
        —are very good ones. Their regulatory regimes, given that they are bigger countries than we are, have bigger budgets than we do, and, may I say, have more established—and I do not want to denigrate any of our research institutions—institutions that have been doing technical research for a little longer than we have. If that is the regime that they have, all I am saying to you, Minister, is that I am happy to come with you but you need to convince me that we are on all fours. If it is a constitutional matter in the United States—amendment 1—then I do not think that is going to satisfy me, because I think that is the nature of their constitution. I think we can participate to that extent, but the wording of, particularly, 9A(c) in this amendment, which says, 'fundamental research, which is basic and applied research in science and engineering' et cetera, is directly on all fours with what is happening in the United States. I see no good reason why we should take a step back in this important area of public policy. I am happy to engage you further on this but I need to be convinced that you think that this is fatal to the thrust of the legislation.

        </small>
        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Johnston. I will take on the task of trying to persuade you because it is the government's view that the amendments proposed by you would be, to use your phraseology, 'fatal'. Having taken on this noble task of trying to change your mind, let me get to it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Firstly, you quoted from the US Export Administration Regulations, both before question time commenced and now, which has given us an opportunity to look at that point. Export administration regulation 734.3 B3(2) states that in the US technology will not be controlled if it arises during or results from fundamental research. This provision was then used to support the opposition amendment (1) proposition to insert section 9A. We say that the quoted
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAR" rel="nofollow">
          EAR
         </a>
         and the amendments that flow from that in fact support the government's position, because, unlike the quoted EAR, the Australian legislation will not control technology that arises during or results from fundamental research at all. This is a critical point that makes us different from the regulatory regimes that you have looked at elsewhere. That is why no fundamental research exemption is necessary and, further, we say it would create a loophole in the bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         To reiterate, the US does not exclude fundamental research from the requirement to obtain a permit for the export of controlled technology. It is simply not correct to suggest that universities and researchers in the United States do not have to comply with US export controls. US government advice on this matter is conclusive. However, to ensure that there is transparency in the assessment that this bill does not disadvantage Australian researchers, the government, as already indicated to you and to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         , will support the Greens' amendment to the functions of the steering group established for the transition period—again, I think we have covered that before we were rudely interrupted by question time—so that the group's functions include whether this act, the regulations, and the implementation arrangements are not more restrictive than the United States exports control regulations in relation to university activities That would build into the legislation an accountability mechanism that addresses the concerns raised by a few members of the university and research sectors and, indeed, the concerns that you have articulated here in the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact is your proposed amendment would carve out an exemption to all the provisions in the bill to any person claiming to be acting as a researcher. If passed, such an amendment would undermine all of the strengthened export controls, the very purpose for which this bill is designed to create. It will mean that Australia will not meet the commitments made by this government, and indeed by the Howard government, under the Wassenaar agreement. It will also mean that Australia's defence export control arrangements will not be strengthened to the threshold required for ratification of the defence trade treaty with the United States and that the benefits from the treaty will not be forthcoming for Australia's defence industry.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to question time, I did answer in a little detail some of your concerns. I want to briefly look at your proposed clause 9A and take you point by point through the government's views of that. Your proposed clause 9A(a):
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … information in the public domain;
        </p>
        <p>
         I reiterate, information in the public domain is already excluded from the proposed controls. Your 9A(b):
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … information that has been, or is intended to be, published …
        </p>
        <p>
         We say that information that has been published is in the public domain and is already excluded from the proposed controls. The legislation does not regulate information intended to be published unless the publication will include control information. Your 9A(c):
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … fundamental research … basic and applied research ... where the … information is ordinarily published …
        </p>
        <p>
         The government's position is that basic scientific research is already excluded from the proposed controls. The legislation does not control the conduct of research. It is not appropriate to exempt applied research as this can involve the transfer of controlled technology overseas and it is only in this circumstance that a permit would be required to enable the government to assess the risk in supplying the technology overseas. Your proposed subclause 9A(d):
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … educational information or instruction provided … by a higher education provider;
        </p>
        <p>
         The government asserts that all education and instruction provided by a higher education provider in Australia will not be controlled. It is anticipated that almost all educational information and instruction materials would be considered in the public domain and hence not controlled. Highly specialised courses containing controlled technology may be controlled if sent overseas. Finally, your proposed subclause 9A(e):
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … information that is the minimum necessary information for patent applications.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government assert, again, that information supplied to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP" rel="nofollow">
          IP
         </a>
         Australia for a patent will not be controlled. I will provide a little further detail regarding the removal of the publishing offence. The legislation does not seek to regulate publications and it does not require publications to be reviewed by the government. The offence provision will only be relevant to researchers if their intended publication communicates specific controlled technology that is listed in the DSGL. Once DSGL technology is published in the public domain, the public domain exemption could be used and the DSGL controls would no longer apply. This would have the effect of decontrolling any published information.
        </p>
        <p>
         It does not make sense to require an Australian researcher to apply for a permit to supply controlled information to a researcher overseas but then allow the same Australian researcher to publish the same controlled information to the public at large. The publishing offence will have an exemption to allow publication of controlled information in rare circumstances when the minister believes that the public interest to publish the controlled information outweighs the need to protect the security of that information. We envisage that this will be a rarely used mechanism and in circumstances perhaps similar to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1" rel="nofollow">
          H5N1
         </a>
         situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         You will recall, Senator Johnston, that the H5N1 influenza was a fast mutating and highly pathogenic strain of the influenza virus, referred to in common parlance as the bird flu. Its rapid spread across Asia, Europe and parts of Africa sparked fears of a global pandemic. Despite the H5N1 research being controlled by US technology controls, the US decided to allow the public release of H5N1 research in early 2012 in order to facilitate international pandemic preparedness efforts. In making this one-off decision, the deciding body noted that the research did not appear to enable direct misuse in ways that could endanger public health or national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of this will be tested during the pilot program that will be conducted during the transition period and overseen by the Strengthened Export Controls Steering Group. Senator Johnston, the concerns you have outlined are all proper and legitimate concerns, but they have been comprehended by the legislative regime and the framework we are proposing. We are able to demonstrate that each of your concerns is either dealt with elsewhere or something that is not required.

          Thank you, Minister. Forgive me if I persist. You tell me that the legislation does not apply to information in the public domain. You say that is already dealt with and exempted. Are you are talking about the exemptions in the DSGL?

            You see, that is the problem. I am a little unconvinced because those exemptions are very narrowly drawn, as I said to you earlier this evening. They only concede what are already written into the DSGL The department takes a very narrow view of those exemptions. I do not think it is good enough to say, in the face of this legislation and in the face of what is replicated in US law when there is no such replication in the DSGL, word for word, that what I am seeking to do here is already covered because it is not.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to come along on this journey with you but I have to tell you: you're not taking me there when I have the words that they are using and our words are more restrictive than theirs. I am seeking to arrest that, and you are saying, 'No, no, no; those words are okay.' It may be that the roundtable, two-year transitional period and all of the things we are going to do with the last amendment fix that, but I am very much unconvinced if you are telling me those DSGL exemptions are what you are hanging all of this on.

             Firstly, I made the point earlier in the debate that the US system is quite a different model and regulates a much broader range of circumstances than is proposed by this bill. That will not come as news to you. For example, foreign students are required to obtain permits for using controlled technology during their studies in the US. In response to university-sector concerns, Defence sought advice from the US government's agencies with responsibility for US export controls on the regulation of the US university and research sectors: both the Department of State and the Department of Commerce. I have taken you to that in comments I gave before question time; indeed, I quoted the US ambassador and his own advice on this important point.
            </p>
            <p>
             The DSGL exemptions to which you refer and about which you ask are being used by both the US and Australia to implement the Wassenaar controls. Australia and the United States have, through the obligations of the Wassenaar instrument, the same list. We are effectively talking, on this occasion, of the two regulatory regimes trying to achieve the same thing. So we say there is no difference of substance between the intent of the US system and their lists and that proposed here.

             <p>
              The reason I read to you the US export administration regulations is that they deal with exports, which is the main mischief we are seeking to arrest here. Exporting is the most obvious way of dealing with controlled goods, and that is what we want to stop, but let me reiterate because I am not sure we are getting to the point that I would like to get to: the reassurance that we can withdraw this amendment in confidence.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I said to you just before question time, the items that are not subject to export administrative regulation are those on the control list. If it is a matter of the control list and you want to take issue with that definition, maybe we can look at that, but I do not think it is. I think the list is exactly the same. 'On the commercial control list that are already published or will be published, to arise during a result from fundamental research' et cetera et cetera. Fundamental research is as I have set out. It is qualified under a paragraph. The intent behind these rules is to identify as fundamental research basic and applied research in science and engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientific community. That is a pretty broad statement in the face of export-control legislation. All I am saying is that the exemptions in the DSGL are nowhere near as broad as that. They do not impact upon what is the direct mischief sought to be arrested by this legislation.
             </p>
             <p>
              I think that, for us to be on all fours here and not to be disadvantaged in our future research, we can fit within the regime that the US has set out because they are happy with it. If people have to have permits to do things, if foreign nationalities are issues and if things of that nature come in, we can deal with that. I think that is a matter for the regulation and the minister. But the broad thrust of where the Americans have gone is the space we want to be in, and I am just not sure that we are getting there given their legislation. I think we are in a much worse position, and that really does concern me. But I remain to be persuaded.

               I will continue to seek to persuade you. You are looking at the US system as a model. We say the US system is in fact more onerous than the framework we are offering. The critical point here is fundamental research. Our legislation is not seeking to control fundamental research in the same way as it is envisaged by the US system. An amendment to exclude activities conducted where there is an intention to publish would completely undermine the entire operation of the strengthened export control provisions, and it is a critical distinction between the framework offered here and that applying in the United States around this issue of fundamental research. I think that should give enormous comfort to the universities and research institutions with whom you have spoken, because ours is a regime that is not trying to control the conduct or outcomes of the fundamental research you quite reasonably are trying to protect.

                Minister, let us come at it another way. You are saying that the exemptions in the DSGL are going to be interpreted by the department, in oversighting, administering and enforcing this legislation, in a way that does not impugn fundamental research? I will get you answer that formally in a moment, because this is the nub of the issue. All of these researchers want to know that their fundamental research as defined will not be the subject of this legislation.

                 To be forensic about it, the US system seeks to control the results of fundamental research. This framework does not seek to control the results of fundamental research.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Perhaps I can assist further.
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_US" rel="nofollow">
                  The US
                 </a>
                 does not exclude fundamental research from the requirement to obtain a permit for the export of controlled technology. The US export controls are complex, and this issue needs to be considered very carefully. It is simply not correct to suggest that universities and researchers in the United States do not have to comply with US export controls. The US export control arrangements span multiple agencies and control lists, and that is one of the virtues of the Australian framework in comparison. There are numerous circumstances in which an export approval is required and numerous sets of exemptions that may apply.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The fundamental research exception quoted in the proposed amendment relates only to dual use technology in the US and is an exception only for the outcomes of fundamental research. This type of exemption does not apply in Australia because the bill does not contain any provisions which seek to regulate the outcomes of research. The US government has provided specific advice to Australia's Chief Scientist and the Senate committee on this critical point. The US government, the authority on US export controls, has made the following points very clear: there is no exception that allows controlled technology to exported out of the US for fundamental research without US government authorisation. In fact, with limited exception, export controlled technology used by foreign researchers or students while in the US requires government authorisation prior to its transfer. This goes further than the provisions in this bill, which do not apply domestic controls within Australia.

                  I follow you on that, but I am not talking about the export of controlled goods. This is a global exemption that gives comfort to those carrying out fundamental research, basic and applied, in science and engineering, not with respect to goods. Clearly, if you are doing research with controlled goods, putting the words 'controlled goods' takes it to another dimension. This dimension that we are looking at is where the goods may or may not have a dual use. But what we are saying is that it is fundamental and applied research in science and engineering where the resulting information is ordinarily published. So we are taking a step back from the controlled goods. I do not have any issue with controlled goods. Let's control those 100 per cent—get the permits; do all the things we need to do. But, when we are doing, for example, a vaccine for uterine cancer, I really do not think that the fundamental research underlying that requires a permit—and I do not think it does in the United States. But the way this legislation stands now, the way it as is broad as it is, with the really narrow exemptions in the DSGL, I think we are locking ourselves into getting permits for that sort of research.

                   The permits are only for transfer overseas. They are not required for research conducted domestically within Australia. The inclusion of a fundamental research exemption was raised during the consultation process and it was discussed at length during the roundtable meetings chaired by Australia's Chief Scientist. The roundtable meetings recognised that not all research involving controlled technology will involve the level of detail that would require a permit. The agreed outcomes recognised that some research might involve the transfer of sensitive technology, and that should not be exempted from legislation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The agreed outcomes instead proposed an implementation model which reduces the need to interact with government agencies on the legislative regime. This is specifically captured in the Chief Scientist's agreed outcomes as a model to be tested as part of the pilot. This model, to be tested during the transition period, involves academic institutions and a supplement to the Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research. It enables institutions to access technology and to determine when a permit might be required. The steering group will report to parliament on the effectiveness of this model. There will be an opportunity to amend the legislation based on the steering group report.

                  <p>
                   Our position, Senator, is that the regime proposed by the government is less onerous than that that applies in the United States. It is a model that is found in one bill and does not involve the miscellany of legislation and agencies that it does in the United States. The proposed framework of the government is going to be put through a transition period in which this parliament obviously ultimately has the final say. All of these things should give you comfort that the concerns that gave rise to your amendment are being adequately catered for.

                    I move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 7296:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    (2) Clause 11, page 14 (after line 21), after subclause (3), insert:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    (3A) If a person makes an application under subsection (1), the Minister must decide whether or not to give the person a permit:
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    (a) if the Minister considers the application to be non-complex—within 15 days after the application is made; or
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    (b) otherwise—within 35 days after the application is made.
                   </p>
                   <p class="italic">
                    (3B) If the Minister fails to make a decision within the period required under subsection (3A), the Minister is taken to have decided to give the person a permit to do each activity covered by the application.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I will speak to that motion whilst the minister is gathering his thoughts.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    This is the one where we are seeking to put a fairly rigorous scheduling regime in place for the approval process. In the event that the previous opposition amendment is unsuccessful in another place, we think that this one is very important because, whilst it is onerous—15 days for non-complex and 35 days for complex applications—we are asking the minister to not further inhibit the funding cycles, the research process, by getting on with the job on these time frames. I do not think they are anything out of the ordinary. I would be interested to hear what the government's attitude is.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Obviously (3B) is pretty strict: if the minister fails to make a decision within the period required under (3A)— 15 days for non-complex applications, 35 days for complex applications—then 'the minister is taken to have decided to give the person a permit to do each activity covered by the application'. So it is a self-triggering mechanism. If the 35 days from the date of receipt of the application expires and nothing happens, and the minister does not address the issue—say yes or no—then he is deemed to have said yes. I think that is a very suitable solution to the demise of the previous resolution—if it meets its demise.

                    <p>
                     I regret to inform you, Senator, that the government does not support this amendment. Defence is conscious of the fact that exporters require quick, clear decisions to be competitive. For routine applications, the assessment time is up to 15 working days, commencing from the date a complete application with all the supporting documentation is received. For sensitive applications requiring referral to members of the Standing Interdepartmental Committee on Defence Exports, the assessment time is up to 35 working days. DECO will inform applicants of this referral.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     There can be exceptional circumstances where an assessment may go beyond 35 days. These are cases usually raising very complex and sensitive matters of foreign policy and national security. It is not always possible to resolve such matters in the additional 20 working days, especially where competing interests need to be considered by multiple departments and ministers. While such cases are relatively rare, Defence obviously works to resolve them as quickly as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     DECO processes approximately 2,500 applications each year relating to goods controlled on the Defence Strategic Goods List under regulation 13E of the Customs Act. These applications are assessed within the government's time frame of 15 working days for routine applications and 35 days for sensitive applications, except for a very small number of very sensitive applications which do take longer—and of course they take longer because of their very sensitivity. DECO also processes approximately 300 cases each year under the Weapons of Mass Destruction Act catch-all legislation. Noting that approximately 2,500 cases are processed each year, current statistics indicate DECO has fewer than 30 cases that have exceeded the normal time frame.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Let us be clear: what we are talking about here is a very small number of cases. These cases raise the most sensitive of foreign policy and national policy issues. They are difficult to resolve. Many people and agencies are involved, and this does take time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The government says it is not in Australia's interests to have legislation that automatically allows the most sensitive and difficult cases to proceed without there being adequate assessment—a sentiment with which I am sure you would agree. This would have a very serious consequence if potentially dangerous technology was put in the wrong hands, and the kind of technology that could be involved might then go on to commit human rights abuses, develop chemical, biological and other weapons and, of course, equip foreign military forces—with implications for global security and stability. In these cases it would be very easy to say no due to the potential risks involved. However, where these risks can be properly assessed and where that assessment indicates that an export will not contravene our policy criteria, it is obviously in Australia's interests to allow that trade or collaboration to proceed. So I guess our final pitch to you on this one, Senator, is: is it better to say no quickly or sometimes in those rare number of cases to take a little longer but be able to say yes with a sense of confidence and assuredness?

                      You are very persuasive, Minister, and indeed I am persuaded not to divide on the voices. However, I make the point that I anticipate that those 2,500 applications will triple. I would like to know at some point, were the officials were to feel comfortable to bring to the roundtable the statistical analysis, what the time frames for those 2,500 applications are and what the average time is. I am sure it is much longer than 15 days.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Generally speaking, I am very conscious of the fact that whilst the department and the Defence Export Control Office do not have physicists, biologists, metallurgists et cetera at its fingertips, and therefore a very large amount of time is going to be required with sensitive and complex applications, I anticipate that the stakeholders at the roundtable will be quite demanding as to what type scheduling regime they are confronting. So, on that basis, I foreshadow that this consideration is a very important one as to the functionality and the way they do their business. Research often in educational institutions and universities is a business, and they will want to know where they stand. They cannot be put into the ether of the Defence Export Control Office for four or five months. That is what this regulation sought to arrest. I am happy with your explanation—persuasively put as it was—and we will not divide on the voices.

                       —and this may come as some surprise to the government and probably some relief to Senator Johnston, by the sounds of things and the rather peculiar mixed messages that he is sending—that we will be supporting this amendment. We were also persuaded. This might have come down as a bit of a lineball. I recognise that the opposition is basically creating an incentive, encouraging efficiency and encouraging some quick decision making for deciding on permits promptly and I do have some sympathy with the opposition in those intentions—for reasons that I guess I have made reasonably abundantly clear during the day.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       But we recognise that making that cut-off period for decision making automatic may have unintended consequences. I would tend to agree with Senator Feeney when he identifies that the ones that are lagging and are taking the longest are likely the examples that are the most sensitive that involve dual-use technology and might involve materials or pieces of equipment that could be used for producing weapons of mass destruction and it is unlikely that trivial things are going to be held up behind the statutory time frames that Senator Johnston is proposing here that would then call for an automatic presumption that the permit was granted.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       If there were real consultation between multi agencies, probably with international authorities or perhaps with groups like the

                        IAEA
                       </a>
                       —and you could imagine a couple of different scenarios—and the answers were not provided within time, my reading of this amendment is that the permit would automatically be granted. I suspect that sets up a degree of inflexibility that, in the wrong circumstances, could be quite dangerous. We believe that there must be some potential for contingency. The time frames put by the opposition, I guess, make sense, but not necessarily the part 3B that states that the permit is approved automatically. So we will not be supporting the amendment. I suspect, as Senator Johnston has indicated, there will not be a division called.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I cannot help but wonder what the fate of this amendment would be if the Greens had chosen to support it. Senator Johnston has dropped about a dozen hints in the last hour or two that he is desperate to drop the other amendment that the Senate just passed. I wonder what kinds of incentives exactly are being offered to the government here.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Senator Feeney was not able to persuade Senator Johnston to drop this amendment now. I encourage the coalition: stick by your guns on this one—bad pun, actually, under the circumstances. Stick with the arguments that you have put. That was well argued. I hope your arguments are sustained by your colleagues in the other place so that we pass this substantive amendment to this bill. Between us, the amendments that the government has made, that the Greens have made and that the coalition have put forward that we have supported, we will be able to say we have made substantive improvements to this bill. So I do not know what the dark hints about withdrawing the amendment are all about. I cannot support this one, opposition amendment (2), but I understand the thinking behind it.

                         Minister, I note the wording of this amendment talks about the supply from a place in Australia, and you then define at the bottom of the amendment the word, 'place'. Can you explain why you are doing that? I would have thought the words 'within Australia' would have sufficed, notwithstanding that that could be:

                        <p>
                         Correct me if I am wrong: I am interested in why we have gone down this path and what is the intent in this quite novel description of a place. If you could assist me with that, I would be obliged.

                           That is a very important exemption that I am pleased to see in this section but there are many other sections—can I draw the departmental officials' attention to—that could equally benefit from having that exemption put in. It concerns me that there are a number of places in the legislation where that exemption has not been put in. I think it would be good if we looked at that closely to achieve that purpose.

One of the benefits of the approach the government is adopting is that the steering group will have the opportunity to look at that very matter and, should your reasoning prevail, make those sorts of recommendations to this parliament so that those changes can be made.

                             Just briefly: this is one of those amendments that by rights should have gone to the Senate Standing Committees on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade so that it could have been properly assessed so that we could have taken evidence so that we could have put these propositions to the witnesses who have given up an enormous amount of their time and effort to try and inform this parliament of some of the mistakes that are being made. All I will say, as I have said on a number of government amendments, is: this has not been properly analysed. I will not be calling a division but I want to record my thorough objection to the way that the government is handling this bill.

Is that appropriate? It may well be, but it gets a bit nerve racking when you give all this power to the minister.

                                  We say, obviously, that it is appropriate in these circumstances. There are a limited number of decisions under this bill which are treated in this manner and, obviously, this represents an issue of potentially enormous importance.

                                  That importance flows from the fact that there is potentially highly sensitive content and the fact that it may involve issues of the highest consequence to government. These decisions are of high importance relating to Australia's security, defence or international relations and, obviously, these are decisions that any minister of the Crown would make only in the context of having the most thorough and persuasive advice.

                                   From that I can take it that if a researcher is doing work on a low noise oscillator, which is a very important component in a whole host of military applications, but that oscillator is used for a peacetime objective, then the minister can stop him without any right of reply from that institution or that researcher? In other words, Minister, a piece of fundamental research, basically applied.

                                    I guess that the first point the government would make here is that the offences of which you speak and which are created by this bill are delayed for two years, and that these are, again, matters that the steering group will have an opportunity to look to. I guess that I would repeat the fact that obviously it is a decision that the minister would not make lightly.

                                   <p>
                                    I guess that there have been recent decisions of government that are perhaps analogous; they did have important commercial implications for parties, obviously, but they were made by a government that was dealing with issues of enormous sensitivity. So I do not think that this is unprecedented, and obviously it is a power that would either be exerted responsibly or the government of the day would suffer the implications of treating it otherwise.

                                     Given that answer, I think that the two-year transition period is important. I realise that the minister has to have some ultimate sanctioning authority in this process. I just wanted to clarify exactly, or attempt to clarify, the length and breadth of that authority.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     I go to amendment 11, wherein it is set out that:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     A person commits an offence if:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     (a) the person supplies DSGL technology; and
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     (b) the supply contravenes a notice, or a condition specified in a notice, that is in force under subsection (1); and
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     (c) the person knows of the contravention.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     I draw attention to the fact that you have included intent in this offence. The penalty is 10 years imprisonment or 2,500 penalty units, or both.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     I do not take any issue with the seriousness of the penalty; I think it needs to be very serious. But the fact is that you have introduced intent into that, and yet when you come to amendment 12—and, for the sake of completeness that is:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     A person commits an offence if:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     (a) either:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     (i) the person publishes DSGL technology to the public, or to a section of the public, by electronic or other means; or
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     (ii) the person otherwise disseminates DSGL technology to the public, or to a section of the public, by electronic or other means;
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     there is no requirement for intent, and so what you have is an absolute offence. You have a supply, which is intentional, but the publishing and the dissemination may be inadvertent and the person is still liable to the 10 years.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     That greatly concerns me. I think that is anomalous. I think that you want to have someone publishing DSGL technology intentionally and I think that you want to have someone disseminating such technology intentionally. But I am open to persuasion, as I always am.

                                       Minister, obviously if he is applying for a permit he realises he is dealing with something that is sensitive and in breach. But if he does not realise that and he is out there as a researcher doing research into something that is not defence-related, but publishes something with respect to that work that is being developed in another area—and can I tell you that this is very common?—he will be caught under this section even though he has no intent to breach the legislation.

                                       This concerns me greatly. I do not expect you to make any changes now. I am drawing it to your attention so that the working group can deal with this, because I am absolutely convinced you need to put an intention clause in there so that it is, as I say, an intentional publication.

                                       You talk about the public interest. I note that is a very subjective term. What do we see, if anything, the minister considering in the public interest?

                                        That is a difficult question to answer, as you would appreciate, Senator. I look to the example I used a little earlier, and that was bird flu research. The minister is able to waive the requirements and introduce something into the public domain where, as was the case with bird flu, there was a broader, vaster public good required. I am unable to anticipate what the next example of such an occasion might be, but clearly the regulatory regime proposed by the government does contemplate those sorts of circumstances and the government responding.

                                         Thank you, Minister. I appreciate that answer. I go to subclause (4), which says:
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic">
                                         If the Minister gives an approval under subsection (3), the Minister must give the person the approval.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Why is there a distinction between the minister actually giving an approval and the physical handing of the approval, which is not a notice or a certificate or anything like that, to the person who is the beneficiary of the approval? I think this creates an unnecessary confusion—'You've got an approval, but did the minister give you the approval?' Do you follow me? I do not see that as necessary. Is there something I am missing there? Can the department help me with that?

                                           I turn to amendment (17). I am very concerned when you, in note form, spell out that the offence in section 10 relating to the supply of DSGL technology 'may not apply to the holder of an approval'. Surely that should have been a section, not just a note.

In amendment (22) you have used the expression again: 'relating to goods'. That is a nebulous broad term, particularly when the Commonwealth is exercising a right of forfeiture. I take it that there is no right of appeal and that it is not a reviewable decision. Thank you.

It related to judicial review and whether the minister's decisions around permitting were reviewable. Senator Feeney's answer on advice was fairly unambiguous as he said no. I test this proposition with the minister: does the bill anywhere—I may have missed it—formally exclude the operation of the Administrative Decisions (

                                                That was not actually the answer that you gave to Senator Johnston. So there is no formal or internal review mechanism enshrined in this act, but it could be judicially reviewed if the minister had made an error at law somewhere?

So you will not be able to point me to a particular provision, but you are saying that these things are regulated differently in the United States. My reading of proposed section 14A is that academic communication inside Australia, whether to a foreigner or to an Australian, if dealing with DSGL listed technology, would potentially be a crime and require approval from the

                                                        It would then appear to me that the definition of 'publication' becomes extremely important. At what point in the research continuum would a researcher be required to apply for a permit if contemplating publication of DSGL listed technology? If it is not at the point of publication then is it not the case that the minister would effectively control what kind of research could be done? Is this potentially criminalising the research endeavour, or merely at the point of publication?

                                                         The first issue is at what point a researcher seeks to make such a disclosure. I draw you back to the example I tried to use earlier in this debate when talking about the mass spectrometer. Where information is of a highly technical nature—in that example, if a researcher was indicating how the blueprints of that piece of equipment might be used to produce weapons of mass destruction—then obviously that is something we seek to have control over. If the research is going to the more mundane aspects of how that piece of equipment works and the technical arrangements around it then we would not.

                                                            </p>

                                                             … makes it an offence for a person to publish or otherwise disseminate DSGL technology to the public, or to a section of the public, by electronic or other means where the person does not hold an approval under this section.
                                                            </p>

                                                             This offence will cover persons who intentionally release controlled DSGL technology into the public domain. As a safeguard, the offence provision will include the ability for the Minister to give written approval for the publication or dissemination of DSGL technology if it is in the public interest to do so.

                                                             We talked about that a few moments ago.

                                                             The offence does not apply if the DSGL technology has already been lawfully made available to the public, or to a section of the public.
                                                            </p>
                                                            <p>
                                                             The offence will be relevant to researchers only if their intended publication communicates specific controlled technology that is listed on the DSGL—that is, if the publication includes the information that communicates how to develop, produce or, in some cases, use items that are listed on the DSGL. Once DSGL technology is published in the public domain the public domain exemption could be used and the DSGL controls would no longer apply. This would have the effect of de-controlling any published information. It does not make sense to require an Australian researcher to apply for a permit to supply controlled information to a researcher overseas but allow that same Australian researcher to publish the same controlled information to the public at large.
                                                            </p>

                                                             Defence envisages that the publishing offence will have an exemption to allow publication of controlled information in rare circumstances where the minister believes the public interest to publish the controlled information outweighs the need to protect the security of that information. We envisage that this will be a rarely used mechanism, and you have heard me use the bird flu example. All of this will be tested during the pilot program and will be conducted during the transition period and thereby overseen by the Strengthened Export Controls Steering Group.

Firstly, what definition of 'the public interest' will apply in this case? I know that is a notoriously difficult concept to pin down. Secondly, proposed subsection (2) of this amendment reads:

I am still not convinced as to why these amendments snuck in, to be honest—why the government drafted this initial bill, sat it on the table and consulted the hell out of it for 12 months without such an offence for publication. You would understand why, when attracting a penalty of imprisonment for 10 years or 2,500 penalty units—and it is my understanding the government is also proposing to hike the amount of money that a penalty unit will cost you—was not seen fit to include in the original iteration of the bill, I am strongly inclined to strike this amendment out. I am very keen to hear Senator Johnston's views on why that should not be the case.

Discussions with the university sector on the issue of publication commenced on 10 July 22. The proposal to introduce a publication offence with the ability to apply for permits was formally raised in Defence's submission to the Senate on 8 August 2012. Subsequent to the Senate committee's preliminary report, Mr Ken Peacock AM and Mr Alex Zelinsky raised this issue in all of their consultations. The result was their recommendation to remove the associated permit framework and to simply have an offence relating to publication. This made it clearer that the legislation is not attempting to introduce a regime that requires all publications to be reviewed for a permit and that it would be quite rare that a publication would have the level of detail that would meet the high threshold of concern. The publication issue was formally raised and discussed at the roundtable meetings chaired by Professor Chubb.
                                                                </p>

                                                                 Researchers and institutions have previously grappled with the balance between national security interests and the public good of disclosing the outcomes, and some examples of that were noted by attendees. During roundtable discussions it was noted by some research organisations that the legislation would in fact help to provide a framework for institutions when considering these sorts of issues when publishing. The issue did not feature heavily in the final roundtable discussion because the focus by then was on the scope of the controls. The narrow scope of the controls consequently narrows the effect on publication. The reduced scope of the controls in the institutional assessment model was broadly supported by roundtable attendees, I am advised, with the exception of one party.

The minister has confirmed that inadvertent release of DSGL technology or the inadvertent dissemination, which may be the erroneous pressing of the send button, is not caught by the provision. You have been very clear on that, Minister, and I thank you for that. But in this day and age I think we need to be a little careful that we do cover this provision, this activity, this potential conduct. People do need to be aware that if they are dealing in DSGL technology as defined they need to be very, very careful what they do, because it may be that they will be fighting off an application or a prosecution for 10 years imprisonment or 2½ thousand penalty units or both. Minister, you have answered me with respect to the public interest, and I think that is a very nebulous, subjective term. The coalition will be supporting the government's amendment, because I think it is necessary.

I am not at all satisfied and we will call a division on this one, Chair, when you put the question, because it is one of the more egregious amendments and one that I think would have been really valuable for the committee to examine. My understanding is that this issue was quite a major topic of the roundtables and one that was unresolved. The minister even acknowledges that it was not resolved to the satisfaction of at least one party, and I am glad to hear the minister acknowledge that.

It was not proposed that either publication or the wider concept of dissemination would be potentially criminalised. I think the practicalities of what this clause would mean for research should have been better contemplated. This is the sort of thing that we could have used a day or a half-day committee hearing to bounce off expert witnesses and they could have told us exactly how this is going to play out in the real world.
                                                                  </p>

On some of the advice that we have, because researchers will need to consider making applications at the commencement of the research process not necessarily at the point when they are ready to hit to print but much further upstream, it is not clear from the supplementary

Whereas I think we are assuming the rather more narrow interpretation of publishing as in it going into a peer reviewed journal. As the term 'publication' is used in other statutes, it is very much more broad than that.

We were not given the courtesy of examining this amendment during the committee process. We will also oppose it because it introduces a chilling effect, quite a dangerous one, attaching a 10-year criminal offence to the publication of scientific research, unless you are willing to tug the sleeve of the defence minister who quite frankly probably has better things to do. I think this is a very dangerous amendment to introduce at such a late stage into this bill. Whatever the opposite of commending is, that is what we are doing to this amendment to the chamber.

They now focus on the requirement to keep records rather than to make individual records for activities. This is consistent with existing good business practice of keeping records. Amendment (19) substitutes a new clause 58, which provides for the keeping and retaining of records. Amendment (20) makes a consequential amendment to the wording in clause 59. The amendments will reduce the administrative burden on industry and the academic and research sectors. The record-keeping requirements are intentionally broad and provide that the person must only keep records of the relevant activity that the person does, rather than making records within the prescribed time frame. The regulations will prescribe the information that is to be included in a record. The regulations are currently being redrafted to reflect these amendments. I commend the amendments to the Senate.

You allowed someone seven days to get their records in order before they were in breach of the section and you did not make it an offence of strict liability. Now you have done that and you have said a person must keep records so that a minute after a transaction or dealing has gone forward they have got to have records. What you have just read out is, may I say respectfully, completely the opposite of what you have achieved here. I am not going to vote this amendment down. I think it is a peccadillo in the scheme of the other sins of this legislation, of which there are many. But can I say, whoever is writing your script does not get it, with respect.

If only we had the opportunity in the questions to test that against some of the expert witnesses who would have fronted up and given you some answers. If they had, I suspect you would not have liked the answers very much. If the Minister has something to say I would be delighted to hear it. Senator Waters informs me that the opposite of commending an amendment is to either condemn it or decry it, so I will do both of those things and move on.

Again, it is an amendment that I am very pleased that we were able to get in negotiation with the government. I thank the Minister's staff and the drafters who have been scrambling around after this rather awkward process, trying to pull the amendments together. It is an amendment that is not satisfying enough to make me want to vote for the bill, so I will make that very clear, but as with the earlier Greens amendment that we passed, again in negotiation with the government, I am pleased that at least, I believe, we will come to greatly appreciate the fact that the Export Controls Steering Group will have move teeth than it otherwise would have had. We will be able to learn more about the actual operation of the bill. I commend this amendment to the chamber.

The government supports the Greens' amendment to insert a new clause 74A, which will establish the Strengthened Export Controls Steering Group. The government had tabled an amendment to implement the steering group but this amendment has a greater level of specificity, which will give greater assurance to stakeholders that the steering group will operate as agreed during the Chief Scientist's roundtable. I note that this includes an additional function for the steering group—to advise ministers whether the bill creates a more restrictive regime than in the United States in relation to university activities.

As this is probably the last amendment that we will be dealing with, I want to thank my staff, particularly Felicity Ruby, who has worked through the entire weekend. I suspect Senator Johnston and the Minister have put a number of their staff in the same position, to catch up with the mad scramble that has been dished up to them by a bad process. I will acknowledge without condition that it is rather a rare and wonderful thing that an improvement can be made on the fly to a bill by negotiation, and it is worth acknowledging when that occurs. I do commend this amendment to the chamber.
