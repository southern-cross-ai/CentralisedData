        My question is to Senator Abetz. I refer the minister to comments made by Senator Fawcett, recorded in the Adelaide
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        , that it is more important for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        to maintain Australia's new submarines than to build them. Are Senator Fawcett's views government policy?

         Senator Fawcett is one of those senators very respected by both sides because he came into this place with a genuine background in matters of defence. So when he speaks, it would be fair to say that a lot of people listen. Similarly, when he writes, a lot of people read and take good measure of that which he is suggesting.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is in the process of determining its position, and it is quite appropriate for people with particular expertise in the parliament to give us and the community the benefit of their opinions through op eds in newspapers or by making speeches. People from all sides do that. Does that mean that, as of necessity, it becomes government policy? Of course it does not. We have people freelancing on ideas and views from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         as well, like those Labor Party senators that did not want a carbon tax and who knew they had been elected on a no-carbon-tax policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         I simply say that Senator Fawcett is a highly regarded senator whose views should be taken into account and will be taken into account, but government policy will be determined on this in due course.

          I have a supplementary question. I refer the minister to further comments made by another
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          n Liberal MP, junior frontbencher Mr Briggs, who told 5AA in Adelaide, 'What work will be done on submarines in Australia will be done in Adelaide.' Given that this government refuses to rule out buying submarines from overseas, precisely what work is Mr Briggs referring to?

           I do not represent Mr Briggs in this chamber, so I think she has asked the wrong minister. They do have to be, as I understand it, supplementary questions to the same minister about the same topic. Regrettably, Senator Wong has failed in that regard.

            I have a final supplementary question. I remind the minister of the government's commitment outlined by the Defence minister prior to the election: 'The coalition is committed to building 12 new submarines here in Adelaide.' Can the minister confirm that the Prime Minister's refusal to recommit to this election promise in his recent visit to Adelaide is simply confirmation that he is softening up

             No, I will not do that. I think it is the absolute height of hypocrisy of the

              Australian Labor Party

             that went to two elections—one in 2010 saying that there would be no carbon tax, then to the 2013 election saying that they had already abolished the carbon tax. Then when we brought in the abolition of the carbon tax legislation they voted against it.

              I rise on a point of order. The point of order is in relation to direct relevance. The minister was asked about his election promise and the Prime Minister's election promise. I invite him to repeat the Prime Minister's or the minister's election promise, about which he was asked, that the submarines would be built in Adelaide. Why don't you put it on the record today?

               Senator Wong, you have made your point. There is no point of order. Your question started, 'Can the minister confirm,' and the opening lines of the minister's answer was, 'No, I cannot.' The minister is being directly relevant.

                Having answered the question straight off the bat, I am now outlining to the failed former finance minister of the record of her government with broken promises. As a former failed finance minister she might like to recall the promises that were made to the Australian people, day after day, about the surplus that they would deliver, and which never was delivered. That is why we have some situations to clean up—
