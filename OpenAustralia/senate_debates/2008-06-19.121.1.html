        and Water, in her own right and also in her capacity as the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I was interested in the minister’s litany of things that she is allegedly doing in the Murray-Darling. I want to ask her a question that will enable her to give a positive response now for something that can be done for the Murray-Darling. Minister, is it a fact that the

        , which, as you know, is part of the Murray-Darling system, is only at 13 per cent capacity? Is it a fact that most of this water is reserved for environmental purposes? Given the critical state of the environment of the Murray-Darling Basin, will the minister today guarantee that the federal government will not approve the

           I would have hoped, Senator Macdonald, that you would have enough knowledge of this area to understand how these arrangements in government work. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC
           </a>
           Act is an act under which Minister Garrett has a certain statutory role and statutory discretion. I believe that the senator’s question relates to the Sugarloaf Pipeline, which, of course, was stage 1 of the Victorian government’s food bowl project.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
            The Commonwealth
           </a>
           government, I should be very clear with the senator, is not funding any aspect of stage 1 of the food bowl project. But it is the case that the Sugarloaf Pipeline has been determined to be a controlled action under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
           </a>
           and it is currently being assessed.
          </p>
          <p>
           As I have previously indicated, the minister for the environment has a statutory discretion under that legislation, and it is not appropriate for me or any other minister to impact upon that inappropriately or to have discussions other than the consultation which is contemplated under the legislation. So I am sure that the issues that are relevant to consideration of that controlled action are issues that Minister Garrett will be taking into account when making a determination under that legislation.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
            Can I
           </a>
           say that it is an area where there has been some community concern, and I think Senator Macdonald’s question reflects that. It certainly is an issue that has been discussed at some length in the Victorian press. How best to deal with water availability at this time, particularly given the drought and the impact of climate change, which I discussed in answer to a question from Senator Kirk, is obviously a difficult decision for state governments.
          </p>
          <p>
           In short, I understand that the Sugarloaf Pipeline matter has been assessed at the state level by the advisory committee, and public comment has been received. The state consideration process has been accredited under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC Act
           </a>
           , and I am advised that at this stage Minister Garrett’s department has examined the advisory committee’s report. Additional documentation has been provided by the proponent and the proponent has been requested to provide further information. Minister Garrett will make his decision on this project only when he is confident that the proponent has provided the information necessary to enable him to make a fully informed decision that ensures that matters of national environmental significance are protected.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Minister Wong, would you confirm that you are the minister for the Murray-Darling Basin system, as you indicated in answer to a previous question? If you are, will you indicate why you will not take action to address the environmental health of the Murray-Darling Basin system? Water from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulburn_River" rel="nofollow">

            </a>
            can be used for environmental flows in the Murray-Darling Basin system, yet it is being proposed by the Victorian Labor government to take it out of the basin, over the range, to flush Melbourne toilets. Will you guarantee, as the minister responsible, that your government will not allow this to happen and thus put even more pressure on the environment in the Murray-Darling Basin system?
