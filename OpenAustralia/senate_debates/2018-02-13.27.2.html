        My question is to the Minister for Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. The National Partnership Agreement on Remote Indigenous Housing, which comes to an end in June 2018, provided over $5 billion over 10 years. What amount of Commonwealth funding is the Turnbull government prepared to provide to state and territory governments through bilateral arrangements?

         We've indicated that we will be taking a view similar to the one we've taken in the NPARIH process, which is that it's done on the number of houses that are required to take the overcrowding down to whatever notional level has been applied. So it's just down to the number of houses. Each one of the bilaterals will be based on the amount of funding that is required to do those houses. I don't wish to affect the negotiations, but I've just—

           Well, the negotiations with the states. That's actually who we're negotiating with in this. You should try to keep up, Senator. I've just finished meeting with the housing minister, Minister McCarthy, from the

            Northern Territory
           </a>
           , literally an hour or so ago, and the negotiating base is that we want to see what the Northern Territory government are going to put up, and they've put up some substantive funds and we're matching those funds. I indicated yesterday that the fundamental difference in the negotiation is that we want Aboriginal and

               The minister has been very clear in explaining that the government is negotiating agreements that relate to the number of houses that would be supported, and of course the amount of funding relates to the number of houses. He is clearly being directly relevant.

                 We have an independent report to guide the parliament on these matters. The independent report indicated that the funds should be on a 50-50 basis between the jurisdictions of the states and territories and the Commonwealth. On that basis, we are entering into bilaterals where we're putting a 50-50 basis on the table. We are currently in negotiations. The

                 government have indicated that they're putting about $1.1 million a year on the table. If that's going to be the case, and I indicated today it would be, then we would be matching that. That's the quantum of funds that has been broadly agreed to so far, and I'm looking forward to the remainder of the negotiations.

                    I can confirm actually that there's not $1.1 billion on the table from the Territory government, because I spoke about that today. They don't have a forward estimates in the same way as the Commonwealth does. They have an annual budget, and they've indicated that they have in their annual budget $1.1 million over the next year. We have about an $80 million residual, and they've indicated that the following year is about $1.1 million and that's what they're prepared to put into the fund, and we will match them dollar for dollar.

                             Listen, one of the normal things in this place is you would write someone a letter. You don't 'blark' in the media, 'Oh, I've done all these sorts of things.' So look, I will be meeting with the
