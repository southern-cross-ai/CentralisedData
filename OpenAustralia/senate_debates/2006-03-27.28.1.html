        These Guidelines remake the previous Guidelines with amendments made necessary by the replacement of the

        Subclause 2.2(3) permits the making of a program that seriously offends a cultural sensitivity, incites hatred, or vilifies persons on certain grounds, if the matter is ‘a fair report’ or ‘a comment’.

         The Committee

        sought advice on whether the second term should be amended to read ‘a fair comment’. The Minister responded that the Australian Communications and Media Authority (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
         ACMA
        </a>
        ) has advised that it was ‘not aware of the Australian Broadcasting Authority’s intention regarding the original drafting of the Guidelines in 2000’ and that the omission of ‘fair’ in relation to comment was either ‘accidental’ or ‘a conscious decision to create a different rule for the Guidelines’. In light of this advice, the Committee has sought further clarification of the position of clause 2.2.
