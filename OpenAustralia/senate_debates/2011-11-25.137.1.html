         The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Both items of correspondence were authored by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         staff. As noted in the ACCC's response to question on notice no. 708 the letter dated 13 December 2005 is a draft only.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The contributors to the drafting of both items of correspondence cannot be ascertained with certainty. The ACCC's document management system in 2005 did not record contributors to the drafting of documents.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The ACCC does not hold documentary evidence which establishes the precise reason for the component failure on Mr Groombridge's bicycle.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The ACCC did not fail to answer the question.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) In its response to Senate Question 156, paragraph 19, the ACCC simply made the general observation that written material which is not in its context can be misleading.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) That is correct.
