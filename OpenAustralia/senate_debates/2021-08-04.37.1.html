        I rise to speak briefly on the need for a federal anti-corruption commission. This is a major concern for Independents in both houses.

        continue to keep this issue at the forefront of federal politics through this parliament. Labor has committed to establish a national anti-corruption commission if they are elected to government and to advancing proposals to improve governance and transparency in federal grants programs. As for the coalition government, they really are a lost cause as far as the question of integrity is concerned. They have deliberately dragged their feet to make sure a federal

        Why hasn't the government expedited a national anti-corruption commission? The answer is simple. They are politically corrupt. From sports rorts to the pork-barrel car-park grants scheme, from dodgy water purchases to politically directed community safety projects, we have seen integrity standards plummet. The Prime Minister is no doubt focused on a new round of pork-barrelling for the next election. Of course, Labor, notwithstanding recent good intentions, has plenty of form at both a state and a federal level. After all, the first sports rorts were from Labor minister

        and her infamous whiteboard. Whatever the results of the election, the Independents will have to continue to do a lot of hard work in this area.
