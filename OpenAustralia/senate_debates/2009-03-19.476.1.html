       <p>
        by leave—It is with great sadness that I make a statement to the Senate concerning the death of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_soldier" rel="nofollow">
         Australian soldier
        </a>
        , unfortunately for the second time this week. I know all Australia was deeply saddened to learn that another Australian soldier was killed in Afghanistan yesterday afternoon Australian time. He was a specialist explosive ordnance disposal technician and was tragically killed while making safe an improvised explosive device. The soldier’s name has not been released at this time and his family have asked that we respect their privacy, given they have only recently heard of his death. It has been a terrible week for our nation and for the ADF, particularly the troops serving in Afghanistan. Obviously, it is a time of great worry for the families of the soldiers.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, this is the second Australian soldier to be killed this week. Corporal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Hopkins" rel="nofollow">
         Mathew Hopkins
        </a>
        died earlier in the week. I think everyone would have been moved by the photos in the paper of such a young man with a young baby and wife. They really brought it home to all of us. I know that anyone’s death is tragic but the death of such a young serviceman was very upsetting for all and brought home the seriousness and tragedy of his death.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the incident yesterday, 10 Australian soldiers have now been killed in Afghanistan fighting Taliban insurgents. We are deeply indebted to those brave soldiers who have given their lives on behalf of all of us. We believe they made that sacrifice not in vain; they have played an important role in maintaining the security of our nation and the world. I would like to reiterate to anyone listening today how seriously the government and, I am sure, all senators take their responsibilities in supporting the deployment of Australian troops overseas. We know what a risk those who serve on our behalf take and we have seen in recent times the terrible price they pay. I assure all Australians that all of us in the government and in the parliament more generally take decisions to support such deployments very seriously and only after great consideration, knowing that someone’s son, someone’s husband, will potentially pay a very high price. Unfortunately, 10 Australian soldiers have done so in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is essential for Australia’s security that we continue our fight to bring greater stability and security to Afghanistan. We should remember that many of the terrorists who have inflicted enormous suffering around the world over the past decade found sanctuary with and were trained under the Taliban. We must recall that, since 2000, over 100 Australians have been killed at their hands. Afghanistan remains a highly dangerous place. The government remains committed to fighting terrorism at its source. We cannot allow Afghanistan to yet again become a safe haven for international terrorists. So, however difficult the task, it is an important task, an imperative task, to ensure that Afghanistan is not allowed to become a safe haven for the export of international terrorism. The implications of this would extend not only to that region but also throughout our region, potentially even to our shores.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Australian government, I extend our deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues—the fellow serving soldiers—of the brave soldier who died yesterday. I know words cannot heal the terrible loss they must feel but it is important that the parliament and the government let them know how we grieve their loss and that the thoughts of a grateful nation are with them at what must be a terrible and difficult time.

         I rise on behalf of the opposition to support the motion moved by Senator Evans on behalf of the government. We also extend our sincere condolences to the family of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_soldier" rel="nofollow">
          Australian soldier
         </a>
         killed in Afghanistan yesterday. I have no doubt that all Australians, whether they support our presence in Afghanistan or not, were completely shattered to hear overnight of the death of a second Australian soldier just this week. We were saddened to hear of the death of Corporal
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Hopkins" rel="nofollow">
          Mathew Hopkins
         </a>
         in Afghanistan on Tuesday and another brave young Australian losing his life yesterday in the service of his country. As Senator Evans said, he was a highly skilled and courageous soldier trying to defuse an improvised explosive device to prevent it causing harm to his fellow Australians and to Afghanis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Again we are reminded of the incredible danger that our soldiers face in Afghanistan and at the same time of the bravery and courage of the young Australians who so proudly wear the uniform of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         . This brave soldier’s colleagues would obviously be devastated but I do trust that it is some comfort to them to know that the government and the opposition stand shoulder to shoulder in support of their mission. These two deaths this week weigh heavily on those of us who were part of the cabinet that first committed Australian troops to Afghanistan in the wake of the 9-11 atrocity. But we in the opposition do share with the new government a very firm commitment to this cause. As Senator Evans so rightly said, it does remain absolutely vital to prevent Afghanistan from once again becoming a haven for these mass murderers who seek to export their reign of terror around the world. So we on this side join with the government in honouring the bravery of this great young Australian soldier and we offer our sincere condolences to his family and friends.

          to add our condolences to what will be another shattered family, mourning and trying to come to grips with the loss of this fine young soldier who has died trying to make a bomb which was so clearly unsafe safe for himself and his fellow soldiers and

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathew_Hopkins" rel="nofollow">
           Mathew Hopkins
          </a>
          , which we mourned earlier in the week and which we now mourn in the knowledge of who he is and his circumstances and of the terrible tragedy that has befallen his family, his associates and loved ones. War is always horrific and it affects much more than the people who are sent by a nation in its interests. I reiterate that, while the Greens believe our Defence Force personnel should be brought home to Australia, we are 100 per cent behind the Defence Force personnel who are in Afghanistan. They are in the service of the country at the request of our government and for our nation, and our hearts go out to the families who were so grievously affected this week.

We are just shattered by it—you think about it and you are really just shattered at losing a fellow Australian, someone who has put his life on the line to bring peace and stability for we who are in relative comfort here in Australia. We do owe a great debt to our Defence Force on the front line and their families. Our thoughts and prayers go to the family and friends.

            earlier this week it gives an added spectre to it that two Australian lives have been lost. And the fact that this young man was defusing a bomb to make it safer for others adds to the tragedy and the poignancy of the situation.
