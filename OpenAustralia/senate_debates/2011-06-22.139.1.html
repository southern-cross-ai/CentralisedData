       Note that the undersigned support the current definition of marriage as outlined in the Marriage Act 1961 namely: "marriage means the union of a man and a woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life", and that we call upon the Senate to act in defence of this definition of marriage and not to permit recognition of any other form of relationship to be considered equal to marriage as defined above.
