       <p>
        I would like to express my reservations in relation to this bill. Australia's aid program is incredibly important for both humanitarian and economic reasons. I acknowledge that there have been concerns about the effectiveness of AusAID on a broader scale, but that is no reflection on the many individuals who have dedicated their time and skills through the Australian Civilian Corps. I believe we are at a point where we need to make a decision on to what extent Australia's aid policy should focus on trade and foreign affairs outcomes as opposed to individuals or communities who are in need of direct aid. I am concerned that shifting AusAID's responsibilities to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        will result in an even greater move towards the first option. While it is important that foreign affairs and trade outcomes form part of the broader picture, they should not be the sole or primary aim of our aid program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's aid program has doubled in size over the last 10 years, from $2.4 billion to $4.8 billion. However, there is very little ongoing parliamentary oversight of how this money is allocated. The desire for a specific committee or subcommittee to manage this oversight has been indicated by many groups and individuals over the last few years, including the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I strongly support these calls and I will be moving to establish such a committee or subcommittee in the new year. My office has spoken briefly to the department, who have indicated that at this stage they will not support such a committee or subcommittee. I am looking forward to continuing these discussions with both sides of politics, because I believe this measure is urgently needed. Australia's aid program should be open to parliamentary scrutiny for the good of our country as well as for others.
