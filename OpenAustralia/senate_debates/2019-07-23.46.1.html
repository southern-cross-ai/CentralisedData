         Thank you, Senator McMahon, for your question. I know you are very passionate about strong and prosperous regions, particularly for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         From day one, the Liberal-National government has backed our farmers experiencing drought now and into the future. Our government believes in the productive capacity of our primary producers and the potential of rural and regional Australia and the seven million Australians who live there, because our government knows that when our regions are strong so too is our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's why we've invested more than $7 billion in our drought response, which delivers ongoing, immediate and long-term support to our producers and their communities, including: $266 million provided to over 11,000 farmers on farm household allowance; $40 million in additional farm household allowance lump-sum payments to nearly 6½ thousand farmers; $77 million invested in the Rural Financial Counselling Service, helping 4,000 farming businesses; $35 million to support more than 10,000 households in drought areas, delivering cash and vouchers from local charities; $131 million for the Drought Communities Program, to deliver local infrastructure and drought relief projects; $50 million for on-farm water infrastructure; $2.7 million for localised weather guides; $72 million on a special drought round of the national water infrastructure fund—and I could go on.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government has always committed to helping our farmers in recovery after drought and allowing our farmers and communities to focus on the future. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
          Future Fund
         </a>
         is a long-term investment in the drought resilience that our communities need. It is now up to our chamber here to show they are also on the side of our farmers. This week, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of the moon landing, we've seen one small step for the Labor Party; it's time to take the great leap and support our farmers affected by drought.

            Drought is, has been and will always be a constant factor in Australian agriculture. The establishment of the Future Drought Fund will provide a new secure and predictable funding stream for drought resilience into the future. The government intends to grow the fund until it reaches $5 billion, while at the same time drawing down $100 million per year from July next year to build drought resilience across Australia. This will support R&amp;D and innovation and infrastructure projects and deliver improved environmental and natural resource management to enhance agricultural practices. From the stump-jump plough to precision direct drill cropping, our farmers have always led the world in innovation, and this will ensure the next innovation comes sooner. Our fund demonstrates government's commitment to supporting farmers and communities to prepare for the inevitable future droughts.

               Last week I travelled to Dubbo with the Prime Minister to attend the Bush Summit, hosted by
               <i>
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph" rel="nofollow">
                 The Daily Telegraph
                </a>
               </i>
               . It was an excellent event that provided all attendees with an important understanding of the issues facing our drought-affected communities now, and also what is going to be needed to recover. To prepare now for the next drought was a constant theme of the day.
              </p>
              <p>
               In Dubbo, the Leader of the Opposition promised to stop playing games on drought. Drought has already cost our economy $12 million, and it won't be long before the national impact of the drought will be felt by all, even in Brunswick and Richmond. Already wool production and sheep numbers have hit 100-year lows. Our horticultural sector is concerned about its ability to plant and harvest a number of crops. It is likely that without spring rain our grain production will take a huge hit.
              </p>
              <p>
               This drought will have a significant impact on Australia's bottom line for some years to come.
