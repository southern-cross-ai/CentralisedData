         Senators, thank you. I really appreciate it and I am deeply humbled by the confidence shown in me, especially being elected unopposed. So thank you very much. I intend to continue my presidency as I did in the previous two years. I am a fierce fighter for the independence of the Senate and the independence of the parliament from the executive, but also acknowledging the executive has a role to perform and the parliament should assist that executive. Equally, I will try and impose discipline on the chamber, as I have in the past, in an even-handed manner, and I expect that the Senate will respond likewise. Let's show the Australian public that we can be a respectful place of debate, of intelligent debate, and pass and debate legislation in a very constructive manner—even though there will be differences from time to time, I am sure.
        </p>
        <p>
         Could I also suggest to the Senate that, as senators think about the formation of committees—in particular, additional committees—we do consider the workload of the Senate staff and the institution of the Senate, so we do not have too many committee hearings, too many committee reports and devalue the workload of the Senate. We have a high reputation around the world for the way that the Senate does handle committee work and the deliberations and the findings of many of those committee reports. Equally, I think senators should also realise that senators have a finite capacity in which to serve on these committees and to attend hearings and travel to various parts of Australia to undertake that work, so I just do ask senators to be cognisant of that particular workload.
        </p>
        <p>
         And, finally, I am here as a friend and as a confidant if you need to speak to me about anything, if you need assistance. In particular I direct those remarks to newer senators. I am here in a very impartial way—a confidential way—to assist you as senators to perform your roles. And I want to make sure that this Senate remains a fine institution and I will be your servant to that end. Thank you.
        </p>

           Mr President

          , on behalf of government senators and, I dare say, I may say on behalf of all senators might I congratulate you on your re-election to the office of

           President of the Senate

          . It speaks volumes of the very high regard in which you are held in this chamber that you were re-elected unopposed.
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Parry, you have served the Senate since you were first elected as a senator for Tasmania in 2004. You were the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_President" rel="nofollow">
           Deputy President
          </a>
          of the Senate for three years before your first term as President, which began on 7 July 2014. In that term as President you demonstrated two of the great qualities of a presiding officer: you were firm but you were fair. And in the past three years you won the respect of all in this chamber for the even-handed and firm manner in which you conducted your office. You have been a good president, Mr President, and I predict that in your second term as President of the Senate you will rise to become a great president—one of the great presidents of the Senate.
