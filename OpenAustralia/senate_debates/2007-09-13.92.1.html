        My question is to the Minister for Human Services, Senator Ellison. Will the minister advise the Senate of action being taken by the Australian government, and specifically Centrelink, to assist those whose livelihoods have been adversely affected by the outbreak of equine influenza?

         The threat of equine influenza is a very serious issue indeed in Australia. Australia is a country that has a great deal to do with horses—not only through horseracing but also across the board. So it is of great concern that many thousands of Australians and businesses will be affected by the threat of equine influenza and the quarantine measures that have been put in place. I am pleased to say that, over the next week, payments will commence under the $110 million program that the government has announced. This is very good news for many Australians, and I am sure that, in Senator Joyce’s home state of Queensland, this will be followed closely.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are four main parts to the assistance package that we have announced. Firstly, we are providing assistance for workers involved in commercial horse-dependent industries who have lost their jobs or most of their incomes, and sole traders whose incomes have effectively ceased. They will be eligible to receive an Equine Workers Hardship Wage Supplement Payment, paid at a rate of $424.30 for singles. I think that is very important. That is the equivalent of the Newstart allowance, and applicants will be subject to income testing but no asset or activity tests will apply. The estimated cost of this part of the package is around $20 million. It is a very important part of the package, targeted at those workers who are affected by the threat of equine influenza.
        </p>
        <p>
         As well as that, we have the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equine_Influenza" rel="nofollow">
          Equine Influenza
         </a>
         Business Assistance Grant, which is available to businesses that derive most of their income from the commercial horse industry and have experienced a significant downturn in income. Five thousand dollars will be available for these businesses, at an estimated cost of some $45 million. We estimate that, over the next week, payments under this part of the scheme will be commencing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The third part of the package, the Commercial Horse Assistance Payment, is a fortnightly payment to primary carers of commercial horses and covers part of the daily costs of keeping the horses fit and ready for resumption of their normal activities. The estimated cost of this part of the package is some $44 million—and a very important part of the package it is.
        </p>
        <p>
         The final part of the package provides grants for non-government, not-for-profit equestrian organisations. It will apply to those organisations or bodies who are involved in equestrian events and other associated activities. Grants of up to $200,000 can be made available to help with the expenses incurred as a direct result of the influenza outbreak and resulting quarantine restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Centrelink will be administering the Equine Workers Hardship Wage Supplement Payment and the Equine Influenza Business Assistance Grant. There is a 1800 number for people to ring—1800234002. As at 9 September, the hotline had dealt with 4,400 calls. That is excellent work being done by Centrelink and its employees and officials, who once again are involved in administering to the needs of Australians in what is a very serious situation. I thank Senator Joyce for his question.
