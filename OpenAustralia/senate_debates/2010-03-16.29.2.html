        My question is to the Minister for

        and Water, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to Mr Rudd’s 2007 water election policy that claimed he would ‘accelerate investment in all water saving infrastructure’ and had re-engineering of Menindee Lakes at the top of the list. Why, three years after the release of the policy, has not even a sod of soil been turned on the re-engineering of Menindee Lakes?

             The fact is that there have been a range of studies undertaken already into Menindee. I look forward to those reports being finalised. I would make the point that under

             nothing was done in relation to Menindee in over 12 years in government, so for Senator Birmingham to come in here and say ‘You haven’t done anything’ really smacks of enormous hypocrisy, particularly at a time when we know that members of the National Party are advocating for less water to go down the river.

                    Office of Water having confirmed that all four lakes in the Menindee system are said to be filled with at least 1,100 billion litres of water, how much of this trillion-plus litres will be unnecessarily wasted through seepage or evaporation thanks to the Prime Minister’s failure to ‘accelerate investment’?

                     I would remind the senator that we have in fact committed $400 million to Menindee Lakes. My recollection is that some $38 million has been committed to particular projects for investigating this issue. I want to make a point about what the senator is suggesting. Senator Joyce and senators from

                     should hear this. If Senator Birmingham, as he outlined in his letter to me, is suggesting that no water be held at Menindee, what he is actually suggesting is that we do not reserve critical human needs—that New South Wales, Victorian and

                     irrigators face the prospect of zero allocations next year. Is that the coalition’s policy? If it is, I suggest you had better chat to your colleagues, Senator Birmingham.

                      , I rise on a point of order on the matter of relevance. The minister was asked very specifically about how much water will be lost to wastage through the lack of action on investing in infrastructure. She was not asked about flows in; she was asked about lack of action on investing in infrastructure and, specifically, how much water will be wasted.

                        It is quite clear from his question that Senator Birmingham is suggesting that it is inappropriate to store water at Menindee Lakes. He might want to talk to some of his colleagues, because what that means is no allocation for irrigators in the coming year and no capacity to reserve for critical human needs for Adelaide.

                           , I ask a further supplementary question. With all four of the Menindee Lakes now said to be filled with at least 1,100 billion litres of water, will this delay any of the planned infrastructure works even further, leading to even greater water losses because of the failure to progress these infrastructure works over the last three years?

I do not know how many more dollars than your commitment that is, Senator Birmingham—I would have to go back and check—but it is probably about $400 million. I just remind the senator that, if he wishes to continue with this ‘don’t fill Menindee Lakes’ argument, perhaps he should make sure he has the support of his party room. Honestly, Senator Birmingham is turning into the
