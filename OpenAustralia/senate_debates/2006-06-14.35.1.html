        I rise to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Fisher" rel="nofollow">
         Rob Fisher
        </a>
        , a much loved member of the screen production industry who passed away last month. I knew Rob through his work with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Film Australia
        </a>
        . Rob was on the board of Film Australia for six years from 1998, mostly as its chair. Rob and I had much contact regarding Film Australia. I found him to be a highly intelligent and committed person. Above all, Rob was a very decent man. I never had any dealings with him that were not marked by his professionalism and his courtesy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rob was a chartered accountant by profession. He entered the screen industry in the early 1980s, looking after the business affairs as the general manager of McElroy and McElroy. Rob Fisher was the founder of the First Australian Completion Bond Company, one of Australia’s leading completion guarantors. Perceiving a gap in the market, he established the FACB in 1990 and, within a few years, the FACB began grabbing a significant market share within Australia. By the year 2000, the company easily had more than 50 per cent of the market.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rob also pushed into New Zealand, where FACB is now the predominant completion guarantor. FACB has underwritten more than $800 million worth of production in

         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        . It has also made strong inroads into Asia, becoming the first completion guarantor to set up in Japan and having a representative presence in

        A memorial service was held for Rob Fisher on Monday, 15 May at the chapel of the Northern Suburbs Crematorium. A number of very moving tributes were paid to him by friends and family. Among the mourners were
