         report by 16 October 2017.”
        </p>
        <p>
         Just briefly, this amendment is to have the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Abolition of Limited Merits Review) Bill 2017 referred to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee, with a report date of 16 October 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just to explain this, while Labor support the bill, our consultation with stakeholders led us to the view that there is merit in holding a short inquiry. The abolition of the limited merits review is a large reform and should be subjected to a process and to proper scrutiny. The limited merits review can be accessed by parties other than network companies—groups like unions and consumer groups—and Labor believe it's important their views are heard by the Senate. The inquiry will be very prompt, with a report back in the first sitting week of October, and will not have any material impact on the work of the

         </a>
         or the broader energy system. I hope that the Senate can support this amendment.

          The government doesn't support referring the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Abolition of Limited Merits Review) Bill 2017. The government has a commitment to an affordable, reliable electricity system. To help put downward pressure on electricity prices, the government is taking action on all fronts. With network costs making up around 50 per cent of an average electricity household bill, the abolition of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMR" rel="nofollow">
           LMR
          </a>
          regime is a key part of the government's plan.
         </p>
         <p>
          The evidence is clear that the LMR regime has failed consumers, adding $6.5 billion in prices for households and businesses. There has not been a single occasion when the LMR regime has reduced prices for consumers. The process is seen as a free option for network businesses. A recent Macquarie note described LMR, saying currently investors are getting this as a free option, with the upside being it brings forward a dividend surprise. This view was shared by the Council of Australian Governments Energy Council following the review of the limited merits review regime in 2016. The council acknowledged at its 14 December 2016 meeting that the regime was failing and was leading to higher prices for consumers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Based on the clear facts, there isn't a need to refer this bill to a committee. I note that the shadow minister for climate and energy said on 21 June at a doorstop:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Abolishing the Limited Merits Review we support and there has frankly been too much time wasted over the last 12 months from the Federal Government to actually make that happen. So we are glad it has finally happened.
         </p>
         <p>
          So the question as to why the opposition is proposing to waste time on a committee is one that the government doesn't understand.
