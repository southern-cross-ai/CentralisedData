         I explained earlier in my speech in the second reading debate that these amendments are actually putting some expertise and TAFE representation on the Tuition Protection Fund Advisory Board to make sure that that expertise is there when decisions are being made about

          I'm going to speak to all of the amendments briefly. The key issues raised through the Senate committee's inquiry highlighted the unreasonable requirement for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
           TAFE
          </a>
          s to make a financial contribution to the scheme, given their low-risk profile and the fact that the states effectively guarantee students in the TAFE system. We're pleased that at Labor's urging this issue has been addressed through the government's amendments, and we note that the Greens also have the same interest as us in that regard. Given that the amendments exclude TAFE from making a financial contribution to the scheme, and we believe that the rationale for including TAFE representatives on the advisory board appeared somewhat limited, we do indeed urge the government to look at the quality of their appointments and the possibility of TAFE representation on that board.
