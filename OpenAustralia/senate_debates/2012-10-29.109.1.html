        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. Given that the Gillard government made an open-ended commitment in its mining tax deal to credit all relevant state and territory royalties against any resource rent tax liability, what is the dollar value of all of those royalty credits accumulated by all iron ore and coal miners to date which they can deduct from any future resource rent tax liability?

              Order! The conduct of question time would be much better without interjections. I made it clear that the interjection was disorderly and I did draw the minister back to the question. I believe that the minister is answering the question. The minister now has one minute and seven seconds to answer the question.

               are those released in the mid-year update, which is the MYEFO, where, as we have stated, the revenue to be received under the MRRT has been written down. Obviously the update would have to include all policy decisions taken to the time at which MYEFO was prepared. The senator can rest assured that royalty increases that have been announced have been taken into account in the revised revenue figures, certainly in respect of Queensland. I make this point, however, again: royalties are an inefficient tax.

                , I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The minister was asked about the dollar value of royalty credits. That is all the question was about. She has not addressed the issue of royalty credits whatsoever in this answer and she has not even attempted to go near giving a dollar value of those royalty credits. These questions are written specifically and we are entitled to a directly relevant answer, and in fact the minister is obliged to give a directly relevant answer.

                 , I rise on the point of order. If senators on the other side listened rather than made continual points of order during Senator Wong's contribution, they would hear, as indeed I did, that she has been addressing the issue of royalty credits. She indicated that the update includes policy changes related to, amongst other things, royalty credits and was highlighting the impact of some reckless state behaviour in increasing them, which of course affects the dollar figures that you are referring to.

                    , I ask a supplementary question. Does the government now concede that its promise in its special deal with the three biggest miners to credit all royalty payments on iron ore or coal, including future increases, against any resource rent tax liability has encouraged five out of six state governments around Australia so far, including the Labor governments in

                     This is the Senator Cormann line, which is: the decisions of state governments are all the federal Labor government's fault. This is your reason for supporting Campbell Newman's job-destroying royalty increase: it is all our fault, and he could not help himself. That is the answer: he could not help himself. I would say on this—

                       distribution review to look at ways to address the issue of states raising inefficient royalties. If the coalition were serious about this issue they might actually approach that review in a more constructive fashion, but I suspect that the day the coalition are constructive is a long way off.

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. Why does the government think it is appropriate to impose a complex new national tax on an important industry which does not raise any money but has provided a direct incentive to the states to increase their royalties to take advantage of Labor's royalty crediting arrangement? Surely even this Labor government must now concede that its mining tax is an unmitigated disaster.

                           A stream of consciousness? Perhaps a little bit theatrical, but I find it hard to discern what question I am supposed to answer. If the senator is so concerned about the mining industry, which I think was part of his question, I invite him to consider Rio Tinto's comments about the Queensland government's decision:
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">
                           We are shocked, surprised and very disappointed by the size of the royalty increase … [which] will further endanger jobs and investment in the coal industry.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I invite the senator to consider the Queensland Resources Council's statement:
                          </p>
                          <p class="italic">
                           It will mean job losses. It risks further mine closures and there are many coal projects on the drawing board that will now never get off that drawing board.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           I invite him to consider those issues when he next wants to speak about the taxation of mining.
