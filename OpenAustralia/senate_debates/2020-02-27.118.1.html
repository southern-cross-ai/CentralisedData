           Senator Keneally's motion is a stunt that represents an extraordinary attack on the integrity and professionalism of the hardworking executive and staff of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Home Affairs
           </a>
           . This motion, once again, illustrates Labor's long-held contemptuous attitude towards Australia's law enforcement and national security agencies. The men and women of Home Affairs work tirelessly to keep our borders secure and keep Australian families safe, as demonstrated through their outstanding response to the unfolding coronavirus outbreak. Further, it's their work that protects Australian democracy and safeguards the Australian values we hold dear. Senator Keneally is using her position of influence to attempt to bully and intimidate career public servants who've dedicated their working lives to serving the Australian people. This motion is a disgrace, and it should be withdrawn.
