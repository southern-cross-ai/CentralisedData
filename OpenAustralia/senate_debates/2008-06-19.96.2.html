          Mr Bennett is indeed a wonderful advocate and a great man of exquisite erudition. He has held the office of Commonwealth Solicitor-General for some 10 years, having served two terms of service in that role. I think it is fair to say that, along with Mr

          , originally of the Queensland Bar, Mr Bennett was throughout that period acknowledged as one of the two great constitutional advocates appearing before the High Court in virtually all of the important constitutional cases of the past decade.

He was admitted to the bar in 1967. He took silk in 1979. He is a former president both of the New South Wales Bar Association and of the Australian Bar Association. He has, as I have said, served in that office with immense distinction, fittingly recognised by the award to him in the Queen’s

          , whose appointment will commence from 1 September this year. I actually had the pleasure once of appearing with Mr Gageler in an electoral matter before Justice Kiefel in the case of Wheeley and the Australian Electoral Commissioner in 2005, when he was representing the Australian Electoral Commissioner and I was representing the former member for Moreton, Mr Gary Hardgrave. My professional dealings and personal dealings with Mr Gageler, although very limited, have been delightful. I note that Mr Bennett referred to Mr Gageler as his natural successor as Commonwealth Solicitor-General. His appointment to that office has the opposition’s wholehearted support and we wish him well also.

           I thank Senator Brandis for his timely contribution to recognising the contribution of both gentlemen, one who is retiring and one as an incoming law officer. This is a very technical bill, so I commend it to the chamber.
