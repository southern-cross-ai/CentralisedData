         The ABC

        has been making news, not just reporting it. But tonight I want to acknowledge a remarkable ABC milestone—certain that my remarks will not be controversial and confident that they will be supported by all senators.

       <p>
        In December 2013 the voice of Australian cricket,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Maxwell" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Maxwell
        </a>
        , celebrated a remarkable 40 years of sports commentary with the ABC on radio and television. Jim Maxwell is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
         ABC's
        </a>
        most experienced cricket commentator. His career has been extraordinary, covering over 250 test matches, including six tours to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Indies" rel="nofollow">
         West Indies
        </a>
        , seven to the subcontinent, over fifty Ashes tests and five world cups since joining the ABC as a trainee in 1973. Jim has also been a constant fixture on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" rel="nofollow">
         BBC
        </a>
        's test match special team for many Ashes series. His knowledge of the game, his wit and his conversational style of commentary have won him a legion of fans and made him an Australian sporting institution.

       <p>
        Jim Maxwell learnt his craft under the tutelage of the remarkable

         Alan McGilvray

       </p>
       <p>
        Jim has by no means limited himself to the summer game. He has been behind the ABC microphone to cover hockey at three
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Games" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , not to mention show jumping and even table tennis! Since 1988, Jim has also shown he is more than handy with the pen by editing Australia's longest-running cricket publication—the
        <i>
         ABC Cricket Magazine
        </i>
        or 'cricket book', as so many of us know it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that Jim Maxwell generously supports many community and charitable causes—including his important work as President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Club" rel="nofollow">
