        My question is to the Attorney-General. Attorney, this question relates to your statement today, regarding the Bell act. I will preface it by saying that you have been very clear that you did not instruct the Solicitor-General on behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        , but for the avoidance of doubt this question goes to your instructions to the Solicitor-General on behalf the Commonwealth, which, as you have acknowledged, is a separate legal entity. So, Attorney, did you instruct the Solicitor-General on behalf of the Commonwealth not to run a particular argument in the High Court in regards to the Bell act case?

         Senator McKim, you are right. My instructions to the Solicitor-General were on behalf of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth of Australia

          My initial instinct was that the Commonwealth did not need to intervene because, as I said, this was a revenue case between the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
           ATO

          and the

           Western Australian

          government. Nevertheless, I did have a discussion with the Solicitor-General. I do not waive the Commonwealth privilege in relation to what may or may not have passed between us during the course of that discussion. I recall that, in his appearance before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee last month, the Solicitor-General—if my memory serves me correctly—was also at pains to say that he did not waive the Commonwealth privilege either. Suffice it to say: we had a discussion. We had a discussion about whether or not the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Commonwealth of Australia
          </a>
          should intervene because of the issue—

            In regards to relevance and in an attempt to assist the Attorney, the question was not in relation to an intervention or whether the Attorney believed the Commonwealth or anyone else should intervene. The question was about his instructions to the Solicitor-General as to what arguments should be run in the relevant case. It was not around intervention; it was around what arguments should be run, which is a different question.

             Well, Senator McKim, I cannot, nor could the former Solicitor-General, disclose that conversation between us. I cannot, Senator McKim, as you will know, without waiving the Commonwealth's privilege in the confidentiality of its legal advice. You know that—you have been a minister in a government. I am not at liberty to do that and I do not. But, Senator McKim, if you care to examine the Commonwealth's submissions that were settled by Mr Gleeson, they deal with the very issue, which he persuaded me we ought to intervene on, namely the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">

               No-one is disputing that, Attorney. The question is: what were your instructions to the Solicitor-General? You said you cannot waive legal privilege on this matter. Attorney, given you are actually a serial waiver of legal privilege when it suits you politically to do so, will you now waive legal privilege, as you are entitled and have the right to do, and reveal whether or not you instructed Mr Gleeson not to run a particular argument in the High Court?

                Senator McKim, I do not waive the privilege, because I do not think it is appropriate. But I think I can answer your question, Senator McKim. The Solicitor-General was of the view, as I said in my detailed statement, that it was not enough for the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
                 ATO
                </a>
                to be defending the Commonwealth's interests in relation to what we have called the revenue point, but also that it was necessary for the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                 Commonwealth of Australia
                </a>
                to intervene in the event that it became necessary to argue the

                   Senator McKim, that is just not the way it works. That is just not the way it works. When you instruct a barrister, you have a discussion with the barrister about the case, and of course Mr Gleeson and I had a discussion about the case. Mr Gleeson in particular, as I said in my detailed statement, had a very strong view that the Commonwealth should argue the

                     Yes. We have dealt with this issue already in the substantive question I asked—at least, we have dealt with it in the question, not the answer. This particular supplementary question does not go to anything that occurred between Senator Brandis and Mr Gleeson. It goes directly to whether anyone from the Commonwealth or

Is the Prime Minister confident that the current controversy was caused by the Attorney-General alone?

                         : Senator Gallagher, when you talk about a 'current controversy', I take it that that is an intended reference to the Bell litigation, which was the subject of my statement to the Senate this morning.

                         What I have given is a very thorough account of all of the events in relation to that litigation—a statement of over 30 minutes, I might say—in which every step, every detailed step, in the course of this matter was addressed. And, Senator Gallagher, I have nothing to add to that statement.

I have not seen Dr Nahan's statement, but I know that the Western Australian ministers had a view as to the effect of their discussions with Mr Hockey, and that view is their view; it is not the Commonwealth's view.
