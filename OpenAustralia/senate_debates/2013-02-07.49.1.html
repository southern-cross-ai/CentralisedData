        I move Nationals amendment (4) on sheet 7336:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Schedule 1, item 2, page 8 (after line 36), after section 86AE, insert:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        86AEA Limit on purchase of water access rights
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The total amount of water access rights purchased by, or on behalf of, the Commonwealth since 2009, whether with amounts debited from the Water for the Environment Special Account or otherwise for the purposes of the Basin Plan, must not exceed 1500 gigalitres.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is about reinforcing the coalition's strong belief in the buyback cap. The buyback cap, as we have always stated, should be at 1,500 gigalitres. Buyback is distinctly different to the gains made from infrastructure or environmental works and measures. There is currently only about 250 gigalitres to purchase to get to that 1,500-gigalitre cap. Most of it has already been purchased.
       </p>
       <p>
        We note that the real economic problems that happen always happen by reason of people buying the water licences out of areas. We have walked down the path of being good citizens in trying to bring about an environmental outcome but we are not going to do it at the expense of the communities of people who live in the area. You can see today with the discussions of the development of the north, trying to make sure we get a northern development area, we do not want to do that and then all of a sudden forget about the south. We have a widely developed irrigation area in the Murray-Darling Basin. The actual purchase of raw water licences, general buyback, causes immense economic hardship. We want to make sure that we limit that and that the efficiencies, the delivery back to the system, come from environmental works and measures in such things as deeper ring tanks, use of laterals, use of trickle, more efficient delivery of water. That is where the gains are made—from weirs that give us the capacity to make water more of an environmental asset with less water because we do not have to wait for a spill event; we can actually create a weir that allows a spill event with the use of far less water. These are the things that we believe are important. I think it is absolutely prescient that the public clearly understand that the coalition's policy is the cap at 1,500 gigs. Most of that has already been purchased. We only have about 249 gigs to go.

           I would like to move item (5) on sheet 7336. I move:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (5) Schedule 1, item 2, page 10 (after line 35), after paragraph 86AI(2)(c), insert:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (ca) for all water recovery for which an amount was debited from the Water for the Environment Special Account during the report year for the purposes of paragraph 86AD(2)(b)—how that recovery achieved a neutral or beneficial socio-economic outcome;
          </p>
          <p>
           We do not intend to divide on this. We want to make sure that the amount is recovered—an environment special account during the report year for the purposes of paragraph 8682—and that they report back to us as to how this recovery was neutral. We have talked about socioeconomic and environmental neutrality. We need to know and the Australian people need to know how the government is doing this. At this point in time it is case of taking them on trust, and taking people on trust is a very dangerous proposition.
          </p>
          <p>
           The purpose of this amendment is to make sure that the Water for the Environment Special Account is achieved in the form that has been promised by the government—and by us—that there will be a socioeconomic neutrality for environmental outcomes. If we do not have this oversight, we have a strong belief that we are not going to get it and there will not be the delivery of the outcome back to the towns in such a way that does not decimate the towns.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have got bureaucrats running round the joint cooling the planet. We have over 1,000 people in the climate change department. Let's see if we can give people a job that really matters: making sure that we do not destroy the economic base of places like Shepparton, Mildura, St George, Bourke—the places where we live.

             I have got a question for the minister around allocations. It goes to how much of the 50 million allocated in the forward estimates will be allocated to a constraints removal works and on farm efficiency grants, bearing in mind that these are the types of things that I am assuming that our review would be interested in knowing.

                   I am clarifying that we have allocated money in the forward estimates, $50 million, with no plan for how that will be spent.

                    for her question. The government intends to spend that money in accordance with what we have indicated in the legislation and in the agreement with the parties. That is exactly what we will do.

                     I would still like more details on the parties and who is invited. We cannot get the details on what is going to be removed with the proportionality. I thank you for answering that aspect of it, that the majority of the $50 million will be going to constraint removal. Please outline how much will be going towards the study and information gathering that is clearly required to undertake that work.

                      That will be a component of the expenditure. I do not think I can give you an exact amount at this stage, but it will be part of the overall spending of the $50 million.

                        My understanding is that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority is required to develop a constraints management strategy. That will be done in consultation with the states and it will then be clear just how much money is going to be spent in this area.

                         I do understand the process. My question was: of the $50 million allocated in the forward estimates, how much will the construction of the strategy cost? Seeing we do not know exactly what constraints are going to be removed and where, yet we have allocated this bunch of money, I am assuming some proportion of the $50 million will have to go to finding all that out. Do you have a figure of cost for that sort of study, work and consultation with water engineers et cetera, and getting out on the ground to see the types of constraints and the types of work that need to be done? I understand you might not have an exact figure of how much that research and study will cost, but I believe that either you or the officials beside you will have a ballpark figure of what that sort of work would cost.

                                I am happy to, Senator Farrell. Could you confirm that the work of the constraint removal will be done by the various states? My understanding from your earlier answer was that the identification research work has been done by the states, and in the future they are going to be doing the constraint removal program.

                                 The point I am trying to make is that the identification of the constraints has principally been done by the states, though not entirely. But there is a process, and there is going to be a strategy developed. When that strategy is developed then there will be a course of action that follows from that which will involve the removal of those constraints and the spending of that money.

                                  I noted in one of Minister Burke's previous media releases that he nominated $200 million to be allocated for constraint removals. I wonder, in light of that media release that Minister Burke put out, and in reflection of the previous $50 million figure being talked about, why these two figures do not seem to line up? Could Senator Farrell elaborate on them a bit?

                                   related to the $50 million over a specific time frame. You are correct, Senator Joyce, that Minister Burke referred to $200 million, but that is over the entire life of the project. We are getting some confusion about the period: Senator McKenzie was talking about the $50 million expenditure; you are talking about an amount over the entire life of the project.

                                       That is good. I am pleased you object to that. There is nothing like facing the truth! My question is about the $50 million that is going to be expended. Senator

                                       has pointed out the proportion of what we will be thinking about and planning to do about it as opposed to actually doing it. You say that the Murray-Darling Basin mob are going to do some of the planning and thinking. My question is: will you be transferring into their normal budget some of the budget for the planning and thinking from this particular pocket of money, or will they expend their own budget in doing that? In other words, is this just a fancy way of topping up their budget? And you don't know the bloody answer because there is none!

                                          Bearing in mind that we are lacking a little bit of the detail on how the money will be spent, where it will be spent and how much the research to spend the money will be as a proportion of total allocated money, you mentioned earlier in an answer to Senator Joyce that the process has a specific timetable. Can you give a time frame of when various programs will be rolled out—as examples, the constraint study, the research that needs to be done in order to inform the work, when we are thinking of starting the work on infrastructure and when we think on-farm grants may be available to primary producers. I am sure we have thought this out a little further, given the amount of time and money that has gone into the consultation process and the desire of a lot of people to see this sorted. I am sure we have done some work on time lines. Could you please outline that for us.

                                              No, it is not to get us through the next election. It is to do something about restoring the health of the Murray-Darling Basin—something that was long overdue under your government. We have done something about it. Minister Burke has done something about it. This government have done something about it. We are trying to proceed to save all of those Murray-Darling Basin communities which you claim to want to represent and, most importantly, to restore the health of the Murray-Darling Basin. That is what we want to do. We have allocated funding so that we can do that. Senator

                                                 Senator Farrell, I apologise; I am seriously not trying to pin you down. When I read the bill I saw clause 86AG, which gave a schedule of yearly payments of varying amounts over time from 2014 to 2024. When I look at that I assume—maybe naively—that some work has been done to come up with those figures. I am not trying to pin you down; it was my assumption that we have put some money there and done some thinking behind how we are going to spend that. But I understand what you are saying; there are parties—little ps and big Ps, going back to our discussion yesterday—to this discussion which have to have input into the process, the basin states being a key group. So when I ask for a time frame it is because we want to know and our communities want to know so that the uncertainty that both the government and the coalition are keen to see ending in Murray-Darling Basin communities will not be strengthened. I do not want an actual date; just a month, a quarter or even a semester would be good.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                 How long, roughly, is the constraint study going to take? I do not want a start date. I do not want an end date. Is it six months, is it a year, is it 18 months? How much have we allowed to gather the information we need in order to start the constraint-removal work that we want to do so we can start getting some environmental to those assets, as the plan sets out?

                                                 When do we think that the on-farm efficiency grants might happen? I do not think I am out of line in thinking that if we have allocated money along a timeline we might have thought about the next level down in the budget process. I would like you, Senator Farrell, if you can, to give me a loose time frame around that. I would be very appreciative, as would the constituents who have come to see me on a regular basis on this issue. I was at the Mildura public meeting years ago for the first draft. This has been a long process, and there are a lot of people who would like some rough guidelines.

                                                 My understanding is the way in which these programs are going to be rolled out will be different to the way in which past programs have been rolled out. Do you have any commentary around the likelihood of producers and irrigators in taking up these programs? Are they going to be as fully subscribed in the same manner as previous programs have been?

                                                    It is a competitive process, and I am not sure that we can say whether the price will be higher or lower. I do not know that we can necessarily predict that at the moment. Just from the knowledge I have of the process, there are so many other factors that come into the price you might get for the sale of water that I think it would be difficult to make a prediction as to what the price will be in future by comparison to what has occurred in the past. Obviously, at the height of the drought, the prices were very high and they have certainly come down. But I am not sure we can predict at this stage exactly what will happen in the future.

                                                     Are you able to inform the Senate of moneys allocated, whether the $50 million mentioned or any other moneys, for communities in northern Victoria which have had land or water buybacks by the government? We currently have some farmers who have sold their land and water to the government and others have chosen to retain their land and water and now find themselves in a position where their adjacent neighbours have sold their properties and water rights, and properties across the road from them have been sold. These farmers have now been told that the channel that feeds the properties where they want to stay will be shut down. Has any money been allocated so that these people will still be able to access water, or will they be left high and dry, so to speak?

                                                       Are you able to enlighten the Senate and affected people about these things? One of the farmers I mentioned has been told, 'If you want to access your water, you're going to have to pay $800,000 to have it piped down the road from the main channel.' What do you say to people like that who wish to remain on their land and wish to retain their water? These people have been left high and dry to date. I acknowledge what you said about certainty, but these people have no certainty even though they have made a decision to remain on their properties. Their families currently are in limbo and have been for some time.

                                                        The answer to Senator Madigan's question is that undoubtedly there have been lots of problems in Murray-Darling Basin communities. The one you have identified is one that probably replicates itself in many other parts of the Murray-Darling Basin. It is not simply a northern Victorian problem, it is a problem in the Riverland and other parts of the Murray-Darling Basin.
                                                       </p>

                                                        The whole point of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is to restore certainty to these communities, to provide some support for these communities and to restore the environmental health of the Murray-Darling. It is the government's intention that by passing this legislation we will achieve that. That is what we want to do: we want to bring prosperity back to these Murray-Darling Basin communities, we want to restore the health of the river, and the way we see that being done is by the implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, which we have done. By adding to that this piece of legislation, which has been agreed by the affected federal and state governments, we will bring about those achievements. That is our aim: to sort out these sorts of problems. I cannot say it will solve every single problem of every single community in the Murray-Darling Basin, but I can say that this is absolutely the best plan that we can come up with to set about the task of restoring the prosperity and the health of the river. That is what we are aiming to do with this legislation.

I acknowledge what you said about the state governments buying land and water rights, but the people just want to know what the physical plan is and how you are going to go about achieving it. I had many calls yesterday and last night about our discussions in the chamber, but people are none the wiser and are even more confused than they were. They are becoming more and more confused by the day. They just want to know: what is the actual plan? What is the actual coordination? And how are we going to achieve these things in a tangible way?

                                                           This group of amendments goes directly to how the money can be spent and for what purpose. The Water Amendment (Water for the Environment Special Account) Bill 2012 contains a long list of purposes for which the $1.7 billion in the special account may be spent. There are also various conditions on the spending included in the bill. These amendments as circulated add requirements to guarantee that any expenditure from this account will be spent in the best possible way to give the best value for money. This means that expenditure on the project is buying the most water with the greatest certainty for the least money—getting the best bang for our buck, so to speak.
                                                          </p>
                                                          <p>
                                                           The amendments take into account recent scientific knowledge in relation to groundwater and climate change. We do not know, as I have said many times in this chamber before, what the future will bring and what new science might soon have to tell us about how we can be using our water resources more wisely. These amendments prioritise and reward new projects that reflect the most up-to-date knowledge and science on these important issues. We know that overallocation and falling into bad habits caused this entire environmental crisis in the first place. We need to make sure we are acting more wisely and smarter and that we are saving taxpayers' money along the way.
                                                          </p>
                                                          <p>
                                                           We cannot afford to see an amount such as this, almost $2 billion, simply frittered away because we are not using it in the smartest and most efficient manner. It does make sense at a time when we know all sides of the chamber are continuing to talk about the amount of money that is in the budget to pay for services. We do not want to see money unnecessarily spent on things just because we did not specify in the legislation that we are trying to get the best value for money for the environment and for the taxpayer.

I refer to the schedule under 86AG, and note that the Greens proposed earlier amendments rearranging that schedule. I would just like an explanation from the Greens of the data they used to rearrange that schedule.

But, in the Nimmie-Caira instance, which is a complete fraud on the public purse, there is a proposition, which was agreed to before the licences were issued—and they were issued with no environmental plan—to pay for the licences before they were issued 2¼ times the value of the water in those licences, which will enable them to acquire the land. How do we know that value? Given that this is in this agreement in this bill, how do we know that this money will not be just blown buying land? That is acquiring a flood plain and, because there is a constriction from the Maude weir to Balranald, when there is just above a supplementary flow the water must go down that flood plain. It has been agreed with the minister's office that they are going to buy this flood plain. This is a complete fraud because when the river is constricted between Balranald and Maude the water is going to go down that flood plain and the only way to get it down there without going over the flood plain will be to shepherd it somehow through the flood plain. And if you then shepherd it through the flood plain, you will turn that flood plain into a desert of blow away grass and poverty bush. Given that this actually authorises the acquisition of that sort, which is to buy the land, which in this case has been covered by the bureaucrats and the filling of the water-buyback book of 370 gigalitres gross and 175 gigalitres net average annual calculated flow, calculated without any measurement, how do we know that under this agreement to which this parliament is about to agree that this money will be spent in the best way possible? That is the vaguest proposition I have ever seen in water management. I agree with you, Minister, that the management of the water, under all governments and for all time, has been buggered up. It started with allowing the trading of supplementary licences in the Murray-Darling Basin. How do we know that this will be used? It says here:
                                                                 </p>

How vague do you have to be to get political cover to get you past the next election? This is an agreement to buy land.

My understanding is that the particular project that you have concerns about is not a project that is going to be covered by this legislation. This legislation will deal with issues into the future. That is currently a proposal under consideration, so I am not sure that it is relevant to these proceedings. I will simply reiterate: it is the government's intention, and I believe it will be the case, that whatever expenditure we make as a result of this legislation will be money that is well spent.

Do you see flooding liability issues as being a non-physical constraint in increasing river flows? Rivers' operators or state authorities hold the ultimate responsibility and liability for adverse flooding impacts—and it is a particular issue for the upper catchment in Victoria, which is why I am asking these questions—on private property. The state authorities and river operators might act in an ultraconservative way in releasing the environmental water because they are liable. I am seeking solutions or for someone to categorically state who is responsible—because I have asked these questions in estimates and I have asked them during the inquiry and I am still not clear—for the unintended flooding of private property as a result of environmental flow releases from dams. Would the Commonwealth consider indemnifying the states from flooding liability caused by the delivery of the environmental watering plans? I would really appreciate some clarity around that. I am not trying to be difficult; I have asked these questions before and I would seek a response, please.

I note that the government will not be responding to those questions, which could equally apply to the bill itself—and my understanding is that the overall question before us today is actually that the bill be agreed to—but I would seek that the Greens, given that they are talking about how the money in the special account will be spent, actually give the upper catchment landholders in Victoria an understanding of who they think is legally responsible for any flooding events that may be caused on their properties as a result of releasing water for environmental flows.

They are to make sure, of course, that the Australian community gets value for money within this special account. It is almost $2 billion and we need to make sure we spend it in the best possible way. It cannot just simply be left to chance as to whether or not, as the years progress, this money is actually delivering the water that we are setting out to achieve.
                                                                                 </p>

It needs to be carefully audited every year so that everybody, from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to the scientists to members in this chamber and our local communities and constituents, knows exactly how much water has been purchased or returned so far and how much money remains in the account. Every time the Commonwealth Water Holder buys water at an inflated price through expensive means, such as some of the more expensive on-farm infrastructure grants, we know less money is available to buy the water that is outstanding.
                                                                                 </p>

This is an appropriate role for the National Water Commission. It enhances its current oversight role and the list of tasks it has to achieve. It is true that this bill as it stands has some inbuilt review mechanisms including a requirement for annual reporting to parliament and two ad hoc reviews. These reviews have their place, but they are very limited in their scope and timing. They will work in parallel with the audits under the Water Commission, as proposed by these amendments, so that the community can be confident of knowing exactly where this money is going and what they are getting for every dollar.

We know that we have examples of porkbarrelling in this area already—Senator Heffernan has spoken about this many times during this debate over the last three days. We need to make sure we put as many safeguards as possible in this legislation to ensure that Australian taxpayer money is not simply frittered away because this chamber cannot be bothered ensuring that we put some proper rules and regulations in place.

We are dealing with further Greens amendments, so can I indicate that the government does not support those amendments. I think it is fair to say that the National Water Commission is already dealing with the audit under the terms of the Murray-Darling Basin process and we are satisfied that that is the appropriate course of action.

One was in relation to the link between groundwater and other parts of the water system and he has now raised a further question. I think it is fair to say those questions are not directly relevant to this particular bill.

Just to make sure you understand that it is relevant, in part (v) it says, 'entering agreements to acquire an interest in, or in relation to, land (including easements)' et cetera. These issues are very relevant to the way this money is spent. I am sure—I will bet you £1,000 to one peanut—that is the answer to the question I have asked, and that is: have we studied the likely implications against three things? They are: the minimum decline by 2050 of 3,500 gigs in run-off in the lower Murray-Darling Basin, the fact that the interconnectivity studies between the rivers and the aquifers are not complete, and that we have increased the allocation from the aquifers by 2,700 gigs and are increasing money to make more efficient some of the works to save waters for the environment but some of the water that we save would have ended up in the aquifer and been allocated to those extra licences. So there is a serious flaw in the thinking of this bill.
