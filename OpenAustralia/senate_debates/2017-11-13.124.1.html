        Medicare Levy Amendment (National Disability Insurance Scheme Funding) Bill 2017
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With this Bill, this Government is instituting landmark reform to protect Australians in need through fully funding the National Disability Insurance Scheme (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        ).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Government does not just talk big when it comes to protecting our most vulnerable, but delivers decisively for the benefit of future Australian generations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sustainably funding our most important programs — such as the NDIS — is real tangible reform; not just empty promises and hot air.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We also know that Australians support this reform because they believe in looking after their mates, no matter their circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians place great faith in our government's range of essential services. However, the burden is still too great on those living with a disability or caring for a family member. No one can truly prepare for the hardship or cost of these responsibilities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By funding the NDIS, we are working to lighten their load and provide a quality of care that they deserve; to give Australians living with a disability the absolute certainty that high-quality care will be provided for them, both now and into the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is about properly caring for people with disabilities. It has nothing to do with the politics of envy or debates about inequality. Such debates should not be an excuse to do the wrong thing, which is what Labor is sadly doing, despite using the same means to provide NDIS funding themselves when they were in government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With this Bill, the Government is protecting the essential disability support services that Australians rely upon daily.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With this Bill, the Government is providing certainty. Certainty for people with a disability. Certainty for their families and carers. And certainty to all Australians who may find themselves in a situation that requires these services. Certainty that the NDIS will be fully funded for the long term.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today, we can give that assurance to all Australians with permanent and significant disability and those who care for them that this vital service will be there for them into the future.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let me now turn to the detail of the Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Medicare Levy Amendment (National Disability Insurance Scheme Funding) Bill 2017 is part of a package of measures to secure the Commonwealth's contribution to funding the NDIS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill will increase the Medicare levy rate by half a percentage point, from 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent, from 1 July 2019.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following this increase in the Medicare levy rate, one fifth of the revenue raised by the Medicare levy will be credited to the NDIS Savings Fund Special Account. The NDIS Savings Fund Special Account will also hold NDIS underspends, selected saves across the Government, and uncommitted funds from the Building Australia Fund and the Education Investment Fund. Along with the Commonwealth's share of the DisabilityCare Australia Fund and the repurposing of existing Commonwealth disability-related expenditure, this meets the Commonwealth's contribution to the NDIS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Low-income earners will continue to receive relief from the Medicare levy through the low-income thresholds for singles, families, seniors and pensioners.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People who are exempt from the Medicare levy, such as blind pensioners and people who are entitled to full free medical treatment for all conditions under defence force arrangements or Veterans' Affairs Repatriations Health Card (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Card" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Card
        </a>
        ), will continue to be exempt.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A number of other tax rates that are linked to the top marginal rate and the Medicare levy will also increase in line with this change — these include increases in the rate of fringe benefits tax and superannuation excess non-concessional contributions tax.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Bills to give effect to these amendments will also be introduced today and further details of these consequential increases are set out in the Explanatory Memorandum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With the decision to increase the Medicare levy rate from 1 July 2019, this Government is asking Australians to contribute – according to their capacity – to funding the NDIS and ensure it is guaranteed and secure for current and future generations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A few years ago, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opposition_Leader" rel="nofollow">
         Opposition Leader
        </a>
        asked Australians to do the very same thing, and contribute to the NDIS through a 0.5 per cent increase in the Medicare Levy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Opposition Leader voted 'yes' then, and now he wants to vote 'no' to suit his political agenda, pitting Australians against Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When Labor left office in 2013, they also left a $55.7 billion funding shortfall for the NDIS. Now is the time to finally rectify that shortfall. This is why I now appeal to all in this Parliament to put aside partisan squabbles about funding, and do the right thing by our most vulnerable fellow Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By fully funding the NDIS, Australians with permanent and significant disability can be assured of access to vital care and support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let us not forget that the NDIS has had bipartisan support from the very beginning. Together, the Commonwealth and the States and Territories are committed to delivering the NDIS across the country and the NDIS is on track to be fully rolled out from 2020.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There must be no turning back on this commitment. There must be no more playing politics with disability. Now is the time to fully fund the NDIS once and for all and, with this Bill, we will finally achieve that objective.
       </p>
