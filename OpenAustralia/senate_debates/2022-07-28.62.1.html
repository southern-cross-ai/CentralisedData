        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Youth, Senator Watt. On Tuesday night, on the
        <i>
         7.30
        </i>
        program, the Prime Minister said, 'We intend to honour our promises.' The Prime Minister promised on 3 December last year that Labor's policy 'will see electricity prices fall from the current level of $275 per household by 2025'. Minister, with young Australians impacted by cost-of-living pressures, will the government honour this promise?

           Point of order in terms of the addressing of a question to a minister: I understand that the opposition used the word 'youth'. The policy which was referred to in the question is not within Minister Watt's portfolio; it's within Minister Bowen's portfolio, and that would be the appropriate minister—who is the minister representing that? It's me, I think!

             's observation: the question didn't reference a specific policy. The question referenced the promises of the now government and the now Prime Minister, and it referenced those promises in the context of cost-of-living pressures specific to young Australians. Senator Watt represents the Minister for Youth in this place and therefore should answer questions relevant to young Australians.

              Thank you, Senator Birmingham. I think Senator Watt is comfortable to take the question? Minister Watt, I'm going to ask Senator Wong to confirm who the repping minister for the Minister for Youth is. Minister Wong, I'm just wishing to ascertain that the repping minister for this question is Minister Watt?

                 I'm always happy to talk about our plan to bring down energy prices and your utter failure to do so in the 10 years that you were in government. Unlike the opposition, the government has a plan. It's probably one of the reasons we won the election—that we actually have a plan going forward to bring down power prices in the way that we promised. The best thing about that is that at the same time not only will our plan bring down power prices, something that you were incapable of doing over 10 years; it will also bring down emissions, something you didn't believe in doing for 10 years let alone achieve. And we will create over 500,000 or 600,000-odd jobs—there are so many I can't remember the exact figure; that's how many jobs we will intend to create—including five out of six in regional Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Our plan will help young people with their power prices. Our plan to lift wages will help young people, especially because of the number of young workers who work in industries like hospitality, retail and minimum wage jobs. What did those people get from a Labor government? They got a government that supported a wage rise—something you weren't prepared to do for the 10 years you were in government. Our policies will bring down youth prices, something you couldn't do—

                   President, a point of order on the question of direct relevance. Indeed, in the previous point of order, I commented—and I highlighted the fact—that the question didn't ask specifically about a policy of the government. It asked about a promise made by the now Prime Minister. That promise was that Labor's policy will see electricity prices fall from the current level by $275 for households by 2025.

I might just note that not only did the former government fail to do anything about power prices in the 10 years that it was in government, it had the hide in the run-up to an election to actually hide from the Australian public how much those power prices were rising, because this mob over here will be the people who will be always remembered for hiding the increase in the default market offer price, which has increased power prices in

In the same way that I have agreed to look at that previous question, we will look at this question and whether it relates to the primary question. If it doesn't, we'll report back to the Senate.

I think he had some time left, but I will check—yes. Senator Watt.

                                                   Unlike the opposition, this government does care about young people. It has a minister in place with programs for young people, and the best thing that we have already done, in the short time that we have been in power, for young people is to ensure that they got an increase to the minimum wage, because of the sheer number of young workers who are on the minimum wage—something that the opposition consistently refused to do. Remember how low wages were a deliberate design feature of the Australian economy under this mob? No wonder they lost the election, and no wonder young voters refused to vote for them in droves.

                                                   There are two ways that you can deal with cost of living. One way is by bringing down costs—and that is what we fully intend to do with the promises that we have put in place. The second way you can do it is by lifting wages. And everyone knows that will only happen under a Labor government; it will never happen under you mob.
