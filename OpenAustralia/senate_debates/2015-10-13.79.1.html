        My question is to Senator Cormann, the Minister for Finance, representing the Treasurer. Can the minister advise the Senate why the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement is so important for Australia's future economic growth?

         had done in helping to achieve a successful landing for the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. What an outstanding job he has done. Australia is a trading nation. We are an open economy. To maximise our success as a trading nation we need to be as productive as possible, as competitive as possible, as innovative as possible; but we also need to ensure we have the best possible access to all of our key markets overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
         This historic Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement will deliver enormous benefits to Australia. By establishing a more seamless trade in the investment environment across 12 countries, it will help our exporters get more competitive access to 40 per cent of our world economy. It slashes barriers to Australian exports of goods and services and investment by eliminating 98 per cent of all tariffs across everything—from beef, dairy, wine, sugar, rice, horticultural products and seafood through to manufactured goods, and resources and energy
        </p>
        <p>
         It is particularly helpful in the high-skill, high-wages services sector. But, importantly, this agreement, with an open architecture, allows—

           I thank Senator Fawcett for that supplementary. The open architecture of this Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement will facilitate access by additional member countries to join in the future, which will further amplify its benefits.

           TPP countries account for 24 per cent of the world's trade in services. Australia's services exports to TPP countries were worth $20 billion in 2014, almost 35 per cent of our total services exports, and this is expected to grow strongly moving forward.

             We do worry on our side of the parliament that this is the beginning of another fear campaign against a high-quality trade agreement that is in the national interest and that we hope will strengthen growth and create more jobs.

             This is a high-quality deal. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
              TPP
             </a>
             includes requirements for the highest labour and environmental standards. The TPP will not affect Australia's ability to set appropriate English-language requirements, training benchmarks, licensing requirements or the temporary skilled migration income threshold. Australia's TPP commitments are consistent with Australia's existing immigration and workplace relations frameworks. It is an agreement that hopefully will receive the efficient and speediest report of the Senate in the not too distant future.
