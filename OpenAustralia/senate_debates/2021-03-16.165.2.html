        I rise tonight to make a brief contribution to acknowledge the extraordinary outcome for Australia of former senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathias_Cormann" rel="nofollow">
         Mathias Cormann
        </a>
        being chosen as Secretary-General of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">

        . Many of us in this place know Mathias well, and I know him—I won't say 'more than anyone'—as well as anyone, having worked for him both in his electoral office, in opposition, and in his ministerial office, and having served with him, albeit for only a relatively short while, in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        It really is an extraordinary achievement not only for Mathias personally to achieve this outcome; perhaps more importantly, for all of us in this place, it's an extraordinary achievement for Australia. It's recognition of the fact that we, to use the proverbial phrase, punch above our weight in international affairs. I thank those opposite for their support—

         No, not all those opposite! Occasionally it was grudging, we must admit, but we thank those opposite for their support—not you, Senator Ciccone, and not you, Senator Farrell! As Australia we have achieved an extraordinary outcome, and I can think of literally no better person than Mathias to take on this role. He has that combination of policy and politics that will enable him to lead the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         with distinction.
        </p>
        <p>
         The union of the free market democracies of the world has never been more important than it is today. We enter very uncertain geopolitical times and very uncertain economic times, thanks to the impact of a once-in-a-100-year global pandemic. Being able to take that highly technical knowledge of international arrangements to do with the economics of the globe and combine that with a very astute and deep understanding of the personalities and the politics involved in international decision-making forums gives Mathias a unique position and a unique opportunity to make a real difference not only for Australia but also for the wider union of Western capitalist democracies.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's good to see support for the decision right across the globe—not only from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         , who is one of our key allies, but also from countries like Turkey and OECD members throughout South-East Asia who have welcomed the appointment of former Senator Cormann to this role. I think it is a remarkable outcome for this country, and I thank Foreign Minister Payne and the Prime Minister for the work that they put in to secure this exceptional outcome. I wish Mathias all the best in his future role.
