         It's been a great pleasure and a delight to welcome back President Widodo to a guest-of-government visit to Australia, his fourth since 2014. It was also a privilege to have him address both houses of the parliament this morning. I am also very pleased to welcome my good friend Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi and many cabinet colleagues to Canberra today.

         Indonesia is a nation of absolutely first-order importance to Australia. It is a dynamic, democratic, diverse nation—a G20 member and the world's largest Muslim nation. It is already a trillion-dollar economy and is predicted to become one of the world's largest economies in coming decades. Australia and Indonesia are both strong regional democracies with a shared vision for a prosperous and open Indo-Pacific underpinned by democratic institutions, rule of law and norms. Most importantly, Indonesia is our neighbour and our friend. In fact, as President Widodo reinforced in his remarks this morning, we are neighbours by destiny but we are friends by choice. More recently, we have become comprehensive strategic partners. We also stand beside each other in adversity, as both the Prime Minister and the President observed in their remarks in the House of Representatives today.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to acknowledge the 40 members from the Indonesian national armed forces, who are helping with Australia's bushfire recovery—most particularly, in the

           <p>
            I was delighted also this morning to join with foreign minister Retno Marsudi to sign the plan of action for our comprehensive strategic partnership with Indonesia in the presence of President Widodo and Prime Minister Morrison. The plan sets out our shared commitments across trade and investment; defence; counterterrorism and people smuggling; maritime security; education; and partnering in regional and international fora. It provides practical and measurable steps to build on our existing cooperation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The plan outlines well over a hundred initiatives our governments are pursuing together in this new chapter in our relationship, including new measures on aviation security, on peacekeeping operations, on cyber, on disaster response management, on health security threats and tackling marine plastics. It is these and other initiatives under the

               Again, thank you to Senator Smith for his question.
              </p>
              <p>
               We are working very hard between us to grow the understanding between our people and our communities. More than 1.3 million Australians visit Indonesia every year, a record number, and a growing number of Indonesian tourists are coming to Australia. But our education links are particularly strong. Australia hosts around 20,000 Indonesian students annually, and we are very pleased to provide Australia Award scholarships to talented young Indonesians to study in Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
               Australia remains the top destination for Indonesian students studying abroad, and Indonesia, in turn, is also by far the most popular overseas destination for our New Colombo Plan Program. In fact, since 2014 over 9,500 young Australians have studied, lived and experienced life in Indonesia. They are most certainly voting with their feet. This is perfectly demonstrated by Monash University's announcement today that it will open a new campus in Indonesia in the coming year.
