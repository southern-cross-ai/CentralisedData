        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Senator Abetz. Can the minister inform the Senate of the wage rises received by Commonwealth public servants over the last decade and how they compare to other benchmarks?

         I thank Senator Bernardi for his question and acknowledge his commitment to a sustainable Public Service. I can advise him that Commonwealth Public Service wage rises have beaten inflation in nine out of the last 10 years. In 2012, Public Service median wages increased by 5.9 per cent compared to inflation at 2.2 per cent. In 2009, Public Service median wages increased by 6.4 per cent compared to inflation of 2.1 per cent. In fact, over the last decade, Commonwealth public servants have received annual median wage increases totalling 42 per cent, well above

         increases totalling 28 per cent.

           However, as a result of the $123 billion of prospective deficits and $667 billion gross debt this government inherited from Labor, there is now minimal capacity for wage increases for public servants. Public Service wages are paid for by taxpayers. They need to be affordable, sustainable and in line with community expectations.

             The 12½ per cent pay rise being sought by the

              CPSU

             is none of these things and jeopardises 10,000 Public Service jobs. The CPSU national secretary has twice acknowledged that, and I quote her: 'There are no easy savings left.' It is important to set an example, which is why remuneration for MPs and senior Commonwealth officeholders has been frozen and previously determined pay increases will not proceed. I am confident that most Public Servants understand the present situation.

                employees quite another. CPSU members have been instructed to read a text out to the public, saying that they are taking action because: 'Government has cut many thousands of Public Service jobs over the last 10 years while nobly claiming that they are fighting for safer workloads and better services for you.' However, in internal DHS emails to other staff, CPSU members have been instructed to claim that they, 'reject the government's pay offer and are taking industrial action to support a fair and reasonable agreement for all DHS workers'—ending with a plea to join the CPSU. Both claims are false and show the CPSU is being two-faced; pretending to the public to be acting on the public's behalf, while pursuing an irresponsible wage claim.
