           . Although we acknowledge the sterile, middle-class-type platitudes intended by this motion,

           cannot support it and briefly states that that is because a motion such as this should highlight the plight of all little female children, especially those subjected to the barbaric and backward rituals of the Islamic ideology. This motion should have sent a message of hope and encouragement to each and every girl, but sadly it hasn't.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australian and international Islamic girls face religious and state-sanctioned genital mutilation, forced marriages to much older men and the constant sexual assault and suppression of women. This motion fails to address any of the challenges faced by young Islamic girls, because the tired old parties will not want to risk the votes of middle-aged Islamic men, and frankly that's disgraceful. We cannot support this motion until the plight of all little girls everywhere is addressed.
