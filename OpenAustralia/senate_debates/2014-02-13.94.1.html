        , my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Cormann. I refer to the exemption granted by the Minister for the Environment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        government's shark kill-and-capture policy from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
        </a>
        . This exemption applies a number of conditions to the implementation of that policy. There have been almost daily reports of potential breaches of this exemption and its conditions. How is the federal government monitoring the implementation of the drum line policy? Is the government aware of the large number of small-sized sharks that are being captured under this program and does the capture and release of these sharks who subsequently die as a result of the injuries from the drum lines breach the conditions applied?

         I thank Senator Siewert for that question. In fact, I had been wondering how long it would take before the Greens would ask me a question about this issue. Let me just say at the outset that we support the efforts of the WA state government to protect human life and to improve public safety on

          Western Australia

          EPBC
         </a>
         Act to the WA government. There is no doubt that the increased risk of shark strikes in Western Australia is a public safety matter of national significance. There have been seven tragic deaths in just three years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has a strong beach culture and the federal government agrees with the

          Western Australian

To protect human life, each and every year New South Wales places its nets at 51 beaches between Wollongong and Newcastle. To protect human life, each and every year the Queensland shark control program covers 84 beaches and uses a combination of mesh nets and drum lineâ€”

                    Senator Siewert and the government will just have to agree to disagree on this. The short answer to her final question is no, we will not be revisiting the very limited and temporary exemption that Minister Hunt has granted with effect to 30 April 2014. I go back to the reports of undersized sharks being caught. Sharks caught that are less than three metres long will be released alive if possible. If they are not in a condition to survive, they are to be humanely destroyed. To summariseâ€”
