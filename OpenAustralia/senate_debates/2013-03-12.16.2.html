        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the need for Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs to have an unblemished reputation for probity. Accordingly, I refer to the statement by former

        Premier Morris Iemma: 'It took

         Eddie Obeid
        </a>
        20 years to build the power and influence that he had and, for 17 of those, Bob was leader.' I also refer to Mr Iemma's statement that he, former Premier Carr, made Obeid a cabinet minister:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … he waltzed into the caucus room when the vote was happening and very publically voted for him … To send a message …
       </p>
       <p>
        Don't Mr Iemma's statements cast serious doubts on the minister's claims on

        last night that he saw Eddie Obeid as a 'marginal figure, never to be taken seriously' and therefore reflect on the minister's reputation and our reputation overseas?

                    I would have thought the Obeid reputation was well known, when Senator Sinodinos of the Liberal Party chose to chair an Obeid family company, a company owned one-third by the Obeids, with the Obeids on his payroll. And, further, he pretended that—

To accuse a fellow senator of knowingly engaging in a certain activity is a clear imputation against that fellow senator's reputation and needs to be withdrawn.

                                   This is a question that raised matters to do with the integrity of a senator; namely, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. When he responded, all sorts of protests were made by those who drafted the question. It is somewhat hypocritical for senators now to complain when the foreign minister points out the hypocrisy of this question.

                                       , I rise on a point of order. The minister is out of order for two reasons. Firstly, he is in defiance of your ruling to address the question. With only 19 seconds remaining, he has not even tried to pay you the respect of observing your ruling. Secondly, when you asked him to resume his seat while you could take a point of order, he entirely disregards your ruling and continues to speak. As I said before, and I did not say it lightly, this chamber is entitled to have you assert your authority over this minister.

And direct relevance would require the minister not to seek to obscure the question by referring to others, but deal with the issue as to whether this minister can be treated internationally as a person of probity if he is not telling the truth about his conduct as Premier of

                                                 , on the point of order, the question from Senator Abetz was barely within standing orders. It has a clear imputation that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had been misleading and not telling the full truth, and I think Senator Bob Carr is absolutely entitled to treat a question that broad with the contempt with which I think he is treating it. He is well within relevance to the question that he was asked, and I ask you to dismiss this frivolous point of order.

                                                   , I rise on a point of order—Senator Faulkner was referring to an Ian Macdonald as a grub. I just wanted to make sure that he was referring to his former colleague and not imputing the character of Senator Macdonald, who we know is not. I can understand his factional ally is a grub. I can understand that particularly.
