        Show societies the length and breadth of this country are a vital part of their communities and the people that make up the largest volunteer network in the land. On behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA" rel="nofollow">

        , I would express our great sadness at the passing of Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Fred Andrews
        </a>
        , a 2019 Ekka Legend. Our thoughts are with his family at this very sad time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fred began his association with the show as a harness racing competitor in the early seventies, moving to RNA trotting, swabbing and steward roles, which he fulfilled until 2018, when he retired at the age of 92. A mainstay of the Ekka horse stables for nearly half a century, Fred was highly regarded, admired and greatly respected by all. His passion for horseracing and the show's horse competition was inspiring, and his contribution to the show was remarkable. In 2019 he was awarded the RNA's highest honour: the Ekka Legend award. The Ekka Legend award is bestowed on those who made an extraordinary contribution to the show. The award was introduced in 2004, and just 15 people have been awarded this prestigious honour. It is the selfless dedication of people like Fred which has made the people's show what it is today. For 50 years he gave so generously of his time to help make the Ekka a wonderful event for competitors and patrons. We join with all the Ekka family in mourning the loss of a remarkable man whose Ekka legacy we greatly revere and appreciate. It was with the support of volunteers and people like Fred Andrews that make us all the richer.
