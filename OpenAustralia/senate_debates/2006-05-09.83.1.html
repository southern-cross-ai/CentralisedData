        This is a day of mixed emotions for Tasmania and for Australia. It is a day of great joy and tremendous sadness. The joy is for the safe return of the Beaconsfield miners

        , who lost his life at the Beaconsfield mine.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is 14 long days and nights ago that the three men went underground for what should have been a normal 12-hour shift, if in fact 12 hours spent one or more kilometres under the earth’s surface can ever be normal for the majority of us. Mining communities have a long and justifiably proud history of looking after their own, and we have seen miners and mine specialists come from across Australia to aid in the rescue of two of their own—a rescue one kilometre underground—putting themselves in a very dangerous situation in an unstable environment for their mates.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now turn to the men and women who have waited, never giving up hope that their loved ones would be safely returned to them, and to the Knight family. This is a day of great sadness for that family yet they too, as we know, share in the happiness of the Russell and Webb families. Today we join together to express our condolences to the Knight family on the tragic loss of Larry Knight, and our joy at the return of Todd Russell and Brant Webb. To the wonderful people of Beaconsfield, who never gave up hope or wavered in their determination to bring their mates home safely, I say thank you. To those who travelled from across Australia to work above and below ground using their skills, knowledge and strength, I say thank you. I say thank you to the women and the local ministers for their prayers. To the children who quietly left flowers, I say thank you. I say thank you to the paramedics and the psychologist who spoke to the men and gave them added hope and security. To the Australian media who reported those long days and nights with skill and compassion, I say thank you. Nor do we forget your loss; we express our condolences to the family and friends of
