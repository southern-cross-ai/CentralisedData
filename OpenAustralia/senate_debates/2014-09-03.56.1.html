         What I can confirm for Senator Sterle is that yesterday we implemented the policy we took to the last election. On this side of the chamber we understand that the budget is not a magic pudding. The Labor Party waltzed around the countryside for six years and they made promises left, right and centre, unfunded. We said to the Australian people very openly and transparently in the lead-up to the last election that we would scrap the mining tax, because it is a bad tax for the economy. It has hurt Australia; it has particularly hurt our home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , Senator Sterle. It has cost jobs. We said we would get rid of the mining tax and we also said we would get rid of all of the unfunded promises that Labor recklessly and irresponsibly attached to that tax. Yesterday, the Senate voted to support our election commitment to scrap the mining tax. Thank you very much to the senators, particularly in the Palmer United Party—

            The reason the previous government made a complete mess of the budget is that they kept walking the countryside making promises left, right and centre without showing how it was going to be paid for, including for small business. The most cruel thing you can do is make a promise that costs money and imposes cost burdens on the budget, without actually showing how you are going to pay for it. We had this tax that was supposed to raise $4 billion in year one. Guess what? It raised 95 per cent less than that, and the five per cent it raised is being refunded—

                  Unlike the Labor Party, before the last election we were honest with the Australian people. We said that we would scrap the unfunded promises that Labor attached to their failed tax. We have done so, including in relation to the measure that Senator Sterle just referenced.

                    What I can confirm is that small business will be the winner from a stronger mining industry and a stronger economy. Small business will have more opportunities to employ people. Small business will be the winner from our decision to delay further increases in compulsory superannuation. Small business will be able to employ more people, because we have reduced the cost burden that Labor in government imposed on small business. And do you know what? Small business will be the winner—

                       Senator Sterle was trying to suggest that we were doing things that were not good for small business. The best thing we can do for small business is ensure that we build a stronger, more prosperous economy. A strong mining industry will create opportunities for small business. You might not understand this, but on this side of the chamber and on the cross bench we do understand this. As far as the various unfunded promises that you attached to the mining tax are concerned, we have always said that we will get rid of them, and we have done so.

                         , I ask a further supplementary question. I refer to the Prime Minister's promise on 15 August last year:
                        </p>
                        <p class="italic">
                         I am absolutely determined not to increase the overall tax burden on anyone.

                        <p>
                         Why has the Prime Minister broken his promise to small business? I will lend you a white hanky if you just want to wave that!

                          Let me make the point right up front that under the coalition, after our budget, the tax burden in Australia is lower than it would have been under the Labor Party. We got rid of the carbon tax, we got rid of the mining tax, and later this year we will be initiating a company tax cut. Let's start with that.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Secondly, in relation to the unfunded promises that Labor attached to their failed mining tax, including in relation to small business, we said transparently before the last election that we would get rid of them. We transparently said before the last election that the various promises Labor attached to their failed mining tax were not affordable at the moment. There are a lot of meritorious causes that you can pursue when you have your budget under control. But you left a debt and deficit behind. One of the worst finance ministers in the history of Australia presided over a $107 billion blowout in the budget deficit in three short years. You left behind $191 billion in cumulative deficits in your first five budgets—
