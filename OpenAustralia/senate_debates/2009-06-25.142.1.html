        My question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Wong. I refer to the multiple reports aired on

        regarding the government’s unwillingness to bring Guy Campos, a self-confessed child beater and alleged war criminal and murderer, to justice for crimes committed against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">

        ese. Can the government confirm that one year into a Federal Police investigation, Guy Campos is still living freely in Australia, no less than two kilometres away from the family of the boy whom he bashed to death, with the government’s full knowledge and consent?

         misread the question, but the implication was that someone was bashed to death with the government’s consent. If that is the case, it seems to me that the question is out of order.

           I have to say, Senator, that I will give you the benefit of the doubt in terms of the question. Some very serious allegations have been made in relation to Mr Guy Campos. Obviously, the government treats allegations of war crimes and crimes against humanity extremely seriously. It is the case that there has been public discussion of Mr Campos, who is alleged to have committed war crimes in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
            East Timor
           </a>
           during the 1990s. This is in the Minister for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
            Home Affairs
           </a>
           ’ portfolio. I am advised that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
            AFP
           </a>
           is currently investigating allegations made against Mr Campos.
          </p>
          <p>
           Generally in relation to the allegation of war crimes, whether in relation to Mr Campos or not, there are often complex legal and factual issues that need to be carefully considered by our law enforcement agencies. Investigation and prosecution decisions are clearly matters for the AFP and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Director_of_Public_Prosecutions" rel="nofollow">
            Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
           </a>
           , as independent statutory authorities. Therefore, some of the matters to which I think
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
            Senator Fielding
           </a>
           referred may well be matters that are within the purview of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Federal Police
           </a>

            , I ask a supplementary question. I was led to believe that it is a fact that the Federal Police have now concluded their investigation into Guy Campos’s crimes and that a brief of evidence in relation to Mr Campos and his alleged offences under the Crimes (Torture) Act 1988 and the Geneva Conventions Act 1957 has now been handed to the

             Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
            </a>
            . If this is so, can the minister explain why no action has been taken to bring this man to justice?

            <p>
             I will see if I can provide to you anything further than that which I have read out. I again say to you that, if it is the case that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
              AFP
             </a>
             investigation is concluded and the matter is with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Director_of_Public_Prosecutions" rel="nofollow">
              Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions
             </a>
             , that is as it should be. Those are decisions for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions. These are not decisions that are made at a political level and I would suggest that what you have outlined in your supplementary is in fact precisely the sort of procedure that should be followed. I will make inquiries of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and see if there is anything further I can give you. As I said, the advice I have before me is that the AFP is currently investigating the allegations. I will take advice as to whether that investigation has concluded or if anything further can be said on that.
