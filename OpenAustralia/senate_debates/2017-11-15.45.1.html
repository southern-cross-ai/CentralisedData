          Thank you, Senator Farrell, for the question. Again, this was something that was canvassed extensively at the estimates hearing. Although I have to say those on the other side don't like my answers, allegations and words that I misled the Senate are, quite frankly, just untrue. As I have always said, the answers that I gave were based on the knowledge at the time—

              Thank you, George, it's nice to hear you say something nice to me for a change! My point of order is direct relevance. Whilst I know the minister likes to run through her justification, the point of order is that the question was a very simple one: will the minister explain to the Senate the principle of ministerial responsibility?

                   Ministers are allocated two minutes to answer the primary question. The minister has been going for 25 seconds. I am listening to the minister's answer. I believe it's within scope, but I note the minister has more than 1½ minutes remaining to answer the question. I would ask senators to also—props are inappropriate. I would ask senators to also allow ministers—

                    One of the elements of ministerial responsibility is ensuring that, when you find out that an answer that you've given based on the knowledge you had is incorrect, you correct the record, which is exactly what I did.

                      I do have a supplementary question. Does the minister accept that the principle of ministerial responsibility extends to the actions of ministerial staff as reiterated in the 2003 report by the Finance and Public Administration References Committee which states:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      <i>
                       Responsibility
                      </i>
                      for the actions of ministerial staff rests always with their minister, and the Committee reaffirms this principle.

                       As I said, I took responsibility when it was brought to my attention that the information I had given was not correct. I corrected the record at the earliest opportunity and my staff member resigned, just as former Prime Minister Gillard's staff member resigned when they incited what was referred to at the time as a race riot when she was Prime Minister.
