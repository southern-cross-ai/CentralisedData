         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Accounting obligations are imposed upon registered organisations by Part 3 of Chapter 8 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (the Act). Obligations are placed upon 'reporting units', which are determined in accordance with section 242 of the Act.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In summary, Part 3 of Chapter 8 places general obligations upon reporting units to keep proper financial records and to prepare a General Purpose Financial Record from those records. The reporting unit must also prepare an Operating Report. The financial report must be prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Reporting Guidelines that have been issued by the Industrial Registrar. These continue in force as though they were made by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Manager" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         of Fair Work Australia and are attached.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Further details of these requirements are contained in a Fair Work Australia Fact Sheet entitled “Financial Reporting Process and Timelines” which is also attached.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) A 'reporting unit's' financial report must be prepared in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and the Reporting Guidelines that have been issued by the Industrial Registrar (and which continue in force as though they were made by the General Manager of fair Work Australia).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Further details of these requirements are contained in a Fair Work Australia Fact Sheet entitled “Financial Reporting Process and Timelines” and the financial reporting guidelines, all of which is attached.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Accounting obligations are imposed upon registered organisations by Part 3 of Chapter 8 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (the Act). Obligations are placed upon 'reporting units', which are determined in accordance with section 242 of the Act.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

Further details of these requirements are contained in a Fair Work Australia Fact Sheet entitled “Financial Reporting Process and Timelines” which is attached.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Fair Work Australia has produced a Fact Sheet entitled “Financial Reporting Process and Timelines” which is attached. The Fact Sheet provides further details of the accounting obligations imposed upon registered organisations by Part 3 of Chapter 8 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) Section 256(1) of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 requires a reporting unit to engage an auditor of the reporting unit. The form and content of the auditor's report must be in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards. Further details of these requirements are contained in a Fair Work Australia Fact Sheet entitled “Auditors” which is attached.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) Fair Work Australia has no obligation to conduct audits of 'reporting units'.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) Part 4 of Chapter 11 of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (the Act) sets out powers held by the General Manager to make inquiries and to conduct investigations in relation to whether there has been compliance with Part 3 of Chapter 8 of the Act, the reporting guidelines made under that Part, any regulations made for the purposes of that Part and any rules of a reporting unit relating to its finances or financial administration.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Since the inception of Fair Work Australia, there have been two investigations commenced under section 331 of the Act. These have related to the Health Services Union Victoria No 1 Branch and the Health Services Union National Office.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Section 268 of the Act requires a 'reporting unit' to lodge with Fair Work Australia the financial documents prepared by the reporting unit and presented to members.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As part of the ordinary examination by Fair Work Australia of financial documents lodged by a 'reporting unit'', Fair Work Australia does seek further information from a reporting unit in circumstances where clarification of a 'reporting unit's' compliance with its accounting obligations is necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) The General Manager may apply to the Federal Court for an order cancelling the registration of an organisation on the ground that the organisation has failed to comply with an order of the Federal Court made under subsection 336(5) of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. There are no actions in train.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (9) The Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 does not provide Fair Work Australia with any specific power to wind up a registered entity which is insolvent or is likely to become insolvent.
        </p>
