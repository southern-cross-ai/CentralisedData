        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. Will the minister update the Senate on the success of the government's turn-back policy in halting the people-smuggling trade and stopping deaths at sea?

         I thank Senator Back for his question. I can inform the Senate that, despite the opposition from those opposite every single step of the way and despite their constant howls that it could never ever be done, since this government implemented Operation Sovereign Borders in December 2013, only one illegal entry arrival has arrived in Australia. When judging the success of Operation Sovereign Borders the statistics are irrefutable. Since December 2013 Operation Sovereign Borders has safely returned 633 potential illegal arrivals aboard 20 ventures to their countries of departure. I again remind those listening that this is despite those opposite consistently saying day after day that it could never be done.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has also ensured that, since the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders, there have been no lives lost at sea. Compare this fact with the policies of the former government, where we saw at least 1,200 people drown at sea as a consequence of the policies introduced by those opposite. In addition to that, who can forget that, at the height of the policy failure of the former government, a boat was arriving in Australia every 15 hours? You woke up in the morning and a boat had arrived; 15 hours later you were looking at going to bed and another boat had arrived; and you woke up in the morning and—guess what?—another boat had arrived. Despite this absolute travesty, those opposite are still hopelessly divided on border protection policy.

           This government understands that it is essential that governments maintain control over their migration programs to ensure that Australians have faith in those same programs. An inability to execute what is a very basic responsibility, quite frankly, demonstrates an inability—as those opposite demonstrated—to govern the country. When those opposite were in power they ceded control of Australia's border protection policies to the people smugglers and, in doing so, they inflicted immense damage on the reputation of Australia's migration policies. This is often an underreported fact of the chaos overseen by the former Labor government. As has been reported, Australia is actually the world's most generous nation for resettling refugees as a proportion of both our population and our national wealth. This is something that, as Australians, we should all be very proud of.

             promise the Australian people if he were elected to govern? That he would adopt the policy of turnbacks. Then once Mr Rudd was elected to govern, do we recall how many boats the Labor government turned back, given that their policy was to turn them back? The big zero.
