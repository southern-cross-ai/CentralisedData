        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am pleased to table this report of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee into the use of unmanned platforms by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        (ADF).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The inquiry was referred to the committee in October 2014. We received 25 submissions (two accepted as confidential) and held three public hearings in Canberra. Additional information was also received from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAND" rel="nofollow">
         RAND
        </a>
        Corporation and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A broad range of interested individuals and organisations contributed to the inquiry including academics, researchers, civilian operators, defence industry companies, regulators and Defence force personnel. In particular, the committee was impressed by the considered approach of the ADF to the use of unmanned platforms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unmanned platforms, particularly unmanned aerial vehicles (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAV" rel="nofollow">
         UAV
        </a>
        s), were described as well-suited to Australia's strategic and defence needs. The range and persistence of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAVs" rel="nofollow">
         UAVs
        </a>
        have provided new capabilities to military forces including the ADF. There are many opportunities for unmanned platforms to also add to the ADF's contribution disaster relief and civil support operations. While much of the evidence focused on UAVs, maritime unmanned platforms were highlighted as important in the future for mine countermeasures and antisubmarine warfare.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This inquiry has been well-timed. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        's Heron UAV, which was successfully operated by the ADF in Afghanistan, will commence flying in Australian civilian airspace next month as part of joint exercise Talisman Sabre 2015. Major acquisitions such as the Triton UAV will also be considered as part of the Defence White Paper 2015 and Force Structure Review in the coming months.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recognising that this is an evolving area of technology, the committee has been pragmatic in its recommendations to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        , the Department of Defence and the Australian Defence Force in relation to the use of unmanned platforms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These recommendations include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, the committee has recommended that the ADF should acquire unmanned platforms which are capable of being armed-when the capability need arises. In the view of the committee armed unmanned platforms will enhance and extend the capacity of the ADF to perform its key role of protecting Australia and its national interests.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As an operator of armed unmanned platforms Australia will also have opportunities to contribute to the establishment of international practices and norms for this evolving technology. Accordingly, the committee has also recommended that the Australian Government make a clear policy statement in relation to the use of armed unmanned platforms. This policy statement would affirm that armed unmanned platforms will be used in accordance with Australia's international legal obligations, will only be operated by uniformed ADF personnel and outline appropriate transparency measures. Further, the committee has recommended that the ADF report on changes to its training and dissemination programs regarding the law of armed conflict and international humanitarian law when armed unmanned platforms are acquired.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee's report will facilitate the effective use of the unmanned platforms by the ADF. The committee thanks all those who contributed to the inquiry.

        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
