        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, and it regards the impending death of 400 kangaroos at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belconnen_Naval_Transmission_Station" rel="nofollow">
         Belconnen Naval Transmission Station
        </a>
        and the comment by the minister for the environment that, ‘I don’t intend to take any other actions other than to just observe those processes as they unfold.’ I ask the minister why the minister for the environment has washed his hands of this issue. Will he urgently review the translocation option of removing the kangaroos to acceptable farmlands in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales

        ? Will the minister give a guarantee, moreover, that the grasslands in question are to be permanently reserved and their environmental values protected?

         I did hear those reports. I do not have a detailed brief on the three issues you raised. I will attempt to assist you insofar as I can. The first point I would make is that, as you know, in relation to a great many matters of this sort the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth and of Minister Garrett is as outlined under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC
         </a>
         Act, an act with which you are well familiar. It is in relation to events which have a national environmental significance that the provisions of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC Act
         </a>
         are triggered and, if so, then Minister Garrett, as the minister responsible, has a statutory discretion to exercise in relation to certain decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am not aware—I have not been advised—of the Commonwealth having any such jurisdiction in relation to this issue, but I will undertake to obtain information as far as I am able to. That also relates to the translocation option which you raised, but again I make the point that these may well be decisions which are not necessarily within the purview of the Commonwealth. Finally, and again in relation to the grasslands issue, I am not aware on what basis you assert Minister Garrett has authority over that issue.
