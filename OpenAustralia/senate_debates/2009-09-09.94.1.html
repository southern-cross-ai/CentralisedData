        My question is also to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Senator Carr. I refer to Abbotsford Primary School in

        </a>
        Program because they have been told to knock down an existing four-classroom building so that taxpayers’ money can build another four-classroom building to replace it. Will the minister explain to the Senate why the government ignored this school community to the point where they feel the only appropriate thing to do is to boycott the program? Does this show that individual schools are more fiscally responsible than the Rudd government?

         I thank Senator Mason for his question. As a matter of general principle, Senator Mason, I know as a result of the practices of the past, where you have been called upon either to do the outsourced work for the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         or the outsourced work for the member for Sturt, to always check the facts. Senator Mason, I do suggest you check the facts. In regard to the particular school you have mentioned, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         Department of Education and Training has provided advice to the minister. The nomination was put forward by the New South Wales government on behalf of the school. It was accepted by the school community on 25 May. Subsequently, the school community indicated that it wished to have additional classrooms constructed. The department is unable to amend the construction plan at this stage. The project had already gone through to tender and has progressed through the statutory plan. I understand that Senator Mason has been put in this extraordinarily invidious position of being advised that certain events have occurred when, if you check the facts, it turns out that the claims being made are not correct. In this circumstance, we have a situation where the time frames for the implementation of

             As distinct from the media reports on this matter, the building was put together in the 1950s and is in poor condition. It would need to be greatly improved to meet the standards for school facilities today.

Why does the Rudd government need schools to explain to them that it is silly to grant a school of one student $250,000 for a library instead of figuring that out for themselves?

                 is located within the central western education district on a property called Evesham. The school was opened in 1967. The nearest schools are Longreach State School, 72 kilometres away; Muttaburra State School, 118 kilometres away; and Winton State School, 124 kilometres away. The Queensland department reports that the sudden drop in enrolments was unprecedented and related to the personal circumstances of some families at the school.

                   , I rise on a point of order. In this series of questions, the senator has sought to seek information on three different issues in three different states and pretended that they are supplementary to the major question. Clearly, they are not supplementary when he is seeking that sort of information. The idea of supplementary questions is to elicit further information on the topic of the primary question. I accept that they are legitimate questions, but they are not legitimate supplementary questions. If the opposition want to ask questions on issues in three different questions they should use three separate primary questions. This is a misuse of the supplementary question system.

                       Well, he did make an effort. I did indicate how invidious his position was, Senator Faulkner, in having to repeat these ridiculous claims without checking the facts.
