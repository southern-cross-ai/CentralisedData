        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Arbib. Why did the government announce in January that the

         I welcome the question from Senator Payne about SIHIP. There has been a great deal of discussion about SIHIP in this chamber and I have talked about the positive results that SIHIP has achieved throughout the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         . SIHIP is on track to deliver its target on time and on budget. It has already delivered 179 new houses, and 1,036 rebuilds and refurbishments. It has exceeded its end of year 2010 targets of 150 new houses and 1,000 rebuilds and refurbishments.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have also previously announced in this chamber that the Australian government has recently brought forward $316 million over the forward estimates for the national partnership. Of these funds, $190 million will be used for housing-related infrastructure, including sewerage and power. This will result in around 180 new houses and 180 rebuilds being ahead of schedule by the end of 2013. This is over and above the original SIHIP targets of 750 new houses and 2,730 rebuilds and refurbishments.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to employment we know that SIHIP has already exceeded the employment targets that the government have set. We set a target of 20 per cent; we have already exceeded it with 30 per cent. They are jobs for Indigenous people—

            These are jobs for Indigenous people in remote areas—jobs that were not there. This is a very good result. The program management costs for SIHIP have been capped at eight per cent and are running within budget.

             , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister advise whether the government actually has performance targets for addressing overcrowding under the program and, if that is the case, why 50 per cent of the newly constructed dwellings will only have two bedrooms or fewer?

              The government are determined to reduce overcrowding. We recognise that this is essential for protecting children. We are investing unprecedented levels of funding in remote housing to address this. With the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
               Northern Territory
              </a>
              government, we are building an appropriate mix of housing to cater for different-sized families. This has been discussed with the community to ensure that new houses suit the needs of families in those communities and cater to singles, young families and the elderly—many of whom prefer to live apart from their extended families. Fifty per cent will have three bedrooms. In Maningrida, for example, the program will deliver over 100 new homes, increasing the number of houses in that community by over 50 per cent. Again, we have consulted with local communities to ensure that the needs of those communities are being met.

Why can’t the government just be upfront with the Australian people and admit that they are having trouble delivering SIHIP on time and within budget, and that they have just shifted the goalposts to suit their own convenience? Or will this just become another project for Mr Fahey?

                Senator Payne is wrong. This is a program that is delivering results for Indigenous people. Look at the new houses that are being put in place—again, 179 new houses and 1,036 rebuilds. The program is already ahead of the targets we set. Money is being brought forward so that we can do more. Senator Payne is right that, in the first period of SIHIP, there were issues and the government has said that. But at the same time Minister Macklin stepped in and put in place her own FaHCSIA officials to work with the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                 Northern Territory
                </a>
                to get the program back on track—and it is back on track. We are meeting our targets. This is a good result for the government, a good result for Indigenous people and a good result for the Territory. Senator Payne has her facts wrong.
