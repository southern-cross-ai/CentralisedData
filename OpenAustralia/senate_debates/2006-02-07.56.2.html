       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government rejects the Chair’s assertion that it failed ‘to win the confidence of either most industry stakeholders or the Senate in pursuit of this policy.’ Following the release of the final report of the Royal Commission, the Australian Government engaged in extensive consultation with industry regarding the Royal Commission’s findings and recommendations.

         The Government
        </a>
        ’s response to the Royal Commission was developed in consultation with industry participants and governments. The Government’s reform package has the strong support of industry participants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is committed to reforming this $50 billion industry. To that end, the Government introduced the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (BCII Act) which received

         Royal Assent

        MAJORITY REPORT RECOMMENDATIONS
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee majority recommends that the Building and Construction Industry Improvement Bill be opposed by the Senate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government rejects this recommendation. The Australian Government is committed to reforming the building and construction industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Royal Commission made significant findings of lawlessness in the industry, providing an unassailable case for reforming the building industry. The Royal Commission made 212 recommendations to improve the building and construction industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Building and Construction Industry Improvement Act 2005 (BCII Act) received Royal Assent on 12 September 2005. Unlawful industrial action provisions of the BCII Act took effect from 9 March 2005. The BCII Act:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         establishes the ABCC, an independent statutory agency tasked with enforcing workplace relations law on building sites;
        </li>
        <li>
         addresses unacceptable safety performance through the work of the FSC;
        </li>
        <li>
         provides sanctions for unlawful industrial action; and
        </li>
        <li>
         provides a means of referring matters to other agencies and bodies such as the AFP and State police, ATO and the ACCC.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee majority recommends that the increased powers for royal commissions, recommended in the final report of the Cole Royal Commission, be resisted in the Senate should amending legislation be introduced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will take into account the views expressed by the Senate Committee when considering any proposals for amendment of the Royal Commissions Act 1902.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee majority recommends, in view of its concerns regarding natural justice, that the Senate refer to its Legal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Affairs_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Constitutional Affairs Committee
        </a>
        the question of whether amendments should be made to the Royal Commissions Act 1902, to ensure that procedures of royal commissions accord with principles of natural justice and give due protection of the reputations of people whose prosecution is recommended but against whom no charges are laid.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will take into account the views expressed by the Senate Committee when considering proposals to amend the Royal Commissions Act 1902. Any additional views expressed by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee would also be considered by the Government at that time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee majority recommends that the Government promote cultural change throughout the industry by encouraging states to institute tripartite industry councils at state level. The Victorian model could be used as an exemplar. Associated with this, the committee majority also recommends the establishment of an overarching tripartite national body, working to a ministerial council, to implement a broad program of agreed reform in the building and construction industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government strongly disagrees with this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Royal Commission found this model ineffective in the past in facilitating the cultural and structural changes needed to reform the building and construction industry. In his final report, Commissioner Cole cited the need for a separate body, that ‘if the culture in the building and construction industry is to change … there needs to be an independent properly resourced entity which will vigorously uphold the law.’
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The assertion that the Victorian building and construction industry model could be used as an exemplar is not reflected in a better workplace relations environment, as indicated by Australian Bureau of Statistics industrial disputes data. In 2004, the Victorian construction industry recorded 338 working days lost per thousand employees (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDL" rel="nofollow">
         WDL

        /1000E), compared to 224 WDL/1000E for the national construction industry; and 46 WDL/1000E for all industries nationwide.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee majority recommends that corporations law be amended to enable more effective prosecution of perpetrators of phoenix companies; and that in association with this, the Government work with state governments to negotiate their legislating for stringent registration laws applying to partnerships and trusts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 12 October 2005, the Government announced an integrated package of reforms to improve the operation of Australia’s insolvency laws. The package proposes a number of reforms, including the establishment of a fund to finance preliminary investigations of ‘assetless’ companies to curb fraudulent phoenix activity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will allocate $23 million over four years to establish an ‘assetless administration’ fund and complementary enforcement programme by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The fund will finance preliminary investigations by expert liquidators of companies, selected by ASIC, that have been left insolvent with little or no assets.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Implementation of the Assetless Administration Fund will commence immediately, with applications for funding by liquidators being accepted from early 2006 when the fund becomes operational.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To support the assetless administration fund, it is also proposed that the privilege against exposure to a penalty be abrogated in proceedings where ASIC is seeking disqualification or banning orders and no other penalty. This would restore the longstanding interpretation of the applicability of the privilege, which was overturned by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         High Court of Australia
        </a>
        in the 2004 Rich case (Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission (2004) 209
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALR" rel="nofollow">
         ALR
        </a>
        271). This will allow ASIC to move quickly to disqualify directors engaged in phoenix activity, to protect creditors and legitimate competitors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, administrators’ reports will be required to include ‘any other matter material to the creditors’ decision’. This would assist in ensuring that creditors, when making their decision at the second meeting, are made aware of matters such as a right of recovery against the director(s) of the company for insolvent trading.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Exposure draft legislation will be prepared in consultation with industry groups. It is anticipated that legislation will be circulated for public comment in early 2006 and a bill introduced later that year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has also implemented a number of the Royal Commission’s recommendations regarding phoenix company activity, including:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         an increase from 10 to 20 years to the maximum period of disqualification of persons from managing corporations for insolvency and non-payment of debts implements recommendations from the Royal Commission and will offer investors greater protection from those who operate fraudulent phoenix companies; and
        </li>
        <li>
         a working party established by the Government to closely examine privacy issues that have been raised by the Royal Commission regarding greater information sharing between ASIC, the ATO and State and Territory revenue authorities.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee majority recommends that in view of the impending abolition of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission, state construction industry councils, whose establishment is recommended in this report, be asked to give priority to continuing the development of national safety codes for the construction industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In October 2005 the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) was replaced by a new advisory body - the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCC" rel="nofollow">
         ASCC
        </a>
        ). The ASCC will continue the work on a national approach to OHS and establish a national approach to workers’ compensation. Although the ASCC is an advisory body, it will retain the power, through legislation, to develop and declare national OHS standards and codes of practice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At its April 2005 meeting, NOHSC declared the National Standard for Construction Work [NOHSC:1016 (2005)]. This national standard is intended to be adopted by the Australian, state and territory governments in their OHS legislation. The Workplace Relations Ministers’ Council (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WR" rel="nofollow">
         WR
        </a>
        MC) endorsed the declaration of the standard and agreed to an implementation timeframe of two years for commercial construction and three years for the housing sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The implementation of the National Standard for Construction Work will be supported by a series of national codes of practice that provide further guidance in achieving the standard. ASCC is currently developing national codes of practice for:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the prevention of falls in construction work: this work is being drafted as two codes, one for general construction work, and one specific to housing construction;
        </li>
        <li>
         construction induction training; and
        </li>
        <li>
         tilt-up concrete construction work.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition to the construction industry-specific codes, ASCC is also responsible for a number of other national standards, codes of practice and guidance materials which contribute to improving safety in the construction industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         national standard for certification of users and operators of industrial equipment (under review);
        </li>
        <li>
         national standard for plant (under review);
        </li>
        <li>
         national standard and code of practice for workplace chemicals (under review);
        </li>
        <li>
         national codes of practice for labelling (under review) and safety data sheets;
        </li>
        <li>
         national standard and code of practice for noise;
        </li>
        <li>
         national standard for manual tasks, and code of practice for manual tasks relating to prevention of workplace musculoskeletal disorders;
        </li>
        <li>
         asbestos prohibition, codes of practice; for the management and control, and the safe removal, of asbestos, and guidance on atmospheric measurement of asbestos;
        </li>
        <li>
         Silica National Exposure Standard (recently revised); and
        </li>
        <li>
         revised national exposure standards for three forms of crystalline silica.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Following declaration of the national codes of practice for falls, construction induction training and tilt-up concrete construction work,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WRMC" rel="nofollow">
         WRMC
        </a>
        will be asked to endorse the codes of practice. It is expected that the Australian, state and territory governments will adopt these codes of practice into their occupational health and safety legislation, and thereby move towards a nationally consistent regulatory framework for health and safety in the construction industry.

        have been introduced under the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This amendment to the WR Act requires a secret ballot be conducted before protected industrial action can be taken. Employees or their union(s) will apply to the AIRC for a secret ballot order.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An application for a secret ballot will only be able to be made:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         after the expiry of the existing agreement;
        </li>
        <li>
         if a bargaining period has been notified to the AIRC; and
        </li>
        <li>
         the proposed industrial action is not for the purpose of supporting or advancing claims to include prohibited content in the proposed agreement.

       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Electoral Commission and other authorised ballot agents (which may be unions but in that case the appointment of an authorised independent advisor will be required) will conduct the secret ballots. The Australian Government will cover 80% of the cost of the ballot. The other 20% must be covered by either the employees or their union(s) who made the application for the ballot.

         to require all agreements to provide effective dispute resolution mechanisms, which allow the AIRC to arbitrate disputes.

       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Response:
       </p>

        The Australian Government does not accept this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government believes employers and employees should resolve workplace disputes themselves. To support greater flexibility and choice for workplace dispute resolution the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005 introduces new dispute resolution processes, and clarifies roles and responsibilities for the participants in dispute resolution processes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Among the key reforms, the amendments to the WR Act provides for a model dispute resolution process for use when a workplace agreement is lodged without specific dispute resolution arrangements. The model dispute resolution process also applies in relation to awards and particular statutory entitlements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under this model process, the disputing parties may agree that the AIRC should provide assistance in resolving a dispute. Alternatively, the parties may agree to use a private dispute resolution provider. If the parties are unable to agree about dispute resolution assistance within a reasonable timeframe, the AIRC would be the ‘default’ provider of dispute resolution assistance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the parties may agree about whether it is appropriate for their particular dispute to be arbitrated. However the WR Act does not presume that arbitration is the best outcome. The WR Act accommodates other dispute resolution techniques like mediation or conciliation, as chosen by the parties to the dispute.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the parties include specific dispute resolution arrangements in their workplace agreement, these arrangements may confer the dispute resolution powers on the AIRC. The parties may agree that it is appropriate for the AIRC to finally determine a dispute, but the WR Act does not require arbitration of disputes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The focus of the new provisions in the WR Act is to encourage parties to attempt to resolve the dispute between themselves, either at the workplace level or with the assistance of a third party of their choice.

        Recommendation 4: Agreement making
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Reject provisions to ban pattern bargaining in the building and construction industry and instead amend the Workplace Relations Act to enable genuine project agreements to be reached and certified for major projects.

       </ul>

        Response:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is committed to ensuring employees and employers have genuine choice in agreement making.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The BCII Act provides that project agreements are unenforceable, to the extent that they relate to building employees, unless certified under the WR Act. The BCII Act does, however, allow a transition period for project agreements created under State jurisdiction. The transition period is three years from the date the BCII Act commenced (i.e. 12 September 2005).

       <p class="italic">
        The WR Act allows multiple business agreements where two or more businesses are carrying on the same type of business and wish to offer their employees the same working conditions, such as franchises. Under the Workplace Relations Amendment (Work Choices) Act 2005, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OEA" rel="nofollow">
