        My question is to Senator Ludwig, the Minister representing the Minister for

         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        . When did the minister first have information that the Chinese sweet,

        , was contaminated and was available for sale in Australian supermarkets? What tests have been taken on this product, and when? Are these products now off all shelves in Australia? How can we be assured that there are no other similarly contaminated products in Australia at the time?

         In respect of that, it is a matter that is, of course, of concern to this government. I do not appear to have a comprehensive brief in respect of that issue. What I can do is undertake to provide an answer to the Senate in respect of that particular issue. If there is a supplementary question in respect of this matter, likewise I can undertake to provide an early response to the Senate in respect of what the government is doing about this matter.

          I find it strange that the minister has not been briefed, given that this is a major scandal and that it has major implications for the Australian public. In view of the lax food standards in China, what special testing of food and other ingestible products from China is in place in Australia?

           Similarly, in terms of providing a response I can certainly undertake to bring that back. If the question is about the more broad issue of imported food products from China I can tell you that testing by the New Zealand authorities for the presence of melamine in products imported into New Zealand from China has shown contamination of unacceptably high levels in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rabbit_Creamy_Candies" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           . Australian food regulators met yesterday and are requesting wholesalers and importers to voluntarily withdraw White Rabbit Creamy Candies from shops pending further results of Australian testing for melamine.

           released a media advisory yesterday advising people not to consume these milk based sweets imported from China. This product is sold in retail packs through Asian retail supermarkets and restaurants. These candies are unlikely to cause health problems if consumed in small amounts but people who have eaten this product and who are concerned about their health should seek medical advice.
