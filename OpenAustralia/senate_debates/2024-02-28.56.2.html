       <p>
        Earlier this morning I indicated to the Senate I would come back at a later time and make a statement about adjournment last night. I intend to do that now. Some of the conduct in the Senate during the adjournment debate last night was appalling.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is appropriate that I remind senators about the rules and practices connected to the open-ended adjournment. It is the practice of the chair to follow the speakers list for the adjournment debate wherever possible. It is impossible to do that when the senators on the list are not in the chamber when an item commences. This is what happened last night. None of the senators listed to give five-minute speeches were in the chamber when the debate commenced at 7.30 pm. The Acting Deputy President, Senator McGrath, quite correctly went to the list for 10-minute speeches.
       </p>
       <p>
        The interpretation of the rules for the open-ended adjournment has always been that, once we've started 10-minute speeches, any senator can then speak up for 10 minutes. The chairs on duty last night each sought to apply that interpretation, although they also encouraged senators to make shorter speeches where possible. I thank them for doing so in the face of some unruly conduct.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to make the following observations. It is never in order to yell at the chair or yell over the chair when the chair is attempting to maintain order. It is never in order to yell at other senators, and it is never in order to yell over the top of another senator who has the call. Senators will not receive the call while they persist in disorderly conduct.
       </p>
       <p>
        I draw the attention of senators to reports of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Procedure Committee
        </a>
        relating to the conduct of the adjournment debate, particularly the first report of 2017—which followed the work of a procedural working group comprising senators representing the parties and the crossbench and which provides guidance on the conduct of Tuesday night adjournment, including the speakers list—and the first and second reports of 2013—which outline the establishment of the graduated time limits contained in standing order 56(6).
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to once again remind senators that we are all responsible for our own actions in this chamber. Thank you, senators.
