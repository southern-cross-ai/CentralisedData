        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Mental health touches us all in some way and it goes to the heart of our nation's wellbeing. Today's mental health announcement does not provide any new funding to mental health, so it unclear whether some people will be left worse off or if some services will be faced with more uncertainty. Will the government commit to increase funding to mental health in order to close the gap between Australia's mental health burden and the current levels of funding committed?

         I am sure that people around the country were pleased to see today the announcement from the government which has outlined a different approach to how we are going to deliver mental health care across this country. In addressing the senator's question about funding, it seems extraordinary that the senator would go to the issue that funding is going to be the only thing that is going to solve these problems and to give us a new approach to mental health care. But that is not surprising coming from the Greens, because you just see a simplistic approach about asking for more money. What we need is a new approach to how we are going to deliver mental health care in this country and that is exactly what the coalition government have delivered today
        </p>
        <p>
         It is about efficiently and effectively using the funding available, in what is a very tight fiscal environment, so we can get better outcomes. This policy is going to deliver much better outcomes. We are going to move from the current situation, where we see delivery of programs from Canberra out across the communityâ€”a very centralised and siloed approach to how those programs are delivered.

             I was very clear in saying that more money is not going to give us a better approach and solve the problems. That is why the government has been very clear in saying that we are changing the way we are doing this. We are not looking to more money to solve the problem. We know it is a clear change to the current system, and it is going to work. We have focused on local delivery. We are going to allow a stepped-care approach. We are not going to continue in the same constrained environment in which we are currently delivering mental health care.

              , I ask a supplementary question. I will take that answer as a 'no'. Mental health and wellbeing is affected by a range of factors, including stable work conditions, adequate housing and strong social supports. Will the government reverse its cuts to social services and stop its attacks on workplace conditions so that more Australians do not have their mental health put at risk?

               , I raise a point of order on that question. In line with Senator Wong's point of order yesterday and your timely newsletter to us, I question its compliance with standing order 73. It seems to be introducing very new information beyond the original question, which was about mental health funding. We are now going to social services funding. I am not even sure if that is in the minister's portfolio area.

                 In terms of the specifics, I indeed imagine that it is not in my portfolio area of health. In addressing the senator's question, what we have announced today with this new package will do exactly what I think the senator is referring to. It is about working with people on an individual basis to ensure that their needs are met. It is about looking across different communities and sectors so that our Primary Health Networks will now have the ability, at a local level, to look across their regions and assess the levels of need in those communities, so that people in the workplaces that the senator is referring to will be able to be assessed for their level of need and what the most appropriate way of delivering services to them will be. That is very different to the very constrained, siloed program delivery outcomes we have at the moment.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. All of the changed programs and funding shuffling in the world cannot reduce the stigma associated with mental illness. What does the minister say to Australians living with the stigma of mental illness, which today's announcement does little to address?

                   I am pleased to see that over recent years we have been making some inroads into reducing that stigma. We are taking this issue out from under the carpet. I think it is very important to look at those who are supporting what the government has done today.

                     , I raise a point of order. My question was specifically about what the minister would say to Australians living with the stigma of mental illness. It was specifically about stigma.

                      Senator Rice, the minister did address stigma first up in her answer. I have been listening to her answer and I think she has been directly relevant.
