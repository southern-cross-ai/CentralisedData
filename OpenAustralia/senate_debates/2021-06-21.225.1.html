        Every year on the Queen's birthday, we honour special individuals that go above and beyond in servicing the community. There were many worthy Australians that graced the list this year, and I would like to recognise individuals in areas close to my heart across Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'll start in the beautiful north-east, a place I visited only a few weeks ago. They are Loretta Carroll AM for significant service to the livestock industry and to the community, Dr Allan Curtis AM for significant service to environmental management education and research, Vivienne Ritchie AM for significant service to the

        </a>

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to mention some inspirational people in our northern and north-western suburbs who have had an incredible impact: Dr Ian Freckelton
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'd like to recognise those who've had a significant impact over the course of my political journey: Colin Tate AM, a thought leader in the superannuation and financial advice industries who has been recognised for significant service to the community through charitable initiatives; Amanda Miller OAM, a digital innovation pioneer herself who has been recognised for service to the community through philanthropic and impact investment sectors; Kerry Chikarovski AM, a trailblazer for women in the Liberal Party who has been recognised for significant service to the parliament of

        </a>
        and to the community; John Daley AM, one of the sharpest minds in even the most rarefied of rooms, who has been recognised for his significant service to public policy development and to the community; Vivian Ngyuen AM for significant service to the multicultural community in Victoria, specifically the Vietnamese community; Helen Shardey OAM, a former state member of parliament, the member for Caulfield, and a member of my own Liberal Women's Council, who has done terrific work serving on the board of Alfred Health and also

        for outstanding public service to superannuation reforms and implementation of infrastructure to enable the government's economic support measures for Australians during COVID-19; and the inimitable Peta Credlin AO for distinguished service to the parliament, policy development and the executive function of government. As a proud senator for Victoria, and on the global awareness day for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MND" rel="nofollow">

        , I couldn't possibly end this contribution without acknowledging Neale Daniher AM for his distinguished service to people with motor neurone disease and their families through advocacy, public education and fundraising initiatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to send my congratulations not only to those I've mentioned but to all recipients of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours

        . Australia is a nation rich in diversity and these honours reflect that. I would like to again thank this year's recipients wholeheartedly for their commitment, service and dedication to our communities. Australia is indeed a better place because of your contribution to our nation. I would also like to acknowledge the three young people in my office this week—Tyler Southwick,
