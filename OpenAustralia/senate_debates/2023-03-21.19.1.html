        Secretary-General Antonio Guterres puts it starkly and clearly. He said that we need to 'massively fast-track climate efforts by every country and every sector and on every time frame', that 'warp-speed' action is needed to save humanity from the thin ice it's on and that what happens this decade will be key to limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius or overshooting it, with catastrophic consequences. Guterres asks countries, including Australia, to commit to no new coal and the phasing-out of coal by 2030 and to block the exploitation of new and existing oil and gas reserves.

       <p>
        Australia is critical. We are the biggest exporter of gas in the world and the second-biggest exporter of coal. What we do in this place matters for the future of humanity and healthy life on this planet, and we know what we need to do. That is to keep coal, oil and gas in the ground, for our future, for our security, for our food, and for

        justice, totems and protecting country. It is too late for half-measures, for greenwashing and for fig leaves. There's no time left for the 116 new coal and gas projects that this government is planning. That will not safeguard our future.

        I just joined the chorus of women in the marble hall, singing with them about turning lament to renewal. I just sang to give our voice to the song of life, to give our promise to children on earth and to sing for peace through the power of love so that lament will turn to renewal. It is very clear what needs to be done to turn lament into renewal, and that is no new coal, oil or gas. Please listen to the scientists, listen to the women and take action.
