        </a>
        . This family owned business has one of the largest collections of primates in any Australian private zoo. It is home to hundreds of endemic Tasmanian, Australian native and exotic species, including critically endangered animals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmania Zoo was founded by Dick Warren in 2003 to contribute to wildlife conservation and educate the community. Dick's daughter Rochelle Penney took over running the zoo after his death in 2018, continuing his legacy to protect endangered animals.
       </p>
       <p>
        The zoo participates in the Tasmanian devil breeding program, contributing strong stock that has bolstered the national devil population and increased genetic diversity for the threatened species. Another Tasmanian Zoo success is the critically endangered northern white-cheeked gibbon, with the zoo's pair welcoming a baby last August. This tiny gibbon is one of just a handful born in captivity in the world, and the first in Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        Besides cute gibbons, fluffy red pandas, strutting cheetahs and hundreds of other animals, I must mention the zoo's newest residents: two 18-month-old giraffes named Hunter and Tallbert. These half-brothers were born at

        , on Queensland's Sunshine Coast, and are the first giraffes to call Tasmania home. It was a huge financial and logistical commitment for Rochelle to bring the giraffes to Tasmania, with help from the SeaRoad and Zoo 2 Zoo transport companies,

        , a team of zookeepers and a vet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coronavirus pandemic presented Tasmania Zoo with a different kind of logistical issue: feeding and caring for hundreds of animals while being closed for six months. During my recent visit to the zoo, Ms Penney expressed her gratitude for the Australian government's zoo and aquarium COVID-19 support package, which helped them out during that difficult time. Our government is making sure businesses like Tasmania Zoo can continue playing a vital role in protecting at-risk species and educating and entertaining visitors.
