                   The question was broader than that. The minister needs to address those parts of the question that pertain to the portfolio. I have ruled previously on this. The minister still has one minute and 34 seconds remaining to answer the question.

                             , I rise on the point of order, to make an obvious point. My view is that these questions are not necessarily in order and that they do not go to the minister's responsibilities. But you have ruled them in order and you have generally taken a liberal view of that and I accept that and I am not in any way critical. But I think it is the case that if the opposition want to try to slur the minister by referring to things that occurred not in this parliament and not in his role as minister, they really have to get used to the fact that the glass jaw cannot be the position they adopt. If they make a sleazy political accusation, they have to expect to get beaten up in return.
