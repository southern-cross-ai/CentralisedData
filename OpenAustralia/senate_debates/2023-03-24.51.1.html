        I must say that I was eating my breakfast this morning, flicking through my Twitter account, only to find out that I'd been copping smears from the other side, where I was accused of, basically, weaponising queer people for political purposes. Nothing could be further from the truth at all. I should say that it was actually left-wing activists—who think that biological men should compete in women's sport and use women's change rooms—that weaponised transgender women for political purposes. I'm pleased to say that the World Athletics Council agrees with me, and I'm pleased to say that women have rights to a safe space as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsequently it needs to be said that I think we're entitled to use some logic in this debate. Can someone please explain to me how a higher level of testosterone—hormones—and bone density doesn't give biological men an advantage in competitive sport? These are questions that we're allowed to raise. We're allowed to protect women from injury or intimidation in a change rooms without being smeared as Nazis and associated with Nazis. I notice Senator Watt said that before as well.

        Moira Deeming didn't go to that event on Saturday because she was associating herself with Nazis; she went there to stand up for women's rights. And yet we've got a Victorian premier, a man, who stands there and bullies a woman for standing up so that women can speak. If you want to start pointing the finger at anyone, it should be asked of the

        why it is that more Nazis are in Victoria than in any other state. What is the Labor Party doing about the Nazis in Victoria? It's about time you guys took a good look at yourself in the mirror before smearing people on this side with unfounded allegations. Shame on you.
