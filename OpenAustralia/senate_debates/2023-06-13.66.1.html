          I thank Senator Ruston for the question, and I refer her back to my statement, where I have made it clear that I received information several days before the first public reports went to air. I did nothing with that information—absolutely nothing. I was asked to keep it to myself, and I did. I'm not going to stand here and go through private conversations that I had with the person who is at the centre of this at a very, very difficult time in her life—a person who has had her privacy breached in the most egregious way over the last two years.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are, essentially, two things that have been alleged of me over the past week. The first is that I misled the Senate. I dealt with that in my statement today. Senator Reynolds and Senator Ruston were in the room when I explained that. They accepted that two years ago, and not once have either of them raised any concern about that with me. That's the first issue. The second issue that has been running in the media has been around my role in the compensation claim—an issue that has been incorrectly reported. These are the two issues that I have been hounded on—

            Yes, a point of order on relevance. I asked a very simple question; the minister has not answered my question in any way. I'd ask you to ask her, in the last 11 seconds, to answer it.

                              Minister, at any point prior to 15 February 2021 did you advise or encourage any person to refer serious allegations to the police? If so, when did you do that and in what format? If not, why not?

                                Thank you, President. Again, I'm not going to breach the confidence of the discussions I had with individuals who had come to me seeking my confidence, but I can guarantee you, as I have done in absolutely every case of a woman coming to me and saying that they had been sexually assaulted or harassed or subject to violence—as often happens in this country, more than we would like—I have ensured that they are aware of the options available to them for them to make their decisions. This has been central to Ms Higgins's case, where a young woman made a decision to tell her story on her own terms and in her own time.
