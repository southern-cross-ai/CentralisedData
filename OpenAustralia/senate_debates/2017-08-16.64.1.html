        My question is for the Attorney-General. There are reports today that the government plans to move ahead and unilaterally refer opposition MPs to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Disputed_Returns" rel="nofollow">
         Court of Disputed Returns
        </a>
        . To quote the Attorney-General from his speech last week:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I caution the Senate that it is a very dangerous course for this chamber or any parliamentary chamber to decide on what might be a party-line vote in the absence of clear evidence that a member of this chamber is not eligible to be here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Attorney, what is your clear evidence or what has changed since you gave your speech last week?

         , it's a good question. Let me address it. I think the principle that I referred to last week is a good principle. It is a good principle. Senator Di Natale, your former colleagues,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Ludlam" rel="nofollow">
          Scott Ludlam
         </a>
         and

          Larissa Waters
         </a>
         , did the right thing. They may have resigned prematurely, but they certainly did the right thing in freely and without any pressure disclosing that they felt that they had a constitutional issue with section 44, just as Senator Canavan, Mr Joyce and Senator Roberts did the right thing by freely disclosing that they felt that they may have a constitutional problem under section 44.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, it's certainly the government's view, based on Solicitor-General advice, that Senator Canavan and Mr Joyce are likely to be found by the High Court not to be disqualified in these circumstances by section 44.

             , I have already told you that that remains my view. Nevertheless, it does depend, for it to operate, on a level of integrity by members of parliamentâ€”integrity that was, let me acknowledge, shown by

            <p>
             What we don't have is the same level of integrity shown by members of the

             . Two days ago, the Prime Minister wrote to Mr Shorten and invited him to nominate any members of the Australian Labor Party about whom he had a level of concern, and Mr Shorten wrote straight back to the Prime Minister and indicated that he wasn't interested in participating in that process. Where there are levels of concernâ€”

                , I adhere to what I said last week. I think that is a good principle if it's capable of operating, but it does depend on the integrity of members of parliament in making good-faith attempts to remove and clarify doubts about their eligibility. At the moment, there are no reference motions before either chamber other than the ones that have been dealt with, unless there is something being done in the House of Representatives of which I'm unaware. I'm not aware of any reference motions that have been moved against any members of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">

               <p>
                I would repeat that where there have been concerns raised about eligibilityâ€”it seems to me, for example, that in the case of Ms Justine Keay, the member for Braddon, the facts are very little different from the facts of Senator Malcolm Robertsâ€”it does depend upon that member showing the integrity and respect for this institution to come forward.

                  Given that the principles the Attorney-General outlined in his previous speech don't seem to hold water and are now being jettisoned at the altar of political opportunity, why won't the government resolve this once and for all and support the Greens and crossbench motion for a comprehensive audit of all members of parliament, so this issue can be settled and the uncertainty resolved?

                   , I agree with you that the uncertainty absolutely ought to be resolved. Might I point out, with respect, that what you are suggesting is a compulsory process, yet in the same breath you are criticising the government for, as you imagineâ€”though I think you're factually wrongâ€”proposing a motion subjecting some Labor members to a compulsory process. The fact is, Senator Di Nataleâ€”

                            It does depend upon all elements of the parliamentâ€”government, crossbench and oppositionâ€”displaying integrity. The government has displayed integrity on this.
