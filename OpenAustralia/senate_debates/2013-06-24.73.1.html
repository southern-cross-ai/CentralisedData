        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. I refer to the fact that, under the government's guillotine motion, the Senate has been given approximately 15 minutes to debate the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill 2013 on Thursday. Given that this is a contentious issue of policy that needs to be properly debated, why is the government using the guillotine as a political tool to avoid scrutiny, negating the principles of accountability and openness?

         As I answered a few moments ago, the opposition are crying crocodile tears when it comes to complaining about the length of time available to debate this bill. If they had not filibustered, if they had not wasted two full days on the

          , I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question was about the Migration Amendment (Temporary Sponsored Visas) Bill. It was about nothing else. It asked why the government was guillotining that particular bill. References to Telstra, references to the

             That those opposite are, again, time-wasting with these points of order—to grandstand and just repeat endlessly the same mantra—goes to the heart of why it is necessary. Those opposite have no interest in debating these issues. They have an interest in pursuing Mr Abbott's no-policy agenda. They want to oppose, oppose, oppose. They simply want to use this chamber as part of their political strategy. They will be exposed on that side of the chamber for having no interest whatsoever in substantive policy debate, because those opposite would not be able to make a positive contribution to these debates. They simply would stand up and say, 'No.' And then they would waste the rest of their time trying to justify their opposition for opposition's sake and trying to support Mr Abbott.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Given the government's deliberate failure to conduct a regulatory impact statement in relation to the labour-market-testing aspects of this bill, is it not true that the extraordinary haste with which this bill has been rammed through the parliament is confirmation of the total control that the union movement has over the Green-Labor government?
