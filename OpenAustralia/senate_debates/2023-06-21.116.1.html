        , Senator Watt. The Albanese Labor government has made making early learning more affordable for families a priority of our first year in government. The government clearly recognises the critical role early learning plays in a child's development and boosting our economic prosperity by supporting workforce participation. Why has the government made early learning a priority, and what changes is the government making to the childcare subsidy from July? How will these changes impact on Australian families, easing cost-of-living pressures?

         Thank you, Senator Green. I know this is a topic very dear to your heart, with baby Stevie now participating in early childhood education herself, and what a bright young woman she will turn out to be, I have no doubt. The Albanese government has made early learning a priority of our first year. We've done this because we know how important affordable early learning is. We know that for too many families the cost of early learning has put it out of reach. Unfortunately, under the Liberals and Nationals, out-of-pocket costs for early learning went up by 49 per cent, and that is not helping cost-of-living pressures, I don't think—is it? We, on the other hand, are taking action to ease cost-of-living pressures on Australian families by making early learning more affordable. From July our changes to the childcare subsidy will boost the maximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning $80,000 or less.

         Gerard, we know you don't like child care, and we know what you have said about Dorothy and child care and things like that.

                            As I was saying, from July our changes to the childcare subsidy will boost the maximum subsidy rate to 90 per cent for families earning $80,000 or less. We're also boosting the subsidy rates for around 96 per cent of families with a child in care who are earning under $530,000. Our changes will also introduce a base level of 36 subsidised hours of early learning per fortnight for

                            children. First Nations children will have access to the base level of subsidised hours regardless of their family activities.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            These changes will deliver more affordable early childhood education and care for around 1.2 million families, including 265,000 in rural and regional Australia. Our reforms will help more children access the powerful benefits of early childhood education and provide real cost-of-living relief for families. We're making these changes because we know that investing in early education is good for children, it's good for families and it's good for the country.

                              Affordable early learning pays a triple dividend: it's good for children, it's good for families and it's good for the economy. But the evidence also shows that some groups in the community benefit from investments in early learning. Can the minister advise of any specific groups that will benefit from the changes to the childcare subsidy that will come into effect in July this year?

                               Thank you again, Senator Green. I'm pleased to say that over 1.2 million families in Australia will benefit from the changes to the childcare subsidy. But I do want to take the time to draw attention to two groups that we know will particularly benefit from the changes, the first being Australian women, who we know are often primary carers. We know that the high costs for early learning act as a massive disincentive for women to get back into the workforce, and our changes will give Australian women more choice. Having more women in the workforce will make a real difference for our economy, as well as empowering them and making a difference to families.

                               children and families. Our changes will introduce a base level of 36 subsidised hours of early learning per fortnight for First Nations children, regardless of activity. This will build on our government's commitment to closing the gap and ensure that First Nations children get the best start in life. As many as 6,000 First Nations families will benefit from these changes, in addition to the many other Australian families who will too.

                                 Thank you, Minister. Making early learning more affordable for families is a vital reform providing immediate cost-of-living relief to families, but affordability is just one part of the government's agenda. Minister, what other actions is the Albanese Labor government taking to build a world-class, flexible early education system?

                                  Thank you again, Senator Green. I'm pleased to say the Albanese government is also looking to the future, taking action to build an early education system that is fit for purpose—one that will ensure all children have access to the transformational benefits of high-quality early learning, a system that support parents and provide them with more choice.

                                  . These reviews will help our government navigate the path to building a more sustainable early childhood education system.

                                  We are also investing in the early childhood education workforce, recognising the critical role they play in children's lives. As part of this year's budget, we have invested $72.4 million in a workforce package focused on access to professional development and upskilling. Our government values early education, we value the people who work in early education, and we're investing in making early learning more affordable while building a world-class system.
