           We support this motion. After the resignation of Senator McKenzie over matters raised in this motion, one would think that the Nationals would have learned their lesson. However, overnight Minister Littleproud said in an interview with the ABC:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           What people have to understand is you might get a warm, fuzzy feeling voting for a micro-party …
          </p>
          <p>
           …   …   …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           [They] won't be cutting the cheques. We cut the cheques.
          </p>
          <p>
           What an outrageous thing to say! Senator McKenzie resigned as Deputy Leader of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">
            The Nationals
           </a>
           for treating the taxpayer's chequebook as the Nationals' own multimillion-dollar slush fund. Minister Littleproud has been elevated to Deputy Leader of The Nationals and has immediately declared business as usual. The lesson has clearly not been learned. Taxpayers expect and deserve better.
