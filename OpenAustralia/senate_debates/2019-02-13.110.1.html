        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Before I ask my question, Minister, I note that we've had a number of delegations in this place over the last few days from our near-northern neighbours. Can the minister outline progress made by the Liberal-National government to enhance our engagement in the Pacific, and how these efforts make Australia and the region safer and more secure?

         I thank Senator Brockman for his question, because the government has been very clear in recognising that a stable, secure and prosperous region benefits us all. We know that our Pacific neighbours are family. That's why the Liberal-National government has announced a comprehensive set of initiatives to support the region's ongoing development, and those announcements are becoming a reality. Last month, Prime Minister Morrison became the first

         to visit Fiji since 2006 and the first to visit Vanuatu since 1990, affirming their role in regional leadership. In Fiji we're elevating our relationship through the Fiji-Australia Vuvale partnership, which will be broad ranging and comprehensive, deepening our security, our economic and our people-to-people links. Last week, I was privileged to visit the

          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         , Tuvalu and, briefly, Vanuatu. I met leaders there to discuss progress in deepening our partnerships. I was able to turn the sod on two important initiatives—a new telecommunications cable landing point in Honiara and our new purpose-built high commission in Funafuti in Tuvalu. I officially opened our interim high commission while I was there.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're working more closely than ever with the

          Pacific Island
         </a>
         nations on the issues of greatest concern to them, as the Boe declaration affirmed, including regional security around climate solutions and disaster resilience. As the Prime Minister has said, we are strengthening our engagement with the Pacific for the Pacific's sake, because this is our home. This government has a comprehensive plan to step up our engagement in the Pacific, and we are delivering. Working closely with the assistant minister, Senator Ruston, with the Prime Minister and with myself, we are delivering.

            We're stepping up in the Pacific to enhance cooperation across defence, policing and cybersecurity to create a safer and more secure region, again guided by the Boe Declaration on Regional Security from last year's
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Island" rel="nofollow">

            s Forum. We're also working together to address the Pacific's unique security interests—including those from environmental challenges and those from transnational crime, both human and cybersecurity issues—because we know that a strong and stable region keeps us more secure. It enables our economies to grow and our peoples to prosper. In partnership with Fiji we've begun the redevelopment of the Blackrock peacekeeping facility with Prime Minister Morrison and the new Fijian Foreign Minister Seruiratu, turning the first sod last month.

               As with all relationships, we know that our bonds in the Pacific are formed and founded in our people-to-people links. We have shared history, interests and understanding. That's why we are investing in a number of projects to strengthen those common bonds, including, particularly, in sport, which often lies at the heart of Australia's engagement with the Pacific. It brings people, communities and countries together. In fact, I was just discussing this with the Nauruan finance minister,
