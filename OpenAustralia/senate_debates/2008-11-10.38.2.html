        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Who leaked the confidential details of a private conversation between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States on 10 October, as reported by

         I thank the senator for the question. I have no personal knowledge but I understand that the Prime Minister has made it clear, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">
          White House
         </a>
         has made it clear, and the

          United States Ambassador
         </a>
         has made it clear that the reported comment was never made and was inaccurate. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         Ambassador has made it clear that the matter is now concluded. I think if everyone had made it clear that the reported comment was never made then clearly it could not have been leaked. So, as far as the government are concerned and as far as the United States Ambassador is concerned, the matter is closed.

         There was a call between the Prime Minister and the President of the United States where they both emphasised the importance of the G20 and its response to the global financial crisis. That was the purpose of the call from the Prime Minister to the President of the United States and that, I think, is an important call. Certainly, from the Australian government’s point of view, it was important that there was a commitment to the G20. I think all parties to the call and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Ambassador" rel="nofollow">
          US Ambassador
         </a>
         have made it clear that they have a common understanding and that the matter, as far as they are concerned, is closed.

          Whatever the contents of the conversation, someone leaked it.

          , I ask a supplementary question. As the Prime Minister’s office has now confirmed that when he took the call from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush" rel="nofollow">
           President Bush
          </a>
          the only other person present was a note-taker, will the Prime Minister now investigate the security breach or come clean and admit he was the source of the leak?

           I cannot really add much to the original answer I gave. I made it clear that the Prime Minister and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">
            White House
           </a>
           had made it clear, and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
            US
           </a>
           Ambassador has also commented to this effect, that the comment was never made and was inaccurate. Therefore, a question of a leak does not occur. As I understand it, all parties agree on the importance of the call and what occurred and, as far as the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_Ambassador" rel="nofollow">
            US Ambassador
           </a>
           is concerned, the matter is concluded.
