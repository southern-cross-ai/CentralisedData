              Senator Abetz, they absolutely apply double standards. Yesterday, I was asking legitimate questions. Of course, we have copies of documents. There are all the matters that I have referred to in this chamber about this issue since August last year, and there are lots of documents, but all I got produced from this government was 44 folios, most of which were just blank pages. We know that Minister Garrett received correspondence from the member for Dobell, because on one little line that was unredacted it refers to Mr Thomson raising concerns about interaction between '…' and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEEWR" rel="nofollow">
               DEEWR
              </a>
              . Who is '…'? We know who '…' is: it is

               CCGT
              </a>
              . Of course, because the documents were denied to me because of unsubstantiated allegations, this is only a cover-up.
