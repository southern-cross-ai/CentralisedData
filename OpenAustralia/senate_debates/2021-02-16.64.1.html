        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Reynolds. On what date did the minister first become aware of the allegations of rape made by her former staff member? What action did the minister take as a result?

         I thank the senator for that question.

         just address a couple of the questions that somewhat took me by surprise previously, and I will come to that question, Senator. I've just checked and I can confirm that my second staff member—he was terminated shortly after this incident occurred, and it was for a security breach. I do not recollect any contact I've had with him since then and I certainly cannot recollect doing a reference for him. But, now that this issue has been raised, I'm doing a search of the files just to determine that that is true. But I have no recollection—and I can't imagine any circumstance in which I would. But, again, I will check that.

          In relation to the last question, the dates, Senator, you probably know more about the incidents surrounding the incident itself, as other members of this chamber do, because there's been a parliamentary inquiry into the circumstances of when and how I was told. So I will provide all of those details to the investigation.

               It's on relevance. I understand very clearly that Ms Brittany Higgins has said that she is comfortable with these questions being asked. I think it's important that we get to these questions being answered, and there is the capacity for the minister to dutifully answer them.

                     The minister's former staff member was allegedly raped in the defence minister's office almost two years ago. When was the Prime Minister's office informed, and how; and when was the Prime Minister informed, and how?
