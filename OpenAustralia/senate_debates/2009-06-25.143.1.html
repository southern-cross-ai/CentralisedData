        My question is to Senator Ludwig, the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Health_and_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Health and Welfare

        into hospital statistics, which notes that visits to emergency departments in Australia are growing by five per cent a year. In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        an average wait time in an emergency department is 10 hours. Bearing in mind the Prime Minister’s promise to fix the public hospital system by next Tuesday, I ask: does the minister regard people waiting for 10 hours for treatment in emergency departments as the kind of fix the Prime Minister had in mind?

         What we do regard as good health and hospital reform is putting $64 billion over five years into it—unlike those opposite, who thought the good for the health system was in fact to remove $1 billion from it. Unlike those opposite—it is very disappointing to hear those opposite complain—I welcome the latest report from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Health_and_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
         </a>
         and the contribution it makes to the accountability and performance of hospital systems. It is clear that public hospitals are continuing to experience pressures in relation to elective surgery and emergency department activity. The government is implementing lasting reform to alleviate this pressure on the hospital system.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think the real issue is we are implementing lasting reform. We have a

          COAG

         agreement. We have looked at both health and hospital funding, but we have also said that we would put $64 billion over five years, which is provided through the national health care special purpose payment, which now goes beyond hospitals and covers other areas of the health system, and through the National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform, preventative health and Indigenous health. The National Partnership Agreement on Hospital and Health Workforce Reform provides funding of $2.5 billion, including $154 million for a more nationally consistent system of activity based funding. It also provides $1.1 billion to train more doctors and ensures the training of nurses and other health professionals. There is also $500 million to improve sub-acute care services. In addition, when you look at the achievements within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT

         and break that down—and I know those opposite, particularly the senator for the ACT, would be interested in knowing that—the ACT government has received $10 million—

          , I ask a supplementary question. I am glad for that clarification. I had thought the Prime Minister, when he was promising to fix the hospital system, was talking about outcomes, not inputs. The same report from the Institute of Health and Welfare indicates the median waiting time for elective surgery across Australia was 34 days last financial year—two days more than the previous financial year. Again in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
           ACT
          </a>
          it is more than double that—72 days wait for elective surgery. What does the minister suggest that I say to my constituents, who were promised a system that would be fixed by now but instead have a system which is actually falling apart?

           It is one of those areas that I know the Senator for the

            ACT
           </a>
           has an interest in. I know he prefaces all his remarks to the constituents, but when he was in government he participated in ripping $1 billion out of the health and hospitals system. We have said time and time again that we have been in government for 18 months and we have put our money where our mouth is. Those opposite did not do that. When you look at emergency department funding, the Rudd government will deliver $750 billion to state and territory emergency departments. The ACT received $10 million of that. That is $10 million that was not there and that is now being provided for elective surgery. There is also stage 2 of the program to ensure the ACT can also get $6.6 million for capital works at Canberra and Calvary hospitals, because it is not going to be a system that is fixed overnight after the mess the Liberals left it in. We will need to ensure that we provide both the capital funding—

What this government is doing is putting in $64 billion over five years to address the neglect that you left. And if you want to tell us about what your plan is, I am only too happy to hear it. I suspect it is a piece of paper that is blank, quite frankly, because what this government is doing is ensuring that we are addressing the neglect that the previous government left the health and hospitals system in—12 years of neglect. And of course those opposite do not like what I am saying. I understand that. I understand you do not like it because of course you are responsible for the neglect. You are responsible—

If so, Senator Abetz has said it would be inappropriate for him to have voted, so the matter may be recommitted to the chamber.
