           CSG

          and other forms of unconventional mining taking place on their land. Sadly, some four weeks ago

           George Bender
          </a>
          , a brave and courageous Queensland cotton farmer, took his own life because he could not cope with the stress and devastation of CSG mining happening on his cotton farm. Today I am taking a stand for all families, farmers and landholders across rural and regional Australia who are having to suffer the impact of CSG and other forms of unconventional gas mining. I am determined to ensure that George Bender did not die in vain. My motion establishes a committee to inquire into the human impact of CSG and other forms of unconventional gas mining. We must listen to the people of Australia. We must investigate the impact of CSG. We must acknowledge, face and respond to the suffering and devastation that is being endured by farmers and landholders at the hands of this industry.

             I recognise Senator Lazarus's keen interest in this issue, but the government cannot support this motion because of flaws in its construction. The coalition has supported previous inquiries into coal seam gas, including one chaired by Senator Bill Heffernan in 2011. That inquiry provided a fair opportunity for all senators to have their say. Because of that, it made recommendations that actually ended up in law. However, the proposed inquiry before us today would be established in a way that prevents the fair reflection of all views in this chamber. The motion provides for just one coalition senator out of five members, despite the coalition representing more than two in every five members of this chamber. It also establishes another select committee, when there is no reason why this inquiry could not usefully be sent to a standing references committee. Finally, I note that the issues outlined in this motion are largely ones for state governments. That is why the Commonwealth energy minister has committed to raising these issues with his state colleagues at the next

               Senator Xenophon, if you are going to amend motions, you really should have them in writing and before me at the time, but it is a simple amendment, so we will probably manage. Is leave granted for Senator Xenophon to seek to amend the motion?

                I seek some clarification of Senator Xenophon's amendment. My understanding is that this committee would have five members. If you were to add one member to the government's side, that paragraph of the motion would then be internally inconsistent.

                 Exactly. This is the problem which I pointed out. I am taking it that Senator Xenophon's amendment actually increases the total number on the committee.

                  I apologise. The amendment ought to be in these terms: that the committee should consist of six, not five, senators, and that there be two, rather than one, nominated by the

                       I raise two points of order. In relation to the motion as a whole, is there a rule in the Senate that senators can only chair one committee? I note that this is a second committee that Senator Lazarus would chair. The second point of order is: I understood there was a convention, if not a rule, that all of the crossbenchers would share in any committee chairs that were going to the crossbenchers. I am not aware of any other crossbencher having the chairmanship of a committee, whereas, if the motion to establish a select committee passes, this one senator will have two chairs.

                        I am certainly not aware of any such rule. I am aware that other senators have chaired two committees in the past. To my knowledge, there is no rule that limits chairs going to crossbenchers. The question is that the amendment moved by Senator Xenophon be agreed to.
