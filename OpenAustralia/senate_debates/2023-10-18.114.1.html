        My question is for the

         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        , Senator Farrell. The last election saw the biggest drop in votes for candidates from the major parties in our nation's history. More and more Australians are voting for independents like Senator Tyrrell and me. Australians are voting for independents because they know our loyalty is to the people who put us here—it is not to big corporate donors and it is not to unions. We work only for our people. Minister, you publicly stated in June this year:

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian electoral system shouldn't be just open to people with lots of money.
       </p>
       <p>
        What is your government planning to do to, as you have stated, 'ensure that combination of transparency so that ordinary people can run campaigns'?

         I thank Senator Lambie for her question. The process that we have set in place is the one that occurs after every election. The issue of electoral reform is referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. I have made submissions to that committee. They have put down, or released, an interim report, and we are now in the process of obviously taking further submissions. I welcome any submission from the Jacqui Lambie Network to that committee process.
        </p>
        <p>
         The objective, of course, is the objective that Labor set out before the last election, which is to improve transparency and accountability in our electoral system. Nobody is suggesting at any point that this would make it more difficult for people like yourself to get elected. But when you have seen in the last two elections that one individual has spent over $200 million on the electoral system, I say this parliament has to review the way in which our electoral laws work so that it is not simply rich people with vast amounts of money who can get themselves elected. With all due respect, Senator Lambie, you are not in that situation. I will, at some point—

            Peter Dutton

           to give major parties even more public funding during tough times, a dirty deal that would entrench the major parties and make it harder for Australians to vote for ordinary people at federal elections. Will you confirm that you have already cut a deal with Peter Dutton to raise the amount of taxpayer money that goes to political candidates?

               In the state of Victoria, when Labor and the Liberals did a deal on election funding, they gave themselves exemptions for their own slushy funds, funds like Labour Holdings and the Cormac Foundation. It seems Labor is good at talking the talk but not walking the walk. Will the minister rule out exempting slush funds or will you admit here today that your deal with the opposition leader is a cynical attempt to stop ordinary people, instead of career politicians, from being elected to parliament?

                Thank you, Senator Lambie. You obviously wrote that second supplementary question before you listened to my answer in the first supplementary question. But I thought I made it very directly clear that I don't have any agreement with Mr Dutton about electoral reform. I have explained to you what the process is, and the process is the same process that goes on after every election. We review the processes of the previous election. We work out ways in which we can improve our electoral process.
