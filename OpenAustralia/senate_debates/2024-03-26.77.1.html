        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Watt. Since taking office, the Albanese Labor government has been focused on getting wages moving and easing cost-of-living pressures—in contrast to those opposite, who support a race to the bottom on wages. How is the government's approach to the Fair Work Commission's annual wage review helping ensure Australian workers earn more and keep more of what they earn?

         As you may have noticed, there is no limit to how many times we will talk about the actions of the Albanese government to ensure that Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn. This is something that opposition senators are going to need to get used to for the remainder of this term. We are going to talk about it over and over again because it's something so many Australians are looking forward to.
        </p>
        <p>
         To help Australians earn more, the Albanese Labor government has consistently backed low-paid workers through the annual wage reviews in 2022, 2023 and now in 2024. What a contrast to the nearly 10 years of coalition government that we had, with a government that refused to actively engage itself in the Fair Work Commission's decisions about the minimum wage. It's no wonder, therefore, that we saw wage suppression in this country, especially for low-paid workers, for the nearly 10 years they were in office.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a good thing that now, under a Labor government—the Albanese Labor government—we have a government that is prepared to roll its sleeves up, put forward submissions and put forward an argument to the Fair Work Commission, as we have done each year since we have been in office. As a result of that action, the minimum wage for a full-time worker in Australia is now $110 higher than when we came to office.
        </p>
        <p>
         We understand that low paid workers, more than anyone in our community, are feeling the pinch from cost-of-living pressures. How much worse off would they be if we hadn't taken the action that we took to support a wage rise for the minimum wage? That is now bearing fruit, with people receiving $110 more than what they were receiving when we took office.
        </p>
        <p>
         And they don't like it. They don't like a government getting involved and fighting for fairer wages for workers. The same approach that we've taken this year, a submission to the Fair Work Commission, that the wages—

              It is an unfortunate thing to have been a senator for nearly five years and only get a chance to speak when he interjects. Senator Rennick never gets to ask a question; he only ever interjects.

                   Thank you, Senator Stewart. Well, it's pretty straightforward. The Albanese Labor government is fighting for a pay rise for our low paid workers because it's the right thing to do for people who have been hit hardest by the rising cost of living.

                     Thank you, Minister, for that response. I note that the Liberals and Nationals have committed to a targeted repeal of the government's workplace relations reforms to restore the low-wage economic settings that they support. How have the Albanese Labor government's decisions and actions helped reverse the pattern of wage stagnation, while getting more Australians into jobs?

                     <p>
                      Thank you, Senator Stewart. Our government is fighting every day to ensure Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn. I reckon by the end of this term we can have coalition senators saying that. Repeat after me, coalition senators: 'The Labor government will ensure that Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn.' It's pretty straightforward. We know you believe it because you voted for our tax cuts. So you must agree that a Labor government delivers Australians the ability to earn more and keep more of what they earn.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Of course, we remember Senator Cash—and I haven't mentioned her in question time for a while, so let's give her another go. She said that our measures would 'close down Australia' by letting Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      We had the member for Banks say that the secure jobs bill was 'a grotesque piece of legislation'.
