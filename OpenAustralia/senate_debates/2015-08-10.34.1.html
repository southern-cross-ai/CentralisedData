        —I was absolutely amazed by that answer. My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. I refer to Hutchison Ports Australia and the reprehensible sacking of 97 employees in five-minutes-to-midnight text messages on Friday night, effective immediately. I also refer to the minister's statement:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the culture is that employees can text message the boss and they in fact expect the boss to text message them, then that may be an appropriate methodology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the minister really endorse text messages as a means of terminating employment in this country?

         I thank Senator Cameron for the question. Not only was Senator Cameron asleep at the wheel when his time had commenced to ask the question; he also failed to tell the Australian people and the Senate the full quote. Where he conveniently stopped, he did that to try to—well, for whatever his purpose might be. I continued: 'I'm not going to comment on it other than, given whatever the culture might be, you want employees and employers to treat each other with respect and due consideration.' Why could Senator Cameron not bring himself to quote that to the Australian people and indeed to the Senate? Why is it not possible for Senator Cameron ever to honestly represent that which is said by those of us on this side? Quoting half-sentences might be your game, Senator Cameron—it diminishes you; it diminishes the Labor Party. From my perspective, what I have said at all times is—and I repeat—that employers and employees should treat each other with respect and due consideration.

          , a point of order on direct relevance to the question: the last part of the question was clearly, 'Does the minister really endorse text messages as a means of terminating employment?' I take the point the minister has covered his situation up to this point, but with 36 seconds to go that part of the question remains unanswered.

           Order! Thank you, Senator Moore, for your point of order. I believe the minister was directly relevant. He was addressing the quote that was referred to by the questioner. The minister has the call.

            I was about to continue to say that this matter is in fact before the Fair Work Commission. If we want to talk about respect, I would invite Senator Cameron to say to the

            </a>

              Senator Cameron, I have already ruled on that point of order. I believe the minister has now concluded his answer. But, in any event, the minister was directly relevant in relation to the quote that you quoted to him. He indicated with his answer, in completing the quote, about mutual respect from employer to employee. I believe he was directly relevant. Minister, am I correct or not, that you had concluded your answer?

                 As I understand the sorry history of Australia's waterfront over many decades, the balaclavas were, in fact, used by certain workers to protect themselves from being identified in retaliatory action by the

                  , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the seriousness of the Hutchison dispute and the potential for it to disrupt Australian ports, will the minister abandon his confrontational and partisan approach to workplace relations and, instead, encourage a cooperative, negotiated settlement to the dispute in the national interest?
