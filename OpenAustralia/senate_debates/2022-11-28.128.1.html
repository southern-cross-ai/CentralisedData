        and Energy, Senator Wong. With the large-scale penetration of renewables into the national grid over the past 20 years coinciding with energy costs for Australian households and businesses rising by 300 per cent or more over the same period, is the Albanese government telling Australians the truth when it says renewables are cheaper?

         Thank you, Senator Hanson, for the question. Yes, we are. It's not simply our assessment; it's the assessment of those involved in the energy markets, and those assessments are public. It is the case that the lack of policy certainty over the last decade has meant we have seen an increase in energy prices, combined with the international circumstances we see, which are well known to everyone in this chamber, including the war on Ukraine and the way in which energy supplies are being utilised as part of that, essentially—

           Senator Hanson, with respect, it's not simply me saying this; this is what global markets are saying. This is what developed economies around the world are saying. If you go to Europe and you understand what is occurring in Europe and what is occurring in global markets, it is affecting Australia's energy costs, as costs are being affected around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Rennick—a bit of economic irrationality over there, fair enough! The reality is the market is not where you are. Senator Hanson, we deeply appreciate how difficult the increase in energy costs is for Australian households.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sorry; I don't know how to respond to the interjection from Senator Rennick! We understand how difficult it is. The government is very seized of this. I would make the point to you that a rational position that was in place over so many years under those opposite meant that we saw supply exit the system, and we know if supply exits the system what happens to price.

            Before I call Senator Hanson for her first supplementary, I remind senators on both sides this is crossbench time. They get limited opportunity, and interjections are disorderly. I would appreciate Senator Hanson having the benefit of hearing Minister Wong's responses in quiet. Senator Hanson, a first supplementary question?

             Senator Wong, I don't accept your answer to the question and neither do a lot of Australians, because the war in Ukraine only just started this year and energy costs have been going up for years. My question is: with domestic energy costs predicted to increase by up to 56 per cent over the next two years as more renewables come online and more coal fired plants are closed ahead of time, will the Albanese government apologise to the Australian people for falsely claiming it would reduce household energy bills by $275 per year?

             <p>
              Senator Hanson, we are seeking to deal with what is happening in global energy markets and what is happening in the domestic energy markets, and we inherited, as you will recall, a price increase for which the policy response was simply the former minister, Mr Taylor, hiding a price increase prior to the next election. We inherited a system which saw four gigawatts of dispatchable capacity leave the system with only one gigawatt coming in.

              In relation to the point about renewables, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
               CSIRO
              </a>
              , in their report in July 2022, forecast that by 2030 electricity produced by solar

              would be two-thirds cheaper than black coal and over 80 per cent cheaper than nuclear, and wind generation would be 50 per cent cheaper than black coal and 80 per cent cheaper than nuclear. The reason the market has not invested in more coal fired power is because the market is looking at the same predictions that I have just outlined to you.

                Maybe they're not looking into it because the government is shutting coal down in Australia. Considering that no human being in history has ever led a carbon-neutral existence, will the minister please explain to the Senate and the Australian people how the Albanese government's policies to bring in more than 250,000 immigrants every year are consistent with its policy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43 per cent by 2030?

                 Senator Hanson, we do think that responsible levels of migration are consistent with economic growth. We also believe that renewables are demonstrably a cheaper energy source than those which I have outlined—so coal and nuclear—which explains market behaviour over this last decade. It is the case we will have to transform our economy, and we will have to ensure that we, both, reduce what we put into the atmosphere and offset that which we cannot reduce. In that regard, the position the Albanese government is putting is where the mainstream economies of the world are. It is where the majority of the global economies are, and—
