         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) and (2) Headcount including maintenance and leave relief staff.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) At this stage there are no plans for significant changes to the staffing levels in the field offices listed in questions 1 and 2. Changes may result from the introduction of the Next Generation Forecast and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warning_System" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Decisions on the staffing levels within Bureau offices depend on service requirements and changes in technology. They can also depend on the availability of staff to work in some locations. Staff numbers and locations are constantly under review to optimise the service.

         's radars provide rainfall estimation, and not forecasts, by detecting the reflection of radar signals from water droplets. Every radar has unique characteristics and limitations which are determined by the location and type of the radar. Due to the complexity of the terrain near Townsville the radar was positioned in an elevated location to enable the better detection of severe weather such as thunderstorms, tropical cyclones and potential flooding over a larger geographical area. This means that some low-level rainfall may go undetected. Recent maintenance and calibration checks have ensured that the radar is now operating to specifications.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (9) The Bureau has received some comments on the radar's ability to detect low-level showers. In response, the Bureau has recently adjusted the radar settings to capture rainfall closer to the ground and has conducted further calibration and maintenance checks on the radar.
