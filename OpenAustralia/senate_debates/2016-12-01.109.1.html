        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to answers given by the Prime Minister yesterday in question time. Can the minister explain why the Prime Minister refused to rule out appointing Senator Brandis to a diplomatic or judicial post before the next election?

         I have actually seen the Prime Minister's answer. I found it quite flattering, actually, Senator Kitching. But I think the point that the Prime Minister was at pains to make is the extraordinary obsession the shadow Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus, has with me. Senator Kitching, this is the point of the Prime Minister's answer. Senator Dreyfus, I am sorry to say, Senator Kitching, has developed a very, very unfortunate reputation around this place in the last year or two as the man who cried wolf, because every time Senator Dreyfus has mounted a political attack on me it has fallen flat. Do you know why it has fallen flat, Senator Kitching? Do you know why it has fallen flat?

             On the point of order, I hate to keep pointing out the Attorney's lack of knowledge of the standing orders, but, under standing order 193, I do not think he can refer to the shadow Attorney-General in the way he just has. I refer particularly to sub order 3.

               , I do owe the Senate an apology in referring to Mr Mark Dreyfus as a senator. I am sure every senator would be embarrassed by that misattribution. Senator Kitching, the reason everyone of Mr Mark Dreyfus's political attacks on me have fallen flat is the absence of one essential ingredient, and that is relevant facts or evidence. That is the problem.

                   . I was asked about the Prime Minister's answer and I was referring to it directly. So, Senator Kitching, if you are going to mount a political attack on somebody, you ought to make sure you have the evidence. We know that the Hayden royal commission had plenty of evidence about you, Senator Kitching. We know the Hayden royal commission had enough evidence about you, Senator Kitching, to refer not one, not two but in 11 criminal prosecutions to the police or the Fair Work Authority. But, nevertheless, in relation to what Mr Dreyfus has said about me from time to time, it would strengthen his hand if he had any relevant facts.

                               Senator Wong, it is question time. I adjudicate on the information before me. Senator Brandis has indicated that the Prime Minister's answer contained exactly the information that he is reporting to the Senate, and that is what the question inquired about. The question inquired about the Prime Minister's answer. The Attorney-General is completely relevant in relation to this question. Attorney-General.

                                . If you ask an open-ended question, you must expect the answer that you get. Mr Dreyfus is not just obsessed with me, Senator Kitching; he is obsessed with you. Why otherwise did he say that he would resign if you were appointed to the Senate? We are waiting to see Mr Dreyfus come good on his threat.

                                   Senator Kitching, in the spirit of the season I will overlook the jibe and I will say to you that what we have achieved—as recently as today, by the way, as I addressed in my answer to Senator Fawcett—is to concentrate on what really matters to the Australian people, in my portfolio and in the portfolio of every minister represented along this front bench. In my portfolio, had you bothered to attend the debate, which you did not, you would have seen two important national security bills passed by the chamber as recently as this morning, and you would have seen, earlier this week, the Prime Minister and I announce the appointment of the first woman to be the
