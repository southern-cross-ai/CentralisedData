       <p>
        Thank you, Mr Deputy President. I am not sure whether I will need the full three minutes. Tonight I want to record in this parliament the sad passing of one of Australia’s renowned modern playwrights,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Buzo" rel="nofollow">
         Alex Buzo
        </a>
        . Alex Buzo died on 16 August after a long illness. He was only 62 years of age. He died far too young and the nation has lost one of its modern literary giants.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Williamson" rel="nofollow">
         David Williamson
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Hibberd" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Hibberd
        </a>
        , Buzo was a pioneer of Australian drama in the 1960s and 1970s. I was fortunate to be studying Australian literature at Sydney university in the early 1970s and became well acquainted with his work, and I went to see his plays when they were shown. Buzo’s plays, particularly his first play,
        <i>
         Norm and Ahmed
        </i>
        , followed by
        <i>
         Rooted
        </i>
        and then the legendary
        <i>
         Coralie Lansdowne Says No
        </i>
        , have become modern Australian literary classics. Their themes are universal and timeless whilst being quintessentially Australian.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alex Buzo was also well known for his great love of Australian sport and his interest in the emasculation of the language by prominent personalities, particularly sporting commentators. He started the Australian Tautology Competition, which he ran for many years, and published the results in the
        <i>
         National Times
        </i>
        newspaper. Invariably the winner was the Rugby League
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        commentator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rex_Mossop" rel="nofollow">
         Rex Mossop
        </a>
        , who gave us such immortal quotes as:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They’re retreating backwards towards their own tryline!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He seems to be favouring a groin injury at the top of his leg.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Stanley Gorton is racing towards the opponent’s tryline with great speed and alacrity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He’s just given him a verbal tongue-lashing.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many more, some of them unprintable. I think that Buzo secretly wished that he could have written many of the lines which seemed to tumble naturally out of Rex Mossop’s mouth. Buzo created the Australian Tautology Competition, and in a way I think he brought to the attention of readers the need for correct pronunciation and adherence to correct language standards. A number of obituaries have appeared in the newspapers following his untimely passing. However, I believe it is appropriate that we note in this parliament Alex Buzo’s great contribution to our literary heritage. He enriched our cultural and sporting life.
