                children in regional and remote Australia. Indigenous kids, particularly those from remote areas, are more likely to start school behind, with the gap growing throughout their schooling life, and, if you start behind, it's incredibly hard to catch up. School attendance rates have not improved, and, despite some improvements in literacy and numeracy, about one in four Indigenous students in years 5, 7 and 9 remain below the national minimum standards in reading. We want to turn that around.

               <p>

                today, we're investing $250 million to ensure all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have a strong and positive start to their learning journey to be able to access quality education that will assist closing the gap, with significant investment in evidence based programs, a lift in participation and improving literacy rates, and $280 million to support improvements in leadership capability, professional development and student outcomes through city-to-country partnerships, getting high-performing metro schools partnering with Indigenous schools. Haileybury, in my home state, is partnering with an Indigenous school in Darwin, and they're getting great improvements. You can't be what you can't see. Often, for young people, it's learning from their peers. We've seen a significant improvement in

                   We know that focusing on reading and literacy will help set up Indigenous students for success in their school years and beyond. We're backing what works by providing up to $25 million to scale up evidence based programs that have already succeeded. We're putting $8 million to support the program called Making Up Lost Time in Literacy. We're going to double the number of schools that are going to be participating in that program. That is a program that focuses on a phonics based approach to literacy skills, because not everybody learns the same way. The government knows how important it is that teachers who are engaged in schools with Indigenous students have the right skills, and we will provide $5 million to the Good to Great Schools Australia program, which supports better student learning outcomes by improving teaching methods. We're also going to provide additional funding to support the expansion of the Kimberley Schools Project in the Pilbara region of WA.

                      We're not just investing in early childhood care and education, but, for secondary, we're wanting to make sure that parents and students have choice to determine what works best for them. In remote communities there can be few if any local secondary school options, and that's why often boarding or residential schools are an important option for so many children in your home territory, Senator. The government will invest $75 million to help meet the cost of building three new boarding schools in remote
