        My question it to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, representing the Minister for Education, Senator Carr. Can the minister advise the Senate on the long-term objectives of

         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        ? How will it benefit teaching and learning in Australian schools, how will it benefit individual students, what role does it play in the government’s innovation strategy, what is the scale of the program and what new facilities will it provide? Can the minister explain how Building the Education Revolution relates to the government’s other education initiatives and how these initiatives will contribute to Australia’s economic wellbeing in the decades to come?

            Building the Education Revolution
           </a>
           is about supporting jobs, Senator Faulkner, not just today but for generations to come. It is about creating the infrastructure needed to sustain quality teaching and learning. It is about providing environments in which Australian students can develop their skills, find their inspiration and reach their full potential. It is a pity you did not know more about this, senators over there. This is absolutely essential if we are to boost Australia’s innovation capacity and performance. The most important factor in the innovation process is human capital: smart people, whom it is a pity we do not have more of over there; creative people, whom it is a pity they do not have more of as well; and people who can engage in critical yet constructive approaches to the world around them.
          </p>
          <p>
           More than 24,000 Building the Education Revolution projects have been approved in more than 9,500 schools right across the country. This is the biggest school modernisation program the nation has ever seen. Schools across Australia are benefiting—

            Schools right across Australia are benefiting from new classrooms, new halls, new libraries, new science laboratories and new language centres. Of course, we do not have any support from the other side on any of those matters. This comes on top of the government’s $2.2 billion Digital Education Revolution, which is preparing Australian students to live and work in a digital world.

                A better educated workforce is a more productive workforce. It is a workforce that can solve problems, can grasp opportunities and can handle the unexpected. It is a pity that you did not learn more about that in recent days. We cannot transform the Australian economy from the top down; we can only achieve that by building from the bottom up. It will only happen if we draw on the intelligence and the imagination of every worker, every citizen, every entrepreneur and every researcher. And it will only happen if we are ready to recognise and nurture creativity wherever we find it. This is the key to competing in a knowledge intensive global economy. That is why Australia needs the education revolution, that is why the government is building this revolution and that is why we are building iconic projects like the square kilometre array telescope. I look forward to its support from the coalition.
