        asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 14 June 2011:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In regard to the Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative and revenue transparency and in reference to the answers to questions during the 2010-11 additional estimates in February 2011 which stated that the United States of America (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        ) Dodd-Frank Act ‘does not demonstrably reduce corruption’:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Is the Government aware that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the British and French Governments have publicly stated their support for extractive industry reporting rules in the European Union, similar to the US Dodd-Frank rules; and,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         European Commission
        </a>
        is now developing legislative proposals to improve extractive industry disclosure requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Is the Government aware that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Stock_Exchange" rel="nofollow">
         Hong Kong Stock Exchange
        </a>
        enacted a similar extractive industry disclosure requirement in 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Does the Government accept that secrecy of oil, gas and mining company payments to governments can foster government corruption and violent conflict in resource-rich countries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Does the Government agree that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) initiatives such as the US Dodd-Frank Act can contribute to improving transparency of extractive industry payments and that this transparency is essential for tackling corruption and reducing poverty in resource rich, poor countries; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) making public the revenues that governments receive from oil, gas and mining companies will make those governments more open and more accountable to their citizens.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Does the Government agree that making public the revenues that governments receive from oil, gas and mining companies will make these industries more transparent to investors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Given that many companies and other stakeholders believe that extractive industry disclosure requirements should be adapted across all major markets to ensure a level playing field and consistent reporting across countries, what is the Government’s position on this.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) Will the Government commit to engaging in dialogue with stakeholders – including Australian mining oil and gas companies, investors and civil society – on possible Australian requirements for extractive industry disclosure similar to the US Dodd-Frank Act; if not, why not.

        <p>
         The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) (a)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
          The Government
         </a>
         is aware that some European Governments have indicated support for extractive industry reporting rules in the European Union. (b) The Government is aware that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          European Commission
         </a>
         has consulted stakeholders regarding country-by-country reporting by multinational companies but has not yet brought forward draft legislation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The Government is aware of the new Chapter 18 requirements for extractives companies newly listing on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong_Stock_Exchange" rel="nofollow">
          Hong Kong Stock Exchange
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Yes. In countries with weak governance frameworks, or the absence of the rule of law, government corruption can be a serious problem. The Government supports improved governance arrangements to help address this.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Refer to response to Question 3.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) The Australian Taxation Office regularly publishes details of revenue received by industry sector.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) The Government believes that action on this subject is most effective if coordinated globally, and is working with other G20 nations to achieve this.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) The Government continues to engage with stakeholders to ensure Australia’s governance arrangements remain world’s best practice.
