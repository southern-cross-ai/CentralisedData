        , may I also add my voice to the chorus of congratulations on your appointment, particularly as a fellow Victorian. My question is to the Acting Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, Senator Cash, and it is, in fact, about policy. Given that we are at the start of Innovation Week in 2017, can the minister update the Senate on how the Turnbull government is helping Australian businesses stay at the cutting edge of innovation and be globally competitive?

         I thank Senator Hume for the question. Indeed, Senator Hume is correct: this week is Innovation Week for 2017. Innovation Week, for those who don't know, is the annual celebration of science, technology, engineering, maths and medicine.
        </p>
        <p>
         In fact, this morning I had the opportunity to meet with a female astronaut,

         , who goes by @Astro_Pam, to talk about what more we can do to get young girls to literally shoot for the stars and look for an occupation in science, technology, engineering and maths. But can I also thank the Australian Science and Innovation Forum, which, in partnership with the Australian Academy of Technology and Engineering, is running this event for the third year.

           The government is focused on keeping Australian businesses at the cutting edge and, in particular, globally competitive and ensuring that Australian businesses have the best opportunities to benefit from that connectedness and, of course, the Industry 4.0 practices.
          </p>
          <p>
           I had the opportunity last week in Perth, with Senator Cormann, to launch test labs for Australia at the Asia-Pacific Regional Conference, at which we had over 1,100 people attend to talk about Industry 4.0. In terms of the test labs for Australia announcement, this is a $5 million investment on behalf of the Australian government to create five new test labs at universities and training institutes around Australia, but it's very much focused on small and medium enterprises. What it's going to do in relation to small and medium enterprises is enable them to incorporate the latest technologies into their operations and embrace digital innovation, including the

           , big data, data analytics, robotics, sensors and automation. This is a great initiative. It reinforces the government's commitment to innovation.

              In short, Senator Hume, the answer is opportunity. It is about the opportunity to help Australian businessesâ€”in particular, small and medium businessesâ€”on the world stage. It is all about opportunities for Australian businesses to reinforce their position as part of a global value and supply chain and, of course, opportunities for jobs.
             </p>
             <p>
              Industry 4.0 is about optimising manufacturing processes through integrated use of digital technologies such as automation and robotics, data exchange, artificial intelligence and 3D printing. The program itself has been designed to ensure that Australian

We are committed to ensuring that our small and medium enterprises have every opportunity to ensure that they can compete in a globally competitive environment.

                 Yes, I can. The government is committed to ensuring that Australia is a globally competitive exporter not just of products but also of intellectual property and research. Our National Innovation and Science Agenda has been helping the science and business communities do just that. Through our Global Innovation Strategy, the government have established five 'landing pads' for our young, fast-growing companies to access new markets and establish international profiles. In a recent survey of landing-pad participants, 100 per cent of respondents expect to achieve a commercial outcome as a result of participating in this program. The Global Connections Fund has provided over $2.8 million for our local businesses and researchers, in particular to collaborate with over 20 countries, including Brazil, China, Germany, Japan, the
