        Tonight I am going to speak about the importance of the right to equality in Australian society. Equality is a core democratic principle that underpins our society. Applying this principle is fundamental to making sure that individuals and groups can have access to opportunities and essential standards of living so that they can participate fully in society and realise their own potential.

        are committed to working towards a more equal world. We believe that as a community we should take positive steps to promote the right to equality and principles of nondiscrimination, to uphold equality before the law and to address the underlying causes of systemic discrimination. We must also seek to ensure that people are treated with equal dignity and worth. We should celebrate diversity and recognise people's different needs and identities. And we must endeavour to provide and create the conditions and opportunities that are necessary to empower all people to live a fulfilling life in Australia.

        recognised the importance of giving people the freedom to develop their inherent capabilities and to reach their potential when he stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What people can achieve is influenced by economic opportunities, political liberties, social powers and the enabling conditions of good health, basic education, and the encouragement and cultivation of initiatives.

        welcomed today's release by the Attorney-General of the government's exposure draft of new antidiscrimination legislation and the referral of that legislation to a Senate committee for inquiry. The Australian Greens have been advocating throughout 2012 for this legislation to be introduced into the parliament as soon as possible.
