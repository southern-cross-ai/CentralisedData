        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to my question to him on 27 February relating to the Prime Minister's next visit to my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        in an attempt to salvage her Prime Ministership, can the minister advise the Senate when we can expect Ms Gillard to venture even further west to save Labor in Western Australia?

         . Since Labor came to office in 2007, 186,300 jobs have been created in Western Australia: 1.3 million more

         Western Australian households with a $300,000 mortgage are now paying $5,000 a year less in repayments under Labor than they were when the Liberals last held office. Almost 120,000 families receive the schoolkids bonus, worth $123.6 million. Thanks to the Gillard government's tax cuts, 779,000 Western Australians are paying less tax, 58,000 Western Australians are paying no tax and 628,000 got a tax cut of more than $300. More than 358,000 Western Australians are getting a boost to their retirement savings through a low-income superannuation contribution, and those 358,000 Western Australians know that if an Abbott government is elected that $300 will be taken back from them in a tax hike imposed by those opposite.

There is $3.6 billion as part of a six-year nation building program to upgrade and modernise the state's road, rail and public transport infrastructure. In fact, we have almost doubled annual infrastructure spending, from $154 to $261 per
