           I note that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee is currently inquiring into the Commonwealth funding and administration of mental health services and has received over 1,000 submissions. I also note that the Climate Commission's report
           <i>
            The critical decade
           </i>
           states on page 42 that there is 'a high degree of uncertainty in our current understanding'. It continues:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Observational records show no changes beyond natural variability in either the frequency of cyclones or their storm tracks. … it is not yet possible to attribute any aspect of changes in cyclone behaviour (frequency, intensity, rainfall, etc.) to climate change …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The floods across eastern Australia in 2010 and early 2011 were the consequence of a very strong La Niña event, and not the result of climate change.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is from the government's own report that I imagine the Greens have agreed to. It also seems spurious that this motion states that positive mental health is the key to tackling rural climate change. An article I have read states:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           In addition, water policy changes, a national oversupply of grapes combined with a global economic down turn and international competition are starting to take their toll on grape growers …
          </p>
          <p>
           I would say that that has got far more to do with depression in regional areas than climate change. Item (b) of Senator Wright's motion does include some items that would seem prudent and understandable. But relating those matters to issues pertaining to climate change makes this motion something that the coalition cannot support.

              A recent report from the Climate Institute concludes that the mental health of Australians, particularly rural Australians, is being adversely affected by climate change now and states that this will only increase in the future. A further recent report from the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
               CSIRO
              </a>
              , looking at 50 winegrowers from southern Australia, has also found that mental health stresses are affecting farmers' decision making and capacity to act and cites earlier research suggesting that farm based suicides in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               South Australia
              </a>
              may be as high as one per week.
             </p>
             <p>
              This Greens motion recognises these issues; recognises that while farmers and rural people are resilient—and in fact the CSIRO study indicates that those who are coping best are those who are able to adapt to the climate variability that they face—it is important that we ensure adequate funding for rural mental health and assistance for rural Australians to adapt to the future challenges of climate change.
