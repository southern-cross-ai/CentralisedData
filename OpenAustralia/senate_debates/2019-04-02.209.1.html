       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Supply Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020 provides for appropriations for proposed expenditure on the ordinary annual services of the government for the first five months of 2019-20.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of just under $40.8 billion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The appropriations proposed in this Bill are based on five-twelfths of the estimated 2019-20 annual appropriations. The 2019-20 estimates are broadly the 2018-19 base, adjusted for economic and program specific parameters, and the effect of decisions announced as part of the Mid-Year Economic and

        s.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although Supply Bills can sometimes include front-loading for agencies that have uneven spending needs over the year, this is not the case in 2019. The five twelfths apportionment has therefore been applied strictly to all agencies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Supply Bills also take into account terminating programs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The remainder of the estimated 2019-20 annual appropriations are contained in the Budget Appropriations Bills, which will be introduced separately. To support Parliamentary scrutiny, the effect of both the Supply Bills and Budget Appropriation Bills is incorporated in the 2019-20 Portfolio Budget Statements, as was the case for the 2016-17 Supply Bills.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill must be passed in this session to ensure funding is available to all entities from 1 July 2019, thereby ensuring the continuity of program and service delivery.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I wish to emphasise that this Bill seeks provision only to fund government expenditure on an interim basis until Budget Appropriation Bills have passed. Consistent with convention, the Supply Bills do not include funding for Budget measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This arrangement allows for Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2019-2020, or a similar bill, to be passed by the next Parliament, if necessary.
