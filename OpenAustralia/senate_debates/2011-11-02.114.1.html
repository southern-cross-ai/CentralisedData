            As I have indicated previously, these are complex issues that these motions are trying to deal with. Not only do these issues have complexity; they also go to foreign policy issues, and Senate resolutions by themselves are very blunt instruments in trying to deal with what can be quite complex foreign policy matters. The government cannot support the motion as it is worded, nor the amendment as it is worded—that is, we do not intend to support either the amendment or the substantive motion, whether it is amended or not.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government acknowledges, though, the tragic consequences of the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956, which the Australian government deplored at the time, and stands with the people of Hungary in commemorating this important anniversary.

                  Senator Bernardi is rightly indicted by his own words. This is a motion to mark the 55th anniversary of the bloody uprising in Budapest, Hungary, which I remember very clearly. I remember at the time, as a young fellow, being appalled by the failure of the West, including the Menzies government, to intervene. That has since been a matter of some criticism. It came, of course, in the wake of the Suez crisis, and the governments of

                  and
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Menzies" rel="nofollow">
                   Robert Menzies

                  felt, in the wake of that, enfeebled in terms of the tanks rolling into Budapest.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  But this is a motion to remark the travail of the Hungarian people. What we are seeing here is a debasing of that process by Senator Bernardi and his Independent co-host of this motion for a domestic political pointscoring exercise, which I think dishonours the Hungarian people in toto, including the thousands of Hungarians who came to this country and made such a great contribution to it, as would be marked by the amendment from the Greens if it were to pass.

                     in the months between 23 October 1956 and January 1957. Democracy is a fragile thing, hard to secure and easily lost. At that time the Soviet oppression was supported by the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Communist_Party" rel="nofollow">

                     , and I remember only too well the very real threat of Communism to Australia during those years. As a member of the Labor movement, I hope the Senate recognises the loss of over 20,000 Hungarian lives and the contribution that has been made by the many Hungarian and Soviet refugees who settled in Australia after that country's brave attempt to secure its freedom.
