        I rise to take note of the government response to the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee’s report
        <i>
         Inquiry into the workforce challenges in the transport industry
        </i>
        , which was tabled earlier today. Some five to six weeks ago, in the company of Senator Abetz, I joined the Liberal Party candidate for Corangamite on a visit to the Journey Management Group. The Journey Management Group are Australia’s premier transport and logistics training company, servicing the road transport, agriculture, oil and gas mining and rail industries. It was a fascinating visit to the extent that they are using world state-of-the-art technology for their trucks and the emissions from them.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2010, the pollutants emitted by 65 trucks will be equivalent to the pollutants emitted by just one truck in 1988—a quite remarkable change. They are using technology that has not been used anywhere else in the country. It is called BlueTec emissions technology. I understand that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPA" rel="nofollow">
         EPA
        </a>
        regulations require a reduction an 83 per cent reduction in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NO" rel="nofollow">
         NO
        </a>
        x emissions from EPA 2007 levels and that this new BlueTec technology—and I am reading from some of their material—is the only technology that will meet the standards at the tailpipe with better fuel economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        These trucks are quite remarkable; their emissions have been slashed. I was very pleased, with Senator Abetz and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Henderson" rel="nofollow">
         Sarah Henderson
        </a>
        , to meet with Shane Blakeborough, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , and take a look at them. Mr Blakeborough not only showed Senator Abetz, Sarah and myself this new technology but he also discussed some of the concerns of industry in relation to getting some assistance with training for the operators who will be driving these trucks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I noticed that in the government’s response to the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee report
        <i>
         Inquiry into the workforce challenges in the transport industry
        </i>
        that it appeared neither the committee nor indeed the government were aware of these changed technologies and that there will be a requirement for major transport companies and those who are training transport drivers to have the requisite skills to operate these new vehicles.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vehicles are quite remarkable. My understanding is that this new technology—I hope I have this right—traps about 51 per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
         CO2
        </a>
        emissions, which go into a special tank in the vehicles that is emptied out at intermittent levels. The emissions are effectively run through and kept in a material in the tanks. This is very exciting technology, and the investment in this machinery is substantial, as honourable senators will appreciate. They are state-of-the-art trucks providing state-of-the-art technology. I know that, as shadow industry minister, Senator Abetz was—as Ms Henderson and I were—quite taken aback with the positive impacts of this new technology on the environment. I ask the government to look at this new technology and the training that will be required for transport operators to use it. I thank the Senate and Senator Farrell for allowing me the opportunity to speak on this tonight.

        Question agreed to.
