        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Carr. I refer to the report released by the Commonwealth Ombudsman on 3 February 2011 in which the Ombudsman finds:

       <p class="italic">

        </a>
        immigration detention facilities and the current scale of operations on the geographically remote island are not sustainable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the minister agree that this is a disgraceful and inhumane situation of which the government should be ashamed and that it is solely a result of the government’s failed border protection policies?

          I think it would be only reasonable to acknowledge that there are considerable pressures on accommodation facilities within detention centres across the country. The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Immigration and Citizenship
          </a>
          will continue to manage facilities with flexibility and move clients across the network as necessary to ease overcrowding. The government has sought to provide additional accommodation facilities for irregular maritime arrivals and the minister has announced the expansion of accommodation at a number of centres across the country. The government has announced additional accommodation facilities right through
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           South Australia
          </a>
          ,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
           Northern Territory
          </a>
          , and the additional capacity is progressively coming on line. Accommodation for families—for some 280 people—will, for instance, be available at Inverbrackie. The provision of detention accommodation facilities is about ensuring that there is appropriate amenity and sufficient capacity across the country to ensure that we are able to provide for accommodation needs, including on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Christmas Island
          </a>
          . Given that it was the Howard government that built the facilities on Christmas Island, I am somewhat surprised that the coalition now wants to question the use of those facilities. One has to face the fact that, when it comes to dealing with the coalition on these issues, one has to deal with considerable hypocrisy.

           , I ask a supplementary question. The Commonwealth Ombudsman’s report finds that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
            Christmas Island
           </a>
           is overloaded and that asylum seekers are living in unacceptable conditions. This contradicts comments made by Minister Bowen on 3 February 2011 that they are not. Who is correct: the Ombudsman, whose findings are based on observations during two years of periodic inspections, or Minister Bowen?

            It is true that the Ombudsman has taken an oversight role of the non-statutory refugee assessment process for asylum seekers at
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
             Christmas Island
            </a>
            . We have seen that the government takes these reports seriously; that the government seeks to provide appropriate accommodation facilities across the network; that we seek to provide people who are placed in detention on Christmas Island with appropriate support facilities, including the necessary mental health support facilities and the necessary interpretation facilities; and that the government is ensuring that we are treating people in a humane way while at the same time protecting the security of this country and ensuring the integrity of our arrangements for people arriving by boat. There are a range of facilities available and we want to ensure that those facilities are of an appropriate standard and meet our international obligations.

                As of 9 February, Senator, you would be interested to know that the advice I have is that there were in fact 2,625 irregular maritime arrivals, including 23 crew members of various vessels, detained at
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
                 Christmas Island
                </a>
                . So I think the suggestion that you have made in your question is at variance with the facts and I am sure that if there is any further information I can provide that might assist you to make a more accurate assessment of what actually is happening on Christmas Island then the minister will be only too happy to provide it.
