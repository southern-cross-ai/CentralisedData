        I rise today, compelled to share with you the harrowing story of a brave journalist who endured untold suffering at the hands of the government of Azerbaijan. This year I had the honour of meeting Mr Alexander Lapshin, an Israeli journalist. I heard firsthand the horrors he endured during his illegal imprisonment by Azerbaijan. The grim details included torture and even attempted murder, and for what crime exactly? It was because Mr Lapshin dared to visit the so-called disputed territory of Artsakh, currently completely occupied by Azerbaijan, and published articles critical of its authoritarian leader,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ilham_Aliyev" rel="nofollow">
         Ilham Aliyev
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, Mr Lapshin's case is not isolated. There remain countless political prisoners, journalists and Armenian prisoners of war, including civilians and government authorities from the republic of Artsakh who have walked the halls of this parliament, who are held captive on fabricated charges. The crimes even extend to the ethnic cleansing of over 100,000 Armenians from Artsakh in September 2023, after Azerbaijan launched an unprovoked military attack, forcing the entire indigenous Armenian population of Artsakh to leave.
       </p>
       <p>
        Azerbaijan is one of the most corrupt and aggressive nations in the world. As representatives of a democratic and free nation, it is our duty to stand up for those who cannot speak for themselves, including the over 50,000 Armenian Australians who are rightfully outraged by the actions of this regime. I urge the Australian government to outright denounce the egregious violations of human rights of Azerbaijan and demand accountability of those responsible. We cannot turn a blind eye to the suffering of innocent individuals like Alexander Lapshin and ethnic Armenians.
