        Speaking of important issues, my question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Government Services, Senator Ruston. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Morrison government is boosting services to support the livelihoods of Australians who have been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic?

         Thank you very much, Senator Chandler, for your question and the opportunity to tell the chamber what the government has been doing as we face the unprecedented demand and significant new challenges that have been presented by the coronavirus, particularly to Services Australia, who are at the forefront of supporting Australians who have been impacted by this pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout this time, Services Australia have been required to deliver new and improved income support measures and fast track the Australian government's coronavirus financial support to many, many thousands of Australians in need. We acknowledge that this has been a particularly difficult time for many Australians.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         acknowledge the extraordinary patience and understanding they have shown as we have had to ramp up the services at Services Australia to a level we have never, ever seen before.
        </p>
        <p>
         This effort includes the redeployment of over 12,000 additional staff into support centres and call centres, processing claims. Since 27 April, we've got the $550 coronavirus supplement out the door, valuing $1.1 billion for that fortnight to around 1.9 million Australians. We have also ramped up the capability and the stability of our online service systems, particularly MyGov, and we've seen a capacity increase from 6,000 concurrent users to 300,000 concurrent users just in a matter of days. In the month of April, we had an average of 1.7 million Australians on MyGov every single day, and on one day alone we had three million Australians, which is the most we have ever seen on the MyGov website. We also managed to get the $750 stimulus payment out in early April to over 6.8 million Australiansâ€”that's $5.1 billion in the hands of Australians who most need it. This is an injection into the Australian economy to support Australians through the corona pandemic.

            The government has made significant and extraordinary changes to the Services Australia delivery mechanism, including making sure the process is simplified. We've moved to digital processing so Australians can get their payments in a timely way, and also from the safety of their own homes. From 25 March 2020, Australians were able to register their intent to make a claim by logging onto their MyGov account, which means that they could register for financial support in a matter of just minutes. We appreciate the patience the Australian community has shown as we have put these systems into place. Services Australia have also introduced a streamlined jobseeker process claim form to allow people to make their claims in 20 questions. This is half the average amount of time for the somebody who is making a typical jobseeker claim. We are absolutely committed to supporting Australians who have needed our support through Services Australia through these unprecedented times.

               Since 16 March 2020, Services Australia have processed more than one million jobseeker claims. That's more than double the number of claims we would have processed last year. In the space of six weeks, we've done the equivalent of two years' normal work. This is in addition to the millions of Australians who have accessed our services for health, welfare, child support payments and other services that Services Australia provide to everyday Australians. We have also been able to extend the jobseeker phone line hours from 8 am to 8 pm on workdays.

               once again extend my thanks to the Australian public for their extraordinary patience as they have had to interact with these new systems as we have got them up and running with the most extraordinary speed.
              </p>
              <p>
               Can I also thank and acknowledge the extraordinary work of the staff at Services Australia. The frontline staff have had to deal with people who are in very, very distressing circumstances. I thank them for the passion and dedication they have exhibited as they have dealt with Australians who are in extraordinarily vulnerable times.
