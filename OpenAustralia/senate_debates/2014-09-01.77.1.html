         The Prime Minister is well known for his support of science for research. Indeed, in my home state of Tasmania we have seen an absolute commitment to the Antarctic endeavours with funding for a ship that Labor promised but without funding. As was their wont in so many areas, including in the scientific space, Labor made the promises but then never budgeted for them or provided the funding base. What did we do? We actually provided the funding base for a replacement vessel for the

            The budget also provides $28 million for science for Australia's future, and so the list goes on. Whether the Prime Minister has or has not met with the particular council to which the honourable senator refers I do not know, but what I am happy to do is to see if the Prime Minister wants to add anything to my answer.

             , I ask a supplementary question. Given the abject lack of dedication to science displayed to date, can the minister guarantee that there are no plans to downgrade the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, which has been advising Australian prime ministers for 25 years? Can the minister assure the Senate that there are no plans to have the council report instead to the industry minister?

             <p>
              To whom or what the council might report from time to time will not necessarily determine the government's approach. What I can indicate to the senator is that the Prime Minister is absolutely committed to the wellbeing of science and future research. Indeed, that is why one of the very important parts of this year's budget was the new Medical Research Foundation, the funding source for which I understand the Labor Party are committed to opposing.
             </p>
             <p>
              So what they say and what they do is that they come into this place, saying, 'We champion research; we champion a vessel for Antarctic research,' but then you ask them the fundamental question, 'Where is the money for this medical research coming from?' 'Oh, we're going to block that in the Senate,' in other words, no funding.
             </p>
             <p>
              What about this ship for the Antarctic? 'Oh we didn't make any provision for that either'
