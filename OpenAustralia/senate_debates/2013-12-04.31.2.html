        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Did the Prime Minister write to the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia on 14 October? Did that letter say: 'I look forward to working with you in the years ahead'? Can the minister explain why, six weeks after the Prime Minister signed that letter, the government axed the council's funding and forced it into voluntary administration?

         I thank the senator for her question. There is no doubt that, with this government taking office, the previous government left the country in such a situation that we are having to make some difficult decisions. I very recently made the decision—

           . The ADCA, that I recently took the decision to discontinue funding for, is part of a number of organisations that provide advice to the government. I took the decision to cease that funding in the knowledge of two very carefully thought out processes. One is the fact that—

           If those opposite listened, they might learn something. One is the fact that there is a range of organisations that provide advice to the government, as those opposite would well know. One of the things that this government has undertaken is to ensure that we reduce duplication where we can. The other thing I took into consideration was the fact that the previous government left this government with a $200 billion net debt. I can indicate to senators on the other side, if they are not already aware, that the Australian people expect this new government to appropriately consider organisations for their efficacy and their fiscal responsibility when it comes to appropriately spending taxpayers' money. Every single dollar of taxpayers' money—

               A range of commentary has been seen since the decision was taken to discontinue the funding. I note that those on the other side had four months from the initial indication of further funding from the previous government to finalise the arrangements for the continuation of that funding. Within that four months absolutely nothing was done by those opposite to complete those arrangements. Subsequent to that, with us coming into government, there is a range of programs across portfolios for which we will be determining whether they are delivering appropriate and efficacious service, and we make no apologies for that.

                 I can indicate to those opposite that I did not speak to Dr Washer. I did, however, consider a range of very important aspects before I took my decision. Quite frankly, we would not be in the position of this government having to review so many ranges of things, programs across portfolios, if the previous government had not left the economy in such a mess. We are looking at around $200 billion of net debt and the Australian people expect this new government to act appropriately when we are considering the use of taxpayers' dollars. Every single dollar that is earned by a taxpayer is something that we on this side realise we have to spend responsibly. When we look at the track record of this government when it comes to health, it is extraordinary that they should be asking us a question on health. We saw a litany of disasters in the Health portfolio area of the previous government.
