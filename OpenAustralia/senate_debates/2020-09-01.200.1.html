        Tonight I rise to speak about something that affects many of us, but these effects are often felt silently. Pain is not just physical; it can also affect our emotional and mental wellbeing, especially if it continues long term.

        local and member for Bean, Mr David Smith MP, I want to highlight the importance of recognising the impact that chronic pain can have on ourselves, our loved ones and our community. Our parliamentary friends group aims to raise the awareness of chronic pain and managing that pain with our peers and within our communities. Advocacy organisation Painaustralia is working with us to improve the quality of life for those living with chronic pain conditions. Painaustralia's remit is to develop the National Strategic Action Plan for Pain Management, which outlines the key actions Australia should take to tackle chronic pain. This plan was launched in 2019, and its recommendations are now being considered by health ministers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chronic pain is pain that continues for more than three months after surgery, an injury, as a result of disease or from another cause. Although chronic pain can be a symptom of a disease or injury, it may occur without a clear reason and can be a disease in its own right. There are many underlying causes of chronic pain, although it is not always possible to determine the precise cause of the pain. Chronic pain is often linked to changes in the central nervous system, psychological factors and environmental changes that stay long after the tissue damage that initially triggered the pain has been resolved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Common chronic pain syndrome includes back and leg pain; cancer; migraines and headaches; neck pain; pelvic pain; sciatica; and musculoskeletal conditions, like arthritis, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and gout. Almost 3.4 million Australians live with chronic pain, and for most their pain restricts the activities they can undertake. It impacts their work, sleep and relationships. The effects of living with chronic pain go beyond the individual to their families, carers, friends, colleagues and the wider community.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to address the needs of the millions of Australians who live with chronic pain and we need to do it soon. Painaustralia estimates that more than 68 per cent of people living with chronic pain are of working age. Research indicates that there are strong links between anxiety, depression and chronic physical illness. Almost 50 per cent of those with chronic pain also live with mental health conditions such as anxiety and depression. Modelling by Deloitte Access Economics shows that if Australia's policy around pain management doesn't change then the annual cost of pain will rise from $140 billion to more than $215 billion by 2050. This figure includes costs to our health system, lost productivity, reduction in quality of life and other financial costs such as informal care, aids and modifications. It is expected that over five million Australians will be living with chronic pain within 30 years.

        Deloitte's report titled
        <i>
         The cost of pain in Australia
        </i>
        outlines how changes in policy that extend best practice care to Australian chronic pain patients could lead to substantial savings and better health outcomes. Suggested changes include a national
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        training program designed and led by pain specialists, the doubling of current levels of access to multidisciplinary care, and the prescription of atypical opioids rather than conventional opioidsâ€”although Deloitte does acknowledge that further research is needed in this area. Painaustralia considers that the best way to manage pain is through holistic methods like the multidisciplinary approach I've just mentioned.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pain medicine was recognised as a medical speciality in 2005, and there are currently 316 active fellows of the Faculty of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pain_Medicine" rel="nofollow">
         Pain Medicine
        </a>
        in Australia. Pain specialists provide holistic care that includes prescribing medication; coordinating rehabilitative services; performing pain relieving procedures; counselling patients and families; directing a multidisciplinary team that often includes psychological and psychiatric services and other healthcare professionals; and liaising with public and private agencies. Just last month, the Parliamentary Friends of Pain Management Group launched the updated National Pain Services Directory, providing information on services offered by more than 200 facilities throughout Australia. This updated directory enables those with chronic pain to make informed decisions around pain management options and pathways available at locations close to them. Providing support like this early on allows someone with chronic pain to better manage their outcomes in the long term. It's a good start to making the changes that are needed.
