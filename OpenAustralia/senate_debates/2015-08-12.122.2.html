        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE" rel="nofollow">
         BAE
        </a>
        in Williamstown this morning announced that they were shedding a further 125 jobs, bringing the total number of jobs lost since October last year to 600. The Minister for Defence put out a statement after that announcement to say that the government was disappointed by this decision but had no control over the commercial decisions of a company such as BAE. This is despite the fact that this government, upon coming to office, sent two supply vessels to be built offshore. The shipyards in either Korea or Spain—probably Korea—will benefit directly from the actions of this government at a time when the government knew that the prospects of Australian shipbuilders were bleak because contracts were coming to an end. What we have today is in example of how the government does not appreciate that its own decisions are having such dire consequences for the defence capabilities of this nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week we saw in Adelaide the Prime Minister announce that there would be a continuous build for contracts for future frigates and offshore patrol vessels. He failed to mention that his pre-election promise to build future submarines in Adelaide had been breached. What we know is that this action by the government is driven by the dire opinion polls for their Liberal colleagues in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and has nothing to do with maintaining the defence industry capabilities of this nation. What we know is that the government's calculations are based on its electoral fortunes, not on the industrial needs of this nation. We are now facing a situation where shipyards like BAE will not be able to share in any of the government's announcements. The offshore patrol vessel project is due to start in 2018. The Future Frigate project is due to start in 2020. BAE's existing contracts, involving the air warfare destroyers and the landing helicopter dock ships, will be completed by the end of 2016. The yards will be empty. The direct consequence of that is that the yards will be laying people off and may well close.
       </p>
       <p>
        What was the situation in the United Kingdom when it was faced with a similar situation under a Conservative government? Did it send its warships offshore to be built as this government has done? No, it did not. The Conservative government of the United Kingdom awarded patrol boat contracts to BAE in order to avoid a shutdown—a specific build for BAE. So the situation in this country could have been avoided. The Prime Minister has nothing to offer the 125 workers who have found out today that they are losing their jobs, just as he had nothing to offer the 600 in total since October last year. There have been no assurances for the workers at Forgacs in Newcastle or Austal in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . He has not conceded the need to have expert advice on the Future Submarines project. We are seeing a similar pattern in defence materiel purchases. We saw, for instance, in my office today employees of Workwear Group in Footscray who are facing dismissal because of this government's decisions with regard to the supply of uniforms for the ADF. The defence minister's decision will mean the loss of some 45 jobs and the closure of the factory, adding further to the loss of industrial capabilities in the defence industries. Some of these workers are visiting parliament today.
       </p>
       <p>
        This of course reflects the pattern of decisions by this government—a government that likes to wrap itself in the flag but, when it comes to a commitment for the defence of Australia and the industrial capabilities of this nation, has nothing to say. The government is treating the Australian people as fools and as fodder in its campaign to offshore work. It is failing to fulfil its responsibilities to meet the defence procurement needs of this nation. And the only time it changes its view is based on its electoral calculations, not on the defence capability needs of this nation.

         Senator Carr is correct when he says that this could have been avoided. It could have been avoided if the previous Labor government had done something in its six years. Instead the Labor government in the six sad years when it was in power did absolutely nothing except buy a warship from the United Kingdom. Senator Carr should remember when his government purchased the

         from the British government. Why did they not do something then? Senator Carr is walking out the door, not interested in this debate at all. I remind the Senate that in 2012
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE" rel="nofollow">
          BAE
         </a>
         offered the then government, the Labor government, the opportunity to build supply vessels in a hybrid build—part of it in Australia and part of it overseas. What did the Labor government do with that offer from BAE? They did absolutely what they did all the way through their sad six years in office: absolutely nothing. Had they accepted that offer from BAE at the time there would be people involved in that shipbuilding at present.

         government has nothing to be ashamed of in relation to shipbuilding. Indeed, conservative governments, Liberal governments since time immemorial have built ships in Australia. I remember the patrol boats that were built in Cairns very many years ago. Senator McLucas, who is based in Cairns, will well remember this. There was a Cairns company that built those ships. They were tendering under the last Labor government for a new lot of ships. In fact they had been given the tip-off that they were going to get the contract. At least then the Labor government would have done something with shipbuilding in Australia. But what happened at the last minute? The Labor government of Queensland and the Labor government federally cut the ground from under them and refused to give them that contract—

           as a result of which the Cairns shipbuilding industry, once very vibrant and successful and employing people, was shut down. And Senator McLucas has never criticised the Labor government for that horrendous decision that destroyed a shipbuilding industry in my state of Queensland. The coalition government is working towards a shipbuilding industry, and I am delighted that this has been done. I thank my colleague Senator Sean Edwards for his part in building this industry in Australia back up.
          </p>
          <p>
           The motion before the chair is to take note of all Labor questions. I will briefly mention a couple of other questions that came up at question time. One of them related to the issue of emissions of carbon. I just point out to the Labor Party and the Greens, who criticise the government all the time, that it was the Howard government that committed to a target in Kyoto and that the Australian government is one of the few governments around the world that actually met and exceeded its Kyoto targets. We will do this under the plans put forward by the Prime Minister just yesterday. It is important that we concentrate on this issue. Again, we will see in Paris that Australia will make commitments that it will keep—unlike other countries, which will make commitments and not keep them, unlike the Labor Party, who will make commitments that they know they have absolutely no chance of committing to.
          </p>
          <p>
           Finally, there was a question about same-sex marriage. I again point out to those who might be interested: unlike the Labor Party, which is directed by the unions to vote in a particular way, in the coalition we have a full debate on these issues and come to a conclusion that is guided not by the unions and some faceless men in the Labor Party but by the people of Australia, represented by their representatives in this parliament.
