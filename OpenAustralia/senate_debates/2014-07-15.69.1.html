         I thank Senator Ruston for her continuing interest in this particular area of education policy. It is absolutely true to say that regional Australia is indeed among the big winners from the government's higher education reform package. You need only listen to some of the words of the leadership in the sector. For example, the Vice-Chancellor of the

          Central Queensland University

           . As I have mentioned in the chamber previously, the support for an uncapped number of diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees creates a really great opportunity for regional students and for their universities. The Regional Universities Network has said: 'The provision of demand-driven places to non-university providers could build on the significant partnerships or dual arrangements that already exist between regional

           , Professor Barber, and others, have pointed to the way deregulation of the system will create great opportunities for regional universities to position themselves so much more effectively. They are able to say to students: 'Come and do a high-quality degree with us, with higher student satisfaction, good employment outcomes and a high quality of life, that is good value for money.' Professor Barber, with others, has pointed out that regional and other universities will be able to position themselves much more effectively in online education as well. Distance education is also very important to many of our regional universities, and deregulating that—

             The Regional Universities Network has said: 'More options for higher education study, including sub-bachelor pathways, would be available to regional Australians, including low-

             students.' As our universities are freer to compete with each other to attract students, competition will lead to better deals for students—on the range of courses offered; on modes of teaching, which include both on campus and online; on quality of teaching and other student support; and on value for money. In fact, the Vice-Chancellor of the

              University of Wollongong

             , again in my own state, well known to Senator Fierravanti-Wells, Professor Paul Wellings, spoke of the reforms' potential to increase the competitiveness of the sector while maintaining our ability to offer university education free at the point of delivery to all students irrespective of their circumstances.

               , all of their leadership are talking about the benefits to regional and other students that are going to flow from these initiatives. The Regional Universities Network, the leadership group in this area, has said: 'The network welcomes the announcement in the budget of an ambitious target of reform for higher education which recognises the importance of the sector to Australia. The Treasurer and the minister are to be congratulated for highlighting the important role universities play in Australia's future.' That is what is important to us. We have also supported the

               program which will provide major support with living costs for regional students—often a real barrier to their engagement and involvement. The quality indicators for teaching and for learning and the student and employer surveys, which are part of this balanced package, will help regional universities sell themselves. The regional students and the universities are going to benefit from our support in a number of other ways, including research.
