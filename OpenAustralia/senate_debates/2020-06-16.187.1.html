Tasmania's honourees comprise two appointments as Members of the Order of Australia: Hugh Hiscutt from Howth, for his significant service to the people in the

        I would like to speak about the two remaining Tasmanian OAM recipients in more detail. They are two very special people who I've known for quite a few years. Firstly, Donald 'Don' Ives received an OAM for his service to music and to the community. A music teacher for more than 25 years and a member of the Suncoast Jazz Club on the east coast of Tasmania for many years, Don's love for music is infectious, and I am sure his students treasure their memories of learning piano with him. More recently Don and his wife, Susanne, moved to Longford. Since that time, Don has been a driving force behind Longford standing as a jazz town. He is the co-founder of the Longford Jazz Club, which was launched in 2011, as well as being a member of the organising committee for the Longford Jazz Festival, which has been running since 2014. He's also performed in the Art of Mozart concert at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Trinity_Anglican_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Holy Trinity Anglican Church
        </a>
        for many years. Don loves entertaining and he loves people. He was quoted in
        <i>
         The
        </i>
        <i>
         Examiner
        </i>
        last week, saying that the ability to share music was important to him because music makes people happy, and that makes him happy. But Don's OAM was awarded for more than his cultural contribution. He is a justice of the peace and has been a member of the Tasmanian Society of Justices of the Peace since 1974 and a member of the northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JP" rel="nofollow">
         JP
        </a>
        association since 2000. Don has always been an active supporter of local community and charitable causes, and is always willing to give up his time.
       </p>
       <p>
        From a community's cultural pursuits to the health of its members, our final OAM recipient is Colleen McGann, who was recognised for service to community health in Tasmania. Colleen witnessed many changes within private health care during her 52-year career. Starting at Tasmania's own private healthcare provider St Lukes Health in 1962, Colleen worked her way up through the organisation, starting as a junior clerk and later serving as company secretary, public officer, general manager and managing director. In a speech to the House of Representatives in 2013 acknowledging Colleen's retirement from St Lukes Health, former member for Bass Andrew Nikolic described her as 'a transformational leader who has made a major difference in the lives of so many of her staff'. Only those who worked with her fully appreciate the truth of that statement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Colleen's industry knowledge and nous was recognised more widely when she was named Telstra Tasmanian Business Woman of the Year in 2000. Colleen was the first woman elected vice president of the Australian Health Insurance Association, which is now known as Private Healthcare Australia. Her community service extended to a number of board appointments, including chair of the Health Benefits Council of Tasmania and Australian Regional Health Group, director of MyState Foundation and serving member of the Prime Minister's Community Business Partnership. In addition, in her spare time Colleen has been a vital member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Launceston since 1995, regularly serving as a director as well as being club president twice, including the current year, during that time. She will often be seen manning the club's barbecues at local events around Launceston.
