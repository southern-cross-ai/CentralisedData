        As with any legislation that makes conduct that has until now been lawful into a criminal offence, it is important to ensure that an appropriate balance is struck between the conduct being prohibited and the harm to be prevented, and that there are no unintended adverse consequences from the new laws. The Attorney-General said the new laws would include "appropriate exemptions for bona-fide journalists and for situations where the information being released shows a law being broken, such as whistleblowing on animal cruelty." Given widespread current concerns about the efficacy of whistleblower protections and recent examples of threats to the free press and to the public's right to know in this country, as well as the desire many Australians have to end illegal cruelty to animals, it is appropriate that this bill be referred to committee so that the prohibitions it introduces and adequacy of the exemptions it contains can be subject to public scrutiny input.
