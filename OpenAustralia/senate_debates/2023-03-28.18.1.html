        I rise to speak about the children's television industry in Australia, the amazing work they do and the need to support Australian content and stories. Australia has so much to be proud of when we consider children's television. There are amazing productions, showcasing amazing writers, animators, directors and actors:

        . I am amazed at how much local talent we have in all the amazing locally made shows. I attended the Parliamentary Friends of Australian Children's Storytelling this week, celebrating Australian content in Australian television shows and ensuring Australian content is seen at home and around the world. The industry has had a tough time in the last 18 months, as many industries and most Australians have. What this industry needs above all else is a government that is supportive of its right to create Australian content for Australian kids so that that content can flourish in Australia and elsewhere.

        The Albanese government supports Australian content and understands Australian kids deserve to see Australian content on our screens. I grew up watching Australian content on television screens. Now the next generation should not be robbed of this opportunity. A commitment to an Australian content quota is good policy. I've spoken several times in this place about media and Australian content and how important it is to our way of life. What we cannot overestimate is the amount of economic benefit that's brought to local regional areas in my home state of Tasmania and, in fact, to regional areas around the country. We are world leaders. We produce some of the best children's television there is around the globe, but we should also be allowing our children to listen to our accents.
