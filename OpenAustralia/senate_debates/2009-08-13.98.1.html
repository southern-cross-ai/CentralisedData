            Deputy Governor
           </a>

          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           of contractual arrangements, including with countries like Sudan, which have been proscribed by the United States because of their terrorist status? I also ask the minister, does it not trouble the government enough to ask the Reserve Bank about its subsidiary’s dealing with the regime of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" rel="nofollow">
            Saddam Hussein

          <p class="italic">
           Senator SHERRY—Securency was established in 1996 and it is half-owned by the Reserve Bank. I do not have the board membership before me but I am happy to take that on notice and examine whether there is any common board membership between the

            RBA

            Australian Federal Police
