        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. I refer to the minister's statements regarding the retention bonus for aged-care workers. Yesterday the minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We never said at any point in time that these support bonuses would be tax free. That was never said.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the minister concede that his media release of 20 March 2020 described the payments as 'after tax'?

         At no point in any of those statements that Senator Walsh has just read—and I thank her for the question—particularly in the press release, did I say that the bonus would be tax free. I never said that it would be tax free. That's exactly what I said yesterday. We never, at any point in time, indicated that this bonus would be tax free. We said, at all times, that these bonuses would be up to $800 and up to $600, but we never said—

            At the point that you interrupted the minister, Senator Wong, I believe that he was actually directly addressing, albeit challenging, the assertion contained in the question. That is a matter for debate after question time. It's not a matter for me to direct the minister how to answer the question. I believe he was being directly relevant, and opposition senators can say something after question time in the appropriate slot.

                         which is the implication that the Labor Party is trying to make. So the two statements are completely and utterly compatible. The government at no point indicated that these bonuses would be tax free, because that is not the way income bonuses work. They are clearly subject to tax, because at no point in time did we say they would be tax free.

                               I believe the minister is being directly relevant. I will listen carefully—he is 27 seconds in. He was asked about what a term means and he is directly addressing that particular part of the question, which was the only part of the question.

                                Only the Labor Party could make a full glass sound as though it's empty. This government made a very deliberate decision to provide support to aged-care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic because of the circumstances they found themselves in. We said that they were important to the government and that they were important to the community, and so we made a decision to provide up to $800 and up to $600 for residential aged-care workers and home-care workers to support them through the COVID-19 pandemic.

                                  Why did the minister's press release use the phrase 'after tax' if not to suggest that these bonuses would be tax free? Why does the minister find it so hard to own up to his mistakes?

                                   Thanks, Senator Walsh, for the supplementary question. As I said in my previous answer, 'after tax' does not mean tax free. It's a very, very simple statement. I'm very proud of the fact that this government provided support to residential aged-care workers and home-care workers. In fact, this group of workers is the only group of workers in the Australian economy that was provided with direct support, to recognise the work that they're doing through the coronavirus pandemic. It's in recognition of the fact that their work is so important in the care of senior Australians. It was a very specific decision to support residential aged-care and home-care workers to look after senior Australians through the pandemic because of the importance of the work that they do.
