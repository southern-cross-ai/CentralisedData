       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Engage or direct a qualified person who has specialist knowledge of hazardous substances and demonstrated competency in managing risks associated with hazardous substances, to oversee an ongoing system of auditing to ensure that radiopharmaceutical operations maintain appropriate systems of work to ensure the future health and safety of radiopharmaceutical employees is appropriately managed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Provide ongoing documented evidence to Comcare that systematic monitoring is occurring as outlined above.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Audit its consultative protocols with persons involved in radiopharmaceutical operations from time to time to ensure its policies and procedures are effectively carried out buy its employees to ensure ongoing compliance with the Act and regulations and ANSTO health and safety requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Audit its record-keeping procedures to ensure that appropriate information is recoded, maintained and retained in relation to the health and safety of employees engaged in radiopharmaceutical operations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Ensure that notifiable incidents are reported to Comcare in accordance with the relevant legislation (section 68 of the Act and regulations 37A and 37B of the Safety Arrangements Regulations).
