        Today I would like all senators to smile—come on, give us a grin! And then I'll ask you simply this: how important is it that you're able to smile? How important is that for your self-worth and self-respect? How important is it for you to have most of your teeth? According to last year's Senate inquiry, Australia's dental health is nothing short of appalling, and Tasmania's dental health is the worst in the country—what's new?
       </p>
       <p>
        In just the last two years, the waiting list of Tasmanians trying to get their teeth fixed has just got longer and longer. There are now 15,000 Tasmanians waiting to get dental health care, and that's just the adults. Our Tassie kids are having their teeth removed at just five years of age. Children as young as four are having to have general anaesthetic to take their decayed teeth out. Some teenagers are having all their teeth taken out because they are so decayed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tooth decay and bad oral health are directly linked to bad health, including diabetes, heart disease and stroke. In Tasmania, it's the most common preventable reason for people going to hospital. It's been estimated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Health_and_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
        </a>
        that the economic cost of tooth decay is about $5 billion a year, but capping a scheme for vulnerable Australians to get universal dental care would cost about $2 billion a year. And you guys call yourselves the party of the economy! Jesus. Work it out. All levels of government have dropped the ball on this, and it's time it was fixed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has a few more weeks to respond to the recommendations in the latest Senate inquiry. I would like to acknowledge Senator Steele-John for his leadership on the committee. Senator Steele-John and I grew up in communities where people put off a trip to go to the dentist because they just cannot afford it. The Labor Party is busy crowing about Medicare this week. You just keep crowing; go right ahead. I've got more to come about that. Maybe they could take out some time to respond to the recommendations and do something about Australians and their teeth. I tell you what—it is a problem that you can no longer afford. Work out the mathematics. It's $5 billion to $2 billion, and you're calling yourselves the people of the economy. Know what you're doing with the economics. Fair dinkum!
