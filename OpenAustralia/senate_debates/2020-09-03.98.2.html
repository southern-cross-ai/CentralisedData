         First of all, I would reiterate that the government is extending the payments to people who are on unemployment benefits with the extension of the coronavirus supplement from the end of September until Christmas. Any assertion that it is anything other than an extension of a payment is actually false and misleading. As I said yesterday, every single person in this chamber who came in here in March, when we put forward a massive package of reforms—

           My point of order is direct relevance. I know the minister is reading from a prepared brief. The question went to the reduction—those were the words used: the 'reduction of JobSeeker'. I ask her to return to the question.

             One should never mislead the chamber, but certainly one should never mislead the chamber in a point of order. JobSeeker is not being reduced; it's being absolutely not reduced. The coronavirus supplement is being extended, and JobSeeker remains precisely as it was.

              I'll rule on the point of order when there's silence. This is traditionally a time the opposition values. I'll rule on the point of order. Senator Wong, that goes to the terminology and the substance of an answer, which is a matter for debate. I cannot instruct a minister how to answer a question. The minister is being directly relevant.

               Senator Wong, I'm quite happy to take that interjection. In fact, I'm quite happy to continue to answer this question without even looking down. But there you go—you can waste as much time as you like in the answering of this question by your interjections. That's entirely up to you.

              <p>
               Those opposite show their extraordinary ignorance in their understanding of the budgetary process and the economy if they think that one measure in isolation is going to actually tell them the answer. The impact of the suite of measures that were put in place by our government has enabled this economy to be cushioned through a once-in-a-century pandemic that has totally destroyed the economies of every country around the world. And Australia yesterday demonstrated that despite the fact that Australia and Australians have been significantly impacted by this coronavirus, we have actually fared very well on the basis of the economic stimulus that our government put in place in March to support all Australian individuals and businesses throughout the pandemic.

                     When it comes to social policy I make my decisions on the basis of putting in place the economic supports people need, depending on the circumstances that are before them. Right now we are in the midst of a pandemic, and the government made a decision, announced in July, that we would continue to provide additional levels of support until Christmas to people who find themselves unemployed. My decisions are always based on the social impact and the social imperatives of the people I represent.

                       It's extraordinary. With the 1½ million Australians relying on support and 13 applicants for every single job, why is it that the minister can't tell us what the economic impact will be of cutting financial support for those who are on JobSeeker with the coronavirus supplement? Does the minister take any responsibility for making the recession deeper and longer by cutting the coronavirus supplement and cutting wages at the worst possible time?
