            defence ministers meeting in Bratislava was an important opportunity to review developments in Afghanistan and, of course, represent Australia’s interests. Discussions covered Commander ISAF General Stanley McChrystal’s assessment of the campaign, the need to support the ongoing growth and development of the Afghan national security forces and the importance of complementing our military efforts with civil assistance and governance improvements at all levels.
           </p>

              I thank Senator Forshaw for that supplementary question. I am pleased to advise that
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">

               General McChrystal
              </a>
              ’s overall counterinsurgency approach. Important decisions in response to General McChrystal’s assessment are yet to be taken, as I am sure senators are aware, by the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
               US
              </a>
              administration and other ISAF partners. It is, I think, proper that we allow that to take the necessary time. What I can say is that I certainly welcome the rigour of General McChrystal’s analysis, with its focus on protecting the civilian population and training the Afghan national security forces. These features of General McChrystal’s analysis are strongly reflected in the approach that Australian forces are taking in Oruzgan, working side by side with their colleagues in the Afghan national armed forces.

                Certainly as I understand it, a final decision by the Dutch government on the type of commitment that they intend to maintain after 2010 is yet to be made. Needless to say, Australia enjoys an excellent relationship with the Netherlands. Today, as I have done in the past, I commend them for the outstanding job they have done. We would very much like to see the Dutch continue their valuable role, and I took the opportunity to make this point to my Dutch counterpart, Minister Middelkoop. That decision is in the hands of the Netherlands government, as every senator would understand. I can say that I took the opportunity to strongly emphasise to
