        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the answers given by ministers to questions without notice asked today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I find this government very intriguing, as they seem unable to be able to look in the mirror and be honest with themselves. This government lectured us for months on end about the importance of transparency, honesty and accountability. The Prime Minister said last year:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our democracy is precious. We should be very proud of the democracy we have created here in Australia. But the Westminster system relies upon checks and balances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet, since coming to power, this government has done all that it can to unwind any kinds of checks and balances, let alone proper transparency. This government can't face the simple fact that in the past year of governing they have not done a single thing that was conducted in an accountable or transparent process. This government are complete hypocrites on accountability, and, frankly, Senator Gallagher refusing to answer simple questions here is doing nothing to ameliorate that concern. How is refusing to answer questions being accountable?
       </p>
       <p>
        On 24 April 2022, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese published an opinion piece called 'A government that will accept responsibility', and I'll quote from it. He said, 'Australia needs a government that will accept responsibility and not seek to blame others for its errors.' I find it particularly interesting, because all Labor have done is blame the former government. In what instance have we seen this government take any responsibility for its actions? In dealing with serious allegations, they cannot answer important questions, and Labor's unwillingness to be transparent, accountable or honest is shaping up to be a consistent pattern in their attitude and certainly their behaviour.
       </p>
       <p>
        They blame, for example, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
         RBA
        </a>
        for the 11 rate increases on their watch, while overseeing $185 billion in new spending that only adds to further inflationary pressure. I rack my brain to think of any legislation that they've passed that did not play political games and put the people of Australia ahead of their own agenda. We're all very aware of what happened late last year when the shocking 'secure jobs, better pay' bill came before this parliament. They allowed 22 days for the committee that I'm on, the Education and Employment Legislation Committee, to report on that legislation. Now, explain to me how 22 days is a satisfactory amount of time to consult with stakeholders, businesses and individuals, let alone giving them enough time to prepare significant and substantial submissions, in order for the department to have the appropriate time to consult and to have the bill drafted properly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister needs to take a deep look inside his operations and how he is conducting his government. He needs to take a deep look. He needs to stop weaponising important issues and focus on leading this country with integrity. The government said they would end the waste and the pork-barrelling, yet the Minister for Communications blocked a freedom of information request for documents relating to Labor's dodgy round 6 of the Mobile Black Spot Program. No wonder it was blocked. The minister personally selected all 54 locations to receive funding, and they were almost all in Labor seats. This government has some very important questions that they must answer, and when they come into question time they should be prepared to answer those questions in their entirety and with clarity, not hide behind any sort of excuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, remind yourselves, government, of the promise you made to the Australian people—the so-called promise that you would run the most honest, transparent and accountable government. We are yet to see that promise transpire. We're yet to see it occur here in this Senate. So take this opportunity to listen not just to me but to yourselves, because this was your promise, and you're failing dismally.

         Well, that was interesting.

         </a>
         just say that I'm really proud to stand here as a member of the Albanese government. We are one of the most transparent, honest governments that we have seen in this country for the last 10 years. I have to say that. And you want to talk about black spots? Really? You had nine or 10 years to fix the black spots all around this country, and you come in here and talk about black spots, and you haven't fixed any of them. You're having a go at us, and you've had 10 years—10 whole years—to fix the black spots around this country, and you come in here and have a crack at us.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the end of the day, I don't know how many of you on that side did not stand here and listen to the statement Senator Gallagher made yesterday. I want to read out the first four sentences of that. She said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I want to begin by statement by saying that when it comes to responding to the serious allegations of rape, that occurred in a minister's office in this building, I have at all times been guided by the bravery and courage of a young woman who chose to speak up and about an alleged incident in her workplace. I have always acted ethically and with basic human decency on all matters related to Ms Higgins. I will continue to do so. I will always support women to come forward and I will always respect their confidence when it is sought.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those were the first four sentences of her statement yesterday, and that is exactly what she has done.
        </p>
        <p>
         And I think we really need to remember what this is all about. Senator Gallagher, in answering the questions both yesterday and today, has continually said—let's stop and think about this for a moment—that this is about the wellbeing of a young woman who stood up very bravely and was prepared to speak out. She was working in this building that we're all in today, in a Liberal minister's office, when she alleged that she had been sexually assaulted by her colleague. Who was the employer? The Morrison Liberal government. They let her down in the days and the weeks and the months that followed that allegation that she reported to them.
        </p>
        <p>
         After two years, when the government and the party that she served did nothing, she made the courageous decision to speak up, to stand up. Those allegations were made public on her own terms. She has a right to that. She does not have a right to have her name drawn through the mud here every single day. She knew when she came forward that she would become a political target, but she did it anyway because she was determined to change the culture in this building. Senator Gallagher, as the Minister for Women, has done more than any other minister for women in the last 10 years to make sure that people are protected in this building and to make it a healthier and safer place for women. So let's not think about that.
        </p>
        <p>
         We should be concerned about the long-term impacts that these actions—your actions—are having. Senator Gallagher, over and over and over, has said that she has been contacted by women's organisations about the effect of your actions on those women and their courage to stand up and speak out. That is not what this country is about. This is not what this government is about. We want those women to stand up. We want them to speak out, and we want them to get help. What this sends is a message about how they will be treated in this country if they do. So I would say: be responsible, and consider your actions, because those bear huge responsibilities and we don't want women to hide in the corner and not speak out about these issues. For too many years, that has happened. It's time it stopped. The actions around what's happening from that side every single day are not going to help that. We want these women to be able to stand up and to feel safe. Senator Gallagher, as one of the best ministers for women, is helping women to stand up and speak out. What you're doing is continually putting a lid on them and telling them to shut up.

         <p>
          I'd like to support the words of Senator Urquhart, that actions have consequences and people need to consider those. One of the actions that I'm aware that my colleague Senator Reynolds and her chief of staff undertook was to make the offer of support and advice to report the allegation to police. The action of going to the media before the police though has had a significant consequence, in that the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' has been denied to an Australian citizen. Valid concerns have been raised here about the impacts of this whole debate on people's mental health. But it's important to realise that that individual has also been driven close to the point of suicide and self-harm because of the pressure that has been placed on him because that principle, that part of the rule of law in Australia, has been taken away. Likewise, the mental health of a number of other people has also been damaged. So actions do have consequences, and I think all senators in this place should reflect on that, not just in terms of the action in here but also in terms of the actions that governments take. No amount of rhetoric will change the reality.
         </p>
         <p>
          One other answer from Senator Gallagher that I wish to go to is her comment on cost-of-living pressures. She made the claim that things like power prices are linked to overseas events. The reality on the ground though is that, throughout 2020, the average price for energy in Europe—in Germany, in particular, which has been seen as a bit of a canary in the coal mine—was in the order of 43 euros per megawatt hour. By December 2021, it was already increasing to an average of 213 euros per megawatt hour. In December 2021, before the invasion of Ukraine, it was peaking at 435 euros per megawatt hour. There were another couple of large spikes in the intervening period, but in Germany that price has now gone back to 102 euros per megawatt hour, which is still, by the way, one of the most expensive in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
           OECD
          </a>
          . The point is that the price pressures in Germany were rising ahead of the invasion—they have been held out as the canary in the coalmine—so the rhetoric from the minister doesn't reflect the reality of the things that are driving up prices. In fact, if you look, in Australia's case, back to the market interruptions in May of last year, there were times when the domestic price for gas was higher than the international price, which actually lays bare the claim that our market is driven purely by international factors.
         </p>
         <p>
          So the interventions by the Albanese government, with things like the price cap, actually decrease confidence in investment, which decreases supply. Basic market economics say that that then starts driving price factors and has an impact on the cost of living. The other part that is important to understand around the rhetoric versus reality, going particularly to the cost of living and energy, is that the rhetoric here is that the clean energy transition to variable renewable power sources will drive down prices. But the reason that Germany has the highest price for electricity in both industry and residential households in the OECD is that they actually have the highest penetration of variable renewables in the OECD.
         </p>
         <p>
          The country with the lowest price of power in the OECD is Canada, which operates 19 nuclear reactors and also has a substantial amount of hydro. But the province of Ontario, which gets the majority of its power from those 19 nuclear reactors, is in the bottom quartile of the provinces in Canada for power. So clearly there is no correlation between the claim that large amounts of variable renewables will drive down power and that nuclear will drive up power. In fact, reality shows the opposite. It's also borne out by the reality shown in modelling by both the OECD and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEA" rel="nofollow">
           IEA
          </a>
          , which highlights that the only way to have reliable and affordable power is to invest in base load power such as nuclear power.

           is an absolute trailblazer and fierce advocate for women, and I am incredibly proud to be in this chamber with a woman of her calibre. It doesn't feel like it was all that long ago that I was working in child protection with children and women who were survivors of sexual abuse, and I got to see firsthand the impacts of those assaults and violence on children and women, which are long lasting and devastating. They leave a profound impact on survivors. It's certainly easy to forget in this place how powerful words are when they are used so irresponsibly by those opposite. They're used without any care for anybody outside this place. We have a responsibility in here to tread with care.
          </p>
          <p>
           According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics Personal Safety Survey released in March this year, an estimated eight million Australians—41 per cent—aged 18 years and over have experienced physical or sexual violence. One in five women—that's 22 per cent, or 2.2 million women—have experienced sexual violence. One in 16 men—that's 6.1 per cent, or 582,400 men—have experienced sexual violence. The rates of family and domestic or sexual violence are higher for Indigenous women. We know that. They are 34 times more likely to be hospitalised than non-Indigenous women. While those opposite want to try to turn the torch on Labor for political gain about who knew what and when, there are people out in the community who hear every word that we say in here. It is echoed out into the community, and what they hear is that you don't care about their trauma and that you don't care about their resilience or the strength of survivors at all.
          </p>
          <p>
           It would be easy to forget, with the disgraceful comments thrown around over the last couple of weeks, that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Me_Too" rel="nofollow">
            Me Too
           </a>
           movement ever happened. You'd be forgiven for thinking that the
           <i>
            Set
           </i>
           <i>
            the standard
           </i>
           report was never written or that the #LetHerSpeak campaign never happened. You'd be forgiven for thinking that those events didn't happen, because it's certainly fallen on deaf ears over there. It's like those opposite learned nothing. To be so irresponsible is frigging outrageous.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that half of the women who've experienced sexual assault did not seek advice or support after the most recent incident of sexual assault perpetrated by a male. The events that have unfolded in this place certainly won't give them any confidence in seeking support in the near future. It should go without saying that every person in this place should be able to live free from violence, to be safe in their communities.
          </p>
          <p>
           The discussion today again serves as a stark reminder of the work that we need to do not just in this place but as a country. We are certainly under some great leadership with our Minister for Women in Katy Gallagher. We need to place survivors at the heart of conversations that we have about them, because that's what this conversation is about. We need to acknowledge the tenacity and strength of all those who have experienced it and survived, because they are the true heroes here.
          </p>
          <p>
           To those listening I say I'm sorry if you're feeling retraumatised because of the conduct of the people in this place. I'm sorry for what you've had to hear in this place. I'm sorry for what you've had to see through the media and on your

           screens that has retriggered you over the last couple of weeks. I'm sorry if you're in pain from the conversations that have happened in this place. I want to say that we absolutely need to do better. We need to do better for you.

                                            Transparency, honesty and integrity are the most important factors for a functioning democracy. The people must be able to trust that their elected representatives are working in their favour. It is time to bring back integrity into this building. It is time for those opposite and the crossbench to start acting on their words.

                                            Despite campaigning on integrity since day one, the Albanese Labor government has demonstrated anything but integrity.

                                            —even taking him to court. Now in government, he refuses to release his diary, as do other ministers—all of whom campaigned on transparency, honesty and integrity. The complete hypocrisy of the Prime Minister and Attorney-General to campaign on transparency and integrity while in opposition calling for a specific act of transparency such as releasing diaries—we must do everything we can to ensure that government and government processes are transparent, and that citizens are prepared to engage with our democracy.
