        (ii) Labor's approach will focus on the development of policies that will not only cut pollution, but ensure we maximise the jobs and economic opportunities of modernising our economy;

        (d) understands that every Australian deserves a government that looks to the future and makes the necessary policy reforms and investments to secure that future;

        (e) notes that projects, such as the proposed hydrogen production facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Bay" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) recognises that, once complete, the proposed facility would use renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen through a process called electrolysis, with the product then able to be sold as liquid hydrogen, or combined with nitrogen to create ammonia; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) notes that the regional development ramifications for a project like this should be recognised, including an estimated 500 to 1000 jobs which could be created, and that the flow-on effect to other businesses and service providers would be ongoing.

           In 2018, Australia had the largest per capita level of investment in clean energy in the world—more than the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
            UK
           </a>
           , Germany and France combined. We're working to deliver Snowy 2.0, the Battery of the Nation, the National Hydrogen Strategy and investment in bioenergy and lithium research. Labor is hopelessly divided on energy and has abandoned the climate platform it took to the last election. We call on all Labor senators to follow the lead of the shadow minister for agriculture and resources and endorse the government's sensible climate policy and agenda instead of pursuing reckless targets that will hit Australian families and small business the hardest.

              We oppose this motion. Labor only recently lost the unlosable election, in large part due to their extreme climate policies, which would have destroyed the Australian economy and transferred our manufacturing industries to the likes of China and India, who have not burdened themselves with virtue-signalling
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
               UN
              </a>
              climate policies. What does real climate action look like to the Labor Party? Is it transitioning away from cheap, clean hydrocarbon energy sources that power the economy to expensive, intermittent solar and wind that could not even produce enough energy to produce themselves? What would be the benefit of this transition? According to Australia's Chief Scientist, if the entire Australian economy stopped tomorrow and reduced our 1.5 per cent carbon dioxide output to zero, it will have virtually no effect on global temperature. What could be Labor's motivation to kill our economy for no benefit? The answer, my friends, lies in the Labor platform of democratic socialism.
