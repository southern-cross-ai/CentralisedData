           The coalition government does not support Labor's retiree tax, which will take money out of the pockets of one million Australians, including 230,000 pensioners. Labor's policy will overwhelmingly hit low- and middle-income earners, with 86 per cent of the individuals impacted on taxable incomes of less than $37,000. The coalition government notes the importance of the franking credit in the Australian taxation system. Franking credits represent taxes that have already been paid on behalf of shareholders.

              Here we see the Liberal-Green alliance in action. We're just about to see it here. Federal Labor are absolutely committed to progressive taxation reform, including reform to dividend imputation, but it's disappointing that the Greens have taken two positions on this. After Labor's announcement, the Greens shadow spokesperson for finance, Sarah Hanson-Young, was out of the blocks early backing Labor's policy in; yet a couple of days later, hours before a certain by-election, we heard from the Leader of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Greens
              </a>
              , Senator Di Natale, who said the Greens do have concerns about this policy. Hours before the by-electionâ€”so desperate were they to rescue their failing campaignâ€”that was what they resorted to: selling out their principles and selling out their shadow spokesperson. That was what we saw from Senator Di Natale hours before polling day. This mob aren't a patch on the Bob Brown Greens from a decade ago. They are selling out their principles and they were sold short in Batman.

                   Is it the one from 16 March? We just don't know. If you are asking us to support a policy, tell us which one it is. Our position is clear: we support reforms to franking credits. That is why we'll support this motion.

                   We'll do our job in the Senate. When you finally decide what your policy is, we'll make sure that, if it hurts struggling pensioners, we'll protect them.
