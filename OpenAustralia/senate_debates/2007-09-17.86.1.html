        I move:

       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate adopt the recommendation of the interim report that the time for the presentation of final reports be extended to the last day of the 41st Parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to mention one quick matter on behalf of the committee. I see Senator Murray in the chamber tonight. Our colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        was reported over the weekend and today as having concern about the lack of public hearings in relation to his bill, which is the subject of the first matter of this motion. I want to clarify the matter for the benefit of the Senate. I have the leave of my committee to disclose and publish the minutes of our meeting on 12 September, if required, and I am requiring that tonight.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to indicate quite clearly to the chamber that it was always the intention of the economics committee that there would be public hearings in relation to this matter. Indeed, we facilitated that with various motions. The committee had a choice as to whether we would table this report today based on submissions or whether we would table an interim report and have the reporting date adjourned to a later date to assist Senator Fielding. It was the unanimous view of the remainder of the committee that the committee members would not be available. I will quote from the minutes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All members of the committee advised that they would not be available for public hearings on this matter during this sitting period or before the election. Senator Bernardi suggested holding hearings after the election.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …            …            …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On the motion of Senator Bernardi, seconded Senator Stephens, the committee agreed that public hearings not be held on this bill until after the election period.
       </p>
       <p>
        The matter was deferred. The terms of the motion before the Senate at the moment are to accommodate those public hearings, and I have every expectation, as chair of the committee, that those public hearings will take place.

         I rise to support the remarks of the chair with respect to availability for hearings this week and last week. I indicate that my own legislative schedule is very heavy. On today’s
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_Paper" rel="nofollow">
           Notice Paper
          </a>
         </i>
         , for instance, I have six bills, and that is the way it is for me every day of the week, so I cannot attend the hearing. We all know it is an election period. Of course, if it were a government bill that was urgent and had to be passed this week, the committee report might have had to have been brought down. But this is not a bill which will carry urgency; it is not a bill which will be considered during this sitting, so it is preferable, if the bill is to be properly examined, that it be examined when there is time and the personnel available to examine it. Frankly, it has happened in the past that committee inquiries have happened without hearings. My own memory is that in the last 12 months probably two or three economics bills alone have been dealt with on that basis. In this case, a hearing was desired and will be accommodated. It just will not be accommodated this week or in the forthcoming weeks. I want to support the chair with those remarks.
