        My question is to the Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation, Senator Lundy. Can the minister outline to the Senate how the government is supporting industry and jobs? Further, can the minister inform the Senate on the government's economic agenda for the future?

         The government's No. 1 priority is to support working people. Senators on this side of the chamber represent working families and the Gillard government understands that a strong economy underpins the industries that employ these hard-working Australians. We managed the economy through the global financial crisis to ensure that jobs kept growing. The Labor government has worked to do this since coming to office in 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has low unemployment of 5.2 per cent, real wages have continued to grow and we have seen the creation of 700,000 new jobs. Australia's strong economic position has been achieved while delivering on the Labor values of fairness and equity. We removed
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         to restore fairness to the workplace and introduced paid parental leave. We are investing more than $36 billion in transport infrastructure projects around the country and we are building the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         , which will improve productivity and create many new business opportunities. We recognise the need to decouple economic growth from pollution and we are implementing a price on carbon. We are investing in skills and training and giving Australians a fair share of the mining boom.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, the Gillard government is also acutely aware of the challenges our manufacturers are facing and is working side by side with Australian industries to boost their productivity and competitiveness and build a culture of innovation. Labor believes in investing in industry in challenging times with over $15 billion to be invested in creating the jobs of tomorrow, most notably in manufacturing. We are working hard to ensure Australian manufacturers have access to major investment projects, global supply chains and similar opportunities.

             The coalition are on record as having no commitment to the manufacturing industry and are certainly not helping it to compete in a low-carbon global economy. Labor is supporting the automotive sector, but the opposition have a plan to cut that support by $1.5 billion. This plan will cripple a key sector and destroy the 46,000 jobs and the 200,000 broader jobs that rely on the auto sector. Further, the opposition have voted against supporting steelworkers. They are saying no to clean energy and to jobs in manufacturing and beyond. They say no to the mining tax, no to the 12 per cent superannuation for workers and no to investing in the

               I am really pleased to answer this question because it is an issue close to my heart. I am glad to report that, as many of my fellow senators would already know, women as innovators are increasingly making a serious impact in industry and in business.
              </p>
              <p>
               A recent report by the Australian Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry shows that the number of women who run their own business has doubled in the last five years. Indeed, the Australian Women Chamber of Commerce and Industry also report that there are now more than 700,000 women running a business in Australia. Female entrepreneurs are seizing opportunities and contributing immensely to our economy. As Minister Assisting for Industry and Innovation I will be focused on promoting women in industry—on policies that support their engagement and further their interests in business.
