        My question is to Senator Faulkner, the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. Will the minister advise whether the government has yet received the Defence Border Protection Command inquiry report into the explosion on

           Senator, I think this is an important issue, so I would hope that all senators would treat it so. First of all, I say from the outset that the government has stressed on this matter the importance of not speculating about the incident, including of course, as Senator Ferguson and other senators would appreciate, the cause of the explosion on the vessel. I can also say to the Senate that this particular matter is subject to ongoing police and coronial investigations. In relation to the police investigation, I am sure Senator Ferguson and others would accept that it should run its course without interference or statements which may prejudice the outcomes. I will certainly be very careful of that broad principle in responding.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also indicate to you that the approach the government is taking is being supported by the head of the northern—

            , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister advise whether reports that some ADF personnel have suffered ‘severe psychological affront’ as a result of this incident are correct? If so, what action is the government taking to ensure the welfare of our ADF personnel?

             I can continue on this important issue. A Defence inquiry is being conducted into the incident. The instrument of appointment and terms of reference for the Defence inquiry into the incident upon

             36 were signed on 6 May. I can inform the Senate and Senator Ferguson particularly that the inquiry is expected to be completed by early June 2009. I can also indicate to Senator Ferguson that the inquiry team is working very cooperatively with the civilian agencies that I mentioned before who are conducting these investigations into this particular matter. In relation to Defence personnel I can assure the Senate that the

               That is a matter that I will refer to the defence minister for him to give you a more precise answer than I can. As the Minister representing the Minister for Defence it would not be proper for me to talk about that operational element of the questions that you raise, but I will ask the Minister for Defence and I will report back to the Senate on when and what information will be made available.
