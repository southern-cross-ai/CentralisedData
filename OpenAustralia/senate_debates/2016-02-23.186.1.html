        I rise tonight, in the season approaching all things Irish and green, to put on the record the celebration that happened in honour of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Brigid" rel="nofollow">
         St Brigid
        </a>
        in the inaugural Brigid Awards, which happened in Sydney just a couple of weeks ago on 29 January. They were hosted by the Irish Friends of Labor. I am pleased that my colleague Senator Claire Moore is in the chamber this evening, because I do recall that the very first proper celebration I had of St Brigid's Day was actually with Senator Moore at the Irish Club in Brisbane, where they have established this tradition somewhat earlier. Nonetheless, we kicked it off in fine style in Sydney. I want to take the opportunity to acknowledge the contribution of Irish-Australian and Australian-Irish people throughout the history of this great nation and particularly to acknowledge Labor and union women who have made a great contribution in recent times. There were a number of recipients, who have made great contributions, and I would like to put those formally on the record.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our youngest awardee was Siobhan Armson-Graham, who was nominated by Courtney Housses
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLC" rel="nofollow">
         MLC
        </a>
        . Siobhan is a

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers'_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Transport Workers' Union
        </a>
        activist and, in her position as the convenor of the Australian Young Labor Women's Network, she has been the driving force for the party's increasing engagement with young women. She has worked tirelessly to recruit, support and promote young women in our party, and she is the youngest woman who was honoured on the evening. Just to put it on the record, the old tradition of telling Irish jokes is met in Ireland with jokes told about the differences between the counties in Ireland, and this county contest is quite an important part of your identity in Ireland. So to hail from a particular county is an important thing. I want to acknowledge that Siobhan's Irish heritage takes her back to the counties of Cork and Kerry, in the southern part of Ireland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jude Cooke, who was nominated by Trish Doyle, the member for the

         Australian Education Union

       </p>
       <p>
        Our third awardee of the evening was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Faraday" rel="nofollow">
         Ann Faraday
        </a>
        , nominated by Goulburn Labor. Ann is a longstanding member of United Voice and has worked as a school cleaner in Goulburn for more than 30 years. She was a branch delegate to the Goulburn

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        and she loves her Irish history. She is making history tonight, and I am sure that her Irish relatives would be very proud of her contribution to this, her new nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also indicate that we acknowledged
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayee_Griffin" rel="nofollow">

        Dee Madigan gave perhaps the most irreverent speech of the evening, and those who have heard her in full flight would know what a delight that is to behold. Dee is an award-winning creative director with over 20 years experience in advertising. And, as she confessed to us, her father was a leading light in her life when she was growing up, and he was, in fact, a priest—she said not a very good one, and that is how she commenced her speech on the evening. She has been a winner or a finalist of most major awards, including Cannes. She has been a creative director on seven election campaigns for the ALP, including the 2013 federal campaign and the very successful 2015 Queensland state election. She does work with unions and has developed a number of campaigns for a range of unions across the country. She has her own advertising agency, Campaign Edge. She is frequently seen as panellist on

        as well as a political commentator on Sky. Her mother was born in Meath and her father was from

        Karen McKeown was nominated by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Graham" rel="nofollow">
         John Graham
        </a>
        , assistant secretary of New South Wales Labor. She is the first female mayor of Penrith in over a decade and is an outstanding local government leader and advocate for women. She has held roles such as convenor of the New South Wales Labor councillors caucus and president of the Australian

       </p>
       <p>
        Tara Moriarty, nominated by Kaila Murnain, the now general secretary of New South Wales Labor, has dedicated her life to the Labor movement and the Labor Party. As the senior vice-president, she is the most senior elected female officer of the Labor Party in New South Wales and had a very significant role in the fight for affirmative action rules at Labor's national conference in 2015. She is the secretary of the Liquor and Hospitality Division, United Voice in New South Wales and was a key activist and leader in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Your_Rights_At_Work" rel="nofollow">
         Your Rights At Work
        </a>
        campaign in 2007. She comes from a long line of Irish heritage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Patricia Okon, nominated by the Lithgow branch of the ALP, is a longstanding community and ALP activist. She was born on 15 January 1929 and is a pillar of the Lithgow community. She is a mother of nine children, and I am just overwhelmed at the thought of all the washing and folding that that involved. But she managed to get out of the house to all those ALP branch meetings, and she has certainly been a very active member since 1991. She has served as the Lithgow branch treasurer since 1996 and is the longest serving executive member of the Lithgow branch.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Ursula Stephens—no stranger to this place—was also acknowledged on the evening. Nominated, once again, by Kaila Murnain, our general secretary for New South Wales, she served in this place for 13 years. Prior to entering the Senate, she was the first female president of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Labor Party. She has dedicated her career to serving the people of New South Wales, where she continues to do great community work in her hometown of Goulburn. In the 2015 election, she contested the state seat of Goulburn and received an extraordinary swing towards her of 20 per cent. Ursula has an extremely close Irish heritage. In fact, she was born in

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge Noreen Solomon, a member of the ALP since 1980. A tireless community activist, she has stood as an ALP election candidate on several occasions in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Sutherland Shire
        </a>
        area. She is first generation Irish. Her father, Frank, emigrated from Clones in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/County_Monaghan" rel="nofollow">
         County Monaghan
        </a>
        at the age of 17. Noreen was nominated by the Cronulla/Caringbah ALP branch.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our lifetime achievement award went to the Hon. Susan Ryan AO, the Australian Age Discrimination Commissioner and Disability Discrimination Commissioner. From 1975 to 1988 she was a senator for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        , becoming the first woman to hold a cabinet position in a federal Labor government. She served in senior portfolios in the Hawke government as Minister for Education and Youth Affairs, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women and Special Minister of State. As the education minister, she saw school retention rates double and universities and TAFEs grow significantly. She pioneered extensive anti-discrimination and equal opportunity legislation, including the landmark

       </p>
       <p>
        These are all women of fine Irish-Australian heritage making a wonderful contribution to our civic life. It was a pleasure to share the evening with them and to acknowledge their achievements.
