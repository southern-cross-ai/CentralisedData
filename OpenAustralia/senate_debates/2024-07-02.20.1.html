         The Albanese government absolutely knows that many Australians are under pressure right now, with high costs of living, and, unlike those whinging on the opposite side of this chamber, Labor is delivering for all Australians. I am the Labor spokesperson for the seats of Calare, Farrer, Hume, Riverina, Lyne and Parkes in

         . It's more than half the state. Together that is 412,000 people in regional and rural New South Wales who are receiving a tax cut. But things are not always clear on the aggregate.

         Let me talk about industrious Calare. An additional 11,000 people are going to be getting an average tax cut of $1,532 compared to the previous Liberal government's plan, which wasn't going to touch the sides. They weren't going to get a sight of it, not a smell of it. They were just going to get zero. In Farrer, which I had the absolute delight to visit just two weeks ago, up and down the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_River" rel="nofollow">
          Murray River

         , 10,000 locals are going to get an average tax cut of about $1,359. Before that, under the Liberals and the Nationals, what did they get? Zero. In Hume, where I shivered on Sunday as I attended mass at the cathedral of Sts Peter and Paul and met with locals, 11,000 hardworking Australians are getting a tax cut. The Lib's plan for them? Zero. In Lyne, 7,000 taxpayers are getting an average tax cut of $1,325. If the Liberal and National parties had their way, those 7,000 people in Lyne would be getting $0 in their tax cut. In rock-solid Riverina, many of our young service men and women at

         are amongst the 9,000 local workers who are going to get an average tax cut of $1,425. What did the Liberals have for them? Zero.
