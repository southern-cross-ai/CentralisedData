The government shares the Australian community's concerns about animal welfare and is taking the necessary action to provide for a secure future for the live trade industry. But, as I have already announced, the government has suspended live animal exports to Indonesia until we are satisfied that the appropriate animal welfare standards can be met. I announced on 13 June 2011 that Mr Bill Farmer AO would also conduct an independent review into Australia's live export trade. Mr Farmer, of course, will examine each stage of the supply chain from paddock to the point of slaughter. But I have seen comments from Mr Abbott and Mr Truss on this and they seem to suggest that they would want to take—

I have given the minister a minute of his two minutes to consider the question, which was very specific, around when he, his department or his office first saw images of these inhumane slaughter practices. It was a very specific question and I would ask you to bring the minister to the question.

The decision to suspend trade was not an easy one, but let us be clear: on the afternoon of 30 May—

                          officials have been in close contact with our Indonesian ambassador in Jakarta, and Indonesian counterparts. The Indonesian government shares our concern that some animals are not being slaughtered in accordance with Indonesia's own animal welfare laws. Both governments acknowledge that no one issue can dominate the relationship. The Indonesian trade minister, Dr Pangestu, stressed in her public comments that Australia's action represents a temporary suspension and that Indonesia was keen to improve practices.

                           , I raise a point of order on relevance. The question could not have been more specific: when did the minister contact the Indonesian government in relation to these practices? There was nothing else. He was not asked about the bilateral relationship or the history. He was asked a narrow and specific question. Either he answers it or he is not being either directly or indirectly relevant.

                              , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the minister's recent statement that he has been expressing concerns about this matter since January, why didn't the minister take the opportunity to investigate the matter personally when he was in Indonesia in March?

                               Of course this is an area where, unlike the coalition when they are in government, I have been raising it both in January, with the industry, and again at an opportunity in Katherine with the Cattle Council of Australia to talk to the issue of animal welfare outcomes for our trade to continue.

                               In addition to that, we have continued to say that we understand that the suspension will have an impact on the Australian producers and those involved in the live export trade. We know that this government, unlike the previous government, have continually raised the issue of how we improve animal welfare outcomes for this trade. That information has been continuously conveyed both to industry and to the Indonesians.
