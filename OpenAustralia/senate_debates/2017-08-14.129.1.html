         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question. It's true to say that Australia and our neighbours have benefited enormously from the ongoing peace and stability of the Indo-Pacific region, which has enabled trade and prosperity to flourish across the region over the past 75 years. However, that stability is gravely threatened by the reckless actions of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         n regime, as I said last week, which continues to disregard multiple
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         Security Council resolutions aimed at always maintaining global peace. By the development and illegal testing of its weapon and missile programs, North Korea has deliberately decided to become a destabilising and disruptive influence in the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         The outbreak of conflict, of war, on the Korean peninsula would have catastrophic consequences, including for North Korea. That's why it's important that we continue to pursue collective action to prevent North Korea from continuing on its dangerous path. The best prospect for a peaceful and enduring solution of this problem is for North Korea to comply with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         resolutions and dismantle its nuclear and ballistic missile program.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is committed to maintaining regional stability. We're working within the United Nations framework of sanctions, advocacy and collective action to encourage the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean" rel="nofollow">
          North Korean
         </a>
         regime to comply with the rules based global order and coexist with other nations. We are working with our allies and partners to determine the most appropriate defensive countermeasures, including using diplomatic means to constrain and deter North Korea's illegal weapons development activities. Australia will continue to implement sanctions, including autonomous sanctions, aimed at restricting North Korea's ability to carry out its threats. Whatever North Korea's objectives, threats of missile strikes against other nations are unacceptable, and Australia condemns this behaviour without reservation.

            has been a stabilising influence in the Pacific since 1945. The US-Australia alliance is our most important strategic defence relationship. It's central to our security and strategic arrangements. It's an alliance that is underpinned by the deepest levels of cooperation between our two nations, and it's been strengthened by consecutive governments over the past 75 years. It has historically recognised that an armed attack on Australia or the United States would be dangerous to both countries, and it obliges each country to consult if the security of the parties is threatened and to act to meet common danger in the event of an armed attack in the Pacific. We are committed to strengthening regional security frameworks to ensure that stability and prosperity is maintained.

               Australia is committed to those economic and diplomatic sanctions and regional security matters wherever possible, as I have previously identified. As I have said, Australia is committed to strengthening those regional frameworks so that we and our regional partners can work cooperatively to resolve shared challenges and to address common threats. We also outlined in the
