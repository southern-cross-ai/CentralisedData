         I thank Senator Van for his question. As at 6.30 am today, 24 February, there have been a total of 22 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Australia; 10 are reported to have recovered, with the remaining cases understood to be in a stable condition. The case totals by jurisdiction are two in

         Minister Hunt and his state and territory counterparts attended the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee meeting on 23 February and were given an update on the current COVID-19 situation and discussed national preparedness of the health system. The advice received is that COVID-19—or coronavirus, as it is known—has been contained in Australia, with no new cases in the general population in the last week. Although the virus is contained in Australia, with only 22 cases, Australia is ready and has acted very early to prepare for a potential pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
         The containment of the virus in Australia is an encouraging indication that the government's approach to preventing the spread of coronavirus on our shores continues to be successful. Of the Australians who were on the

         , seven have been diagnosed with coronavirus. All are well and in a stable condition but have been put into an isolation and containment process before being medevaced to hospitals in their home states. The protection and safety of Australians remains the government's highest priority.

            While the travel restrictions remain, the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee has recommended that current containment measures receive continual review. As a consequence of the positive signs of containment, the committee has recommended that Border Force extend case-by-case exemptions to the travel bans to year 11 and 12 secondary students from mainland China, excluding Hubei. The government have considered and accepted that advice. There will now be a limited number of exemptions granted. These exemptions will be provided on a double green light basis. This means where both the Commonwealth and the relevant state and territory health authorities agree, students from mainland China have a pathway to return to Australia and continue their studies. We will continue to consider developments in China and advice from the committee as they meet and review health and travel arrangements on an ongoing basis.

               the government decided it remained necessary to continue the travel ban restrictions on foreign nationals entering Australia for a further week to 29 February. This means that for a further week foreign nationals, excluding permanent residents, who have been in mainland China will not be allowed to enter Australia for 14 days from the time they left mainland China. The extension of exemptions to year 11 and 12 students will not substantially change these arrangements. Australian citizens and permanent residents will still be able to enter, as will their immediate family members. We continue to require Australian citizens, permanent residents and their families who have been in mainland China from 1 February 2020 and who returned to Australia to self-isolate for 14 days from the time they left mainland China. Again, our No. 1 priority as a government is protecting Australia and Australians.
