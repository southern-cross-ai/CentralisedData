        , Senator Wong. I refer to Senator Wong's reply to Senator Cormann, where she said that pollution is free. Does she therefore believe that coal is free, fuel is free and power is free? Additionally, I refer to the Prime Minister's comments that a carbon tax will not increase the prices for families, trades and small businesses.

          I refer to the Prime Minister's comments yesterday that the carbon tax will not increase petrol prices for families, tradies and small businesses. Can the minister confirm that the electricity that oil refineries and service stations use will be exempt from the carbon tax? If not, won't the carbon taxes applied to these sectors increase the petrol price in contravention of the Prime Minister's promise?

           I will seek to answer the parts of that question I can. I will answer what I think was the first part of the question. The question related to pollution being free. I think the economic point is that unless you price pollution there is no incentive to reduce it. It is a very simple economic point: unless you price pollution there is no incentive to reduce it. Currently there is no incentive—

             I was making the point about price signals that as long as pollution is free there is no incentive to reduce it. I think that is, frankly, self-evident. The whole reason that you put a price on pollution is to give a price signal incentive to business to reduce its pollution and to look to find lower-polluting ways of doing business and to give an incentive to invest in clean energy and in cleaner technologies. We are a very highly carbon-intensive economy. That is as a result of the nature of our economy. That means we have to transition if we agree that we have to reduce pollution. As I recall it, the opposition agree on that.

                I was making a point about why we want to try to give an incentive to business to reduce its pollution and to invest in clean energy, cleaner ways of doing business and cleaner goods and services. In relation to price impacts the government has been clear: there is a price impact once you price something that is currently free. That is obvious. The question is: how do you do it, and how do you ensure that you assist Australian households? How do you ensure that you look to lower-income families and how do you provide tax cuts and increases in payments to recognise that price impact? We are up-front about that, Senator Joyce, unlike you who are imposing a tax on Australian families to fund your direct action policy.

Will the government claim an exemption for farmers or will they pay a higher price for diesel under the carbon tax? Will you or won't you be exempting diesel for farmers?

                     It is unsurprising that Senator Joyce is embarrassed by his policy and embarrassed by the reminder that he also is in a party that supports a five per cent reduction by 2020. The only difference is that their policy will cost taxpayers money and will cost the budget money. Senator Joyce, this is some $30 billion out to 2020 to make a five per cent reduction. I would be interested to know from Senator Joyce whether farmers will be exempt from spending cuts or tax hikes to fund that policy.

                      , I have a further supplementary question. Can the minister confirm whether interstate truck companies, which I know Senator Sterle will be very interested in, will pay a higher price for diesel under the carbon tax by reducing the fuel excise rebate they claim? How large will a transport company need to be before they are up for a higher diesel price under the carbon tax?
