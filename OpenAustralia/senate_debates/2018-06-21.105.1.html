A key part of the investment that we are making is an innovative partnership with the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, and it is $443.3 million.

                      As I was saying, the foundation will deliver funds to range of partners experienced in delivering reef protection activities, as well as driving new capacity and partnerships for the reef. We have a productive relationship with the foundation. They have demonstrated their ability to deliver benefits for the reef and manage government funding appropriately through previous reef projects.

                        Minister, this matter was canvassed at Senate estimates. Part of the rationale that was explained was that there was a private organisation that was able to leverage business connections to raise more funds for reef research. Can you now tell the Senate how much private funding this private federation has raised to date? What percentage of the $443 million does that represent?

                         You would know that is now a matter that goes directly to the grant, which is actually administered by another portfolio. I understand that you don't like this foundation. You do not like the fact that the government is in partnership with the foundation, but at the end of the day a robust grant agreement setting out the terms of the partnership arrangement is being negotiated by the foundation. The grant agreement will be made consistent with the Commonwealth Grants Rules and Guidelines and the requirements of the Public Governance, Performance and

                            . Those on this side of the chamber are very proud of our record investment in the Great Barrier Reef. This foundation has already proven itself. They have demonstrated their ability to deliver benefits for the reef and manage government funding appropriately through previous reef projects. They have a track record in relation to the Great Barrier Reef.
