         I think it is appropriate at this time to get a few questions on the record. Minister, would it be the case that, through the bill that we are currently dealing with, there would be the possibility to move on this? I note the concern of Senator Xenophon that there should be the capacity to deal with issues such as gambling, especially the use of poker machines, at federal airports.

           have a choice! I think it is important to get this on the record. Is there the capacity with bills such as these, especially this bill now that it is open for debate, for us to deal with Senator Xenophon’s concern about poker machines? So do we have the capacity to deal with it in bills such as this in a decisive way so as to not allow them?

            There is nothing, as the opposition would know, that is in the act directly relating to that. But there is the potential that it can be dealt with by regulation, so it can be dealt with within the framework of the legislation.

                As you will recall, I indicated that we would come back to Senator Xenophon in relation to that matter, so we might have to wait for the process to run its course.

                 Obviously we would have to open up the act in some way, shape or form. Do you envisage such a process as something likely to be before the parliament in the near future, so we can deal with such an issue? Otherwise this issue today would be the area to deal with it, wouldn’t it?

                  It is a rather circular argument that is now being put. It is hypothetical in two respects: (1) it seeks to ask questions about something which has not yet occurred and (2) it seeks to elicit information about something that has still not occurred. I talked about this clearly in the beginning. It is probably worth going back to it so there is no confusion about this. Senator Xenophon had raised concerns about the use of airport land for gambling. The opposition similarly have that concern, judging by the questions that are being asked by the opposition. The government has undertaken to ensure that ongoing reforms are strengthened and reformed gaming laws include consideration of airport land. We will come back to that. That is, again, a future process.

                     If an amendment that precluded gambling at airports were moved and passed today, that would solve that problem, wouldn’t it? It would solve the issue of not allowing gambling at airports.

                       I am genuinely grateful for Senator Joyce’s line of questioning in relation to this—because it is important to raise this issue—and for the minister’s responses. The concern I have—and I have raised it with the state Minister for Gambling in

                       —is the extent to which state laws apply on federal land. There are some grandfathered clauses, and the minister is quite right in terms of regulations prohibiting any more gambling venues, but I am concerned about the extent to which state regulations would apply to protect problem gamblers. My complaint has always been that I think state regulations nationally should go much further. That is why I think it is important that there is a federal approach in relation to this. But the fact that the government is actively looking at this to ensure that there is no ambiguity about the applicability of current state laws in relation to the protection of problem gamblers on federal land is welcome. I think at the moment that the approach is to the extent possible, but I think that ambiguity should be removed in the context of airport land. I am genuinely grateful to Senator Joyce for raising this issue. As I understand it, within about two months—by February at least—the minister’s office will be able to report back on this. I am quite happy with that undertaking. In a more relevant sense in terms of process, as I understand it the ministerial council, at a

                       level, is looking at this issue as well. So it is just a case of getting an update and ensuring that this is still very much on the agenda.
