       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are all witnessing the devastation the current drought has caused.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is the worst drought on record.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At present, more than 44 per cent of the country’s agricultural land has been

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EC" rel="nofollow">
         EC
        </a>
        ) declared.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That covers 63 regions, and a further 4 areas are currently being assessed for EC declarations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you pause to think about this, you will realise that several European nations could fit into an area that size.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some regions are heading into their sixth consecutive year of drought, and more and more farm families are having trouble making ends meet.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To help farmers, small business operators and communities cope with deteriorating conditions, late last year the Australian government announced additional assistance measures and made existing measures easier to access.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These measures included:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         an extension of financial assistance to 2008;
        </li>
        <li>
         funding for social, emotional and financial counselling;
        </li>
        <li>
         assistance for farmers to get professional advice to manage during drought;
        </li>
        <li>
         funding for the Country Women’s Association to provide emergency family and community grants;
        </li>
        <li>
         The introduction of drought assistance mobile service units; EC interest rate subsidies and EC relief payments for agriculturally-dependent small business operators;
        </li>
        <li>
         changes to the eligibility requirements for EC Interest Rate Subsidies;
        </li>
        <li>
         an increase to the cap for EC Interest Rate Subsidies; and
        </li>
        <li>
         an increase to the cap and non-primary production income test for the Farm Management Deposits Scheme.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Since 2001 we have provided over $1.3 billion in assistance  and we have committed a further $900 million in assistance until 2008.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Now eligible small business operators will be able to access the same support that is already provided to farmers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Farm Household Support Amendment Bill 2007 (the bill) will let agriculturally-dependent small business operators access EC Relief Payments and access ancillary benefits, such as a health care card and concessions under the youth allowance and Austudy means test.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill gives effect to the current ex-gratia arrangements for small business income support, and changes legislation so that eligible small business operators can access the ancillary benefits.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to note that not all small business operators in rural areas are eligible to access EC assistance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A small business operator must be able to demonstrate that 70 per cent of their gross business income is derived from providing goods and services for the purposes of farming.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill outlines all the eligibility criteria that will determine whether a small business can access EC Relief Payments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We expect the criteria will make sure assistance is provided to the small business operators most affected by the drought.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is aware that there are small business operators who can also be considered farmers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Due to the extended nature of this drought, it is beginning to affect this group of people’s ability to make a living from their small businesses and their farm enterprises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the current eligibility criteria for EC Relief Payments, these small business operators may not be eligible for assistance as a farmer, as their off-farm income is too high.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Nor may they be eligible for assistance as a small business operator, as their farm assets may rule them out.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will give support to  small business operators who meet both the small business and farmer qualifications, except that they do not derive significant income from the farm.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Specified farm assets and small business assets will be exempt from their assessment for assistance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will also give effect to two other pieces of legislation:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Social Security Act
         </a>
         1991 (the social security act); and
        </li>
        <li>
         The Age Discrimination Act 2004 (the age discrimination act).
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Changes to the social security act will let eligible small business operators access concessions under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Allowance" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Allowance
        </a>
        and Austudy means tests that are already available for farmers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under these concessions, assets that are exempt in the Farm Household Support Act 1992 (the Farm Household Support Act) will also be considered exempt if a small business operator receiving EC Relief Payments applies for Youth Allowance or Austudy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Both The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, and the Minister for Education, Science and Training, have agreed on these changes to the Social Security Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill also brings into effect a section in the Farm Household support act that outlines that the rate of EC Relief Payments for small business operators is the same as that for farmers – and it is dependent on age.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The attorney-general has provided exemptions under the age discrimination act that let the rate of EC relief payments, for both small business operators, and farmers be calculated according to their age.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill makes a number of other changes to the Farm Household Support Act, to bring it into line with the Age discrimination Act.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sections under the Farm Household Support Act that have age qualifications that don’t already have exemptions under the Age Discrimination Act,  will be removed when the bill is passed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Conclusion
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to reiterate that the Australian Government has a strong record of providing assistance to the agriculture sector to manage the impacts of drought in rural and regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And we remain committed to providing help whenever and wherever it is needed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have been out to these drought-affected areas In recent months and I can confirm that I have never seen a drought that is so harsh and so far-reaching.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I know that the prime minister has also seen how bad it is first-hand.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to thank the farmers, small business operators, community and industry groups who have all contributed to the success of the Australian Government’s drought assistance measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My thanks also go to the Ministers and government agencies that have swiftly implemented the drought assistance measures announced in October and November 2006.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of this bill will ensure that our drought assistance can reach those most in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.
