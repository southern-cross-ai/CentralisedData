        My question is to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Government Service Delivery in relation to the nation-building economic stimulus plan, Senator Arbib. Could the minister advise the Senate on how the economic stimulus plan is progressing around the country, in particular how stimulus infrastructure is rolling out? Isn’t it the case that the construction of schools, social housing, community infrastructure and road and rail upgrades is underway across the country? Can the minister advise the Senate on how the states, territories, local government and block grants authorities are working with the Commonwealth to deliver the stimulus?

         I thank Senator Sterle for his question. I know that as a senator from

         he is very concerned and interested in infrastructure and a big supporter of the government’s Nation Building and Jobs Plan.

         inform the Senate that our infrastructure plans are well underway and kicking in, supporting jobs and small businesses across the country. As senators know, 70 per cent of the stimulus package is in infrastructure. Over the next 12 months some 35,000 projects will get underway. Senators might be surprised to hear that after five months we are actually completing projects. In Queensland we have been notified that the first

        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Sterle asked about the effect on jobs. Let me tell you about the effect on small business. I have the contractors list from Evans Harch, the company that was building this project. Guess where the plant excavators came from: Mooloolaba Beach. Guess where the concreters came from: Yandina. Guess where the roofers came from: Nambour. Guess where the plumbers came from: Mooloolaba. The plasterers came from Maroochydore; the electricians from Nambour. The waterproofing? Noosa. The glazing? Maroochydore. All local jobs!

            , I thank the minister for his answer and I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister advise the Senate on the positive impact stimulus construction projects are having on Australian construction jobs? Is the minister aware of what builders and tradespeople, the people on the ground, are saying about the stimulus package? Isn’t it the case that there are people across the country in jobs right now who would have been out of work without the government’s early and decisive action? Can the minister outline for the Senate what the impact on Australian jobs would have been had the Rudd government waited to act?

                  I thank the minister for those examples.

                  , I ask a further supplementary question for the minister. Can the minister advise the Senate on the impact the stimulus is having on small business? Can the minister provide the Senate with any views of small businesses who are actually delivering the stimulus and employing people to do so? In particular, is the minister aware of any examples from the insulation industry, which I understand has seen significant benefits from the Rudd government’s Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan?

I know they oppose the Jobs Fund, which is part of the stimulus. But as the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
