        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Payne. At the Senate committee hearing on Tuesday night, the interim

        </a>

         DCNS
        </a>
        , Brent Clark, said that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
         ASC
        </a>
        would have no role in building Future Submarines. Can the minister confirm that this is the case, despite DCNS proposing a range of options for ASC during the competitive evaluation process for the Australian Future Submarine project? If so, when did the government decide on an option that meant ASC would have no role in the build of Future Submarines, and why has the government withheld this information from South Australians?

         I thank Senator Gallacher for the opportunity to reaffirm the government's decision to build 12 Future Submarines in Adelaide. It is a historic decision. It is a nation-building decision. It will deliver the capability that our Navy needs and it will create thousands of Australian jobs. In fact, it will create over 1,100 direct jobs and 1,700 indirect jobs in addition to the thousands of other jobs which will be created through our surface shipbuilding program as well. Every single decision that this government has taken in relation to naval acquisition, from the Future Submarines to the surface ships, is about ensuring we have a sovereign naval shipbuilding industry in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, that stands in distinct contrast,

                 I can understand why those opposite do not want to hear about this. It is because they do not want to hear about their own record. But let me be very clear. These Future Submarines, 12 of them, will be built in Adelaide with an Australian workforce that will build on the existing submarine workforce in
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">
                  ASC
                 </a>
                 —of course it will. The submarine workforce in Adelaide, which is currently resident in ASC, will have to grow to ensure that Australia can continue to sustain the Collins class submarine and build the Future Submarine fleet. So, as I said, let me be absolutely clear: because of the decisions that the Turnbull government has made, the submarine workforce in Adelaide will grow. The Future Submarine program will create 1,100 direct jobs and 1,700 indirect jobs, and that will be building on the ASC workforce itself.

The workforce that is required for ASC for the continuation of Collins class sustainment has not changed. We will be building on the submarine workforce in Adelaide because we have to build on the submarine workforce in Adelaide to sustain the Collins class submarine and to build the Future Submarine. We have ensured that

                       for the committee hearings, so I have not actually been able to read the evidence. That is not available at this point. But let me be very clear, again. The government's decisions in relation to the Future Submarine are going to grow the submarine workforce in this country. There is no change to that view. There is no change to that direction. It is an absolute commitment: 1,100 direct jobs, 1,700 indirect jobs and more beyond that in global supply chains and Australian supply chains, right across the submarine build and right across the surface ship build. But, if I were in the position that those opposite find themselves in, I would not want to hear about this—because if you made no decisions, if you made no effort to ensure you preserved a workforce that could build ships in Australia to the degree that those opposite insist was apparently the case, if you did nothing, if your output was zero—
