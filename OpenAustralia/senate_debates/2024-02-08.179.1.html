        The greatest victim of COVID-19 was not the many Australians who, sadly, lost their lives to this man-made virus that Australia helped develop. It was not the many thousands of Australians who, sadly, died from injections and jabs that are proving to be the crime of the century; the greatest victim was public health. Confidence in public health is at an all-time low. Childhood vaccination rates are plummeting. Parents are choosing not to engage with the childcare system and, increasingly, the education system to protect their children from public health.

        The nation's health survey was released over Christmas, and I thank

        for this report, which acts as a second opinion on the performance of our health officials. It's one the health officials will not enjoy reading. Let me share some of the findings with you:

        Today … Australians are at significant risk of dying young or living with preventable chronic diseases, with two thirds of us being overweight or obese.

       <p>
        More troubling for our health bureaucrats is that so few respondents were interested in doing anything about it, choosing instead to sit in front of a computer or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        screen for more than eight hours a day, shun exercise and eat junk food. News Limited have taken up the challenge of equipping their readers with simple advice to improve their health. Isn't that our health authorities' job? Remember

        ? Overweight Norm and his family, which started in 1979 and went into hibernation until recently, as it turns out. Public health is supposed to be about preventative medicine, encouraging people to get into life, get into some exercise and fresh air, and interact with others in a sporting, outdoor or otherwise active context. It's great advice—advice that saves the taxpayer money, correcting conditions that are self-inflicted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saying obesity is self-inflicted will earn you the ire of the woke brigade, who call that 'fat shaming'. Someone has to. According to the study, Queensland is the third-fattest state in the nation, with 33 per cent of people identifying as obese. That's one-third. This data is for Australians generally. It does not include the increase in youth depression and suicide that resulted from our failed COVID response and fear campaign. Sedentary lifestyles lead to chronic diseases and illnesses, including cancer, heart disease, diabetes and dementia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This afternoon I plan to speak about the 13 per cent increase in Australian mortality. Those deaths occurred largely in the areas of cancer, heart disease, diabetes and dementia. Many, including myself, are blaming the increase in unexplained deaths in Australia on the COVID-19 injections. Many of those are. Yet other reasons may be brought to light in a COVID royal commission that we need. One of those will be the failure of our health authorities to follow the most simple and fundamental pieces of health advice: preventative medicine.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyday Australians were advised to isolate from others and stay inside away from the sun, yet sunshine is a common natural treatment for COVID. The advice to stay out of the sun is the opposite of the advice that should have been provided. We knew right through COVID that those who were obese were the group most at-risk for an adverse reaction to COVID-19. Where was the advice to eat healthy, exercise and lose weight? Nothing. The only advice was to be afraid, be terrified, so as to force a fear-based level of obedience in a country that had always used a mate's approach to health, like

        At the same time, our health bureaucrats have acted to protect their friends in the quit-smoking industry through this recent ban on vapes. They're protecting the quit-smoking industry, not smokers. One million Australians use a vape, many of whom use it to quit smoking. Australia's smoking rate is higher than in countries with laws that allow vaping. Vaping stops smoking. Britain's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_Service" rel="nofollow">
         National Health Service
        </a>
        advocate vaping as a quit-smoking medium, and our health authorities ban it. Why do they do that?
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2024 public health has changed direction. Preventative health has turned into restorative health. Our health industry is now standing, figuratively, on every street corner hawking the latest drug to correct the very conditions that their failures in public health have made worse. How has this come about? How is this allowed to continue? These are my questions to government and to the media. Will you please start asking those questions?
