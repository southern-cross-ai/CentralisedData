        (3) If the answer to paragraph (1) above is no and the answer to paragraph (2) above is yes, what will the Minister do about these activities.

         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The guidelines developed by Rio Tinto Iron Ore and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodside_Energy" rel="nofollow">
          Woodside Energy

          Burrup Peninsula
         </a>
         r) national heritage listed place were self-imposed and not a requirement of government. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         is not aware of Holcim Australia having any commitments or guidelines similar to those used by Rio Tinto Iron Ore and Woodside Energy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         However, it is an offence under the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">

         for a person to take an action that has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the Indigenous heritage values of a National Heritage Place. If the companyâ€™s explosions are having, will have or are likely to have a significant impact on the values of the National Heritage Place they would be required to refer their activities for assessment under the Act.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The department did receive a report of a scree slope that collapsed some two kilometres from the quarry but the department has no evidence of a connection between that slope collapse and explosions at the Holcim quarry. However, departmental officials will be meeting with Holcim Australia in coming weeks to discuss managing quarry activities to ensure the conservation of adjacent national heritage values.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Please refer to the answer to question (2).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) My powers are predicated on actions that are likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance.
