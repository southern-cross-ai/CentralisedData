        One of the key functions of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is to ensure the accountability and transparency of public administration and expenditure in the Commonwealth. Accordingly, examining the efficiency and effectiveness of the administration of government programs directly ties into the statutory responsibilities and interests of the committee. This report is presented to the parliament pursuant to section 8(1) of the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951 and details the committee's findings from the inquiry into the following Auditor General's reports 2018-19:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <i>
         Efficiency of the processing of applications for citizenship by conferral
        </i>
       </ul>

        The purpose of this inquiry was to examine the efficiency and effectiveness of the administration of a range of government programs across a variety of subject matters and Commonwealth agencies. The committee identified several common themes across the seven Auditor-General's reports which were examined, including the importance of strong governance structures, the effective measurement and management of program performance, and appropriate stakeholder engagement. These elements are critical to the success of all government programs, and the committee's findings are relevant to all government agencies undertaking program management on behalf of the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        In examining the operations of these programs, the Committee has made 11 recommendations to agencies, including:
       </p>

       <ul>

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        On behalf of the chair, I would like to acknowledge the work of the committee secretariat, and like all committee secretariats, we receive fantastic support and I particularly want to point out the support that we receive on this committee. We are often dealing with such varied subjects, and there is never anything—no subject and no issue—that they are not willing to take on. So I particularly thank the secretariat of this committee for this inquiry. I thank the other members of the committee for their cooperation in producing this bipartisan report. I commend the report to the Senate.
