        My question is to the Minister representing that very popular and effective Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Regional Development, Senator McKenzie. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Liberal-National government's investment in key freight and tourism corridors will drive economic growth for the nation?

         Thank you very much for the question, Senator O'Sullivan. I recognise your longstanding interest in this area. Under the economic stewardship of the coalition, the economy has grown by 3.4 per cent through the past year. That is the best since the mining boom, and the peak of the mining boom in 2005. With it comes better jobs, and the Liberal-National party have created more than one million jobs in five years. However, we recognise that there is more to do. Good economic management helps small businesses grow. Small businesses are those great employees, those wonderful businesses that get behind our nation and our regions. That's why we're investing in inland rail to take advantage of our new trade opportunities, like those that will be created under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
          TPP
         </a>
         -11. The 1,700-kilometre rail line is set to deliver jobs, cash flow and new export earnings for regional Australia. As the Prime Minister said yesterday, 'We're in the business of making small businesses—small family businesses—larger businesses.' Inland rail will help regional businesses to link up with our export markets and allow their high-quality products to reach far across the globe. By growing our economy through the trade deals and backing regional businesses, we're growing the economy and creating even more jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         But we're not just stopping at rail. I note that Senator Canavan mentioned earlier a $3.5 billion commitment to Roads of Strategic Importance. It's an important component of our $75 billion infrastructure investment pipeline. This program is supporting improvements in key corridors throughout key regional freight and visitor economy routes and better connecting communities.

            -National government is committed to growing our regions and creating jobs, because when the regions thrive so does Australia. Through Roads of Strategic Importance, $1.5 billion was earmarked for key corridors across northern Australia to improve road reliability and connectivity across the supply chains for key agricultural and mining regions and to better connect communities. This investment will support major freight movements and better connect businesses to markets and export facilities. It will underpin the expansion of key local industries by building capacity and improving access and safety on these key roads. The initiative supports sustainable employment and skills development by providing ongoing opportunities and would provide certainty for businesses operating right across the north. Priorities funded through the northern Australia Roads of Strategic Importance will build on the important upgrades already progressing under the $600 million

               I think it's always best to share, so let's share what the risks to our job-creating plan may be, and—no surprise—it is those opposite. While the government's action plan will promote strong investment, more jobs and higher wages, Labor just wants to tax you more. Bill Shorten's five-point plan is simple: more tax, more tax, more tax, more tax and more tax. More tax doesn't grow the economy. It doesn't guarantee schools, hospitals or Medicare. It drags the economy down, taking more of what Australians earn away from them and their families. It doesn't allow investment in key tourism and freight corridors that allow Australian businesses to export their high quality produce to the world. It doesn't allow Australians to get ahead and build a better life for themselves and their families. Labor has no plan for a stronger regional Australia.
