             Senator Marshall is very well qualified to be our Deputy President, having been a Temporary
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chairman_of_Committees" rel="nofollow">
              Chairman of Committees
             </a>
             in the Senate since 2003. He has also served on several committees involved in the management of this place, including the House Committee and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
              Standing Committee
             </a>
             on Appropriations and Staffing, which are good committees to be on to get an understanding of the mysteries of the operational management of the Department of the Senate and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
              Parliament House
             </a>
             . He has also served as a chairman of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, enduring my questioning for hours on end and with the patience of Job.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Marshall is a senator who respects the traditions and practices of this place and is very well qualified to undertake this new task. Though, I must say, in all the years I have been fortunate enough to be a senator, I have never had the least desire, with no disrespect, to sit between the clerks at the table, dealing with amendments and amendments to amendments that fall to the Chairman of Committees. It takes a certain skill, patience and procedural knowledge, and I envy those senators who undertake that task well. I am sure Senator Marshall will.

              . Senator Marshall and I were elected to this place in the same election along with Senator Moore and others, and it is very pleasing for me to see that he has been elected as our Deputy President. Not only has Senator Marshall demonstrated his regard for the traditions and conventions of this chamber in the time he has been here; those who have worked with him would, regardless of their political affiliation, attest to his interest in procedure and capacity to manage debate both in this chamber and in Senate committees effectively and fairly.
             </p>
             <p>
              We are confident on this side of the chamber, and I am pleased that it is shared, that he will bring not only this expertise to the important role of Deputy President and Chairman of Committees but also a regard, as Senator Abetz said, for the traditions and conventions of this Senate which are so important to Australian democracy.
