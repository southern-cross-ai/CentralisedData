        This year, the Australian people will go to a referendum on enshrining an Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        Voice in our Constitution.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
         The Constitution
        </a>
        holds part of the story of Australia, and it's time that our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are included in that story—better yet, that they be given a voice in the Constitution to tell their own Australian story.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         The Voice
        </a>
        is an extraordinary opportunity, a genuine path towards improving the lives of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It's a proposal that has been put to us, the Australian people, and to this parliament by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and leaders themselves. It emerged from a series of regional constitutional conventions held across the country and one of the most extensive dialogues on our constitution since Federation. It culminated in a national convention at Uluru in May 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since that day, the Uluru statement has travelled the length and breadth of this country. Many hundreds of people from all walks of life have signed their names to the statement. Despite the claim of some within this chamber, the voice continues to receive over 80 per cent support amongst Indigenous communities. This support is shared amongst the broader Australian people. The statement of intent signed by our state and territory first ministers is just the most recent indication of the broad consensus that is building across the country in support of the voice. Essential polling has revealed that over 65 per cent of Australians continue to support the voice. This support has remained steady over recent years. This is because the communities we represent are ready for change.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have a great amount of faith in the Australian people and in their generosity and goodwill. This is a great country, but we can make it better with a successful referendum. We all want to find peace, honesty and justice in our history. We all want to prosper in a more united nation, a nation in which all Australians can see themselves reflected, a nation where all are respected from the uniqueness of the contributions they have made to this country from their own social and cultural frameworks. Australians know that, when Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have a say in the laws and policies that affect them, when people on the ground are listened to and engaged, better laws, policies and strategies are made.
       </p>
       <p>
        The voice is about making our work here in the chamber more responsive, accurate, informed and, hopefully, more collegiate in the future. The voice will improve the work of parliament and its integrity. I must say with confidence that many senators in this chamber have at one time or another benefited immensely from the advice and wisdom of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders. This is what the voice is about—genuine exchange, the sharing of knowledge and wisdom, and mutual respect. This provision, promoted by the Prime Minister at Garma last year, will give recognition to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in the Constitution and provide a guaranteed way for their voice to be heard in this place and the other place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The voice will be chosen by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        peoples based on the wishes of their local communities. It will be representative of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. It will be empowering, community-led, inclusive, respectful, culturally informed and gender based, and it will include youth. Importantly, it will be accountable and transparent, and it will work alongside existing organisations and traditional structures. These principles agreed by the working group have been out there in the public space for more than four months now, and the working group and the government may have more to say on the architecture of the voice before Australians vote later this year. Some of these matters are under consideration by the working group.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Attorney-General for their attendance at the last working group meeting and Senator Bragg for his continued in-principle support for the voice. Many detailed matters can be worked out subsequent to a referendum. There will be and there has already been a significant amount of misinformation in the debate about the voice, and I ask that each of you embrace what is fact and reject what is fiction. This is our duty as senators and as elected representatives of the people of this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a senator, I can say unequivocally that parliament will retain its supremacy and it will be unencumbered in its lawmaking functions. As an Aboriginal man and traditional owner, I can also say unequivocally that the voice will not cede sovereignty nor curtail future efforts towards agreement-making and truth-telling. Constitutional experts have consistently confirmed this, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Eight" rel="nofollow">
         Group of Eight
        </a>
        constitutional lawyers advising the working group. In advice published last week, all members of the expert groups agreed draft provisions would not affect the sovereignty of any group or body. In fact, the voice will strengthen and reinforce the recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We must not lose sight of this as the first step in improving our relationship with the first peoples of this country. We are at the beginning of a new journey. This journey will make us face the consequences of colonisation and settlement, and its destination will be a more united and unified nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The upcoming referendum is an extraordinary moment for our country. Every vote will count. We must grasp this moment and take our nation forward. Many of those who have walked along this long road for reform and who signed their names to the Uluru Statement have already left us, and some far too early. I urge everyone to open their hearts, to imagine an Australia that supports Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to have a say over matters that affect them, and to have that voice enshrined in the constitution. In doing so, it will help us to be a prouder nation, and I hope to walk with you all later in this year as we go towards yes.
