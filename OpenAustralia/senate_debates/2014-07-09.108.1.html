        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Senator Johnston. Will the minister inform the Senate about the coalition's commitment to build the roads of the 21st century and how the budget delivers on those promises? How will investing in such infrastructure ensure that our regions and our nation remain strong and continue to prosper?

         I thank Senator O'Sullivan for his longstanding interests in infrastructure, particularly regional infrastructure. I am delighted to report to the Senate and especially to our new crossbench colleagues that this government's commitment to infrastructure is very strong and ever-continuing, and seeks to progress our great nation. The government has committed a record $50 billion to the infrastructure spend in this year's budget. Delivering modern infrastructure is a crucial part of the government's economic action strategy. The coalition has increased overall infrastructure spending by $16.4 billion between 2013-14 and 2018-19. Included in our budget is $11.6 billion for an infrastructure growth package for new infrastructure spending. Entirely new projects that were not funded by the previous Labor government will now be possible. These include the building of the

           The government are committed to working with regions to create dynamic, stable, secure and viable economies across Australia. We are providing $1 billion over five years to our new National Stronger Regions Fund, which will invest in priority infrastructure for all our regional and rural communities, will support the livability in those communities and will drive their economic growth programs. It will make regional and rural communities a place where more people will choose to live and the removal of the carbon tax will assist this objective even further.

             I thank the senator for the question. The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill is currently before the Senate. We are moving to deliver the infrastructure that Australia critically needs, which will build the vital road and rail projects to improve efficiency, boost productivity and drive the economy forward. This bill is a key component of that objective.
            </p>
            <p>
             Amendments to this bill are critically required to continue the Roads to Recovery program beyond 30 June just gone. Currently, our five-year funding extension of the Roads to Recovery program is at risk of being blocked in the Senate. There is a lot of much-needed work on our local roads and streets. Our communities desperately need the continued vital investment of our Roads to Recovery program. But the Labor Party thumb their nose at those needs.

              My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Can the minister confirm that, under current bulk-billing arrangements, a medical practice in a regional area receives a higher bulk-billing incentive than in a metropolitan area? And can the minister confirm that under the government's budget savings measure this higher incentive for

                , I rise on a point of order: on relevance. This minister, when asked a direct question, has a habit of saying, 'Those opposite are aware of a range of changes.' That is not the point of question time. She has been asked a very specific question about the higher bulk-billing incentive for doctors in regional areas and whether the budget has removed that. She should answer the question and, under standing orders, she is required to be directly relevant.

                      , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of comments by the President of the Rural Doctors Association, Dr Ian Kamerman, that doctors who waive the co-payment will be hit by a further cut in the Medicare payment for these consultations, further eroding what are, in many cases, rural practices that are already only marginally financially viable? Is the Rural Doctors Association correct?

                       Yes, I am aware of those comments by Dr Kamerman. It will be a matter for clinicians as to whether or not they choose to charge the co-payment. Clearly we will not able to determine the impact on individual practices until it is determined whether or not a co-payment will be charged.
