         NGHAM (—) (): I thank Senator Scarr for his question. I note his interest in relation to the impacts on the tourism industry in his state of Queensland and that of many, many colleagues who have engaged in relation to the challenges that our tourism industry is facing as a result of the combined effects of the bushfire crises that we've faced over the summer and the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on travel—globally but in particular from the crucial market of China.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia's visitation from China is the most significant of all of our international markets. In terms of expenditure, Chinese markets contributed to around 10 per cent of total visitor spend in Australia as part of our tourism industry over the last year. A significant part of that relates to the international education sector, but it also relates to all other aspects of the visitor economy—tourism travel, in groups or individually, and those travelling for business and event purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the coronavirus, it's important to note that this downturn that we're feeling began prior to decisions that we made in relation to border security aspects for Australia.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese" rel="nofollow">
          The Chinese
         </a>
         government had already made decisions to suspend group-tour travel and had already cautioned its citizens against undertaking unnecessary international travel. We have engaged deeply with Australian industry over these last couple of months, in responding to the bushfires and coronavirus. I pay credit to my colleague, Senator Duniam, who has worked closely in this space both with affected tourism businesses and with other China-trade-exposed businesses, such as the seafood sector, in terms of engagement there, as indeed have many others.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our visitation figures are coming off a significant high. In the September quarter, tourism figures showed record levels of tourism spend and visitation for Australia. That helps to provide resilience to the industry, but we certainly appreciate that these are tough times for many.

            Following consultation with industry right across the country, we announced a $76 million package to assist the Australian tourism industry to rebuild, to see it through these tough times. We recognise that, first and foremost, getting new bookings into businesses that have seen significant cancellations and sweeping downturns in bookings is essential. That's why we've stood up a domestic marketing initiative, something that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tourism_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Tourism Australia
            </a>
            has not undertaken for many, many years. We've stepped back into that space with a $20 million domestic marketing initiative, the Holiday Here This Year campaign, and that is a message I would encourage all Australians to heed and consider. Wherever it's possible to do so, think about making a booking. Just as Senator Cash was saying before, these people are open for business, and the best thing that Australians who want to help can do is to make a booking in a fire affected region and right across Australia's tourism industry. Make a booking and holiday here this year.

               The $76 million also includes support for international marketing, which is particularly important for bringing international media, travel trade and others to Australia and ensuring they can fully appreciate the extent to which the Australian tourism experience remains an incredible experience where people will have an amazing time and a positive experience. That's why we have started to use some of the major events hosted around Australia, such as the

               and the forthcoming Grand Prix in Melbourne, to make sure that there are positive messages about Australia still being open for business, as Senator Cash was saying. We're also making sure that there is informed and accurate information about the regeneration from bushfires that will take place throughout the year.

               This will be a long and intense effort, but the government is determined to stand by our tourism industry, to work closely with them, and to make sure that we protect the many Australian jobs that rely upon tourism.
