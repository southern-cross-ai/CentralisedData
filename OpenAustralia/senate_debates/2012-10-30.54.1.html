        program last night broadcast what those of us with a health background have known for some years, and that is that the threat to global health posed by superbugs and antibiotic resistance is a severe and urgent threat. In a few short years, minor infections and routine surgery could become life-threatening conditions. What is the government doing to prepare Australia for the worsening problem of resistance and to safeguard the future health of Australians?

         I thank Senator Di Natale for his continued interest in antimicrobial resistance—commonly known as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMR" rel="nofollow">
          AMR
         </a>
         —and drug resistant tuberculosis in Australia. The government is concerned about the emergence of organisms that are resistant to antibiotics and the implications they may have for healthcare delivery in the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         The importance of the effective and sensible use of antibiotics was highlighted in the ABC

         program, as mentioned by Senator Di Natale. The government is pursuing this goal through our investment in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Prescribing_Service" rel="nofollow">
          National Prescribing Service
         </a>
         , which provides independent advice on the quality and use of antibiotics. The Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare have taken the lead on this issue since 2006. The recent establishment of the Antimicrobial Resistance Subcommittee is a welcome partnership between experts and government and, as I understand it, the Minister for Health will be meeting with them on Wednesday to discuss this important issue. It is a matter that is certainly on the agenda for the health minister. The government remains committed. There is further work we can do in the region as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to recognise that antimicrobial resistance—AMR—to antibiotics does delay or prevent recovery from infection and limits antibiotic treatment options. That is why the government has taken these necessary steps to look at this issue.

         not raise the level of concern or alarm in the broader public, this is a matter that is and has been on the radar for some time. AMR has increased over time and it is regarded in the healthcare area—

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic_Resistance" rel="nofollow">
           Antibiotic Resistance
          </a>
          , known as JETACAR, was established to make recommendations to government on the threat of antimicrobial resistance. Can the government confirm that, over a decade later, most of the recommendations have still not been implemented and there is still no systematic collection of data on antibiotic use and on the prevalence of antibiotic resistant organisms in Australia?

           I thank Senator Di Natale for his question. The brief does not provide an explanation over the last report that he mentioned, which was some 10 years ago, so it would predate this government. As I mentioned in my answer to the primary question, there are two bodies which are clearly working on this issue—one is the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Healthcare, which has taken the lead on this issue since 2006, and the other is the recently established Antimicrobial Resistance Subcommittee—and the health minister certainly has this on her radar. I will take on notice the specific points that Senator Di Natale raised within the recommendations and see if the health minister can add further to the answer I have provided today.

             TB
            </a>

            islands of Boigu and Sabai were closed in favour of AusAID support to western

             Papua New Guinea

            for treatment programs. Has the government conducted any analysis of the threat to public health that the closure of these clinics represents and what it might mean for the likely incidence of drug-resistant TB in Australia?
