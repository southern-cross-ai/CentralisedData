        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Senator Evans. Given that schools are already struggling with rising power costs, can the minister explain how schools will meet additional costs from the government's carbon tax without the need to raise school fees or require increased assistance from state governments?

         I thank Senator Nash for her question. This is very similar to a set of questions that were asked last week which sought to make the accusation that universities would close, that public hospitals would close and that there would be terrible wreckage throughout the economy. I make the point to the senator—through you,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
          Mr President
         </a>
         —that the funding arrangements for schools and other publicly supported areas of the economy have formulas which allow for responding to increases in the costs of those sectors. The way that is measured varies across sectors and different indexes are used. Clearly any extra costs that are imposed on schools would be compensated in adjustments that were made in their funding measures.
        </p>
        <p>
         I point out that if Senator Nash and the opposition were genuinely interested in schools they would have supported our huge investment through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">
          BER
         </a>
         in every primary school in Australia. That is $16 billion of new facilities. It is interesting: there has been $16 billion of investment in every school in Australia, yet, despite opposing those things in this parliament, when they turn up at the openings there is no mention of their opposition.

Given that the minister does indeed know that my interest in education is entirely genuine, what guarantee can the minister provide to the Senate that schools, particularly those in regional Australia, will not be left behind should the states not meet increased costs with additional funding?

             The senator's genuine interest in education does not defend her asking a really quite inane question that is part of a political argument to again try to scare Australians. The reality is, as I explained to the senator, that the indexation arrangements will provide for any increased costs that schools incur. If the National Party were really interested in the imposition of electricity costs on schools, they would have a chat to governments like the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
              Western Australian
             </a>
             state government, which has put electricity prices up by over 50 per cent in the last three years without one cent of compensation to anybody. So for the coalition to come into the parliament and say, 'We're really concerned about compensation for an approximately seven per cent increase in electricity,' means that quite frankly they have no credibility. It is a silly, political tactic. Interest in schools means supporting serious investment in schools, which is what this government has done.

                  funds to help them build extra classrooms, extra libraries, extra school halls—extra facilities. So the schools you are talking about, Senator Nash, all have a BER project that provided facilities. There has been $16 billion of funding and you want to talk about the price of aviation fuel? Get serious, because quite frankly you are not behaving very seriously now.
