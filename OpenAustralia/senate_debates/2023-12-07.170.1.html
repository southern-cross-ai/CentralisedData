        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the 2017 Senate Environment and Communications References Committee Report:
        <i>
         Shark mitigation and deterrent measures
        </i>
        . The Australian Government thanks the Committee and those individuals and organisations which have contributed to the Inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Public safety is of paramount importance. It is the responsibility of state and territory governments to focus on public safety in their waters and managing the risks to humans from sharks. The Australian Government supports the states and territories through funding shark behavioural science and other research to implement measures that reduce risk of interactions between sharks and humans and minimise impacts to sharks and other marine life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        State and territory governments have initiated considerable investment in emerging technologies, integrated strategies, and public information campaigns to reduce the risk of interactions between humans and sharks and to minimise impacts on protected species. Both the Queensland and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        governments have released updated Shark Management Plans, in 2021 and 2022 respectively, which seek to further research into improved shark mitigation measures and to undertake community education.
       </p>

        The Australian Government is concerned about human lives lost to shark attack and is also actively engaged in shark conservation and continues to be committed to the protection of threatened and migratory species listed under the

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government recognises that state and territory governments remain committed to addressing issues of public safety and conservation of protected species. State and territory governments need to consider whether shark mitigation activities may have a significant impact on matters protected under national environmental law, and to refer activities to the Australian Government accordingly.

        The Queensland Government introduced a four-year Shark Management Plan in 2021, which includes ongoing research and trialling of new shark mitigation technologies and has committed to implement a new shark management plan after 2025. $5 million was provided to the Queensland Government to assist a transition to a non-lethal shark management program, and trial SMART drumlines within the

        The committee recommends that the Australian Government establish a review into the effectiveness of shark research and, following the review, commit to providing funding on a long-term basis for research areas that are considered likely to significantly contribute to improved knowledge about effective shark mitigation and deterrent measures.

       <p class="italic">
        Response: Noted
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government acknowledges that the safety of human life is of paramount importance and recognises that the states and territory governments have a responsibility to implement policies to protect the health and safety of people using their beaches and coastal waters. States and territories are already implementing a broad suite of measures to reduce the likelihood and occurrence of human-shark interactions. State and territory Governments invest in this area, with recent record investment for shark mitigation programs, including $85.6 million for the New South Wales Shark Management Program from 2022 to 2026.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        State and territory Governments currently implement research programs to understand the efficacy of non-lethal mitigation measures. Measures include non-invasive surveillance, increasing community engagement and funding surf lifesaving programs. The Australian Government acknowledges that over the past 10 years, there has been a noticeable shift away from relying solely on shark nets to using new technology such as Shark Management Alert in Real Time (SMART) drumlines and drones to detect, and safely move target shark species away from people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        States undertake trials to determine the efficacy of mitigation measures, with research showing certain mitigation measures may be highly effective in one state and not suitable in another. For example, the trial of SMART drumlines widely used and effective in New South Wales, was found not suitable for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian

        conditions. States and territories tend to apply different strategies to suit their needs, based on the different environments.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Relevantly to this recommendation, in 2016, research under the National Environmental Science Program (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NESP" rel="nofollow">
         NESP
        </a>
        ) found that states and territories were adequately funding and implementing shark mitigation research programs, and no further Australian Government funding was required at that time.
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Australian Government review the funding provided to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
         CSIRO

        to enable CSIRO to:

        undertake a social survey to determine how the behaviour of water users has changed in response to the recent human-shark interactions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee further recommends that the Australian Government seek advice from CSIRO as to whether research can be undertaken to address anecdotal evidence presented to the committee on the potential risk that certain ocean-based activities, such as the use of teaser baits in cage diving, crayfish pots and trophy hunting, might increase the risk of human-shark interactions. The Australian Government should review the funding provided for marine science research to enable CSIRO (or another research institution) to conduct the research CSIRO advises could be undertaken.

        The EPBC Act makes provisions for any person proposing to take an action that may trigger the EPBC Act to apply for a 'national interest' exemption under section 158 of the EPBC Act. There are no limitations on the number of times a person may apply for an exemption.

        Under section 158 of the EPBC Act, the Australian Government Minister for the Environment and Water may exempt a person proposing to take an action from the requirement to conduct an environmental assessment and/or obtain approval in relation to the action to which the exemption relates if the Minister is satisfied that it is in the national interest to do so. In determining the national interest, the Minister may consider Australia's defence or security or a national emergency, including an emergency to which a national emergency declaration (within the meaning of the
