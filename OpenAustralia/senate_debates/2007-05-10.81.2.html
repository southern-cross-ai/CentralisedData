        My question is to Senator Scullion, the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Can the minister confirm that, while the government will pay some carers a one-off bonus of $1,000, it is not giving the same amount to carers who are on the age pension? Is it not the case that carers on the age pension will instead receive a $600 bonus? Didn’t the Treasurer say in his budget speech that these payments were to ‘lend a helping hand to our carers’? Can the minister now explain why the government thinks some carers are worth $400 less of a helping hand than others?

         I thank the senator for the question. One of the things that has happened since the budget announcement, and something I think the senator should also reflect on, is the acclaim this government has received for recognising the huge efforts made by the carers of disabled Australians. They do an absolutely incredible job. We decided in this very generous budget that we would provide $1,000 to every carer who receives the carer payment and, in addition, $600 to every recipient of carer allowance. This has been very well received. This is a stand-alone incentive for carers who care for disabled Australians. I think it is a wonderful incentive. One needs to understand that it is completely separate from the range of other incentives, payments and pensions that we pay. Carers are in a very different position to a number of other individuals. It has been put to us that there are particular demographics that have not received similar sorts of payments. For example, people have said those on the disability pension perhaps need a one-off bonus. We have reflected on a particular special relationship, and the carer does have other costs associated specifically with looking after disabled people. The broad population of Australia have very much welcomed those payments, and I wish those on the other side would reflect on how important they are for carers.

          , I was going to make a point of order; the minister was in no way answering my question. But, given that he has now sat down, I will ask my supplementary question. I note for the minister’s benefit that Labor strongly support additional assistance for carers, as we have in previous budgets. Why aren’t elderly carers, who often care for their partner or family member with a disability, eligible for the same bonus as other carers? Why is the government discriminating against carers on the age pension?

          <p>
           The policy on this is very clear. It does not matter about the age of the carer; we have not discriminated against carers because of age. We have simply said that, if you are a carer, you are divided into two demographics: to a carer who receives the carer payment, we are giving a very generous bonus of $1,000; and those on a carer allowance will receive a bonus of $600. There is no differential with the age of the carer.

             I thank Senator Ferguson for a very important question. The men and women of Australia’s defence forces do a fantastic job for this country and they deserve the investment of a budget which will provide $14 billion over the next 10 years. This budget continues the solid investment in the Australian defence forces by the Howard government. This is the seventh budget in a row where the government has met or exceeded the 2000 Defence white paper funding commitment. That demonstrates a clear, ongoing commitment to the defence forces of this country. Indeed, since 1996, when this government was elected, the defence budget has increased by about 47 per cent—that equals around two per cent of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
              GDP
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             This increased funding has been targeted in a number of ways. Firstly, our men and women need the technology and the materiel to do the job that they do so well. We also need to target the recruitment and retention of personnel in the Australian defence forces. We have set a target of 57,000 personnel over the coming decade, and to do this we have announced an initiative in this budget of $2.1 billion over the next 10 years. This is phase 2 of what we announced last year, which involved around another $1 billion. We have announced integrated measures which will benefit our defence personnel greatly. Firstly, there is the new home loan assistance package with higher subsidies and greater choice to encourage homeownership and provide higher benefits as members serve for longer periods. That is an initiative of $864 million—one which goes directly to the welfare and the benefit of our defence personnel.
            </p>
            <p>
             As well as that, we have announced we will apply $71 million to an apprenticeship scheme so that people who join the ADF—young Australians aged 16 and 17—can commence an apprenticeship and then go on to serve in the ADF. We have also announced an investment in the professional development of the defence medical officers and also, importantly, an expansion and enhancement of the Defence Force cadet scheme, giving our young people across Australia the opportunity to enjoy the benefits that come with being a Defence Force cadet. That involves an initiative of around $100 million.
            </p>
            <p>
             We have announced other initiatives in that $2 billion-plus package to enhance the position of our ADF and to make it more attractive for people to join and serve in Australia’s defence forces. This is increasingly challenging in the current economic environment that we live in, where you have competitive labour markets in the private sector who offer great incentives. But we also announced in this budget the acquisition of 24 Block
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
              II
             </a>
             Super Hornet multirole aircraft at a cost of $6.6 billion over 13 years. That is an essential part of Australia’s air defence. We also announced funding of about $380 million to increase Australia’s defence intelligence and security capabilities. That is so vital in protecting Australia’s security and national interests in the war against terrorism. This is an outstanding budget for the Australian defence forces and demonstrates yet again the Howard government’s clear commitment to giving our men and women in Australia’s defence forces the investment they need to carry on doing such a great job.

              My question is to the Minister for Community Services, Senator Scullion. Is the minister aware of the many people with disabilities who have called talkback radio over the last two days expressing their anger at being overlooked in Tuesday’s budget? Is he aware of Leanne from Kilburn, who rang the ABC in Adelaide? She said: ‘I am really disappointed. The so-called budget for everyone ignores once again people on disability support pension. What are we? Are we nothing?’ Also, has the minister read the media release from the Gippsland Carers Association which starts with the sentence, ‘People with severe and profound dependent disabilities are the biggest losers in the Howard government budget spree’? Can the minister explain why, when we have a surplus of over $10 billion, there are no new measures in the budget for people with disabilities?

               I think the important point is that this government is absolutely committed to providing each and every Australian with the support that they need to be an active member of the community. This year’s budget has provided additional support for many Australians, such as seniors and carers, who in many ways are the fabric of Australia’s fair go and our Australian way of life. In recognition of the work that these individuals have done, the government has seen fit to provide, for the fourth consecutive year, a one-off payment of up to $1,000.

                , I rise on a point of order that goes to relevance. The minister was asked a question about people on disability support pension. He is seeking to read out his press release about carers and those on the age pension. My point of order should allow him time to find the right brief. I would ask you to draw his attention to the question about those people on disability support pension.

                 I hear what you say, Senator, but the minister is only 43 seconds into his answer. He still has nearly three minutes and 17 seconds left. Both some who answer questions and some who ask them sometimes take a bit longer than others to get to the point. I would remind Senator Scullion of the question and remind him that he has just over three minutes to complete his answer.

                  Additionally, this government set the single pension rate to at least 25 per cent of MTAWE. The single rate of pension has increased by $66.20 a fortnight. That is down to this government’s indexing, and that is $66.20 more than they would have received otherwise. These measures have significantly strengthened and protected the real incomes of pensioners. The Australian government has ensured that pensioners share in improved community living standards as measured by wages and are more than fully compensated for any price rises. The disability support pension is not taxable, whereas other pensions, including the age pension, and allowances are taxable.

                 <p>
                  Additionally, this budget committed to a range of additional measures for Australians with disabilities, including $39.8 million to provide an additional 1,480 vocational rehabilitation places and 987 places for the Disability Employment Network—another great incentive from an absolutely fantastic budget for some of our most disadvantaged Australians. There is $15.8 million to help highly disadvantaged members of society, including those Australians with mental illness and substance addiction. This investment will deliver an additional 2,000 multiple-barrier, intensive personal support places. That is an absolutely flexible incentive for this particular sector. There is $11.1 million over four years for improvements to mobility allowance to ensure that people working over 15 hours per week in a wage-assisted position will be eligible for the higher rate of mobility allowance of $104 per fortnight. There is $1.7 million to provide $300 training credits to people with disabilities who complete 150 hours of Work for the Dole. These are all magnificent incentives in the most recent budget to ensure that our disabled Australians are really looked after.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  There is $12 million to fund improvements to the highly successful National Disability Advocacy Program. There is $166 million to assist in the funding of up to 18,000 supported employment positions over the next four years. How can those on the other side come into this place and start questioning the government about our credentials on looking after disabled Australians? Our credentials are the very highest. And we have been able to provide that assistance because we run the very best economy that this country has ever seen.

                   , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that there is no new funding for the Commonwealth State/Territory Disability Agreement? Given the bipartisan recommendation of the Senate community affairs committee’s inquiry into the CSTDA to increase funding, what message does the government’s decision to ignore this funding send to people with disabilities?

                    I thank the senator for the supplementary question because I think it is time the Australian people and this parliament were informed about the Commonwealth state disability agreement. We all agree in Australia that there is a large amount of unmet need in this sector. We have said to the states and territories, who are fundamentally responsible for disability, to give us an indication of what this unmet need is, not just state it in big letters with a ‘Please, just send us money; don’t worry about it.’ We sat down for the most recent CSTDA and said: ‘We’ll tell you what we’ll do. The largest area of unmet need clearly is in the area of supported accommodation and respite.’ Do you know what we put on the table,
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    ? We said, ‘Instead of 25 per cent, we will double our commitment uncapped to unmet need in supported accommodation and respite.’ Do you know what they did, Mr President? The Labor ministers responsible for disability, with the ink hardly dry on the paper, walked out. I can tell you right now: you will not get that kind of behaviour on this side of the parliament.

                        I think it is a very important question; I am not sure about those on the other side. I say to Senator Joyce that one thing every Australian family should know is that this coalition government is the best friend Australian families have ever had. It was a fantastic budget, as we all know, on Tuesday: a record $4.5 billion over five years to further support families, children, people with disabilities, volunteers, Indigenous people and older Australians; and $3.94 million will be provided for the one-off lump payment to carers of people with disabilities or who are frail aged. Two million older Australians will receive $500 as part of a $1.3 billion one-off bonus payment for each older Australian who receives a utility allowance or a seniors concession allowance. Every older Australian has the discretion to go out and spend $500 on whatever they want. We have had so much support over that incentive—and it is a great thing for families. It does not matter if you are disabled or older, every family in Australia is going to be looked after in this fantastic budget. From 1 January 2008 this government will deliver greater incentives for older Australians, with changes to the pension bonus scheme enabling more members to gain access to the scheme. We are going to commit $46.4 million over four years to extend access to the pension bonus scheme. This is on top of the already significant commitment made by the Howard government to assist older Australians in retirement.

                          The Leader of the Opposition might laugh. You have got to keep your eye on unemployment rates. They go down so quickly. I think they slipped down to 4.4 per cent today—plenty of jobs out there now. We are going to make sure that when you enter the workforce you have good child care. There is $1.1 billion in child care to deliver more financial assistance, extra places for children, high support needs and services operating in rural and regional Australia. The childcare tax rebate for families has been brought forward, so now it will be paid after the end of the financial year in which parents pay for their child care. On 1 July parents will gain further relief from childcare costs, with $729.9 million over four years, a greater than 13 per cent increase in child care. That is right,

                          : an increase of over $1,000 per child per year. Families and parents around the country are so relieved that they can continue to enter the workforce and continue to make a contribution to our wonderful economy. In addition, we will be committing $43.8 million to ensure there is viable child care in those areas.

                           In closing, it is National Volunteer Week next week and I invite the very noisy lot here who are unappreciative of this wonderful largesse being provided by the government to make a contribution. Get involved in Volunteer Week; join the canteen, sports,

                           . Go and make an effort. Volunteer Week is a very important week, and I appreciate your support.
