        by leave—I advise that, at the meeting of the federal parliamentary Labor Party this morning, Senator Farrell was elected unopposed as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. I congratulate him personally, and on behalf of all Labor senators, on his appointment. Senator Farrell has also been appointed to serve as shadow special minister of state and shadow minister for sport. We welcome Senator Farrell to the shadow ministry and to the deputy leadership.
       </p>
       <p>
        With this appointment, there are some changes to the shadow ministerial representation arrangements in the Senate. I seek leave to table an updated shadow ministry list and have it incorporated into

         by leave—On behalf of the government, I wish to congratulate Senator Farrell on his election as Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate. As would have been very apparent from the reaction of government senators, Senator Farrell, you are a very, very popular senator, at least on my side of the chamber!
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that former Prime Minister the great

         While I am on my feet, I advise that Senator Scullion will be absent from question time today due to official business. In his absence, I will represent the Indigenous affairs portfolio.
