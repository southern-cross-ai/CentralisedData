         I am very pleased that at least some in the opposition have read some parts of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         report. If they had read it properly they would know that one of the things the commission says is that putting in place a carbon price is the most efficient way to ensure that an economy reduces its emissions. In fact, it is a report which shows the weakness of the coalition's policy—a policy which is all about taking money from taxpayers, giving it to polluters and hoping that there might be some change in behaviour. That is, as Mr Turnbull has said, a recipe for fiscal irresponsibility. This government has made its approach very clear. It is an approach which we put into this parliament on a number of occasions in the last term. We want to put a price on carbon because that is the most economically sensible way to reduce Australia's emissions and to ensure that we can build the clean economy of the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of price impacts, the senator is aware and the government has been upfront about the fact that there are price impacts from charging for something which is currently free. What is currently free is the ability to pollute; and, as long as that is free, companies will continue to do it. The government has made it clear that the revenue that is received through the carbon price being levied on the big polluters will be returned to Australian households and to Australian businesses to ensure that the adjustment can be made to a cleaner energy economy.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Will the minister confirm that the prices of Australian produced goods will increase more than those of imported goods under Labor's carbon tax? Isn't this policy, as the managing director of Coca-Cola Amatil said recently, 'discriminatory because it advantages imported goods'?

            South Australia
           </a>
           who argued for a carbon price. He looked remarkably like the gentleman who just asked me a question. It is quite extraordinary, isn't it, the way in which those on the other side—who once believed that climate change is real and once believed in an economically rational approach to dealing with it—now come into this place and ask questions like that. Here is another one—

            , I rise on a point of order on the issue of direct relevance. The minister was asked about the differential impact of a carbon price on domestically produced and imported goods. She is more than halfway through her answer and she has engaged in nothing but ritualistic abuse of the questioner. She has not approached the question. She has not been relevant, let alone directly relevant.

             Order on both sides! Listening to some of the answers today has been difficult because of the constant interjections from both sides. It will help the conduct of question time and my capacity to hear the answers fully if those people who are

             cease their interjections. The interjections sometimes overtake the question that has been asked. Senator Wong, you have 24 seconds remaining to address the question that you were asked by Senator Birmingham as a supplementary question.

              What Senator Birmingham is asserting is essentially that no-one else is doing anything. That is essentially what he is asserting, and we know that that is wrong; we know that that is not true. We know that a price on carbon has existed in Europe since 2005. We know that the United States is now investing more in clean energy than in conventional sources. We know the action that China is taking, we know that India is taxing coal, but those on the other side persist in perpetuating a myth.

                         Firstly, in relation to the tax question, obviously whether or not this or any other expense is deductible obviously depends on the taxpayer's particular circumstances and the details of the expense made, so I am not sure I would be in a position to make any definitive statement about the extent to which these sorts of expenditures would in fact be deductible.

I am not sure I can provide much more information to Senator Brown. It is true that companies do, under Australia's taxation laws, have the ability to deduct certain expenses—

                                Rather than getting into a debate about what may or may not be in a particular advertisement, I will just make this point. The proposition that there is no point in pointing in place a carbon price has been made endlessly in this place by Senator Joyce and others. I am on record over quite a number of hours and days in the context of previous climate change debates answering that. It is an interesting proposition because what it essentially says is, 'We might think climate change is real, but everyone else should fix it.' If you say that we do not need to do anything in Australia, you are essentially saying that this might be a problem but other people have to deal with it.

                                  Obviously those are not words that I would use, but the senator is entitled to use them. The government has always recognised the importance of the coal industry; we also recognise the importance of climate change. We have been working on an economically responsible way to deal with climate change, an issue that we understand is not going to go away, no matter how much those on the other side might rail against it. Our view is that it is an economically sensible approach to ensure we put a price on carbon, that we utilise the revenue from that price to assist Australians to adjust to the change as we move to a low-carbon economy.
