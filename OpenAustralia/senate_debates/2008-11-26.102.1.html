         I am very pleased to rise and respond to this question. As I have said previously on a number of occasions, we put out a green paper in July which set out Labor’s plans to reduce carbon pollution and to tackle climate change—

          unlike those opposite. Those plans were put out in a green paper particularly for the purpose of consultation. I am pleased to say, contrary to some of the assertions which have been made in here, that consultation has generally been constructive and extremely useful for government consideration of these issues.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was very pleased to receive a very courteous letter from Nyrstar in relation to the way in which this issue had been previously discussed in the chamber. I know Senator Fisher knows what I am talking about. I think it is beholden on us in this place to ensure that we appropriately utilise information given to us. As to the issue of Nyrstar, I am pleased to say that I have had very constructive discussions not only with the member for Denison but also with other Tasmanians, including Tasmanian senators, about their issues, which they put to the government on behalf of their constituents, and their views about the way in which the proposals in the green paper are perceived by some people. I have found those consultations very useful. I have also met face-to-face with Tasmanian members of the government and members of the community from Tasmania.
         </p>
         <p>
          I will say this: the government made it clear, when we put our green paper out, that we recognised that the introduction of a carbon price—

                Actually, I did not. I had a request for a meeting with a range of individuals, to which I acceded. Again, I remind senators opposite that my department, from memory, has met some four times with Nyrstar, as I said on the last occasion. We will continue to ensure that we consider the information provided by them. We are committed to consulting on these issues—

Is it a fact that every attendee at today’s meeting was a card-carrying member of the Labor Party, and is this the way in which the government intends to conduct its so-called consultation with the other 999 identified companies at risk from the

                  First, we on this side understand the risks of climate change. It is one of the key differences between us, before the election and now. Second, as I said previously, we have met with Nyrstar, as we have met with a range of other companies, and I am very grateful to the senior individual in Nyrstar for his most courteous letter, provided to me after this issue was previously raised in the chamber. The fact is, my department has met with Nyrstar, just as the government has met with a range of business leaders from a range of industry sectors. This government will consult  and is consulting, unlike members of the opposition, like Senator Boswell, who write letters to business people demanding that they oppose the government’s scheme. So let’s be clear who in this chamber is willing to consult.
