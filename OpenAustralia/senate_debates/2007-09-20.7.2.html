        Section 17 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 directs a rule-maker to be satisfied that appropriate consultation, as is reasonably practicable, has been undertaken particularly where a proposed instrument is likely to have an effect on business.  Section 18 of the Act provides that in some circumstances consultation may be unnecessary or inappropriate.  The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Act requires an explanatory statement to describe the nature of any consultation that has been carried out or, if there has been no consultation, to explain why none was undertaken.  The Explanatory Statements that accompany these instruments either make no reference to or provide insufficient information on consultation.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee

        The Explanatory Statement advises that the amendments introduce a broad discretion for this type of body corporate to refuse access to the register of members where the body is not satisfied that granting access is in the interests of the members as a whole.  There is no indication in the Explanatory Statement whether these amendments have been made in response to the decision of the Federal Court in Capricornia Credit Union Ltd v

        Item [39] in Schedule 1 to these amending Regulations inserts a new rule 31 which authorises the issue of warrants to enter and search vehicles, vessels, aircraft or premises.  It also permits the use of reasonable force in such a search.  While noting that this rule is a consolidation of existing provisions in the Regulations, the Committee has written to the Minister seeking advice as to whether it would be more appropriate for this provision to be located in the Family Law Act 1975 rather than in delegated legislation.
