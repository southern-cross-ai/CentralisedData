          ANSTO
         </a>
         ) has advised that normal surface cleaning procedures were conducted after removal of the radioactive packages. The storage area and all areas associated with the transfer, conditioning and further packaging were then surveyed for radiation and contamination. All were determined to be at normal background levels. These surveys were conducted by ANSTO and independently by another qualified organisation, confirming this status. The decisions to demolish the facilities as normal non-radioactive buildings were endorsed by the

        <p class="italic">
         (2) The Department of Finance and Deregulation (DFAD) has advised that the NSW Department of Urban Affairs and Planning (DUAP) commissioned two separate reports to assess if the decontamination works on the

         (b) Consistent with s.4(a) of the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Regulations 1994, ANSTO completed its clean up and removal of radioactive material on the ADI site prior to 31 December 1995. Therefore, DUAP's Audits did not identify any possible radioactive contamination.

        <p class="italic">
         (c) The two audits were made public by DUAP.

         (3) As stated in the answer to question (2)(b), no further radioactive material has been found at the site.
