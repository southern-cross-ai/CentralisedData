        My question is to the Minister for Families and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        , Senator Ruston. When I asked the minister about the budget measure for ongoing funding for 1800RESPECT the minister insisted: 'It is not a reannouncement; it is a new announcement.' She promised to return to the Senate that day to correct the record if she was wrong. When I followed up during estimates, the minister asked to correct the record and said, 'I used the word "announcement"; I should have used the word "measure."' Can the minister confirm that in her answer provided on 7 October she was wrong and that the budget measure was in fact a reannouncement? Why did the minister fail to return to the Senate to correct the record at her earliest opportunity?

         , and thank you very much for the opportunity that you provided me during estimates to re-establish, or to advise you, that I did in fact refer to a measure in the budget by an incorrect term. I said 'announcement'; correctly, it was a measure. I am quite happy to accept the fact that it was a measure. In fact, the measures that were in the budget—there were two measures that were contained in the budget that were first-time funded in the budget—relate to the funding for 1800RESPECT and also an extension of the Help is Here campaign. Senator McAllister, I am quite happy to stand here and acknowledge that the statement that I provided to you in the budget estimates that we were in together a couple of weeks ago—

             , I am quite happy to say that the comments I made to you in response to some questions that you asked me during estimates I am happy to make again here. In response to a question from you in this place I incorrectly referred to a measure as an announcement. It was a new measure in the budget. It had previously been announced as a budget measure. It is not unusual for budget measures that you preannounce them. In fact, there are many, many budget measures that are preannounced, and you would have done the same thing when you were in government. I accept I made that statement to you. I did use the word 'announcement' when I should have used the word 'measure', but there were new measures in the budget. There were measures, as I said, in relation to the 1800RESPECT number, which is a tremendously important hotline that women who are the victims of domestic violence can contact to find out where they may be able to receive help should they find themselves the victims of domestic violence. Equally, the Help is Here campaign provides women with similar advice.

               Last month I asked the minister a question on notice about expenditure on domestic violence programs. The minister transferred the question to the Minister for Women, who answered this week by saying the question should have been asked of this minister. Who is right, the Minister for Families and
