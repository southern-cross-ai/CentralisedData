       <p>
        I said I'd use my position in this place to elevate the voices in our communities. Today I want to share something with you from yourtown's Kids Helpline. They do really important work with young people and mental health. Here are some words directly from their mouth:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We tell young children to reach out and ask for mental health support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Kids Helpline is the critical safety net for every young person in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        No matter where they live. No matter what time of the day or night.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's always there when they need it.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over 443,000 young people between 5-25 contacted Kids Helpline last financial year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's unique in what it offers. It's 24/7 and it's free.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's often the only mental health service available after hours, on the weekends, or for young people who live in rural and remote areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Last year, over half of the young people Kids Helpline supported, contacted the service after hours and on weekends.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One young person who used Kids Helpline said that they struggled with depression, anxiety and suicidal thoughts throughout their teens.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is no question the service saved their life many times.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Right now, Kids Helpline needs your support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The technology that underpins this vital service needs urgent upgrading.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Without it, we may not be able to support young people in the contemporary ways they want to engage, in a safe and non-judgemental environment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need $10.5 million in funding to make this happen.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This will future-proof the service, ensuring that Kids Helpline can keep supporting young people's mental health for many more years to come.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is vital if we want to ensure every child that reaches out for help will have someone there to help them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, this is straight from the horse's mouth, so to speak. I really hope you consider funding this. It's a vital service for the health and wellbeing of our young people.
