        ():  I rise tonight to speak on an issue that I've risen in this place to speak on a number of times, and it's one that's very close to my heart—the sheep industry of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . The sheep industry is facing a very challenging time at the moment, with the threat of the live export ban putting at risk thousands of lives and livelihoods in my home state of WA. This is solely a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        industry, so this threat to the industry is a threat to Western Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        We currently have the serious issue of the

        , which is currently in the port of Fremantle after beginning its journey to a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern" rel="nofollow">

        port in Israel on 5 January. I emphasise that date, 5 January, because that date, when the department of agriculture approved that vessel leaving Australia with a consignment of sheep and cattle, was three weeks after the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        government had asked the Australian government to supply a naval ship to their efforts in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Red Sea
        </a>
        to combat the terrorist activities of the Houthi rebels—three weeks after the US government had asked the Australian government to supply a naval vessel, not a small request by any stretch. Yet, after this time, that consignment of sheep and cattle was approved. Subsequent events took place, and on 19 January—that is my understanding, although there is some debate about this in the media—the Australian government required the MV
        <i>

        to return to the port of Fremantle. There it lies.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government needs to take responsibility. The department needs to take responsibility for its actions in allowing the ship to depart in the first place and then bringing that ship back to Western Australia. What is the minister saying? 'It's up to the owners of the animals.' But they are left with very few options, especially without the active cooperation of the Australian government. In the meantime we have members of the Australian government—in particular
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Josh Wilson
        </a>
        , the member for Fremantle—out with protest groups, using this very difficult situation as another excuse to attack the Western Australian sheep industry and advance the idea of banning this trade. Yet this government, Mr Wilson's own government, has played a significant role in the current difficult situation the industry finds itself in. It's not only Mr Wilson, the member for Fremantle, that has taken this pass; others in the other place, senators in this place and animal activist groups have all used this as an opportunity to once again attack the sheep farmers of my home state of Western Australia and this vital industry in which they play a part.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to, in the last minute I have remaining, set the record straight. The MV

        arrived back in Fremantle. Health and welfare checks were conducted on those sheep immediately, and those sheep were found to be in good condition; in actual fact, both sheep and cattle had been gaining weight on the voyage. There were no problems with conditions aboard the vessel, as some in this place, in the other place and in the animal activist groups wanted to tell the public. The boat has been in

        for cleaning purposes—live stock transport boats need to be cleaned on a regular basis—but the ventilation has been running, and running at full capacity, for the entire time. There is no need for the boat to be moving in order for ventilation to be provided for the animals on board. And the mortalities are absolutely minimal—well below the reportable thresholds required by the government.
