        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. On 29 July 2016, when asked whether he had consulted with any Aboriginal groups about the terms of reference for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        , the Attorney-General stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a matter of fact I did. I consulted Mick Gooda, who is the Aboriginal and

        social justice commissioner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the Attorney-General stand by this statement?

         I recall that when the Turnbull government decided very, very swiftly to establish the royal commission into the Don Dale youth detention centre and the child protection system of the

           social justice commissioner, but the commissioner in fact contacted the Attorney-General? Can the Attorney-General confirm that when he returned the commissioner's call he said he would think about consultation, but the commissioner never heard anything back? Are the Attorney-General's claims of consultation just as fictional as his claims of consultations with the Solicitor-General?

            Senator Gallacher, I do not remember precisely what was said between Mr Gooda and me, but you asked me whether I spoke to him and I have told you I did. In fact, as you know, I subsequently decided to appoint him as a royal commissioner.
           </p>
           <p>
            I know Mr Gooda very, very well indeed. I speak to him quite often about issues of this kind, and I did speak to him at that time. I might say, Senator Gallacher, since you have sought to draw a comparison, when I consult people, do you know what I do? I ask them what they think about an issue. My view of what consultation means stands in stark contrast to the view of Mr Mark Dreyfus, who said on Sky News on 6 October, 'You can't consult with someone if you haven't told them what you're going to do.' Now, that is Mr Dreyfus's view of a consultation: you make up your mind first and then you tell somebody what you have already decided to do. My view is: you ask them for their view.

                  Senator Gallacher, I think I am known as somebody who is very, very careful in my use of language, unlike the shadow Attorney-General, who is very careless and reckless in his use of language. But I cannot miss the opportunity to dwell on the delightfulness of Mr Dreyfus's definition of consultation. Let me quote it to you again: 'You cannot consult with someone if you have not told them what you are going to do.'
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Well, Senator Gallacher, the shadow Attorney said, 'You cannot consult with someone if you have not told them what you are going to do.' Mr Dreyfus thinks that consultation means making up your mind first and talking later—and telling someone what you are going to do. But when I consult people I ask them for their views, as I did with Mr Gooda and as I did with Mr Gleeson.
