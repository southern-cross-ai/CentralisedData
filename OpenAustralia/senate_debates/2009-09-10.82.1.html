        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade, Senator Carr. Does the minister agree, as stated by Austrade’s now censored submission to the Senate’s inquiry into the removal of the rebate for the

         I do not agree and the proposition advanced to the Senate inquiry did not reflect the view of the government, nor did it reflect the considered view of Austrade. The Austrade executive realised there had been a mistake and acted appropriately to correct the public record. A wide range of industry representatives have endorsed and supported the government’s decision—the Australian Dairy Industry Council,

           I would remind those opposite that the export certification rebate in question was scheduled to lapse at the end of 2008-09, an arrangement put in place by the previous government. There has been no budget to fund it beyond that date. The Beale review found that the funding should be allowed to lapse. As a consequence, the government proposed to invest $40 million in reform of the export certification process. These reforms will reduce costs for exporters and improve efficiencies. Just as it did with the EMDG, the Liberal Party is bleating about a policy reform that they lacked the required political courage to implement when they were in government. They have the hypocrisy to demand that this government—

             The government has not censored Austrade. I repeat: what has occurred is that the government is implementing a reform that the Liberal Party did not have the courage to implement when in government. It proposed actions and did not budget for them. As a result, we now have a situation where the Liberal Party is once again acting in a most hypocritical manner in suggesting that changes that it proposed in government are not being followed. The submission was not cleared through the minister’s office—which is custom and practice across the government. As it was under the previous government and as it is under this government, it is custom and practice for departments to present—

              , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister give a commitment that the officials involved in the preparation of the now censored Senate submission will be available to appear before the committee? Further, will the minister guarantee that these officials will be permitted to give full, frank and fearless advice to the committee in the same way as they tried to give it to the government?

                     will disclose that the second supplementary question in no way, shape or form dealt with the issue of censorship. For the minister to claim that the question did deal with that shows clearly that he is being irrelevant. The question related to whether or not the minister would give a commitment that the officials involved in the preparation would be allowed to appear.

                      , on the point of order: if Senator Abetz wants to argue that the question he wrote did not include the words ‘censored report’, he perhaps would like to read the whole question, not just the bit that suited his argument on this occasion. The minister is directly on point and is trying to seriously respond to the question.

                          Just because the officer has not been schooled in what he is to say—Senator Abetz has got that sort of experience—does not make it illegitimate. What we have here is Senator Abetz’s experience of going through a tutorial with a witness before he appears before a Senate inquiry. We do not do that. That is not the standard that this Senate has come to expect.
