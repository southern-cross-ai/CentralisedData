        My question is to the Minister for Human Services representing the Minister for Education, Senator Payne. Can the minister advise the Senate how the measures contained in last night's budget broaden the opportunities for school leavers and of any endorsement of these reforms?

         I thank Senator McKenzie for her continued interest in the important area of education. What I am able to tell the Senate about this historical higher education reform is that it will ensure that more Australians are able to receive a world class higher education as well as wider opportunities through diploma and other pathway courses, and it will ensure that Australia's higher education is not left behind in what is an increasingly competitive international environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the first time ever, the Australian government will provide direct financial support to all students studying at any registered Australian higher education provider such as a public university, a private university, a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
          TAFE
         </a>
         or a college for any accredited under graduate course including higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas, associate degrees and degrees. For the first time ever, there will be direct financial support to all students in those categories. What those changes provide is an historic pathway into higher education for Australians. And a lot of those Australians will come from lower socioeconomic areas and regional areas. What that means by 2018 is world-changing for this country.

           What that means by 2018 is that the reforms will see the Australian government supporting over 80,000 more students as they pursue the best course for them. The government will also offer

            HECS

             I thank Senator McKenzie for the supplementary. Most importantly, from 1 January 2016 there will be no restriction on the number of subsidised places available to students who are enrolling in these higher education courses. This reform responds to the recommendation in the 2008 Bradley review of higher education. That was for a demand-driven funding system to be implemented for all undergraduate courses. What the more recent Norton report has also recommended is that sub-bachelor higher education courses should also be included in the demand-driven system. So we will see options dramatically expanded for Australians, pathways for students who are less prepared for university while funding an enormous range of qualifications that then lead straight to jobs. Students who really need the support can prepare better for university rather than necessarily going into degree courses before they are ready. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWS" rel="nofollow">
              UWS
             </a>
             College is a great example of this particular aspect of the policy. We are going to support students into pathway courses.

               Thank you, Senator McKenzie. This is a fantastic piece of news in the higher education space because it means that students from disadvantaged backgrounds are going to have access to a new Commonwealth scholarship system which will help them meet the costs associated with higher education, particularly students, as Senator McKenzie would especially identify with, from regional Australia.

                 Those regional students often face additional challenges. They are going to be offered by higher education institutions with 500 or more Commonwealth subsidised students who increase their revenue as a result of the deregulation of student contributions. We are going to require universities and other higher ed providers to spend a dollar in every five dollars of additional revenue raised to the new Commonwealth scholarships. Universities and other providers will provide tailored individualised support to students which includes need based scholarships which will meet the cost of living, fee exemptions, mentoring, tutorial support and assistance and other critical points in their study.
