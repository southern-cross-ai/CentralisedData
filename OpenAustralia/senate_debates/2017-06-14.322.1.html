           The government does not release commercially sensitive information that could have the potential to distort local markets, and is therefore unable to release the consultant report on this basis. The government can confirm that Defence has received an unsolicited proposal from Australia Zhongren Enrichment Holding Pty Ltd but this has not been accepted and is not being considered. All parties, including the Victorian government, are welcome to participate in the open-market process. Planning decisions for the Defence site Maribyrnong, including the potential number of dwellings that could be built on the site, will ultimately be decisions for the city council and relevant Victorian government authorities. The government remains committed to working with the Victorian government and local council to ensure the needs of the broader community are considered in plans for future development of the site.
