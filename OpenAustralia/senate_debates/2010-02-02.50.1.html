        My question, to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery, is in regard to the nation-building economic stimulus plan. Is the minister aware that, during the school holidays, it appears work on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         Building the Education Revolution

        projects increased? Can the minister provide the Senate with information on the level of activity that happened at our schools during the holiday break? Is the minister also able to outline to the Senate how this vital schools infrastructure is supporting jobs? How is the stimulus generally helping to support employment across the economy, and are there any threats to the jobs that it has sustained?

         I thank Senator McLucas for the question and also for the work she has undertaken particularly in

         and the community of Cairns, where unemployment has reached 14 per cent. The work she has done to create jobs and support the local community should be commended. I am pleased to inform the Senate that, while parliament has been in recess, the builders, the contractors, the tradies and the subcontractors working on

         projects have been hard at it. As senators would be aware, the program is valued at $16.2 billion—and I remind the Senate that coalition senators voted against it six times.

         As at the end of December, only halfway through the school holidays, at the nation’s 8,000 primary schools over 5,000 projects were under construction. That is more than double the figure of only two months ago. What that means is that there are tradespeople on sites, wages getting paid, libraries being built, classrooms being built and science and language centres being built—and

         , the member for Warringah, is complaining. Two months ago there were only 33 science and language centres underway, but we now have 503 science and language centres underway—and all the member for Warringah can do is complain. He complains that the government has kept Australia out of recession. He complains about vital school funding—which was so neglected by the Howard government—going directly to school communities. As I travel around the country talking to principals and school communities—

             A week ago I was in Perth, and I visited the Westminster State School. There are three classrooms under construction, there are workers and apprentices on site, and money is going into the local economy. The school community is happy and the tradespeople are happy. That is exactly what the stimulus was designed to do. Again, this is an example of the other side being completely out of touch with what is going on in the economy, what has been happening with the global financial crisis, and the gains from the projects. I go back to Senator Joyce, who said on 12 December:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Well I think the whole ... stimulus package was not warranted ... I think the stimulus package was inappropriate
