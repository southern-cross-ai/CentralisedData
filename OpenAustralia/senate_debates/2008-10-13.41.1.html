         </a>
         Liberals do not support the imposition of a blanket curfew on Canberra airport. We are looking at ways to address the concerns of the curfew lobby but do not feel that there is any need to pursue a course that would threaten the economic development of Canberra and Australia as a whole. Canberra airport is the only airport between Brisbane and Melbourne that is currently curfew free, and maintaining that is important to the national infrastructure suite. Noise abatement measures already apply to Canberra and Queanbeyan. Due to wise planning there are no dense urban areas close to the airport, as there are in places such as Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. The coalition does not feel that this motion would contribute anything towards the protection of residents and feels that it has much more to do with the ACT election this coming Saturday.

          by leave—As the Senate will be aware, I have pursued this matter for some time and it was logical to have the motion to follow it up. Senator Humphries did not say how he was going to address what he called ‘the curfew lobby’, who are residents in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
           ACT
          </a>
          who are very concerned about the potential expansion of this airport to become an international hub, to use the developer’s own words, for cargo transport into Australia, certainly south-east Australia. One can understand what a potential nightmare that would be for the people who are living under the flight trajectory or near the airport. It does require, if the curfew is not going to be addressed, that Senator Humphries and the opposition give concrete expression to their concern for the lobby, but there has been none of that here today. There should have been support.

             I will just finish. For the senator

              interjecting

             , the very argument that Senator Humphries used that this is the only airport between Melbourne and Brisbane without a curfew speaks for itself. Canberra residents should get the same protection as the residents of the other cities, which are protected.
