        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer the minister to an article by

        last Friday that quotes a coalition minister, describing one of the Senate's newest members as 'completely stark raving mad'. Did the minister or any of the government's Senate leadership team describe one of their fellow Senators in this way and provide this quote to the journalist?

         I can confirm that I have not used such language in relation to any new senator, but I do confess that I may have used such language in relation to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this place from time to time—of course with no hard feelings, whatsoever! I can indicate that I have not used that language in relation to any new minister. As far as my colleagues are concerned, I am not aware but I would not assume so. If that descriptor was used in relation to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, it would be unkind, it would be uncharitable and it would be unparliamentary but chances are it would be true.

          , I ask a supplementary question. During the government's shambolic efforts to repeal the carbon tax last week, did the minister describe the amendments being put forward by the Palmer United Party as, 'crazy, crazy, crazy', or was the minister referring to the Palmer United Party senators again?

           The only reference that I made to the Palmer United amendments was 'belts and braces'. In relation to 'shambolic efforts', can I simply remind the Labor Party that they went to the last election on the basis of repealing the carbon tax. If the

                 Senator Macdonald and I are on a heated unity ticket on the need to get rid of the carbon tax, and that is all that Senator Macdonald and I are concerned about. It would be fair to say that the leadership of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                  Australian Labor Party
                 </a>
                 has to make a determination as to where they stand on the carbon tax. Having gone to two elections promising no carbon tax, they have come back and have continued to vote to support the carbon tax. In relation to leadership and bringing people with them, the Labor Party leadership needs to determine its position where it is going to land in relation to the carbon tax. But both Senator Macdonald and I campaigned at the last election for the repeal of the carbon tax. I can understand Senator Macdonald's disappointment that we were not able to achieve that last week. Senator Macdonald and I are hopeful that we can achieve it this week.
