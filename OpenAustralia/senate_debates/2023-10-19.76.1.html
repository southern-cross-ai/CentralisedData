        <p>
         I answered a very similar question from Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie" rel="nofollow">
          McKenzie
         </a>
         yesterday, to which I said that Minister King has already put on the record that she did meet with the former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         of Qantas as well as the CEO of Virgin. That is her usual practice—to speak to the CEOs of major airlines on a regular basis. I know that this is something that Senator McKenzie is determined to keep asking questions on, no matter how many times they are answered, so I can only repeat the answers that I gave yesterday. Senator McKenzie, of course, is entitled to ask whatever questions she wants. We will continue providing the same answers, as we have done now for probably the best part of three months.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that overnight, or in the last 24 hours, Minister King has also made the point that the government will be reactivating
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         monitoring of air passenger services. That was intended by the former government to end on 30 June this year. The former government had agreed to the finalisation of that in June, but of course they're much wiser in opposition than they ever were in government.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <i>

          —
         </i>
        </p>
        <p>
         I take the interjection—not a lot wiser. And I also note that the 12 ACCC reports that occurred under the previous government found declining services standards and higher prices by the airlines but were not acted on. Again, it seems to have taken the opposition losing government to actually start caring about any of these issues and continue asking questions which have been answered many times.

           s of both our major airlines—one would hope she would be—but I asked about 23 January, and that hasn't been answered. Minister, next week, as it's estimates, you will be appearing before the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport committee on Minister King's behalf. Will you undertake to seek the relevant information from Minister King's office so that you can provide the committee with a satisfactory answer to what is actually a very straightforward question?

            As Senator

             McKenzie
            </a>
            knows, it's always my practice to assist the opposition in answering questions. I'm actually looking forward to estimates next week. I think most people have worked out that many of our ministers enjoy appearing at estimates. I'm seeing a lot of nodding heads here. We've got a lot to say next week at estimates. We've got a lot to remind the opposition of about their time in government as well.
           </p>
           <p>
            The matter that Senator McKenzie is asking about—unfortunately I will not be able to represent Minister King at the infrastructure estimates, because I'll be representing Minister O'Neil in the home affairs estimates. I look forward to seeing Senator Scarr and a number of others there. But Senator Chisholm will do a fantastic job answering those questions.

                      Prior to the election, the Prime Minister promised to bring transparency and integrity back to politics, claiming that only a Labor government would deliver on that promise. How are Australians expected to believe that you have kept your promise, when the Albanese Labor government won't even be up-front about who a minister met let alone reveal the reasoning behind major decisions impacting our economy and the Australian travelling public?

                        , of all people, wants to talk about transparency in government. Have you still got those spreadsheets? Are they still coloured? I mean, seriously, we're going to take lectures from Senator McKenzie or anyone over on that side of the chamber about transparency? Senator Cash has a lot to say now. Of course, Senator Cash was the Attorney-General who didn't introduce a national anticorruption commission. That is how committed Senator Cash was to transparency. Senator Cash of course refused to co-operate with a police investigation. That is how committed she was to transparency in office and they now want to lecture us.

It is absolutely against standing orders, this continual behaviour. When he feels under attack, he makes it personal every time.

                              I have a submission on the point of order. I think there is a distinction between a personal attack and a criticism that goes to someone's behaviour as a public official. The latter is not a personal attack, no matter what others may say.

                                As I say, this government has delivered on transparency. We have introduced a national anticorruption commission. Senator Farrell is doing work on electoral donations. There are any number of examples we could give. Unfortunately, Senator McKenzie is never happy.
