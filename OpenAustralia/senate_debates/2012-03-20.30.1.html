        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Senator Ludwig. I refer to the report released by Fair Work Australia last Friday on its investigations into the allegations of financial mismanagement in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Health Services Union
        </a>
        , No. 1 Branch. Is the government satisfied that the report thoroughly deals with all relevant issues and allegations and that nothing was swept under the carpet?

         I thank the opposition for their question. In terms of the Fair Work Australia conclusions on the investigation into the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSU" rel="nofollow">
          HSU
         </a>
         Victorian No.1 Branch, we welcome the conclusions of the investigation by Fair Work Australia. We do note the general manager's comment that the investigation findings relate to the keeping and lodgement of financial records and financial management. Fair Work Australia, as I think I have said in this chamber before, is an independent agency and the government will continue to fully respect its independence.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the investigation report, we note that the decision originally was not to make the report public, but that eventually it would respond to requests from the Senate committee to produce it. For the record it is worth adding that the report was provided to the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Employment and Workplace Relations last week and of course made public by the committee on Friday. It is a matter that Minister Shorten will have an opportunity to follow and read through, obviously. He has already made some broad comments about it, but it would be early in this piece to actually provide Mr Shorten's comments in relation to the investigation and the report itself. I will seek further and better particulars from Mr Shorten as to whether or not he wants to provide any particular response to the question you have raised. Again, I remind those opposite that it is a matter that is still, and can be, in the domain of being referred further—for example, to the

          I rise to ask a supplementary question. I think that the answer to my question was no, and, on that basis, will the minister investigate reopening Fair Work Australia's inquiry into the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
           Health Services Union
          </a>
          to investigate claims by the former assistant secretary of the union, Mr Nader, who said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          There is a lot of irregularities between 2002-05 which no one has looked into …

           Again, those opposite seem to miss one of the significant points: Fair Work Australia is an independent body. It is charged with looking after the relevant obligations it has under the Fair Work legislation. In terms of the specific issue you have raised, obviously I am not the minister responsible for referring a particular matter. I can ask Mr Shorten whether he wants to provide a response in relation to the supplementary question asked by the opposition today. But, again, if the opposition do have any evidence in relation to wrongdoings of any organisation then it is incumbent upon them to provide that information to Fair Work Australia.

              Again, the opposition are trying to make a cute point on that. If the opposition do have any substantive information available about any particular wrongdoing then they should not hide it or sit on it; they should bring it to the attention of the relevant authorities so that it can be properly investigated.
