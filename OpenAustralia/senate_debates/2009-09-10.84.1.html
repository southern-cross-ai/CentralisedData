        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, Senator Carr. I refer to Abbotsford Primary School in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales

        , where the school community has shown greater fiscal responsibility than the Rudd government in trying to optimally use their $2.5 million grant under the so-called

           This is yet another matter that Senator Mason has unfortunately been asked to raise in the Senate. I know that it is a dreadful situation, Senator. Through 12 years of opposition there were occasions, I must confess, when there were questions that on reflection I should have sent back. This is—

                  Department of Education and Training has advised that the nomination was put forward by the New South Wales government on behalf of the school and it was accepted by the school community on 25 May. Subsequently, the school community indicated that they wished to have additional classrooms constructed. What we have found is that the school currently has four spare classrooms in their current quota. One is being used as a specialist music room, another is a specialist Italian room and there are two spare classrooms that are not currently in use. The

I refer to Evesham State School in Queensland, where a $250,000 grant is attached to the school’s single student and, should that school close down, the grant will follow her to her next school, which has already started a bidding war among other schools for the student. Will the minister explain how a grant can be given to a school with only one student, particularly when that school did not apply for a grant in the first place?

                    , I raise the point of order I raised yesterday, which goes to the question of the opposition’s use of supplementary questions that have completely different subject matters to the original questions. In this instance a primary question was asked about activities at a school in
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                     New South Wales
                    </a>
                    and the supplementary is a question about a school in Queensland, with no suggestion that there is any sort of context to that. Mr President, I ask that you have a look at this matter and advise the chamber, because it seems to me that this is an abuse of the use of supplementary questions.

                     , and Senator Mason clearly referred to that. He has now referred to another example of the Building the Education ‘so-called’ Revolution, but in Queensland. I thought this Building the Education Revolution program was nationwide, not only in

                      On the point of order I will rule, as I did yesterday, that there is no point of order and the question is in order. However, I will take away the comment that Senator Evans made and I will review the questions and, if needs be, those matters will be referred to the Procedures Committee. If necessary I will bring any detailed statements back to this chamber. But the question stands.

In the case of Evesham State School, the Queensland Department of Education reports that a sudden drop in enrolments was not predicted and it related to the personal circumstances of some families at the school. This is in the context where over the next 12 months there will be 23,000

                          Senator Evans will be happy with this. Isn’t the grandmother of Evesham State School’s only student, Mrs Joanne Hall, correct when she says that spending a quarter of a million dollars on a school library for one student is a ‘waste of money’?
