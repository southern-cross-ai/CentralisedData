        I welcome the government’s belated announcement this morning of some funding for the

         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        . It is regrettable that the government was dragged kicking and screaming into making that announcement and a lot of people around the country are wondering why it took them so long and why it was that the government was not prepared to move earlier on this matter, having been alerted to it by the Chairman of the Australian War Memorial Council,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cosgrove" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Cosgrove
        </a>
        , back in March of last year and then May of last year. In fact, the situation was so desperate in May last year that General Cosgrove, probably one of the best known and highly respected living Australians, had to ask for a meeting with the then Prime Minister to discuss the financial situation. In actual fact, remarkably, that meeting was never granted.

          It was never granted. Yes, absolutely. The pressure came on in October last year and in response to that the Prime Minister announced an inquiry into the resources of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
           Australian War Memorial
          </a>
          . What the Prime Minister knew, and what others knew, was that they had already been told what the situation was. In fact, the incoming minister was provided with a departmental brief which said the memorial was facing potentially crippling financial circumstances. Why did it take from October until now to make the announcement? I will tell you what forced them to make the announcement this morning, hurriedly—and I would love to know from Senator Lundy what time she got the phone call to be at the War Memorial; I suspect it was not long before the announcement was made. What happened was that there was incredible community pressure growing to the diabolical and appalling behaviour shown to, in my view, the pre-eminent iconic memorial in this country. The pressure became too much and the government was forced to respond. I thank the community for its assistance in the campaign that has been run by the coalition—by Mr Abbott himself and I as the shadow minister for veterans’ affairs. The community has worked very hard on this. The media has made a significant contribution.
         </p>
         <p>
          But why did it get to this, when this organisation was pleading for $5 million a year extra 12 months ago? When you look at what has been expended and wasted by this government in the last 12 months, the community is asking: what are the Labor Party’s priorities? We heard only two weeks ago that $13 million was wasted on advertising a health agreement for which there was no agreement. That represents nearly three years of the additional funding that the Australian War Memorial required. There is a litany of waste and financial mismanagement which could have put money into this institution and, indeed, other institutions throughout the country. The sooner this government wakes up to itself and reorders its priorities the greater will be the respect that it is given by the Australian community. Look at the last two days in relation to the decision on a carbon tax and look at the impact that that is going to have on Australian families—the very people, the nearly 900,000 ordinary Australians, who visit the Australian War Memorial every year and the nearly 200,000 children.
         </p>
         <p>
          The financial situation of the War Memorial became so grave that the council met and discussed whether they would close the doors for one day a week. They were going to close the doors for one day a week because the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Labor Party
          </a>
          refused to provide $5 million. They wasted a billion dollars on the Home Insulation Program, the pink batts program—a billion dollars wasted to pick up on the mistakes they had made—let alone the school halls program and the Green Loans program. When you go through it, there is litany after litany of government waste and financial mismanagement. I hope the Australian Labor Party, and the Prime Minister particularly, has learnt the lesson of the Australian War Memorial. If you treat such icons with the contempt that the Australian Labor Party have done, then you will be pilloried and judged adversely by the Australian community, as you should and they indeed have.
         </p>
         <p>
          I will finish as I started. I welcome the funding announced by the Prime Minister today, which of course was a response to the funding announced by Mr Abbott last week. Is it coincidental? Others will make their own judgment about that. What the government has to do now is commit the $25 million to the refurbishment of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
           World War I
          </a>
          galleries and not $1.7 million apparently for a feasibility study. We know it is feasible. We know it must be done.

          <p>
           On the same matter, I am also pleased to make a contribution because of the significant announcement made by the government today to increase the operational budget of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
            Australian War Memorial
           </a>
           by $8 million. In sharp contrast to the outlandish claims of the very eager senator opposite to claim credit, the government has been undertaking a very serious review of the War Memorial’s operational budget and its capacity to support a very appropriate and very grave and important commemoration of the centenary of Gallipoli in 2015. In stark contrast, as I said, to the claims of the senator opposite, this is the responsible approach by government. I put to the opposition that their quite shallow exercise today in claiming some credit for the government’s longstanding review of the Australian War Memorial is not the situation at all. In fact, our consideration and our announcement today have been well programed. I would put to you, Mr Deputy President, that in fact it is pure opportunism for the opposition to stand up here today and claim some credit. We take very seriously our responsibility for the ongoing operation of the Australian War Memorial—we all do. We do not play games with it, and that is one of the reasons why we commissioned a very serious review. It is not about playing politics. It is not about a quick grab for cash in response to an opposition campaign. It is about a serious consideration of the War Memorial’s ongoing operational budget.
          </p>
          <p>
           I know that there has been quite a deal of interest in this issue, and rightly so. I participated in a Public Accounts and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit_Committee" rel="nofollow">
            Audit Committee
           </a>
           inquiry some time ago now that looked at the operational budgets of a whole number of what are defined as small agencies, and serious issues like the ongoing impact of the efficiency dividend. Indeed, I have participated in Senate estimates over many, many years—but obviously in my role as an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
            ACT
           </a>
           senator through the course of our years in opposition—and I am very familiar with the budget situation of the War Memorial. The fact of the matter is that there had been no diminution of the budget of the Australian War Memorial up to this financial year. The claims of the opposition that it had somehow been reduced were incorrect. Despite them being advised of this fact, they persisted in telling mistruths in the public domain about the state of the Australian War Memorial’s budget. And now they have the audacity to come in here and try to claim credit for a considered review and a response to those ongoing operational needs, which were the substance of the Prime Minister’s very warmly welcomed announcement this morning.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is very easy for the opposition to play these games, to make out that they have been somehow instrumental in the community campaign. The bottom line is that they knew we were reviewing the Australian War Memorial’s budget, and the opposition have made token endeavours in the public domain to buy themselves into this debate in an opportunistic way—so much so that, obviously with the results of the review imminent, we saw a shallow exercise last week by their leader, Mr
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
            Tony Abbott
           </a>
           , in announcing some kind of commitment from the opposition about the budget. But the fact is that they are not in government; they are in opposition. They can play politics all they like.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am incredibly proud of this announcement today. It is the operational budget that this institution requires. It is about providing $1.7 million, particularly towards the upgrade of those extraordinary World War 1 exhibitions. It is about all of the things that many Australians care deeply about. I have been to the War Memorial many, many times, and I think all Australians will agree that the World War 1 exhibition area, with its amazing dioramas, deserves this investment by the Australian government. It was my honour to stand beside the Prime Minister this morning as she made this important announcement, and I think it will serve the interests of all Australians very well.
          </p>
          <p>
           In closing, I want to reiterate the point about the state of the budget at the War Memorial.

              On the same subject, it is a sign of our Australianism that we give credit where credit is due. I just want to take a few seconds tonight to give credit to Senator Ronaldson for his sterling effort in changing around what was turning out to be an absolute catastrophe for one of Australia’s iconic sites. Senator Ronaldson has been running a campaign. He has assisted
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
               RSL
              </a>
              clubs, service organisations or anyone around Australia who might have an interest in the curtailment of hours at the War Memorial that has occurred for many weeks and, indeed, months now.
             </p>
             <p>
              In an illustrious career that has been literally adorned with many achievements and successes for his constituents, I have to say to Senator Ronaldson, ‘This is your finest hour.’ It would not have happened—in spite of what Senator Lundy has tried to indicate—if you, Senator Ronaldson, and Mr
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
               Tony Abbott
              </a>
              had not made the sort of public noise about the financial problems confronting the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
               Australian War Memorial
              </a>
              . It is a great credit to you. It is a great credit to our leader Tony Abbott that he was prepared to join with you in this campaign not just here in Canberra but also right around Australia because the War Memorial is something that all Australians are so proud of. We want to be able to go and see it every day of the week as we can. What was happening to the budget was just scandalous, so congratulations Senator Ronaldson. As I say, this is almost your finest hour.

               I would concur with the remarks of Senator Macdonald. Senator Ronaldson has been a tireless worker in this area and it was so pleasing to see this today.

               will recall that Senator Ronaldson, Senator Humphries and I spoke on this matter on a few occasions in the past. I am very pleased to know that the last post will still be played every night and they will not have to seek sponsorship to play it which I think is incredibly important. This is one of the few institutions in this country that we should not ever baulk about funding. I am delighted with the announcement today. I do thank Senator Ronaldson for keeping the pressure on the government that he has. I think it is a good outcome at this point and let us hope that funding continues to flow and increases when necessary to such an iconic item in Australia’s heritage.

                 I also want to make a short contribution and congratulate Prime Minister Julia Gillard for today reaffirming the government’s ongoing commitment to the

                 , and announcing an additional $8 million per year to ensure its ongoing operations. The new funding will ensure that the memorial can adequately respond to increased demands for these events as well as support inquiries, multimedia and education programs, research centres, services and professional historical advice. Today’s announcement also includes—as my colleague Senator Lundy has indicated—a one-off payment of $1.7 million to begin the redevelopment of the memorial’s
