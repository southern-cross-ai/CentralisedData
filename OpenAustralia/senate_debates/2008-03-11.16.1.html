        My question is to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the

        , Senator Conroy. Can the minister update the Senate on progress in implementing the government’s election commitment to build a new national broadband network? Will the minister advise the Senate what the government is doing to ensure that all Australians can access basic broadband services regardless of where they live or work?

         I thank Senator Wortley for that question. As all of you in this chamber would know, as part of its commitment to boosting Australia’s productivity the Rudd government has a commitment to provide up to $4.7 billion and regulatory changes to roll out a high-speed fibre broadband network. The Rudd Labor government has been working hard to set out the framework for the open and transparent competitive assessment process to build the new network.

         Today I announced the panel of experts whose job it will be to assess proposals to build the national broadband network. We have secured a fine panel, which will be chaired by the secretary of my department, Ms Patricia Scott. The other members of the panel include Dr Ken Henry, the

         , a former chairman of the communications authority. The experts on the panel bring a blend of technical, regulatory, business, investment and policy skills to the process. The panel will be supported by my department as well as by specialist advisers. In addition to this, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">

         will provide ongoing advice on pricing and competition issues, and deliver a written report to the panel.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first job of the panel will be to receive submissions from industry to assist in the development of the request for proposals for the national broadband network. Submissions are due before 30 March after which the request for proposals will be issued. Proponents will have time to develop their proposals and we expect the panel will then make a recommendation to government in September. The new network will deliver speeds of at least—none of the fraud from those opposite—12 megabits per second to 98 per cent of homes and businesses over fibre technology. The government is committed to uniform wholesale pricing across Australia and will ensure the network operator provides open access to broadband services on transparent, equivalent and genuinely procompetitive terms and conditions.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will also be inviting submissions from interested parties on the appropriate policy and regulatory framework for the future. The competitive assessment process will be open and transparent, with opportunities for industry and community input. The government will also ensure that people who may not have access to the new fibre network will have access to the best new fixed-line wireless or satellite technology.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Rudd government believes that all Australians are entitled to access first-class broadband, no matter where they live or work. This includes the two per cent who will not have direct access to the new fibre network. Today I am pleased to announce that the government has set aside an additional $95 million for the Australian Broadband Guarantee program in 2008-09, in keeping with our election promise—not something that those opposite were prepared to commit to. In addition to this, the government is calling for comments on policy and funding initiatives, to improve access to affordable broadband in remote areas into the future. The Rudd government is committed to ensuring all Australians have improved broadband services. Finally, the Minister for Education is progressing the government’s—
