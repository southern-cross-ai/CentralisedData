       <p>
        I've moved these amendments with great pride. Whilst I note the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Transport's speech during the second reading debate and thank her for the gracious way she and the government have listened to the contributions of senators on this bill and recognised our particular concerns with the bill and obviously some of the things we like about the bill, I'm concerned about her dismissal and assumption that those from rural and regional Australia don't have the requisite merit, experience or, might I say, intelligence to actually serve on the board of an authority such as this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, I completely reject the fact that the National Party is seeking to insert quotas, per se, onto the membership of this board. It is absolutely not our public policy to support quotas. We seek merit based appointments always, but we probably cast the net a little wider than the Labor Party would traditionally in what meritorious appointments might look like. We have learnt by hard experience that without someone around the table who has the lived experience of working, living, growing up and seeing a positive future for rural and regional communities then that perspective is often not taken into account. Given that the Labor Party's specific focus for this authority is in regional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        then I would suggest that it would actually help the authority to do very good work on behalf of the government to have somebody from rural and regional Australia around the table.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, I'm incredibly disappointed that the government won't be supporting our very sound and sensible amendment—particularly, again, when it comes to ensuring that the authority will consult with local communities. Despite your attempts at cheap political points, Assistant Minister, with respect to previous governments and consultation, no-one gets a gold star when it comes to consulting adequately with rural and regional communities. We can always do things better. I would hope that in my time in this place—and, Minister, you've been in this place for quite a while as well—processes have improved over time. That should be the case particularly in this portfolio area, because the minister who announces the project is very rarely the minister who cuts the ribbon on the project. These are long-term commitments and it's very often the case in this pipeline of infrastructure build for our country that the current government accepts and commits to continue projects of the previous government. That's because the level of planning and design, the tender process and the arrangements which have to be set up with local and state governments are long and arduous. They're negotiated outcomes which often take a lot of time, and a lot of effort and money are put into them. So respect for previous decisions needs to underpin this.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other aspects of our amendments that I'd like to go to actually increase accountability and transparency, something this government made a big song and dance about in coming to power. And yet when we put sensible amendments in front of them, when the Greens put sensible amendments in front of them and when Senator Pocock puts sensible amendments in front of them to increase the transparency, accountability and reporting mechanisms—not just for the Senate but, indeed, for the Australian taxpayer—around these arrangements those guys think they have it all sorted out. Well, it turns out that they don't. The Suburban Rail Loop in Melbourne is a classic case in point, where those opposite have turned their backs absolutely on their own stated objectives—that they would only fund projects that use the Infrastructure Australia methodology. Within five months they have broken their own promise to themselves, let alone their promise to the Australian people. Far be it from me, in opposition, to be the only one in this chamber suggesting that they might need a little help with increasing transparency and accountability in these spaces; other political parties and other senators want to assist them to be their best selves within government. I think that's a good thing and not a bad thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have described our amendments, but I also have some questions which I would like the minister to answer. In my speech in the second reading debate I actually went to the explanatory memorandum for this bill, where it explains that this bill will have no financial impact on the budget bottom line. Can you confirm the explanatory memorandum's statement to that effect?

        <p>
         First of all, I do wish to deal with your comments around the government's view of community members. Of course, I reject your remarks absolutely. I take them as political pointscoring by the opposition. They couldn't be further from the truth.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will go through the five amendments that you have put forward. I just want to step through the reasons that the government will not be supporting these amendments, and then I'll go to the question that you've placed before me.
        </p>
        <p>
         As to your first amendment: we, in the government, believe that this is an unnecessary amendment. The legislation already states that the authority will be consulting, liaising and negotiating with states and territories and other relevant parties, and it is inherent that the community will be a core part of the work of the High Speed Rail Authority.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'll go now to amendment (2).
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Infrastructure Australia
         </a>
         already evaluates business cases for transport infrastructure projects with an Australian government funding contribution of $250 million or more. In addition, business case evaluation reports are publicly released by Infrastructure Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'll move on to amendment (3). Again, the government will be opposing this amendment. The board will consist of five members, who will be appointed based on the appropriate skills mix. And it may well be, Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie" rel="nofollow">
          McKenzie
         </a>
         , that the board members will have experience in regional Australia or be from regional Australia, but the prime view of the government is that they have to have the appropriate set of skills to be on the board.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendment (4) we will be opposing. Information on the progress of the High Speed Rail Authority will be publicly available via its annual report and corporation plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         And your last amendment, amendment (5), we will also be opposing, as information on the progress, as I said, of the High Speed Rail Authority will be publicly available through its annual report and the corporate plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, on the other question that you put to me, I will just take some advice.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, going to your question, the cost of establishing the High Speed Rail Authority will be offset by existing funding set aside for the National Faster Rail Agency.

          With high speed rail, the first $500 million investment was for going from Sydney to my neck of the woods in the Hunter. Is there a break-up of that $500 million between planning and acquisition of line range?

             As I've said, once the authority is established, work will begin on the planning and the overseeing of the construction of a reliable, safe and efficient high speed rail network. As soon as we can get this bill in place and the authority is established, the sooner the better as this is going to be a huge opportunity for Australia. And I know that the opposition is supportive of the bill and the opportunities that high-speed rail will bring..

                Minister, following up on Senator Cadell's questions, in the budget you've put down half a billion dollars for this agency. You can't tell us when it's starting, you can't tell us if it will even be laying a track in the next decade, and yet your government put $2.2 billion on the table in the budget for an uncosted project for

                   First of all the government has committed $500 million for corridor acquisition, has committed $500 million to securing the Sydney to Newcastle corridor for the high-speed rail network is the key first stage. I think everyone knows what the $500 million is seeking to do. That funding includes funding to start corridor acquisitions, planning and early works and includes working closely with the

                   government. The High Speed Rail Authority will work collaboratively with the Australian government and the New South Wales government to determine the best way to deliver this project. Before allocating the funding the government will consider advice from the authority. That is the situation, and it's not unusual. I think I've been very clear. The bill is a very simple bill. It is also very clear, and I commend the bill to the Senate.

                    In the explanatory memorandum it said that the bill will have no financial impact as any impacts will be offset. The budget actually says that there will be a cost. There has been a cost to the budget to the tune of $18 million. Can you confirm where the $18 million was offset from? What projects were cut to find the $18 million?

                      's question about the $500 million, you said that the $500 million is to get the corridor for Sydney to Newcastle—correct me if I'm wrong—and you mentioned acquisitions. However, when I was before Senate estimates and I put the question to Mr Hallinan from the department, he specifically said that the $500 million was for setting up the agency and commencing preparation for corridors. When pressed he implied that there would be no acquisitions undertaken under the first stage because it would be the commencement of conversations and negotiations. Can you clarify, if Mr Hallinan was wrong, what portion of the $500 million is being set aside for corridor acquisitions? Or is that $500 million to fund the new agency, the new bureaucracy, to start work on conversations that have already started?

I am happy to put a written question back to the department to seek clarification from them, but I seem to be experiencing quite regularly where the departments are saying one thing and the government is saying another thing. I'm just wondering when we are all going to be singing off the same hymn sheet.

                          This is a final question from me and then I will sit down and listen. With regard to the establishment of the High Speed Rail Authority and the disbandment of the National Faster Rail Agency, are you able to advise whether those staff were transferred over? Is that why there hasn't been a budget impact, as per your explanatory memorandum? The explanatory memorandum says there's no budget impact and any costs will be met through savings. So I'm wondering if the disbanding of the National Faster Rail Agency is one of those cost savings. What's happened to those staff? Are they being transferred to the new authority or are they being settled elsewhere?

                           To answer your question, the agency is still in existence and transitional arrangements are still being undertaken. The National Faster Rail Agency will cease as an executive agency, with its functions being absorbed by the authority.

                            's comments about shifting money from other regions, especially rural regions, down to Victoria to help current Premier Dan Andrews in a difficult election reminded me of the Rockhampton ring-road, which is urgently needed and to which $700 million to $800 million had been committed. Land had been purchased. Families had moved into Rockhampton to start work. Companies locally had bought construction equipment. It was cancelled—just like that—to send money to help shore up the corrupt regime of Premier Dan Andrews.

                            Does the government realise that shifting these things for electoral gain, that may occur in the Hunter due to a proposed way-off high-speed rail connection, costs money and lives in other regions—particularly, in my concern here, in

                              I will ask one final question of the minister. Once I set the context for the Rockhampton ring-road, my question really boiled down to: is the government aware that when it rips money out of the regions and sends it to another area for electoral gain that that is a cost to the regions and it hurts and sometimes kills people?

                                Thank you, Minister, for your comments earlier on the bill. I note that you pointed out concerns about the way the coalition have appointed people to boards. I would like to note that there was nothing to rectify that in this legislation to set up the High Speed Rail Authority. There was no transparent framework to do that. I thank the government for their support of my amendments to do that, to ensure that Australians know that the people on the board and running the High Speed Rail Authority have the right skills, represent different areas of the country and will do the job there.
                               </p>

                                Given that there would be hundreds of people appointed to boards by the government, I'm interested to hear from the government if it is committed to reviewing those appointments to ensure that there is a transparent process in all of these authorities and for these boards.

They go to selection for appointment and disclosure of interests. As I've already said, the appointments to this board will be on the basis of relevant qualifications, knowledge, skills and/or experience—so it's merit-based. I can't speak about the situation regarding other boards, board members and appointments other than what we have here before us today.

                                        On behalf of Senator Cadell, who has had to leave at this stage of the debate, I'll say that he will put in a request about this, given that the authority's work will be between Sydney and his hometown of Newcastle. It would show great faith in the government's apparent newfound belief in rural and regional Australia if those jobs could be located in the Hunter.

                                           For the record, the government will be supporting these three amendments. Amendment (1) goes to the selection for appointment. These amendments relate to ensuring that the appointments to the board of the High Speed Rail Authority are a result of a merit based process, which, of course, they will be. The minister has already made clear in the other place that the board of the High Speed Rail Authority has to be a skills based board, and it is absolutely the determination of the government to appoint people based on merit.

                                             I'd thank Minister King and her office for the way in which they engaged with me on this piece of legislation. I appreciate their commitment to ensuring that all appointments are merit based. Clearly, this is something that is expected by the communities that we come from. Australians want to have peace of mind that the people who get into influential positions are getting there not because of who they know but because they have the right skills and leadership ability to make a difference in those positions.

                                             This is clearly a problem that we are grappling with in politics. A recent report by the

                                             found that, across all federal government appointees, seven per cent had a direct political connection. That figure rose to 21 per cent amongst positions that were considered well paid, prestigious and powerful. This is something that my community is telling me they want to end. I welcome the government's commitment to that, and I really look forward, over this next parliament, to ensuring that all boards have a very clear, transparent process for appointments so that the public can see that we are advertising, that people can have input and that we get the right people for the job.

                                             We also need a range of experiences in something like high-speed rail. I think it's really important that people from a regional and rural background can have input. We also need more women in positions of leadership when it comes to the High Speed Rail Authority. A quick glance at the National Women in Transport website shows at least 36 women who are currently leading infrastructure organisations or the infrastructure and transport arms of multinationals operating in Australia. The talent is there, and I look forward to seeing who is appointed. I'm sure they will do well leading this authority, which is a really important authority for us. It's going to be a huge challenge, but, looking at the future of Australia, it is something that most Australians want to see happen at some point—sooner rather than later.
