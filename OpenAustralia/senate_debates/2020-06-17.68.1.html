        My question is for the Minister for Women, Senator Payne. A survey by early childhood advocates The Front Project found the government's decision to make Australian families pay unaffordable childcare fees will take food from families' tables. More than half the parents surveyed said the high cost of early learning impacts their weekly grocery budget and how much they can buy. Why is the government making parents choose between food and care during Australia's first recession in 29 years?

         I have not been made aware of the survey. I am not familiar with the group that Senator Bilyk referred to. I think it is important to be clear here about the response that the government has worked through, which is something that's never been done before. Australian families were indeed facing a crisis that was unprecedented. We took an important and temporary measure to help Australian families get through the crisis. We are supporting the childcare sector to keep it strong and to keep its workers employed, both of which are fundamental to any provision of any childcare at all. We also know, as those opposite have raised, that we have seen women do an even more disproportionate share of unpaid caring and domestic work, and that's an issue that we believe needs to be addressed irrespective of COVID-19. We know that working or returning to work needs access to child care.
        </p>
        <p>
         What many service providers and sector peak bodies have told the government is that that rise in demand could not be supported on what were, then, the business continuity payments that formed the basis of the emergency relief package. Parents were also reporting, and I have said this in the chamber before in response to other questions, that they couldn't access the level of care that they needed, into the future, under the relief package as it stood. But we don't believe and we don't agree with those opposite on a number of the points that they have made. Parents who are able to afford to pay for child care, of course, will continue to be expected to do that. That is how the system works. But there are always those, as Senator Bilyk has pointed out, who face further challenges, those who cannot afford it because ofâ€”

            As a government we have put a considerable, greater, contribution into the childcare system in this country. Importantly, in the context of this process, we have also established a transition payment, as it is described. That was the choice between having an ongoing JobKeeper or a 25 per cent subsistence payment to the sector. We are talking about the same amount of support in that context, but it does mean that more employees are able to be helped, and in the consultations that government had with the sector that was seen as the better way forward. So that transition payment of 25 per cent of childcare services fees revenue will continue to support the sector through to 27 September. In fact, it puts $708 million back into the sector as it moves back to the childcare subsidy system. What we have said to providers is that in order to receive the transition payment providers will need to guarantee employment levels to protect staff as they move off JobKeeper.

              Mr Morrison's childcare snapback will hurt family budgets. Mr Morrison's JobKeeper snapback will cost families their jobs. Mr Morrison's jobseeker snapback will see them have a fraction of the support they need. Why is this government determined to hurt Australian families in September?

               Let me repeat that we have put $708 million into the sector as it moves back to the childcare subsidy system, and that is an important contribution from the Commonwealth, recognising a number of the challenges that continue in the sector. I want to be very clear: in terms of continued additional support for families who need it, we are providing a safety net in the form of an additional childcare subsidy for families in financial difficulty. Those families can still receive free care for a maximum of 100 hours per fortnight. The additional childcare subsidy for families transitioning from jobseeker back to work. We are easing the activity test until 4 October to help families whose employment has been affected. They will receive subsidised care as they return to work and study and training. So to ensure the viability of the sector, to ensure that child care can actually be accessed, this is a very important process.
