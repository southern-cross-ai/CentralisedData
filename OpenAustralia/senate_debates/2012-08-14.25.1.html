         I thank Senator Cormann for the question. I do not know how I have managed for the last six weeks without questions from Senator Cormann, but I struggled through! In terms of the

          , I rise on a point of order. It goes to the requirement for the minister to be directly relevant to the question. I asked the minister a very specific question, which was: how much has the government collected in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
           MRRT
          </a>
          revenue in the month of July? There is only one answer to that question that can be directly relevant, and that is a dollar figure in relation to the revenue collected in the month of July. If the minister does not know the answer, she should just say so.

           There is no point of order. I believe the minister is answering the question. The minister has one minute and 30 seconds remaining.

            As I was going on to say, in the last budget we updated and revised the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRRT" rel="nofollow">
             MRRT
            </a>
            revenue to $13.4 billion over the forward estimates. As Senator Cormann well knows from questions in this place and in Senate estimates, the government acknowledges that the revenue take from the MRRT obviously depends on a range of factors such as commodity prices, exchange rates and production volumes. By virtue of being a profit based tax, it is obviously more volatile than other types of revenue.
           </p>
           <p>
            In terms of the quantum, the senator knows that I release monthly statements of the budget. Those are released every month from the preceding month, and he can consider those statements when they are released and made public, as is usually the case. I make this point about the position that Senator Cormann asserts.

             , I raise a point of order on direct relevance. The minister has just told us that she is not going to provide the figure which is the subject of the question. She is now making comment on what she calls the 'position' Senator Cormann asserts. Senator Cormann asserts no position. He merely makes an inquiry which the minister has told us that she is not able to respond to today. Nothing more can be relevant—directly or indirectly.

She made a promise, less than five months ago, to publish monthly updates on revenue collections from the MRRT. Why are you not in a position to do so today?

                       </a>
                       . If that is the case, you would not anticipate the first set of instalments to be paid until October. But, as I said, I will check that because I do not have a comprehensive brief on this issue. But I remind you again that we update our budget figures at each budget update and the mid-year review, and that is more than can be said for any costing that you have ever been involved in.

                           We know that, for all of the chest-beating by those on the other side, that economic team has never come up with a costing that added up. Not once. They go to catering companies and accounting firms who are found to have acted unprofessionally. Not once have their costings added up. And the consequence is: they will have to do far worse than what Premier Baillieu and Premier Newman are already inflicting on their populations.
