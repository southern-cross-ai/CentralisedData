           I thank Senator Bernardi for the question, because Senator Bernardi and I are as one in our desire to ensure that Australian students, whether they are in schools, in training or in universities, are receiving skills and education and training that is relevant to the jobs of today and the jobs of the future. Last week, I was very pleased to join the Prime Minister and the member for Corangamite,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Henderson" rel="nofollow">

           , for the launch of our P-TECH pilot schools. Newcomb Secondary School in Geelong and then subsequently Federation College in Ballarat have been announced as the first P-TECH pilot schools in Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           P-TECH is a very innovative program that the Prime Minister personally brought back from the United States to Australia. Pathways in

           </a>
           nology Early College High School is around the world now and is providing strong linkages between industry, business and high schools. In doing so, it is providing enormous opportunities for students in those schools to benefit from real work-placement opportunities and real industry experience. These two schools—Newcomb in Geelong and Federation College in Ballarat—will benefit enormously from being the first pilot schools that this government rolls out under P-TECH.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am amazed there has not been a warmer reaction to this announcement from some of those opposite, although I did note when it was first indicated last year that we would be pursuing P-TECH there was dissension on the other side. Senator Carr welcomed the announcement while Ms Ellis, the shadow minister for education, criticised the announcement. I hope and trust that those on the other side have lined up their policy to make sure they are supporting this type of innovation in schools that will give students work-ready training and the opportunity for real work placements with local businesses and local employers.

             , who have championed the advancement of P-TECH globally, will be the local partner. IBM will be providing support across both sides and indeed are providing significant financial support that complements the government's own financial support. We are grateful and indebted to these employers for being willing to step forward and provide their time and commitment—

               Senator Cameron is not even interested in the advancement of opportunities for school students, sadly. But these employers are interested and these employers are doing something by giving their time for this important pilot.

                 I am pleased to say these pilots will commence from next year. Students will have the opportunity in 2016 to start streaming through the pathways in technology program in Geelong and Ballarat. This will give the students enormous new opportunities. We are providing support through a contract the government have entered into with the Skilling Australia Foundation, who will be engaging with local communities and with the involved employers and ensuring that teachers, parents and students have the support of the curriculum that they need, that the models that

                 have developed are rolled out in a way that complements the Australian curriculum and Australian learning environments so that we are building on the best of our education system. Local advisory boards will be in place to help both of the pilots operate. I acknowledge the support of the Victorian government in that regard, as well, who are working cooperatively with us because they recognise this initiative, brought to Australia at the instigation personally of Prime Minister Abbott, will provide students in Geelong and Ballarat with the work-ready skills for the future.
