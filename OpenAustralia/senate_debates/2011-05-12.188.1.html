       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Cycling Strategy 2011-2016 notes that the $40 million Commonwealth stimulus funding for cycling infrastructure was significant, but states that more investment is required to 'facilitate real progress on the cycling agenda' (the $40 million stimulus package was administered by the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government):
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Can an outline be provided of the funds allocated to Active transport within the department, including a breakdown of full-time equivalents and work units.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) In relation to the 166 projects funded under the $40 million stimulus funding for the National Bike Paths program: (a) how many total kilometres of bicycle paths were built; and (b) how many jobs did this create.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) In kilometres, what is the current estimate of dedicated bicycle paths that exist in Australia.

         has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I am advised that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Active transport is defined as physical activity undertaken as a means of transport and not purely as a form of recreation. Active transport generally refers to walking and cycling for travel to and/or from a destination, but may also include other activities such as roller blading or use of public transport. Use of public transport is also included in the definition as it often involves some walking or cycling to pick-up and from drop-off points (National Public Health Partnership 2001).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Department can determine projects that are directly related to Active transport but does not hold separate statistics about Active transport related projects that are integrated into larger programs across the Department. Any data would not provide an accurate picture of the proportion of funding used to promote Active transport in individual projects funded through the Department.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) The National Bike Paths program is building aproximately 600kms of bike paths across Australia through 166 contracted projects. As at 1 April 2011, 127 of the completed projects have submitted details of the creation of 1,314 long term, short term, work experience, traineeships and apprentices' jobs. National Bike Paths projects facilitate both Active transport and recreation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The Department is not able to provide an estimate of the number of dedicated bike paths in Australia. In addition to funding through the National Bike Paths program, bike paths are funded and constructed through local governments and state governments and are constructed as on-road line marking and off-road paths.
