        Yesterday, Senator Allison asked me a question without notice in relation to a report of a United Kingdom study of the impact of the British nuclear tests carried out in Australia. That report is yet to be presented to a parliamentary committee; nonetheless, I have obtained further information on that. I table that further information and seek leave to have it incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The information read as follows—

       <p class="italic">
        I have read the newspaper report which appeared in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        ’s

        </a>
        on 16 September 2007 to which Senator Allison refers. The report indicates that the study, prepared by a Dr Chris Busby of the University of Liverpool, is to be presented to a Parliamentary hearing in the UK next month.

       <p class="italic">
        The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs has advised me that his Department is unaware of the detail of this study but has undertaken to monitor the outcome of this work. I would note that at this stage the study does not appear to have been subjected to peer review and has not been published in scientific literature. Until this occurs it is difficult for the veracity of the study to be adequately assessed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am further advised that on 28 June 2006, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        released the findings of the
        <i>
         Mortality and Cancer Incidence
        </i>
        study of Australian participants in the British nuclear test in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although the study did not show an association between the elevated cancer rate and radiation exposure, the Government has decided to provide non-liability health care treatment for all cancers to nuclear test participants.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of this, treatment will now be provided to nuclear test participants for all forms of cancer including: throat cancer, prostate cancer; and skin cancer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This treatment is available to all military personnel, public servants and third party civilian contractors who were present at the nuclear test sites.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Eligible participants will be given a White Card for free cancer treatment.
