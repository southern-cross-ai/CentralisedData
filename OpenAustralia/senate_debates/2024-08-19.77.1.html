        My question is to Minister Wong representing the Prime Minister. Minister, Mr Peter Dutton has set a new low in racism with his disgraceful calls for a blanket entry ban on Palestinians fleeing Israel's genocide in Gaza. With Mr Dutton's history of bigotry, many of us Muslims and people of colour aren't surprised. After all—

          I withdraw. After all, Mr Dutton is a man who suggested it was a mistake to let
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanese_Muslims" rel="nofollow">
           Lebanese Muslims
          </a>
          into this country, whipped up false fears about African gangs in Melbourne and boycotted the apology to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations" rel="nofollow">
           Stolen Generations
          </a>
          . More recently, he said that a government that included Muslims from

           Western Sydney

          would be a disaster. Mr Dutton is totally unfit to be an MP let alone an opposition leader or—God forbid—the Prime Minister. Minister, why won't your government show leadership and call out Mr Dutton's behaviour for what it is—vile, dangerous racism? Why won't you use the 'R' word?

            I think it is disappointing that things that are said by Mr Dutton which we do not support, which do not reflect our policy, our values or our approach, are somehow used in that question as a political attack on the Labor government.
           </p>
           <p>
            What I'd say to you, Senator Faruqi, is what I've said previously when the discussion of racism has occurred over the last decades. When I am asked that question, what I have said is that I do not know what is in people's hearts, but I can look at what they say. I do know also where the words of politicians, and in this case the words of Mr Dutton, land for communities—how people feel when they hear those words. And I know that, when Mr Dutton has an opportunity to bring people together or to divide, he almost always chooses the latter, and you've referenced some of the times we have seen that. We've seen that when he said that welcoming Lebanese refugees was a mistake. We've seen that when he's spread falsehoods about African migrants. We've seen him also say that white
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africans" rel="nofollow">
             South Africans
            </a>
            should have fast tracked visas. I remember also the words of his political hero,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
             John Howard
            </a>
            , when he called for a reduction in Asian immigration because that was bad for social cohesion.
           </p>
           <p>
            So, yes, Senator, I do understand, and so do many of us on this side—I think all of us on this side, but some personally—where these words land and what that means for communities. But what we try to do is to govern—

              Minister, Mr Peter Dutton is unfortunately not the only one spewing racism in this place. We also have Senator Hanson. Almost two years ago, Minister, a parliamentary committee recommended mandatory antiracism training for MPs.

                          Given that the senator has been forced to withdraw two clear breaches of standing orders, where, quite frankly, withdrawing them makes the questions nonsensical, I just wonder whether these questions shouldn't fall over.

                           Thank you, Senator Brockman. I will seek the advice of the Clerk. I advise the chamber that I am advised, about both questions, that questions to ministers, as most senators in here understand, need to go to matters of government, so it is hard to reconcile how those questions from Senator Faruqi go to government policies or government actions or government business. However, as you know has happened in previous cases, I do invite the minister to respond. You've got one second left, Senator Faruqi, so I'm calling it, and I invite the minister, if she wishes to, to respond.

                            What I can say to you is that the government's view is that what politicians should do and what the Labor Party seeks to do is to bring people together. What we seek to do is to work across the diversity of our community, which we see in the diversity of our caucus, and we seek to bring people together. We don't seek to divide. We don't seek to inflame. We seek to govern in the interests of all Australians and we seek to bring people together. We do that for two reasons. One is that that is where our philosophy is, because we believe in collectives. We believe that is the way you find change. That's the way you achieve change.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            The second reason we do it is this goes to the heart of what sort of Australia we want. We want an Australia where the diversity of Australia is seen as a strength. We want an Australia that is unified. We want an Australia that looks to the future positively and optimistically. We do not want a divided Australia, and we will always fight those who seek to divide.

                              found that the government was reluctant to use the word 'racism' and that its preference is for 'social cohesion', which has weakened antiracism work. The problem isn't social cohesion, it is racism, Minister, and your government is only making it worse with your dog whistling on international students and the abandonment of truth telling and treaty. When will you stop hiding behind 'social cohesion' and get serious about tackling racism and mandate antiracism training?

                               I note that the Greens in 2016, under a different leader, promised an Australian centre for social cohesion. I note that Senator Di Natale talked about social cohesion. I note now that somehow that is no longer an appropriate thing to do and we are being criticised for using social cohesion.

                               Whatever the words are, I believe, and we believe, in an Australia where people are not targeted because they are different. I believe in an Australia where people should be brought together. That is what we will always work towards. What I find interesting, Senator Faruqi, is you say these things about Mr Dutton, but you were prepared to work with him and his people on the
