        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. I refer to the recent cancellation of President Yudhoyono’s state visit to Australia. Can the minister confirm that the President’s program included an official welcome, a special cabinet meeting, an official lunch and an address to this parliament? Will the minister please table a copy of the program prepared by the Prime Minister’s department for the state visit?

         I assume this means that the senator is concerned that he might miss out on his lunch! I cannot confirm the particular arrangements you have asked about, Senator, but I would take the view that normally, when a visiting head of state comes to Australia, such arrangements are put in place. I gather that the opposition spokesperson, Ms Julie Bishop, had been briefed and then was out there talking about those arrangements. I am not sure whether she was briefed confidentially or not, but anyway that is for her.
        </p>
        <p>
         I make clear that both the Australian and the Indonesian governments have indicated that the President’s visit to Australia has been accepted but that due to domestic matters and scheduling matters the President will probably take up that invitation next year. According to the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">
           Sydney Morning Herald
          </a>
         </i>
         , the President’s spokesman, Dino Patti Djalal, ‘said suggestions the timing of the visit related to the stand-off involving the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankans" rel="nofollow">
          Sri Lankans
         </a>
         were rubbish’. The spokesman also said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The President has a lot on the domestic agenda. He’s just spent six days in Malaysia and at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
          APEC
         </a>
         . He wants to go to Australia when it can be a fully-focused visit.
        </p>
        <p>
         So my understanding is that the President will visit in the new year. Those arrangements will obviously be finalised and the details announced in due course. I am sure that at that time those sorts of official engagements will occur.

               As I indicated, I am sure that the normal arrangements were being put in place for any planned visit. As I say, those are just normal processes, but it has been made clear that that visit has been delayed. I am not aware of approaches to my office regarding the timing of the visit, but they may well have occurred. I was not aware of any particular invitations. It may be that I was not invited, and that is not uncommon—I tend not to be on the top of the A-list for these social events. If the invitations were made to my office, we would have scheduled those things in, but the key answer is that I am sure normal arrangements were being put in place. The visit has been delayed at the request of the

                  Senator Abetz keeps asking me to give a one-word answer, so the answer is no. I generally try to be more helpful than that to senators. Clearly the relationship between Australia and Indonesia remains very strong. There is constant contact between the President,
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBY" rel="nofollow">
                   SBY

                  , and the Prime Minister. I was speaking to

                  meeting. There are very strong relations. I have not yet had the chance to meet the new immigration minister in Indonesia but I hope to do so soon. He is a new minister. There are very strong government-to-government relations. They have not been damaged by this event, and I am sure we will continue to enjoy very positive and strong relations with this very important neighbour.
