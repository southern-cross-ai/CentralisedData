         To begin with, I'm not aware of the publication that Senator Liddle outlined in her question nor the material as it has been presented, so I think, in the first instance, before being in a position to answer, I would want to see that. I don't think it's unusual that there would be discussion about the Voice over the next few months as we lead up to the referendum. Across this country, I think there will be quite a number of articles written in quite a number of publications as organisations seek to get information out about the Voice and, if they are supporting the Voice, why they are supporting the Voice.

           Yes, it is a point of order. While I appreciate the response in relation to not having seen it, the question does go to whether it is a reasonable representation to just present the yes case.

             I was just going to say that we would want to see that publication before I am in a position to answer the question comprehensively. But I don't think it is unusual that organisations will have a view on the referendum and that they would seek to outline some of the reasons why they have that view. I don't think that is unusual. If there is anything further I can provide, or if that publication that you quote from can be provided, I am happy to come back to the senator.

                (—) (): I don't accept that they are not listening to the local community. There is a difference of opinion across the chamber, as we understand it, between the view that you have around the Voice and the view that we have. We believe the Voice is part of the solution to ensuring that the voices of local communities are heard and that local communities have a say in response to some of the challenges that local communities face and in response to some of the priorities that those communities would seek to have the government's and other organisation's attention paid to. This is fundamental to the request through the Uluru Statement from the Heart about having a Voice, about constitutional recognition and a permanent voice that is able to provide advice that listens to the voices of local communities and is able to provide that to government. It is exactly why we believe it is an important change to get through.
