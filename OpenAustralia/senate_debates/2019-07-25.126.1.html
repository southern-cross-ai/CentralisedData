        My question is to the Minister for Families and Social Services, Senator Ruston. On Tuesday, when asked about the Liberal-National government's targeting of Townsville flood victims as part of its robo-debt program, the minister told the Senate four times—and I quote: 'There has been no debt recovery undertaken in the Townsville area.' Does the minister stand by her statement?

         I thank Senator Green for her follow-up question in relation to this matter. As I advised the senator in the chamber on Wednesday, following her question on Tuesday, I contacted and spoke to the mayor of Townsville, Mayor Jenny Hill, and explained to her that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Social Services
         </a>
         had not commenced debt recovery in the Townsville area, and I expressed to the mayor that there was no intention for that to occur.
        </p>
        <p>
         I did, however, say at the time—and I also relayed this information to the senator opposite on Wednesday—that if there had been any instance of debt recovery in Townsville, and they were aware of it, that they should please bring it to my attention so that I can take action, because I stand by my comments that no debt recovery has commenced in Townsville. If, by some fluke or accident, a debt recovery action has been undertaken of which I am unaware, I wish to know it so that I can stop it.

           Despite the minister giving her assurance to the Senate four times, the minister's own department has directly contradicted the minister, telling the
           <i>

           that compliance activity has resumed this month. Can the minister explain to the Senate why her own department contradicted her, only one day after she gave assurances to the Senate?

            I thank the senator for her question. I will reiterate my comments: I give an absolute undertaking to this chamber that debt recovery has not commenced in Townsville, and if my agency, or any agency that falls within my portfolio, has made that comment then they were wrong. It has not commenced and it will not be commencing in the foreseeable future.

                 In response to your question, as I said to an earlier question, to the best of my knowledge, there has been no debt recovery action taken in Townsville. However, as I said to Mayor Hill and to you in this chamber, privately and on camera: if you have any instance at all then please provide me with the evidence and I will ensure that it is immediately stopped. If you have any evidence at all of anybody in the Townsville area having received a debt recovery notice, could you please bring it to my attention and I will ensure it is immediately stopped.
