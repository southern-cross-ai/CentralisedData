        My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Hasn’t the government had an array of different positions on carbon trading over the past 10 years, including: rejecting proposals for putting a price on carbon in 1997 and in 2003; the minister himself and the Treasurer saying that Australia will only join a global trading scheme in the long term; the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources saying we might join a regional trading scheme in the medium term; and the Prime Minister, under political pressure last year, setting up a committee?

             As I said in my answer to Senator Evans, this government has a focus on the national interest in ensuring that, as we address the evolving science on climate change and evolving international responses to climate change, we keep an eye to Australia’s national interest, something the Labor Party seems to have forgotten with its environment spokesman running around saying that we have to be shut down the Australian coal industry. We will not do that. We will ensure that, whatever we do in making sure Australia contributes to international efforts to contain greenhouse gas emissions, we preserve the national interest and that we look after Australian workers, unlike the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Labor Party
             </a>
             , which is all too ready to abandon Australian workers whenever it suits them and when they want Greens preferences. So much of what we hear from the Labor Party is nothing more than a naked grab for Greens preferences in a desperate bid to get over the line. They will abandon the workers like they did in the 2004 election if they think it will get them Greens preferences. That is what we have seen from Mr Garrett in his abandoning of people in the coal industry. The coal industry is a vital industry in this country and one of the biggest export earners we have. We are not going to abandon them simply to chase votes like the Australian Labor Party.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the meantime, we will take a realistic, pragmatic and sensible approach to this issue. The science on climate change has been evolving. The fact of Australia’s position is that it contributes just over one per cent of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions that the world emits. Yes, we can make a contribution. Yes, we are leading on many issues in relation to this matter. Yes, we adopted a Kyoto target of 108 per cent which we are going to achieve. We have spent nearly $2 billion to achieve that target. We are proud of our record on this issue. We are not going to abandon Australian workers or risk the foundations of this economy like the Labor Party in a blind chase for Greens preferences.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Don’t most companies now see it as inevitable that a national carbon trading scheme will be introduced in Australia? Haven’t many been including a notional carbon price in their feasibility planning for a number of years? Why can’t the government see what every major corporation can, that setting a price on carbon is inevitable and ultimately in our national interest?

               This is really an idiotic question because we have established a national and highly qualified expert task force to examine this. This is an extremely complicated matter.

                The European

We are going to get this right. The report will be with us on 31 May and we will announce the outcome after that. We are taking considered, solid steps to ensure that, if we are going to go down this path, we do it sensibly and do not end up like the Europeans with a scheme which has collapsed in on itself.
