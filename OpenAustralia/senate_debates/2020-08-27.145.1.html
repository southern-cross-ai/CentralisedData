        I have some further information with respect to Kalyna Care, which I said I'd bring back to the chamber. The department and the local PHU were notified of the outbreak at Kalyna Care on 27 July. As I said in my answer, the facility was primarily staffed by the provider until we brought in workforce from 1 August. We had
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Healthcare" rel="nofollow">

        testing staff and residents on site from 28 July. Between 27 July and 31 July, nine staff tested positive, but no residents. The first resident to test positive at Kalyna Care tested positive on 1 August.

           Again we've had the embarrassing situation where the minister has had to come back to the chamber to give basic details that he was unaware of during question time today. But, more importantly, in the minister's presentation during question time, he was again completely unable to give any explanation of why aged-care workers were left without adequate
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
            PPE
           </a>
           . We have had reports to the government's own royal commission that aged-care workers were left with only one glove and only two face masks, and there is the incredible admission from the minister that the government only thought about ensuring that aged-care facilities had adequate PPE after an outbreak had occurred. The entire point of PPE is to keep an outbreak out of an aged-care facility. It's too late once it has got into a facility, and if you're then leaving staff with only one glove and two face masks, that's only going to make the situation it worse. Again, the government has failed.
