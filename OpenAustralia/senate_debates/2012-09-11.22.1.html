        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. I refer to the 900 job losses in Australia's second largest export sector announced by Australia's two largest coal producers yesterday. Can the minister confirm that, consistent with the government's assumptions in its 2012-13 budget, Australia's coal producers are required to pay carbon taxes in excess of $2.7 billion over the next three years even after taking into account the assistance provided under the coal sector jobs package? Can the minister nominate a single top-10 coal-producing country in the world that currently applies, or plans to introduce, a carbon tax on fugitive emissions generated by the mining of coal, as is imposed under the Labor-Greens carbon tax? If not, how can the government possibly think it is fair to make Australian exporters less competitive internationally and to put workers' jobs at risk as a direct result of its carbon tax?

                           This is a new point of order. This issue was not raised by Senator Wong. In truth, the question that was asked should have been directed at the representative, me, handling climate change, and not to the Treasurer. It was clearly a question about climate change. Although the sceptics on the other side do not believe it, they did ask a question about the carbon price and the question should be directed to me.

                             . That in fact is what I was going on to say: that I am happy to take those aspects of the question which are properly directed to the Treasurer's portfolio. However, I would have thought that the extent of the carbon price being paid by particular coalmines is clearly a matter within the climate change portfolio. In fact, I answered maybe 100 or 200 of those questions previously.

                             But in relation to the issue of jobs and job losses I would make this point: we have an unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent. I have recently returned from a trip overseas, including to the

                             finance ministers meeting, and let me tell you that there is no other advanced economy that can look at an unemployment rate like the one Australia has. No other advanced economy has grown 11 per cent since prior to the global financial crisis. So those opposite might like to come in here and talk gloom and doom when it comes to jobs and investment, and talk down the economy because they think it is in their political interest. We will get on with the job of creating jobs.

                              , I rise on a point of order. My point of order is that the minister is not being directly relevant to the question. The question was directed to the effect of the carbon tax assumptions in the budget on employment. The minister has not addressed the issue of the effect of the carbon tax assumptions in the budget on unemployment.

They believe it is in their political interest to talk down the Australian economy. The only people who are pleased with job losses are those on that side, because they think it is in their political interest. But if he really wants to learn about job losses I suggest that Senator Cormann wanders along to Queensland and has a chat to Mr Abbott's mate, Premier Newman, as he busily gets rid of—

                                 , I ask a supplementary question. When Treasury assessed the economic and fiscal impact of the carbon tax, did they consider that the European emissions trading scheme does not apply to the fugitive emissions from coalmining? Did Treasury consider that the Chinese, Indonesian and Colombian coalmining sectors do not pay, or expect to pay, a carbon price on their fugitive emissions? And did Treasury consider that the American surface coalmines are not even required to report fugitive emissions, let alone pay carbon tax on them?

                                        , I rise on a point of order. As you have ruled before on several occasions, it is not proper for ministers to comment on the questions. The question that Senator Cormann asked had three parts, and each was directed to an inquiry as to whether Treasury—whom this minister represents here—took into consideration certain international comparators. She has not approached the question. She has done nothing but indicate that she is not prepared to answer the question because she asserts it should have been addressed to another minister. The fact is that only this minister can tell the Senate what Treasury took into account.

It contains a great deal of information, including the assumptions about policy action taken in other countries.

                                           , I ask a further supplementary question. In this context, I refer the minister to her response to my question yesterday, when she said she stands by the Treasury modelling of the carbon tax. Does that mean the minister stands by the warning in the Treasury modelling that the Australian mining sector will experience a significant decline in rates of return and that investment in coalmining will fall by nearly 13 per cent by 2020? How can Australians avoid the conclusion that this government is knowingly and recklessly destroying jobs in Australia's second most important export sector?

                                            If Senator Cormann wants to talk about destroying jobs, I suggest he go to Queensland and talk to Premier Newman and the thousands of public servants he said he would not sack and is now proposing to sack. He wants to ask about jobs. How many jobs have been created since we came to government? How much investment is there?

He narrows it to the one thing that has stuck in his mind, rather than the broader question that, it seems, has been asked time and time again. Senator Wong is referring to—

If she were allowed to continue, you might get some of the question answered.
