        (1) What is the government’s policy on the disclosure of details to the public and media regarding soldiers wounded in Afghanistan.

       <p class="italic">
        (2) While the numerical total of soldiers wounded in Afghanistan is disclosed, have there been instances wherein the details about the timing and nature of those wounds has remained ambiguous; if so, can an explanation be provided.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Will the Minister retroactively correct the public record as to how and when each individual was wounded.

         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Defence aims to provide public information on every operational incident involving battle casualties (wounded and killed in action). Operational tempo, ongoing operations and special operations are three factors which may lead to occasional differences in the timing and detail of reporting. However, media information about casualty figures are updated as appropriate when operational circumstances permit.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Defence guidance on the release of public information during incidents includes:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         (ADF) will not release the names of casualties until Next of Kin (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOK" rel="nofollow">
          NOK
         </a>
         ) notification procedures have been completed.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) The ADF will not comment on the circumstances or causes of an incident until any investigation has been completed and if it is likely to be subjected to disciplinary proceedings.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) In order to align with the civilian practice for reporting patient medical condition without compromising the medical-in-confidence nature of the wounds and injuries, Defence has adopted a nomenclature for public information relating to battle casualties.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Public release of names:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Names of ADF members (not afforded protected identity status) remaining in an operational area following an announced wounding or injury will not be released.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Names of ADF members (not afforded protected identity status) returning to Australia for treatment will remain protected until authorised for release by the individual member concerned. Names of ADF deceased will be released in consultation with the member’s family.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) Only Special Forces soldiers, who have protected identity status, may have their names withheld when they are admitted into non-military hospitals.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) There is no policy to hide the identity of other Australian soldiers undergoing medical treatment and rehabilitation in private or public hospitals.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defence" rel="nofollow">
          The Defence
         </a>
         website carries the latest statistics of ADF fatalities and casualties, including a year-by-year breakdown of these incidents. Delays in reporting fatalities and casualties can occur for a range of reasons:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Defence will, as a matter of policy, seek only to confirm fatalities and casualties following next of kin notification.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Delays in reporting can also occur for operational security reasons and releasing information close to the time of the incident would place ADF personnel at an increased risk of harm.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) Delays in reporting can also occur when an ADF member presents some time after the wounding occurred. This has occurred recently for example following delayed onset of symptoms.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The Department of Defence is currently conducting a detailed investigation of its casualty records for Afghanistan, which were created prior to the standing up of Headquarter Joint Operations Command in late 2009. Prior to this time the Department did not have in place a consistent and unified process of collating and releasing information. Where an error in public reporting, e.g. the number of wounding incidents, has occurred the public record will be corrected.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Where there have been historical inconsistencies with how personnel wounded in action in Afghanistan has been publicly reported, it does not detract from the care provided to wounded soldiers, and where required the ongoing rehabilitation of individuals who were wounded during their service to the nation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Defence’s reporting of fatalities and casualties seeks to strike a balance between meeting the public interest in reporting fatalities and casualties, while respecting the individual rights of ADF personnel to privacy and confidentiality.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It is always the intent of Defence to disclose information that is in the public interest. The current policy and practice of reporting battle casualties (wounded and killed in action) provides sufficient information to the Australian public without compromising the medical-in-confidence and personal privacy of the individuals involved.
