           The set of documents requested in this motion is incredibly broad. It would require significant diversion of resources for the department to undertake searches and compile all this information. The

           has conducted more than 75 consultation meetings with stakeholders since late March 2023 on the measures being considered for introduction to parliament in the second half of 2023. Over 160 written submissions from organisations have also been received. This is in addition to meetings that Minister Burke's office has facilitated with stakeholders. Consultations facilitated by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations were led by senior departmental officers, with policy and legal experts attending to discuss the measures. Feedback from participants was that the level of detail provided was useful and that discussions were informative. Consultation is exactly that. We are talking to all relevant stakeholders about these proposed reforms. It would not be consultation if the policy position were settled before we consulted.

            The question before the Senate is that the motion standing in the name of Senator Cash for the production of documents in relation to the proposed workplace relations bill, as moved by Senator Cadell, be agreed to.
