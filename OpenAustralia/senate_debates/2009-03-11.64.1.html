            Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: I do object to a process whereby a senator puts forward a proposal on the basis that a future action of the Senate be anticipated otherwise that proposal is not dealt with. In good faith, I can tell the senator that we will not, and would not, object to an amendment being put under these circumstancesâ€”but conditional? No, we do not accept that condition; we just give him that assurance.

             On that, Mr Deputy President: I think Senator Bob Brown has a good point. I took it that

              Senator Fielding
             </a>
             was in fact asking for leave and, on that basis, we would always grant leave to move an amendment in this chamber; that is how the chamber works. If it has been badly put by Senator Fielding, I am sure he can correct the record about that.

              You may note that is why I sought advice from the Clerk, because it was conditional leave. I will put the question again. Is there any objection to this motion being taken as formal? There being none, I call Senator Milne to move the motion.

                 by leaveâ€”This is a quite extraordinary proposal being put forward by

                 . I presume, but I do not know, that it means that the Independents have not been able to determine who should be on the committee. But the way to resolve that is not by giving a quite untoward representation to my Independent colleagues. The equivalent would be to add all five Greens. If we follow through on that logic, we should hold the committee in here, of the whole Senate, and make sure that everybody gets an opportunity. These are difficult matters. I have been in this position before when, as the single Greens senator, I could not get onto the committee I wanted to. You have to accept that. I guess I am foreshadowing that the Greens will not support this process, for very important procedural reasons in this place.

                  by leaveâ€”I thank Senator Bob Brown for reminding us of the good old days. More seriously, can I say from the oppositionâ€™s point of view that we love Senator Xenophon and
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
                   Senator Fielding
                  </a>
                  dearly and we would love to have them both on the committee, but the reality is, and the practice has been, as Senator Brown has outlined. Given that there is unable to be a resolution between Senator Xenophon and Senator Fielding of who out of the two Independents should be on the committee, that is a matter of regret. But that is the motion that I jointly sponsored with Senator Milne and we are minded, therefore, to continue with the motion as is, which of course has the unfortunate and regrettable consequence of voting against Senator Fieldingâ€™s amendment. We would invite him to understand, though, that the reason we are doing that is simply because of the way these matters have been dealt with in the past and not for any other reason. Of course, the best resolution from the coalitionâ€™s point of view would be if you, Senator Fielding, and Senator Xenophon could come to an agreement between the two of youâ€”but I think that might require pistols at 20 paces, which I am sure is against standing orders. Accordingly, the Senate will undoubtedly need to resolve it by ballot later on.

                   by leaveâ€”I would seek to remind the Senate that Senator Abetz and I, in moving this motion, have included a clause which is unusual in establishing a committee of this kind in that it provides for anyone to choose to be a participating member of this committee. The issue there is that we did not want to exclude anyone from participating in the hearings of the committee and being able to exercise their rights as a senator. So I put that to the Senate, in case people were not aware of it. Nobody is being excluded in that context.

                    by leaveâ€”I appreciate the love and response from Senator Abetz. I am not so sure that we would go kissing with each other, mate, but I appreciate the loving feeling. The real problem is that I wear glasses and Senator Xenophon does not, so at 20 paces I may not be able to shoot that straight! The issue at hand is: do we have the right emissions trading scheme for this country? For the next decade, the emissions trading scheme will be the biggest reform we have had in this country and it will affect every single Australianâ€”yet we will not have each political party or interest across the Senate being represented on the select committee. I take up the Greens on their statement that you can be a participating member. Maybe the Greens want to give up their spot around the table and become a participating member and allow Senator Xenophon and me to participate as full members of the committee. Maybe that could be a way of solving it for me. If they think participating members are that valuable, then they can go down that track. I appeal to the chamber: this is an absolutely key piece of legislation that will affect every single Australian, not just for this year and next year but for the next decade, and we need to get it right. You need to make sure you have all the views across the chamber and that they are able to be expressed by full members of this particular committee. As senators are going to vote on this issue, I appeal to them to give that full consideration.
