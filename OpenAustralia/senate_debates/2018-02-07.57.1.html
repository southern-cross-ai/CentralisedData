         Thank you, Senator Polley, for your question. However, I'm going to have to completely reject the assumptions on which your question is based—the assumption that there are cuts to the Commonwealth government's investment, our ongoing increasing, record level of Commonwealth funding to every single state and every single territory, year on year. In fact, when I look at the figures, as far as the eye can see there's increasing funding. That's going to mean more doctors, more nurses, more services and more surgeries in public hospitals right across this nation. And that's a good story, because our world-class health system in this nation is underpinned by the partnership that exists between our Commonwealth health system and indeed our state governments.
        </p>
        <p>
         But when we look at Labor and your phantom funding—I mean, really. Let's go to shadow minister King's tragedy of a press conference this morning. Whoever the reporter is, whoever it is out there, please make yourself known; some fantastic questions were asked, questions that the shadow minister did not have the answers to, questions about: how was Labor going to fund its phantom funding? But, again—like the Gonski promise, like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         promise—nada, nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm very happy to go to the Labor Party's most important policy document, and it's shadow minister King's 'National platform on health', 18 pages of some really interesting things around the health portfolio. Promoting wellness, preventing disease, some great initiatives—no dollars. When we go to public funding for hospitals—

           , on a point of order: the minister has been asked a question about the Turnbull government's health policies. She is straying very far from that and, indeed, she has not addressed the issue at all in relation to the leaked

             On the point of order: the question that was asked was in relation to alleged funding cuts. The minister directly answered that question in referring to funding increases. Indeed, of course, funding increased by 73 per cent compared to Labor's last-year budget for 2020-21. The minister was being directly relevant to the question.

                             We've given this minister a number of opportunities. The point of order is direct relevance. She's been asked whether she agrees with the call of the AMA for the government to lift public hospitals out of the current funding crisis, which is putting patients at risk. How is talking about opposition policy on private health insurance possibly relevant to that question?

                              was 'agree with the AMA'. I remind her of the question asked by Senator Polley. There was a bit of noise in the chamber; I didn't hear what came after that phrase. I remind Senator McKenzie of the question with 26 seconds left to answer.
