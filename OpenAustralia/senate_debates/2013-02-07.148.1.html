        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Bob Carr. I refer the minister to the government's decision to cancel the $225 million contract to buy self-propelled howitzers from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        . Does the minister stand by his response to Senator Nash's question last year, that there would be no trade fallout from this cancelled contract, which, in his words 'did not figure' in the minister's many discussions with Korean government representatives?

         I repeat what I said in two answers to this question last year, and that is that in meetings between me and the foreign minister of

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister's answer, can the minister explain why, then, in my recent visit to Korea, Korean government representatives actually expressed to me great disappointment with the Australian government's decision to cancel the

           SPH

           , this was not raised. And how you, as an opposition spokesperson, could talk about 'sovereign risk' in Australia when no country on the face of the planet would offer a better investment climate, I do not know. To talk up the sovereign risk of your own country I think is a very dubious and shameful strategy. None of Australia's interlocutors would suggest for a moment there is sovereign risk about doing business in this country, yet you as an opposition say, 'Oh, sovereign risk in Australia'! The fact is, jobs in this country are to a large extent sustained by the flow of foreign investment and by the high reputation Australia—

               The reason for this decision on howitzers was announced by the Minister for Defence. In October 2009 the government announced it would acquire four batteries of lightweight towed howitzers, and the government announced the cancellation of the acquisition of self-propelled on the highest advice of the people in the armed forces. Was it supposed to do a different thing? Was it supposed to ignore that advice it received from the highest levels of the ADF on the recommendation of Defence—
