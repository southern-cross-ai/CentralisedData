        My question is to Senator Ian Campbell, representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. I refer the minister to the decision by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Civil Aviation Safety Authority
        </a>
        on 25 November to suspend the air operator’s certificate of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockhart_River" rel="nofollow">
         Lockhart River
        </a>
        tragedy airline, Transair, meaning that all its flights are grounded effective yesterday, 27 November, for five days. I also refer the minister to Senator Abetz’s answer on his behalf on 6 November this year with regard to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
         CASA
        </a>
        ’s scrutiny of Transair, when he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The director of aviation safety has assured himself that there is no imminent threat which would prevent Transair flights continuing at this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will the minister now identify the ‘serious and imminent’ risk to air safety which is noted in the suspension notice? Why were such risks not identified until after 6 November, and can the minister also give an assurance that the Civil Aviation Safety Authority will apply to the Federal Court to ensure that the airline remains grounded?

         I am sure that Senator Abetz, who was representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, provided the Senate with very accurate information from a brief prepared in consultation with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
          CASA
         </a>
         at the time. I am sure that between 6 November and 27 November things have probably changed, because I am absolutely certain that Senator Abetz’s information to the Senate at that time would have been accurate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Transair has ceased operations today as a result of a decision by CASA to suspend their air operator’s certificate with immediate effect. CASA was recently provided with new and credible information relating to the safety of Transair’s operations, and CASA’s attempts to verify this information were resisted by Transair. That is what has happened between 6 November and 27 November, and that is why Senator Abetz was absolutely accurate then and this response, to the best of my advice, will be accurate now.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pending further investigation, CASA has formed the view that continued operation by Transair would pose a serious and imminent risk to air safety. CASA’s decision to suspend the Transair air operator’s certificate takes immediate effect and remains in effect for five business days. CASA has five business days—that is, until Friday 1 December—to make an application to the Federal Court for an order to continue the suspension to allow for further investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Until the suspension of its air operator’s certificate, Transair operated
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Sky_Express" rel="nofollow">
          Big Sky Express
         </a>
         services via Sydney to Inverell, Gunnedah, Grafton and Taree. Transair also operated aircraft on behalf of Aerotropics providing services to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Far North Queensland
         </a>
         . The government is concerned about the impact of the grounding of Transair on regional services in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Queensland, and I urge the aviation industry to look at putting in place alternative arrangements. Transair is not contracted by the Australian government to provide air services to remote communities under our Remote Air Service Subsidy Scheme. Aviation safety must, as always, be the primary concern for all.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I again ask the minister to give an assurance that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
           CASA
          </a>
          will apply to the Federal Court to ensure that this airline remains grounded under the provisions of the act, as it can. Isn’t it the case that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
           Civil Aviation Safety Authority
          </a>
          has repeatedly refused to listen to claims about Transair’s risky operations? Apparently now they have started to. Doesn’t this backflip by CASA demonstrate why Australians are losing confidence in the aviation safety regulator?

           I do not think that Australians are losing confidence, as much as Senator O’Brien works most of his time trying to undermine confidence. I think that we have a very good civil aviation regulator in place and the people who work there are very dedicated Australian public servants who care deeply about the safety of the people who fly around Australia’s skies. They know, as I do, that regional Australia exists on the back of a sound aviation sector which is properly regulated. They have acted properly in this area. They will make their decision about Federal Court action. They are entirely the appropriate people to do that.
