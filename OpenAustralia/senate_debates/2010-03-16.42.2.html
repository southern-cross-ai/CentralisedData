          by leave—It seems, Senator Brown, that there may have been an oversight. I asked my staff to contact the various Independents, and obviously the Greens as well, to indicate that I sought from those opposite additional time to deal with government business in the program this week. It involved two 30-minutes slots for government documents. The opposition indicated that that was okay and, on that basis, I proceeded with the motion. I also seek your concurrence so that we can deal with some of the legislative program this week and allow debate.

           by leave—I will agree to that move, but I must say here that this is effectively the government taking one hour of time when members can discuss government documents to give to government business. But there is no reciprocation from the government here on private members’ business so that the big backlog of bills—and some of them are very important pieces of legislation that are not the government’s—get a go. I say to the government that it is testing the Senate to be simply expanding government business in a year in which it sets sittings at an almost record low period of time without any quid pro quo for proper consideration of the pile-up of legislation that comes from members other than the government in this place.

            by leave—I have just been informed that we are doing it a day at a time. So I seek to amend my motion by striking out ‘and tomorrow’. It relates only to half an hour today. I will be thankful to the Senate for even agreeing to that much. I move the motion as amended:
           </p>
           <p class="moved">
            That the consideration of government documents be not proceeded with today and that government business continue until 7.20 pm.
