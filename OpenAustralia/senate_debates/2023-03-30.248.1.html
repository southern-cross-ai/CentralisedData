        The Albanese Labor government has not stopped implementing positive reforms since we formed government. In the past two days, we've witnessed again a commitment to the Australian people to continue the path down economic security and opportunity with action to transition our economy to net zero.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese Labor government's safeguard mechanism reforms have now passed the House of Representatives and the Senate. This puts Australia much closer to net zero by 2050 and closer to cutting our emissions by 205 million tonnes by 2030. That's equivalent to taking two-thirds of the nation's cars off the road over the same period. This is a long-overdue reform which will keep Australian businesses competitive, decarbonising the global economy whilst reducing emissions. The Albanese government's plan is to look for future opportunities, for good environmental opportunities and for good jobs. All of this is very good for our economy. Being in government is about making the tough decisions and displaying leadership at home and abroad. Taking decisive action to reduce emissions and follow the rest of the world isn't just about being a good global citizen; it's about investing in upskilling the secure and renewable jobs of the future. It's about securing our economic future as a nation and not being left behind. Action on climate change will prepare our economy for the future, and I urge those opposite to get on board.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is also ensuring responsible cost-of-living relief because we know people are doing it tough in communities right across our country. Australians are doing it tough. That's why we are implementing cheaper child care, cheaper medicine and direct energy bill relief in the second Albanese-Chalmers Labor budget in May. Our fee-free

        policy for students across the country is investing in Australians. We're delivering our 'Made in Australia' commitment with the National Reconstruction Fund, which will assist businesses like Waverley Woollen Mills in my home state of Tasmania. We are addressing the homelessness crisis with more affordable housing and with our Housing Australia Future Fund. Those opposite talk often in this place about how expensive life is becoming and the cost-of-living crisis in Australia, but there's nothing more fundamental in helping Australians than providing a roof over their heads, providing an opportunity for those women and children who are fleeing domestic violence to have an affordable home.
       </p>
       <p>
        You can't on one hand talk about these important issues without being prepared to address them and find solutions. We in government have legislation ready in relation to the Housing Australia Future Fund—$10 billion we prepared to back our policy—but we need those opposite to support that legislation. You can't just come in here and oppose everything, because you are getting to be known as the opposition of no policy. No policy, no action. I'm urging Mr Dutton to bring the Liberals and the coalition into both chambers to support good policy. Support the Housing Australia Future Fund that will deliver affordable housing and provide opportunities for people not only to have affordable houses but to establish a home for their family. That is so important.
       </p>
       <p>
        That needs leadership. The only political party at this point in time that is showing leadership to resolve the housing crisis we have is the Albanese Labor government. You can't come into this chamber and vote against energy bills that are going to give relief to Australians and their energy prices. You can't come in here and talk about your concern about jobs and skills if you're not prepared to support the National Reconstruction Fund. You have opposed both of those measures. You're not prepared at this point in time to support people to get an affordable home. What you are doing is adding the real, serious risk of higher inflation for much longer. You are damaging our economy and you are damaging Australia.
