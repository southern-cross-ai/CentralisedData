         I thank Senator Keneally for her question. I don't have a full brief on this matter, but let me provide the information that I do have to the Senate. As I understand it, the

         minister for health wrote to the Commonwealth minister for health, Minister Hunt, on 11 August and was responded to by phone on the same day. That was followed up by phone on 12 August, with a formal reply sent by letter on 13 August. This fact has been acknowledged and confirmed by Mr Hazzard on several occasions. On 12 August, at a press conference, Minister Hazzard, I am advised, said: 'They responded very quickly and I think Minister Hunt responded within minutes to say they would see what they could do to try to get onto it. So we just have to hope everyone's got enough staff and enough vaccines to be able to get up there and do what we need to do.' On 13 August, Mr Hazzard said: 'They've stepped up. Minister Hunt responded quite quickly. I think it was within an hour or two he responded to me and indicated that they would have the appropriate committees put in place to get the ADF working with the public health network up there with the western New South Wales local health district.'

           I do appreciate the minister's information. However—and this is a point of order on relevance—the question specifically was about

            Western Sydney

            Senator Keneally, with respect, there was a preamble to the question. The minister outlined at the beginning that they were providing the information they had available. I would be reluctant to rule what the minister is saying as not in order given the question.

                      Senator Keneally, I'm going to remind senators, when they stand to raise a point of order: don't just go straight to restating the question. At least try and have a semblance of the standing orders by mentioning a standing order. Senator Keneally, I have ruled before that, when questions are politically loaded, a minister can respond in kind. Your earlier questions were specific, and I think a lot of specific information was provided. There's an opportunity to debate them after question time, but that had loaded language, and the minister is in order in responding.
