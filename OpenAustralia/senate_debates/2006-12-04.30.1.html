       <p>
        On Friday, at the time for the adjournment debate, Senator Moore, in the chair, undertook to refer to me a point of order taken by Senator Bob Brown to the effect that certain words uttered by Senator Ian Campbell were offensive under standing order 193 and should be withdrawn.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Campbell ascribed certain policies to the Greens. Statements about the effects of the policies of parties which are regarded by the parties concerned as incorrect or misleading are usually dealt with by way of claims of misrepresentation and correction in debate. This is how Senator Brown initially referred to Senator Campbellâ€™s remarks on Friday, and how such remarks have been dealt with in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        On this occasion, some difficulty was created by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_the_Whole" rel="nofollow">
         Committee of the Whole
        </a>
        reporting progress and the adjournment debate commencing before Senator Brown could respond in debate in Committee of the Whole. In other possible situations it may be difficult for a senator claiming misrepresentation to make a response as early as the senator would like.
       </p>
       <p>
        Claims about the effects of the policies of parties, however, should continue to be dealt with as matters of misrepresentation and correction in debate rather than offensive words under standing order 193. That standing order should be reserved for its intended purpose of avoiding words which are personally offensive within the meaning of the standing order.

          Mr President
         </a>
         , if I may respond to your ruling, that was the point that I made clear in this place on Friday: the words used by Senator Ian Campbell were personally offensive to me. From the chair, Acting Deputy President Moore asked for those words to be withdrawn. Senator Campbell did not withdraw the words and I remain offended. It is not a matter of debate on policy. The senator made an accusation against me which was untruthful and highly offensive to me personally. Mr President, I ask you to look again at the matter and rule that section 193(3) of the standing orders has been breached by Senator Campbell, with the particular use of the words that I referred to, and that Senator Campbell is requested to withdraw those words because they are highly offensive.

          I was not here, and we have reviewed the
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          . I have taken advice and that is why I gave the ruling I did today. I will have another look at the matter in the light of what you have just pointed out, but my understanding is that it was a misrepresentation rather than an offensive word.
