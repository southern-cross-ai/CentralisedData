         I am not sure why the Liberal senators will not ask Senator Wong questions about this—probably because she beats them up so badly. It is my great pleasure to answer the question. I note again that Senator Birmingham has amnesia, like all Liberal members who forget that they went to the last election supporting an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">
          ETS
         </a>
         , arguing for an ETS and promising the Australian people that they would deliver it. Even a conservative like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          John Howard
         </a>
         recognised the impact of climate change and he went to the election. Senator Birmingham and the rest of the Liberal opposition promised the Australian people that you would support an ETS. You also indicated when we first introduced this legislation that you would be supporting it. Up until a month or two ago you were supporting it, but now apparently it will result in the end of the world as we know it. Of course that is nonsense.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have undertaken to fully compensate Australian families for the costs of our ETS and 92 per cent of the families will receive full compensation and working families in Australia will have those costs met. That is in sharp contrast to yesterday’s con, yesterday’s stunt, by Mr Abbott in which he suddenly announced that $11 billion over 10 years would magically arrive and would be paid for under the ‘forces of greed’. According to the finance spokesman, polluters will get access to $11 billion of whose money? Taxpayers’ money. So do not talk to me about a tax! The $11 billion of taxpayers’ money will allow people through their ‘actions of greed’, as you describe it—what a disgrace!—

                  , on the point of order: there is no point of order. The minister has been directly answering the question. Those opposite may not like the answer to the question, but it is an abuse of process to stand up and object on the basis that they do not particularly like the answer. The minister has been directly relevant to the question. He has been dealing with the question and the policy of this government on climate change—unlike those opposite.

                        , taxpayers understand that when an opposition party promises to spend $11 billion of taxpayers’ money it has got to come from somewhere. Your finance spokesman was not able to explain where it came from, but taxpayers know: $11 billion out of their taxes.

                          As the senator knows, our plan was costed by Treasury. The compensation package was costed. It has all been out on the public record for months and months. We have debated this twice in this parliament. On two occasions it was your intention to vote for it. Now you have joined the climate deniers, Senator Birmingham.

                          is no longer; it is back to being the conservative party. The deniers like Senator Minchin are in charge, Mr Abbott describes climate change as ‘crap’, and now you pretend you have got a policy to deal with it. The Australian taxpayers know you are going to spend $11 billion of their money, with no compensation.

                            policy makes it clear that the big polluters will not pay. There will be no cap on emissions. The big polluters will get access to $11 billion of taxpayers’ money, with no compensation. You have no credibility.
