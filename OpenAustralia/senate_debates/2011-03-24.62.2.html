           I rise to say that the Greens will be opposing the establishment of this select committee on Australia’s food processing sector. We do so noting that the coalition had a select committee on food production, which went for a couple of years at least in the Senate, chaired by Senator Heffernan. I am unaware of any recommendation of that committee being carried out or fulfilled in any shape or form. I note that, when I moved in this chamber for a recommendation to reinstate antidiscrimination provisions, the coalition voted against it having agreed in a tripartite report, I might say, to have that as one of the recommendations that came out of the dairy inquiry. The appropriate place for this kind of investigation is the Senate Standing Committees on Rural Affairs and Transport. That is where we would normally do this kind of thing and this will just be yet another coalition based committee. I think it is not an appropriate use of the resources of the committee system. It should go to one of the existing committees.

             <p>
              I wish to indicate that the government will be opposing this motion. The government has already embarked on a comprehensive range of work on food related issues in Australia. The Australian government is developing a national food plan encompassing Australia’s food supply chain. The plan is expected to have a broad scope including issues such as food security, productivity and efficiency; sustainability; health and nutrition in general; and economic policy relating to the food sector.
             </p>
             <p>
              In conjunction with the national food plan the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research has established a food-processing industry strategy group to develop a long-term strategy for an innovative, sustainable, responsive and globally competitive Australian food-processing centre. The group is comprised of industry leaders across the field as well as academic and union representatives. The terms of reference for the proposed Senate inquiry overlap substantially with this strategy group.
             </p>
             <p>
              Other recent or current initiatives in the field include a review of food security in Australia by the Prime Minister’s Science, Engineering and Innovation Council, the report of an independent committee on food labelling, the 2008 national food regulation agreement and the current Senate inquiry into the dairy industry, which is the second in recent years. A further inquiry by the Senate will only create confusion and duplication as well as absorbing government and industry resources already working on food industry issues.

                 Specifically in relation to Senator Feeney’s statement, I reject that the government has exclusive right to undertake processes to look at particular issues that might be of interest to the Australian community or to the parliament. This is a parliamentary process. I understand that the government has its own processes underway. I was present at the announcement of one of those and I have followed them closely from a portfolio responsibility perspective. But the government does not have exclusive rights to gather information. This parliament has the right to make that decision and to have a process occurring at the same time. In fact, it may be that this process assists the government process. I hope that is the case. I reject the government’s reasons, in particular, for opposing this reference.
