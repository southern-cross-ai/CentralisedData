        On 22 March 2007 I undertook to examine the supplementary questions asked by Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Nash. In doing so I indicated that I believed that the supplementary question asked by Senator Nash was in order.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        transcript shows that Senator Fierravanti-Wells’s supplementary question directly asked the minister to comment on the policies of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government and Labor Party. This supplementary question was therefore out of order on the standard applied in the past. Because of the noise in the chamber at the time—and it seems to be continuing—I was unable to hear the question clearly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The supplementary question of Senator Nash asked the minister why the government will not be adopting alternative policies. It was therefore in order in accordance with the standard applied in the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that senators are beginning to lose sight of the distinction which the chair has drawn in the past between questions which ask ministers to say why the government will not adopt alternative policies, which are in order, and questions which simply invite ministers to comment on the policies of other governments and parties, which are not in order. This distinction is based on the principle that questions must ask about the government’s intentions. Questions which simply ask for comment on alternative policies are not in order. I reinforce that distinction and ask senators to observe it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also ask that the chair be allowed to hear questions and answers, and that senators refrain from the kind of noise which occurred during question time last week and is continuing today.
