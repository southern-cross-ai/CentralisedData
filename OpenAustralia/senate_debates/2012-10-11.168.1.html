         The Minister for Housing and the Minister for Homelessness provides the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) and (2) The administered budget for Outcome 2.1 in 2012-13 is $33.58 million; comprising $24.16 million for Youth Homelessness (Reconnect) and $9.42 million for

         </a>
         Advice, National Homelessness Strategy, National Housing Priorities and Homelessness Research Strategy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Total departmental staffing resources devoted to Outcomes 2.1 and 2.2 are provided in the Department’s 2011 12 Annual Report. These resources include an attribution of corporate, network and other departmental support. Total staffing in the Housing, Homelessness and Money Management Group allocated to programs 2.1 and 2.2 are provided in response to Question 3 below. The Department and Group use resources flexibly across the programs and do not separately allocate resources to each program. In addition to managing the administered appropriations, the Group undertakes a range of activities in support of the broader objectives under Outcomes 2.1 and 2.2. A summary of these activities can be found in the Department’s Annual Reports.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Departmental staff under Outcome 2.1 are located in Canberra.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Outcome 2.1 and Outcome 2.2 are managed by the Housing, Homelessness and Money Management Group. The structure of the Group, numbers and levels of staff for the relevant housing and homelessness elements is in the table below.
