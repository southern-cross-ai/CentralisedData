           When this parliament set up two parliamentary commissions of inquiry, we consulted with not only the financial sector but also victims of misconduct and other stakeholders, including community legal centres. You've already said that you've consulted with Treasury, the

            The government's announcement today is self explanatory. We did not believe—and it is a matter of public record—that a royal commission was the appropriate way forward. But, given how this debate has evolved and given the increasingly political nature of the debate and how it was impacting on a very important sector for the future success of our economy, we made the judgement that, in the circumstances that Australia had reached and in the national interest, it was appropriate to make the decision that we have made. All of the appropriate consultations have taken place, and the Prime Minister and the Treasurer will continue to make relevant announcements as appropriate.

              Currently, banks are only required to keep financial records for seven years. We've seen catastrophes like forestry managed investment schemes in 2009, eight years, ago, and the

               It is interesting that Senator Whish-Wilson is going through the list of years that all these various financial disasters happened, because they all happened under the watch of the Rudd-Gillard Labor-Green government—and, of course, the Labor Party did nothing. In fact, the Labor Party in government said that there was no need for a comprehensive inquiry into the financial system. When former shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey recommended a comprehensive financial systems inquiry, the Labor Party dismissed it and said that that wasn't warranted and wasn't appropriate. We know why the Labor Party has been pursuing this: it is purely politics. Mr Shorten doesn't care about people who are victims of financial—

                    Senator Bilyk, the fact is that a lot of very irresponsible and very foolish statements were being made about the Australian financial system. There is no doubt that establishing a banking royal commission was not the government's preferred option, for all the reasons I outlined, but the government made a decision, based entirely on the national interest, that we needed to protect and defend the Australian financial system from some of the foolish and extravagant statements that were being made in the course of this debate. For that reason, the government decided that it would accede to the will of many in this parliament to establish a banking royal commission, with very specific terms of reference and set up in such a way that it won't last forever.

                       The Prime Minister listens to everybody. He mightn't agree with them all, but he listens to everyone. As I said, Senator Bilyk, in answer to your primary question, establishing a banking royal commission was not the government's preferred course, for all of the reasons that I've explained in this chamber earlier in the week and in previous weeks as well. But, in view of the way this debate was developing, the government does have a concern about the effect that some of the wilder and more foolish claims were having on the Australian financial system. For that reason and, at the request of the banks, to staunch the damage that was being done to confidence in the Australian financial system by some of the foolish claims made in the debate, a royal commission with a certain reporting date and specific terms of reference was necessary.

                         I would just point out to Senator Brandis that there's a huge difference between listening and taking action. When was the Prime Minister first advised of the shift of the banks' position, and was the meeting of cabinet this morning called prior to or following the decision by the banks to support a royal commission?
