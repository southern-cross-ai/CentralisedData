        How much does it cost to care? The truth is that it isn't costing us enough. My office in Launceston is located in a working-class area. I've noticed it's a carers hub. I'm smack bang between a hearing clinic and an optometrist. I give a shout-out to the girls at Eyelines. I miss you all. Every day there are people outside my office taking time out of their day to care for someone else. Despite being the most active volunteers in our communities, carers go largely unnoticed. Don't worry, legends, I see you.
       </p>
       <p>
        One in 11 people in this room have caregiving responsibilities. In my home state of Tasmania it is one in six. That's 80,000 Tasmanians providing unpaid care. Increasing cost-of-living pressures and workforce shortages are forcing more people into unpaid caregiving roles. In Tasmania there are over 9,000 carers under the age of 25. That's kids and young adults putting everything on hold to care for someone they love. For some it's temporary and for others it will be a lifelong commitment that could end up costing $1 million in lifetime earnings and over $400,000 in retirement savings. We can't keep asking Australians who are already sacrificing so much to also bear the losses.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Tasmania alone their care has saved our health system $2.2 billion. Yes, there are services in place to provide support, but there are not enough. They need financial security. That's why I think paying superannuation on carers payments makes sense, but the government can't afford to do it for everyone. What if we limit payments to only carers under 40 and only for the first two years? It would cost about $60 million a year, but it would actually end up saving us money. The budget would actually be healthier by making these payments. It would support people to retire in dignity and help the budget at the same time. So if you were to become a carer tomorrow, what value are you willing to place on caring for a loved one?
