        My question is to the Minister for Defence. Before the government commits to $30 billion of expenditure: a well-equipped defence force could become a museum exhibit if it cannot be supported by adequate logistics in a time of conflict. There are serious concerns about the ability of our defence forces to have a guaranteed supply of fuel in a conflict scenario, given the fact that Australia has no government owned fuel stocks and does not mandate minimum stock levels for industry to hold. Fuel security is the job of government. How would the government respond to a direct attack on our fuel supply lines?

         I thank senator Madigan for his question. There have been a number of discussions recently, and most recently I saw former Air Vice Marshal John Blackburn making some observations in relation to this. Significantly, while Defence is indeed able to meet its fuel requirements through its own stockholdings, it is important to note that we do in fact a have a number of other supply options. Amongst those I would indicate that we have arrangements with our closest allies, who can be relied on should there be an interruption to the general supply of fuel. I understand also in response to Senator Madigan's question, particularly in relation to logistics support, that this is an aspect of the white paper, to which I would draw senator Madigan's attention. It is an area of enabling capability within Defence that has been significantly underfunded in recent years, and it is one which this white paper most importantly seeks to address and in fact readdress.

          , I ask a supplementary question. The government does not know the amount and location of fuel stocks in this country because the government does not mandate reporting of fuel stocks, unlike the majority of the developed nations. Does the government see this as a significant weakness in our defence capability?

           I think I indicated in my previous answer Defence's views and in fact the government's views in relation to our ability to meet our fuel requirements through our own stockholdings and the other supply options that we have. I note the concerns that Senator Madigan has raised and will certainly undertake to seek further advice for him if he would like it.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Minister, the government depends on commercial fuel supply chains for our fuel, supply chains upon which we are critically dependent but which the government has no control over. The fuel industry sector cannot be delegated responsibility for our fuel security. Can the minister refer me to where in the defence white paper this critical issue is addressed?

             As I indicated in reference to particularly the logistics aspects of the white paper, that is the point that Senator Madigan should take his reference from, if I may say. But I would not like Senator Madigan to go away from this discussion thinking this is not an issue (a) to which Defence has turned its mind and (b) which Defence works on regularly, given its importance in terms of our day-to-day operations, let alone operations in extremis. That, Senator Madigan, I can absolutely assure you is the case. It is a matter on which we place significant focus and on which we do a great deal of work.
