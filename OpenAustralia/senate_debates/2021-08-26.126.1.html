        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. Can the minister advise the Senate how the Liberal and Nationals government is delivering its economic recovery plan and supporting Australians to chart our way back from the COVID-19 pandemic, including through the national plan agreed to by the national cabinet?

         [by video link] I thank Senator Askew for her question. It's a very important question about Australia's performance through this once-in-a-century global pandemic and our pathway through to the other side of it. Australians have much to be proud of in the way they have responded to this pandemic. The responses of Australians, with the work of their governments, businesses and others, have seen an estimated 30,000 lives saved around Australia, compared with the type of devastation we have seen in so many other countries. Although parts of the country are doing it tough right now, we should never underestimate the success we as a nation have had in responding in world-leading ways, saving those 30,000 lives and saving, as well, close to one million jobs during the course of this pandemic as a result of effective policy measures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Right from the start of the pandemic, the closure of our international borders managed to keep so successfully through the pandemic, in so many different ways, what would have been a flood and a wave of COVID cases from coming into the country and spreading throughout the country. Equally, there have been the economic supports, from JobKeeper through to the coronavirus supplement, the cash-flow boost, temporary full-expensing measures, targeted support to sectors like tourism and aviation, business payments now being delivered directly with the states and disaster assistance payments being paid directly to affected individuals. Our economy has demonstrated resilience again and again, and we should have confidence that it will do so once more when current lockdowns and restrictions ease, particularly with the growing confidence we see as vaccination numbers set new records. More than 335,000 vaccinations were achieved yesterday, helping Australia surge towards the scientifically based targets of the Doherty institute of 70 per cent and 80 per cent full vaccination rates that can give confidence, safety and hope to Australians that we will be able to achieve a greater sense of normality in the future and, through that, help to get our countryâ€”

            There continues to be significant support in terms of our economy and, from that support, significant strength in our economy. The jobs market has shown great resilience, coming back strongly from different lockdowns and shutdowns and holding up very strongly. Last week we saw real wages data continuing to remain above prepandemic levels. These things are in contrast to so much of the rest of the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            Indeed, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
             Future Fund
            </a>
            , a hugely important asset for our nation, has delivered its strongest ever investment earnings through the 2020-21 year. Earnings have grown by 22.2 per cent, up some $35.7 billion, tripling the initial investments made in the Future Fund and ensuring that net debt for our nation's future is as strong as possible. These all demonstrate resilience, strength and capability across the Australian economy and should give people confidence for the future.

               [by video link] The national plan is about giving Australians confidence in the safety of themselves and their families as well as confidence in the reopening of our economyâ€”that they will be able to get their businesses back on a stable footing, their jobs even more secure, and that we can resume the type of growth that our country has seen in recent years, with strong growth in jobs numbers, providing strong opportunities for all Australians. To support this plan, Australians need toâ€”as they currently areâ€”turn out in record numbers to get vaccinated. Some 86-plus per cent of over 70s have now had their first dose of vaccine. Fifty-nine point nine per cent of them have had their second dose. Across the whole population aged 16-plus, 55.2 per cent have now had their first dose. As we see the ATAGI advice being received in relation to children, continued increase in supply and growth in the more than 8,900 centres where people can get a vaccine, all should have confidence that we can deliver this plan.
