         Early Childhood Education

          Thank you. Yes, I am the representing minister; that is a statement of fact. As the representing minister, what I can tell you is that the Albanese Labor government will be delivering cheaper child care for Australian families, something that your government did not do. As a result, 97 per cent of families in Australia will be better off.

             I did remind senators yesterday, and I'll remind senators again today, when you call a point of order you simply state the point of order and then not get into argument or other statements. I do believe that the minister is being relevant. He has just started answering the question. There were a lot of interjections the minute he stood so it's quite difficult to hear him, but I am listening carefully. Thank you, Minister Watt.

              Thank you, President. As I was saying, I'm very happy about the fact that the Albanese Labor government will be delivering cheaper child care to Australian families. Not just one family, not just two families, but 97 per cent of Australian families using the early childhood sector and childcare system will be better off as a result of our policyâ€”something that you were not able to do in your first year, your second year, your third year, your fourth year, your fifth year, your sixth year, your seventh year, your eighth year or your ninth year.

                   Thank you, President. I'm happy to take the exact details of that question on notice for Senator Hughes. And I'm happy that she is showing an interest in this issue, because I don't remember any opposition senator ever doing anything to support child care in the way that the Labor government is doing. What I do remember is the now opposition copying the policy of Labor, then opposition, when it came to child care, but not delivering that policy in full, and for that reason, that policyâ€”what was then your policyâ€”left a lot of Australian families much more out of pocket than ours will. That's what I remember.

                         President, on the points order that have been taken, and indeed Senator Watt's assertion while you was speaking before, cavalierly, that he still has 30 more seconds, with a tone that apparently means he can say whatever he likes, just because he has taken the details on notice does not remove the obligation for him to be directly relevant to the question that has been asked and does not provide him with free licence to simply talk about the previous government. I encourage you to draw him back to the direct relevance of the question.

I will draw Senator Watt back to the question. And I would ask all senators to raise their points of order respectfully and to sit down when asked to do so. Minister.

                           Thank you, President. As I was saying, and I appreciate the opportunity to remind the chamber, all Australian families who use the childcare system will be better off under the Labor policy that we will now implement than under the policies that existed under the former government. It took a change of government to deliver the cheaper child care that Australian families so desperately need. There is one party that is delivering a cost-of-living benefit to Australians. It is Labor in child care and other areas.

                             Under Labor's proposed child care changesâ€”and I'm assuming you'll have to take this one on notice, but if you could stick to thatâ€”what will the increase in childcare subsidy be for a family earning $400,000? And is it true that the subsidy will now lift from zero to 27 per cent under Labor's proposal?

                              Again, I'm happy to take the details of that question on notice for Senator Hughes. I'm sure that her colleagues in the House of Representatives are posing the same question to the actual minister to get that level of detail. If that's not occurring, perhaps she could have a chat to her colleagues about that.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              I think the other point to be noticed here is that, as we have consistently said, child care is not simply a social welfare program.
                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_care" rel="nofollow">
                               Child care
                              </a>
                              is not simply about economically supporting families who receive childcare benefits, as important as that is. Increasing childcare payments is an important economic policy of this government to broaden, in particular, women's participation in the workforce. Having affordable child care, regardless of income, is an important measure for this government to take to increase women's participation in the workforce. It is a shame that the former government didn't take the opportunity in any of the nine and a bit years that it was in government to do the same thing.

                                Whilst I appreciate the ministerâ€”the 'not my job' ministerâ€”Senator Watt, has taken on notice the getting of the figures, some of us have actually had a look at these papers. Perhaps you might like to explain why, under Labor's much-vaunted cost-of-living support, it's proposing to give more than five times in assistance to a family earning over $400,000 than it does to a family earning $60,000.

                                              In answer to Senator Hughes's supplementary question, as I was saying in answer to the previous question, something that the opposition seems to fail to grasp is that childcare payments are not only a social welfare measure; they are an important measure to encourage more women to participate in the workplace. We know that women's participation in the workplace is far lower than men's and we know that increasing women's participation in the workplace is an important economic measure for this government.

                                                  If Senator Ruston requires me to do so, I will repeat the point. The point I was making is that childcare payments are not only a social welfare measure; they are an economic development measure. The Australian workforce needs more women, and childcare payments will assist.
