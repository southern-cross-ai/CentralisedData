        I'll change gear a little bit. I'd like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a hero of the seafood industry in the state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        by the name of Brian Jeffriess AM. He is retiring from his role as the head of the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association, a terrific contributor who has done an amazing job for that industry and the hundreds of South Australians in particular who've worked in that industry. He's leaving behind an amazing legacy.
       </p>
       <p>
        To touch on some of the things Brian was involved in in his many years in the southern bluefin tuna industry, I'll start with the innovation that he has spearheaded. He collaborated with government and brought together a partnership between industry and government, alongside the conservation movement and the recreational fishing sector, putting the southern bluefin tuna fishery in Australia in a world leading position, something that we as a country should be very, very proud of. Brian also stood up for our industry internationally, at the CCSBT and other international fora, defending the reputation and rights of the participants in the industry here against interest from overseas that didn't necessarily share our values. He also made sure that industry had a very strong standing when it came to government policy. Never was a call from Brian Jeffriess left unreturned, and he made sure those he represented were heard. Turning to those he represented, the tuna barons, as they were so called in the state of South Australia, were managed very well by him, I have to say. They are a group of people not to be trifled with.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final thing I'll say about Bryan Jeffriess, who I do wish well into the future, is that he did something no-one else was able to, and that was to create the first resource-sharing framework for any fishery in this country. Again, it is a world-leading legacy, something he should be proud of. So I do wish Brian Jeffriess well into the future.
