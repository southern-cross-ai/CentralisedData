        I seek leave to take note of documents tabled by Senator Faulkner relating to the government’s election commitments that amount to the largest ever pork-barrelling in the history of this country and to the sports rorts cover-up that the Minister for Sport finds herself embroiled in.

         by leave—I know the senator is interested in progressing this matter. If he delays the matter we may be able to deal with it tomorrow. I say that because we have a very tight legislative program. We need to finalise the legislation and references that we are currently dealing with. We have a cut-off today of 5.30 pm for valedictories, which makes this a very short Wednesday. So I ask the senator’s indulgence so that we can manage the program and finish the work that we have set.

         <p>
          by leave—We have no desire to mess around with the government’s legislative agenda and we realise the time constraints. But Senator Bernardi has an issue which we believe would take no more than 20 minutes in total, with 10 minutes either side for debate in relation to a return to order and taking note. If time can be arranged at some time later in the day today or tomorrow, that would be agreeable. But we will proceed with a suspension of standing orders if we cannot agree to go away and discuss a time where we can squeeze it in. We are willing to limit the time, but if we can insert it somewhere that would be good.

           by leave—It would be helpful if we could actually just go away and work this out so that we are not actually debating it on the floor, because this is also drawing time away from the work of the Senate. With these matters, I understand that it is always helpful for senators—though not always possible, I understand—to organise with the whips so that the whips can schedule these types of debates, particularly at this time when we are drawing close to the winter recess and time is of the essence. I request the senator take cognisance of the fact that there is very limited time today. There are debates that still have to be had. We have a time critical element of 5.30 pm for valedictories. I am sure the whips can organise between themselves a way to accommodate Senator Bernardi.
