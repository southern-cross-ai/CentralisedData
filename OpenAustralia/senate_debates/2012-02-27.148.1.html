        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the release of the initial report of the Remuneration Tribunal (the Tribunal),
        <i>
         Review of the Remuneration of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
          Members of Parliament
         </a>
        </i>
        , on 15 December 2011, the Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) and Other Legislation Amendment Bill (the bill) seeks to implement the Government's commitment to abolish the Life Gold Pass (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGP" rel="nofollow">
         LGP
        </a>
        ) entitlement prospectively so that it is not available to those who enter or re-enter the Parliament following the commencement of the
        <i>
         Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) and Other Legislation Amendment Act 2012
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also reduces the number of return trips available to an existing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPG" rel="nofollow">
         LPG
        </a>
        holder, who has never held office as Prime Minister, and his or her spouse or de facto partner and the spouse or de facto partner of a sitting member who has qualified for a LGP (entitled person) from 25 to 10 per financial year. Consistent with the Tribunal's recommendation that the entitlement for existing LGP holders be reduced now, the bill includes a transitional provision for the last quarter in this financial year or the date of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Assent" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Assent
        </a>
        , whichever is the later, limiting the number of return trips available to two, where the entitled person has at least two unused return trips from his or her 2011-12 financial year entitlement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also amends the
        <i>
         Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973
        </i>
        and makes consequential changes to the
        <i>
         Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948
        </i>
        (1948 Act) to grant the Tribunal the power to limit the flow of windfall gains to the superannuation benefits for current and former parliamentarians covered by the 1948 Act, from increases in the additional salary for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministers_of_State" rel="nofollow">
         Ministers of State
        </a>
        and parliamentary office holders.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill should be introduced and passed in the 2012
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autumn" rel="nofollow">
         Autumn
        </a>
        sittings to ensure the number of return trips for existing LGP holders is reduced from the start of the 2012-13 financial year. It is also preferable that the transitional provision apply from 1 April 2012.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is also important that the Tribunal has the capacity to limit any windfall gains that could flow to the superannuation benefits of current and former Ministers of State and parliamentary office holders covered by the 1948 Act, from a determination of the Tribunal on parliamentary remuneration. The Tribunal has indicated that it will not determine any variation in parliamentary remuneration, terms and conditions, or any associated matters, until measures have been enacted to address the potential windfall gains. Delays in passage of the bill will mean that the Tribunal is not able to properly fulfil its role in determining parliamentarian's remuneration.
