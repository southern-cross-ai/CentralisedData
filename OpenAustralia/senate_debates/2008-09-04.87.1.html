        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Faulkner. Will the minister update the Senate on the status of those Australian soldiers wounded in Afghanistan on 2 September?

         I thank Senator Feeney for his question. I can inform the Senate that, of the nine soldiers wounded on 2 September, one soldier remains in a very serious condition and that in order for him to get the best possible treatment he has been evacuated for specialist medical treatment at a

         military hospital in Germany. I can also report to the Senate that overnight the number of soldiers on the serious list has fallen from five to three. Those three soldiers remain in a serious condition but have been stabilised and remain under care in coalition medical facilities in Afghanistan. The remaining five soldiers are in the hands of those who provide excellent care on base at

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The incident that led to these casualties is a reminder to all of us of the danger that is faced by the men and women of the ADF in Afghanistan, where, every day, members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         risk their lives to secure, stabilise and reconstruct Afghanistan. The fact that, in this instance, operations carried on and will continue to carry on is a testament to the resilience of our forces and our commitment to the cause of peace and stability in Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to acknowledge not only the soldiers of the Special Operations Task Group but also the coalition aeromedical evacuation teams who—as all senators are aware—risk their lives to save others. I also acknowledge the Australian and coalition medical staff who have done such great work to keep this incident from turning into an even greater tragedy. I believe we should keep in mind the fact that every aeromedical evacuation mission puts aircraft and crews at great risk. There is a very great risk in flying in the adverse conditions that exist, certainly under enemy fire, to bring the wounded to safety and to medical care.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know that all senators are aware that these operations are complex, they are dangerous and, of course, they are conducted in one of the most hostile environments that exist on this earth. The fact that the overwhelming majority of these missions are conducted without any incident is testimony to the courage and professionalism of the Australian Defence Force.

         , I can assure the Senate that the Minister for Defence and the government will continue to monitor the progress of our wounded soldiers in Afghanistan. I know that I would speak on behalf of all senators in this chamber in wishing those wounded a speedy and full recovery from those wounds that have been suffered in our service.
