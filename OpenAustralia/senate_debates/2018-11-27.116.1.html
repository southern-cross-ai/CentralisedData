        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. I refer to the article in this morning's

         Labor senator, because you obviously don't have a great deal to do with your time and you can ask questions of the foreign minister which have nothing to do with their portfolio responsibilities. So I presume that I can respond in kind. I presume that that is the threshold which Senator Cameron has set. So let's talk about Mr Morrison and the message that Mr Morrison will deliver to the Australian community in the coming weeks and months, working up to the budget that he has announced for April of next year. He will advise the Australian community that Australia's economy is growing at 3.4 per cent, more strongly than at any time since 2012, which was, of course, during the height of the mining boom. He'll advise Australians that the economy is growing at a stronger rate than the world's seven largest advanced economies—the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
          USA

         , Canada, Germany, France, Italy,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         and Japan—and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         average. And, because Mr Morrison is from the fine state of New South Wales, he is always welcome in that fine state. He will talk about the commitment which we have kept in relation to ensuring one million new jobs were delivered by this government after 2013, which was delivered ahead of schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite have no idea how to manage an economy so as to set up a nation to support the sorts of things that we support with our strong economy: small business, the operation of the

                 Order! If everyone would just be quiet, I'll be able to have a chance to call the senator to order. Senator Macdonald, I ask you to withdraw the comment.

                    . I'm not going to comment on unsourced claims that might be run or might not run in newspapers. In fact, it gets a little confusing over there. I'm still trying to work out what's happening in Lindsay—whether it's
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diane_Beamer" rel="nofollow">

                    </a>
                    or Emma Husar. It's very confusing. But that's a matter for you guys. You'll sort that out, I'm sure.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    But while I'm talking about

                     Western Sydney
                    </a>
                    , perhaps I could talk about the government's record infrastructure investment. We have a record $75 billion being invested over the next decade in highway upgrades; congestion-busting roads; rail projects, including the Inland Rail; improved local roads and a new airport in Western Sydney, which will be a game changer for the Western Sydney economy and, in fact, for the economy of Australia. The roads investment: Senator Cameron tries to avoid it, but he knows those roads. Northern Road, Bringelly Road, the developments around Elizabeth Drive, the development of the Western Sydney Airport—he knows them all. This government is delivering those, and those opposite are doing nothing.

                      Liberal ministers are also calling for the Prime Minister to go to Siberia, questioning how much more out of touch his government can get. They're saying that any link to his government is poisonous. Does the foreign minister agree with her New South Wales colleagues?

                       I absolutely agree with the Prime Minister in relation to what this government is delivering. I've spoken about infrastructure. I've spoken about jobs. I've spoken about the stronger economy. But I could talk about income tax relief as well. I could talk about making income taxes lower, fairer and simpler. Those opposite only want to increase taxes on everything and on everyone. We are making income taxes, as I said, lower, fairer and simpler. In 2018-19, around 4.4 million Australians will get a tax relief of $530 a year, and over 10 million Australians will get some more tax relief as well. It's a plan that we put—
