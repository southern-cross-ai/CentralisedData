        After only a short time in government, the Labor Party is certainly showing its true colours. My good friend Senator Polley is right about one thing: they do have a mandate. But that mandate seems to be to backflip on every promise that they've made and to make decisions purely for their donorsâ€”to look after the thuggish CFMMEU, to look after their donors in the industry super funds. That's the mandate that they seem to have taken on board. That's the mandate that's letting Australians down already. On only the second day of parliament, we're seeing more and more backflips.

        Despite arguing, while in opposition, for more spending on COVID and for free rapid antigen tests, they've now backed away from that. It took days for us and all the responsible bodies to get them to agree to reinstate the COVID payment. The Labor Party have shown that their main concern is just to look after their donors. Watering down the

        's powers and the Your Future, Your Super legislation will only serve the purpose of disempowering Australians and empowering their donors. Nonstop over the last three years we heard the Labor Party, when they were on this side, carry on about accountability and transparency. They have just done two things that have destroyed accountability and transparency.

        It's time for the Labor Party to wake up, take responsibility, realise that they are now the ones in government, put in place proper protections against
