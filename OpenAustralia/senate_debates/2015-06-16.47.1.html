         Thank you, Senator Johnston, for your question. I notice in the gallery are Councillor Walsh from the City of Darebin and Councillor Mulholland from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Banyule" rel="nofollow">
          City of Banyule
         </a>
         , both of whom are very strong supporters of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Senator Johnston is correct: we recently released the latest quarterly report of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         on 3 June, and there is good news. There are now over 13,000 participants in the NDIS. There has been $754 million committed to those individuals to ensure that they get the better deal that they deserve. That represents about 85 per cent of the numbers which are required in the bilateral agreements with the states and territories. That is up from 81 per cent in the last quarter. I can report that the average package cost is around $34,000, which is largely unchanged from last quarter, where it was about $35,000, and remains a little bit below the expected full scheme average of $36,000. That means that the NDIS's budget is pretty much on track. I should also indicate that satisfaction levels remain high amongst NDIS participants.
        </p>
        <p>
         There were some important elements in the budget to support the NDIS. Obviously the government is absolutely 100 per cent committed to the scheme. The budget included an allocation of $695 million in the coming financial year for the NDIS. It also included $143 million to build the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
          ICT
         </a>
         system that the NDIS requires and also $20 million for an early rollout for kids in

           I am in the process of negotiating with the jurisdictions as to how the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
            NDIS
           </a>
           will roll out beyond the existing seven trial sites throughout the rest of those jurisdictions. Those discussions are going very well. I mentioned in response to the primary question that there was an early rollout in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
            Western Sydney
           </a>
           —in Penrith and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
            Blue Mountains
           </a>
           —for people with disability below the age of 17. That is happening early. That will benefit 2,000 young people in the west of Sydney. It was great to be in Penrith recently with Fiona Scott and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Markus" rel="nofollow">
            Louise Markus
           </a>
           from the other place. We signed a memorandum of understanding with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           government to see the NDIS roll out beyond trial sites for the first time in Western Sydney. I think that is something we can all agree is good news.

             system which ultimately will help ensure that there is a virtual marketplace where service providers and individuals receiving supports can meet. That is going to be important. It also will have an important role in the actuarial and insurance approach that the

              NDIS
             </a>
             takes to ensure that the scheme is sustainable. There is in the budget the $20 million that I mentioned in relation to

             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales

             . He said:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The Abbott Government’s strong support for the NDIS cannot be questioned. They are funding the NDIS and in doing so transforming the lives of people with disability.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is a good thing that this is something that enjoys support across the chamber.
