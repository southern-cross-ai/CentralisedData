        I present the final report of the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee on the performance of the Department of Parliamentary Services, together with the

        Today I table the report of the Finance and Public
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administration_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Administration Committee
        </a>
        on the performance of the Department of Parliamentary Services. The report is a culmination of an inquiry that has taken the committee well over a year to complete. The committee's inquiry commenced as a result of evidence provided in relation to the sale of two billiard tables in 2010 by the Department of Parliamentary Services. This matter was examined in the committee's interim report and exposed poor asset management practices and the provision of misleading information to the committee during estimates hearings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee's final report covers employment issues in the Department of Parliamentary Services, asset and project management issues, security and information technology issues, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPS" rel="nofollow">
         DPS
        </a>
        budget, performance reporting and accountability of the DPS to the parliament. The committee has also made a range of recommendations relating to these matters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly, the committee has recommended that changes to the standing orders be made so that the Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee and the House Appropriations and Administration Committee, acting as a joint committee in relation to the DPS, can consider the administration and funding of DPS. The committee considers that the implementation of this recommendation will improve accountability and oversight of the department. The committee also considers that the DPS should improve the standard of its performance reporting through its annual report and, in particular, its reporting on the condition of the building and the impact of budget constraints on matters such as maintenance. The committee believes that this should be done through improvements to the DPS annual report and biennial reporting on the building itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inquiry undertaken by the committee has been difficult. The committee received information on individual cases concerning bullying and harassment. The committee has not adjudicated on these cases but has used them to build a picture of the employment environment in the DPS. The committee has also used information from staff surveys and a Comcare order to aid its deliberations on employment issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the committee's inquiry, there were some major developments within the DPS. As a result of the review of assets disposal practices following the sale of the billiard tables, the Department of Parliamentary Services has implemented more rigorous disposal policies for assets which may have a heritage value. A survey of items which may have heritage or cultural significance to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        has been undertaken and new items have been identified. This will improve asset management of these items.
       </p>
       <p>
        A new secretary of the DPS, Ms Carol Mills, has been appointed. Ms Mills has commenced a restructure of the department in order to improve the delivery of services. The Department of Parliamentary Services is also developing a conservation management plan and a strategic asset management plan for Parliament House. The committee welcomes these developments and will continue to monitor the changes at future estimates hearings. In addition, the review of information and communication technology initiated by the Presiding Officers has reported major changes to the provision of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
         ICT
        </a>
        services to the parliament are underway, including the creation of the new position of chief information officer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, while the report focuses on the problems and deficiencies in the DPS, the committee would like to reiterate that the vast majority of Department of Parliamentary Services employees undertake their duties with professionalism, dedication to the support of the parliament and commitment to preserving Parliament House and its contents for the next 175 years and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to place on record and reiterate that this was a very difficult inquiry, but one that I feel very satisfied with. I am sure that I speak for the whole committee in the final report, so I urge people to read it. I would particularly like to thank the secretariat and the team for their hard work and their commitment to ensuring that we have produced the most complete and highly professional report possible. I also thank the committee members who participated and the many witnesses and all the submissions provided. I place on the record our appreciation for the effort that went in.

         I appreciate this opportunity to speak very briefly on the final report of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee inquiry into the performance of the Department of Parliamentary Services. In the very limited time available to me this afternoon, I want to stress the significance of this inquiry and the importance of its recommendations. I believe that this was an essential inquiry for the Senate committee system to undertake. By just simply holding this inquiry and listening to and treating seriously the concerns of so many
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPS" rel="nofollow">
          DPS
         </a>
         employees and others who have a very genuine interest in this building, much has already been achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
         While I do not have time to speak in detail about the myriad complex issues canvassed in this report, suffice to say significant change in DPS, which I have previously accurately described as the worst administered government department I have seen in the time I have served in the parliament, is long overdue. I am delighted that the committee, its inquiry process and this report have been the catalyst for change in DPS. There is much to do, but we are starting to right the wrongs.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also want to acknowledge the courage of those who have given evidence or submissions, including a significant number of confidential submissions. They have been absolutely critical in exposing the toxic culture that was allowed to develop in the Department of Parliamentary Services. The finance and public administration committee's secretariat has produced two outstanding reports—the one tabled today on behalf of the committee by Senator Polley and the interim report into the performance of DPS which preceded it. I too thank all those involved for their efforts. I know that they have made a real difference. I think responsibility now rests with the government—but not only the government, all of us who serve in the parliament—to ensure that the recommendations in this report are accepted and the positive changes we have seen in DPS in recent times continue into the future. I commend the report to the Senate.
