         He is an old friend. I have never agreed with Senator Conroy on Senator Carr. I refer to the government’s attempt today to soften up Australian consumers for a plastic bag checkout charge by leaking a so-called confidential report claiming that a voluntary plastic bag phase-out is not working. Will the minister categorically rule out Australian shoppers being charged for each plastic bag they use at the checkout?

           If the opposition are interested in an answer we will seek to provide it; if they are not then I guess we will have to muddle on in any event. I can say that the government, along with other members of the Environment Protection and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Council" rel="nofollow">
            Heritage Council
           </a>
           , is committed to the phase-out of free single-use plastic shopping bags, and would like that to be underway by 1 January 2009. This is a timetable that was agreed by the previous government. In fact, under the former minister for the environment, the member for Wentworth, that was announced through an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPHC" rel="nofollow">
            EPHC
           </a>
           communique on 2 June 2007. I will quote from that because it is quite clear that the opposition have a very poor memory on these matters. That communique said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Ministers reaffirmed their commitment to phasing out plastic bags by January 2009. They welcomed the submissions received during the recent public consultation process on regulatory options for dealing with plastic bags and agreed to consider this issue again along with a revised Regulatory Impact Statement at their next meeting.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is why this government now understands, in the lead-up to the council’s next meeting next month, that the state and territory ministers will be considering a range of options which were agreed to by the former government and in fact by the member for Wentworth last June. We now have a situation where there is widespread consultation. In fact, one of the options that the previous government did agree to was a proposal that the government impose a levy on plastic bags. That was the previous government’s policy.

              Senator Kemp, you are starting to debate the point of order. I have listened very carefully. Ministers are not required to give specific answers, but they are required to be relevant, and Senator Carr is being relevant.

               I was indicating that the opposition had agreed to these policies, not the government. The opposition, when it was the government, presented these policies. This is the problem. We have an opposition with a very short memory of what it actually did in government. What I can tell the present opposition is that this government will not impose a Commonwealth levy on plastic bags, and actions on plastic bags should not be used as a government revenue raiser.

The question was not about a Commonwealth levy; the question was whether the Commonwealth would allow a charge to be mandated on plastic bags at the checkout. That is the question before the chamber.

                    No, I will not rule them out of order in taking points of order, Senator Conroy, because I do not believe they have been frivolous. I have ruled them out of order but they are entitled to take points of order.

                     I have explained that the Rudd Labor government will not be imposing a Commonwealth levy on plastic bags. I have indicated this to the Senate on, I think, three occasions. We have a situation where the government has yet to consider the deliberations of the council meeting to be held next April. We can only speak for the Commonwealth government on this issue. We can speak only for this government. Unfortunately, the opposition cannot even speak for itself.
