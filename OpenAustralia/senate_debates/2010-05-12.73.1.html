        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Carr. Minister, with the budget’s return to surplus dependent upon the imposition of a great big new tax on Australia’s resources sector—to which Western Australia is the largest contributor—how does the government reconcile its decision in the budget—

             How does the government reconcile its decision in the budget to provide Western Australia with support for just one infrastructure project—a rail line in the state’s goldfields region? Why has the government neglected to provide the necessary support for the projects in Western Australia’s Pilbara, such as the Pilbara Cities project, which will provide much needed improvements to social infrastructure in Karratha and

              I thank Senator Cash for her question. I made the point yesterday that we are dealing with a group of economic knuckle draggers. Once again we have clear evidence of the simple failure of Senator Cash to understand the reality of how this scheme works. Mining activity is actually projected to increase, because the

              is paid only after mines become profitable. The proposition she put to us is that this would undermine the mining industry. The Australian government will refund royalty payments to companies, which will be—

                       The government’s arrangements only cut in when projects become profitable—a simple proposition that even Senator Cash would be able to understand. Our arrangements are actually more efficient and more equitable for the mining industry and they were originally suggested as such by the mining industry for that very reason.

                       What the Resource Exploration Rebate actually provides is an immediate cash rebate of 30 per cent for eligible exploration expenditure. It is actually a device to assist the industry to meet its payments. Of course, it is only part of the arrangements we have. This arrangement provides essential infrastructure to enable Australia’s resources industry to achieve its full export potential.

Minister, given that the government’s great big new tax on Australia’s resource sector, which is underpinning its budget commitments, is predicated on increased resource trade between Australia and China, will you guarantee to the people of Western Australia that the rail line infrastructure project promised to the state in yesterday’s budget will be funded should Chinese demand for Australian mineral exports falter?

What we have actually seen is a big—

                            This government in 2010-11 is investing $799 million for road, rail and port infrastructure—$243 million in funding for Western Australia; $51 million for local roads; $6.5 million to eliminate another 49 black spots on local roads—all in Western Australia; and $2.6 million for roadside facilities. This is a government that actually invest in infrastructure, unlike the 10 years of neglect we saw under the previous government.

                              I thank Senator McLucas for her question. I know she has a deep interest in this area. This budget is the culmination of our reform agenda in the health area. It delivers a comprehensive, $7.3 billion, investment to deliver more doctors, more nurses, more hospital beds and more accessible health care in the community. Last night’s budget delivered a massive $1.2 billion boost to

                              and primary healthcare services to deliver real improvements in front-line health services across Australia. The government will invest $417 million to establish a national network of Medicare Locals to coordinate care in the community and make it easier for patients to get the treatment they need when they need it, especially after hours.

                              We will invest $355 million to build around 450 GP superclinic type facilities. This commitment will lead to the construction of around 23 new, dedicated GP superclinics and the expansion of more than 400 existing general practices, community health centres and Aboriginal medical services around the country. This is also a budget for Australian nurses, with a $522 million commitment, which means patients will get better access to nurses when and where they need them. There will also be $390 million provided to support and recognise the work of practice nurses who will help take the pressure off GPs and provide additional services. There will be $103 million provided to support nurses working in aged care. There has also been $466 million committed to establish personally controlled electronic health records, which will allow Australians to check their medical histories online and allow the healthcare professionals to access their relevant history at the touch of a button.

                                I thank Senator McLucas for her supplementary question. The record shows that the Rudd government can be justly proud of its record in health. Let me start with the government’s record $64 billion funding agreement for health and hospitals—something the opposition never achieved when they were in government. These health dollars started flowing last year and they represent a 50 per cent increase on the previous government’s funding agreement. Next is the government’s $600 million elective surgery waiting list reduction plan, which has already delivered more than 62,000 extra procedures—64 per cent more than the target of 25,000 procedures. In addition, 125 hospitals have received new elective surgery equipment and operating theatres.

                                   I thank Senator McLucas for her second supplementary question. Smoking is the largest preventable cause of disease and premature death in Australia. Each year, about 15,000 Australians die from tobacco related diseases, and it costs our community an estimated $31.5 billion each year. That is why this government has announced a comprehensive package targeting smoking. The government has decided to increase the excise for all tobacco products by 25 per cent. I am also pleased to inform the Senate that legislation was introduced into the House this morning. The government has also decided to lead the world  and introduce plain packaging of cigarettes by 1 July 2012.
