        I bring to the attention of honourable senators the incredibly successful sporting club Hub Gymnastics, which is located in Adelaide's southern suburbs. Hub Gymnastics was established in 1985 by a group of volunteers, and has since grown to train over 700 athletes, with a waiting list of over 300 who are desperate to join. Gymnasts of all ages are welcome to the club, and they enjoy great training from head coach, Emma Murray, and her team. I pay tribute to Emma for her incredible dedication to leading the coaching of all the gymnasts, as well as for her amazing drive in growing and advocating for the club, alongside its president, Marie Moran. Last week, I visited their gym, which is named after Emma's father, Paul. Paul was instrumental in building the club. Sadly, Paul is no longer with us, but he has left the community a great legacy. The club is a living testament to his incredible efforts to promote gymnastics.

        On the weekend, Hub Gymnastics held their annual recreation day. The gym was abuzz with activity, particularly with gymnastic displays for proud parents and family members. I'd like to think that there was an Olympian amongst those participating on the mats. I also had the chance to hear more from the club about their need for expanding their facilities, especially to accommodate the 300 keen gymnasts waiting to train at the club. An upgraded and expanded facility for Hub Gymnastics has become a necessity, and I intend to continue working diligently with my state colleagues and the local council to ensure Hub Gymnastics' vision for the future comes to life. I thank the president, Marie Moran, and head coach, Emma Murray, for their kind welcome and hospitality.
