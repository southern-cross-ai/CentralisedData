        As a servant to the many different people in our one Queensland community, I was pleased to accept an invitation from Isaac Balbin, founder of cannabis.org.au, to attend last Thursday's national cannabis industry roundtable. What a pleasure it was meeting Isaac, Rhys and their team in Melbourne and speaking with other members of parliament who, like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">

        , believe medicinal cannabis is long overdue for sensible downregulation.

        realised it could not make as much money from a natural plant. There are now 820 varieties—and growing—in the Australian cannabis cultivar database, many developed to suit specific health conditions or needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Victorian MP David Limbrick made sensible comments about where the line between government regulation for the good of society and personal freedom should be—and it's nowhere near where it is now.

        from Western Australia Sophia Moermond spoke to the need for some level of personal growth. While we may not agree on personal growing, there was so much commonality in views being expressed. I'm excited for the potential of the cannabis industry uniting behind a sensible cannabis downregulation.

        One of Australia's leading cannabis doctors, Dr Nic Guimmarra,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President" rel="nofollow">
         Vice President
        </a>
        of the Society of Cannabis Clinicians, raised his concerns that the current licensing schedule has led to a situation where some disreputable cannabis clinics are pushing patients through so quickly that the resulting prescription and instructions for use are counterproductive for the patient. It's One Nation's belief that the heavily regulated and restricted pathway system is burying the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
         Therapeutic Goods Administration
        </a>
        in paperwork that it's not checking, causing suboptimal care and, likely, patient harm as conditions worsen instead of being treated.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why One Nation advanced legislation to downregulate medicinal cannabis so that any doctor can prescribe medicinal cannabis for any patient with a medical need and have that prescription filled by a chemist on the PBS. Our legislation harmonises the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/THC" rel="nofollow">
         THC
        </a>
        level below which a planet is hemp, not cannabis, to one per cent. This aligns with changes made in all states. The bill further adds a level of THC and CBD below which a pharmacist could sell the product to an adult without prescription.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was pleased to hear Michael Balderstone, President of the Legalise Cannabis Party and a legend of the Australian cannabis industry, warn that new hybrid cannabis strains with THC of up to 35 per cent were a concern needing some regulation. Thirty-five per cent THC is insane. It would suit the treatment of chronic pain and palliative care and very little else. Michael called for some commercial growth activity as otherwise development of new strains will be compromised. This is the problem with free growing without a commercial option. The plant works best when the profile of THC, CBD, terpenes and flavonoids are set to the needs of a person with a specific health condition. Unlike pharmaceuticals, with natural plant cannabis, one size is not expected to fit all. For this development to continue, it needs a commercial market presence. Consensus in the industry may ultimately fall on some level of licensed free growing. One Nation will cross that bridge, in consultation with our members, when we get there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Thursday I heard an analogy for free growing. It was the belief that, just because people can brew their own beer, it doesn't mean people will. In fact, almost nobody does, because people can readily buy what's needed commercially. The challenge is to take out the industry's criminal elements while providing the widest range of quality Australian whole-plant and natural medicinal cannabis at an affordable price.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a scandal that regulatory authorities insist on tight volume controls that enable criminal gangs to provide much of the domestic medicinal supply. These are gangs that lace cannabis with narcotics and then deliberately target kids at events like Schoolies. The TGA is driving practices hurtful and dangerous to children. It's a scandal that the minister could downschedule cannabis today yet has not done so; scheduling is regulatory, not legislative. It's a scandal that some in the cannabis industry, including pioneers, have developed their business under the current regulatory regime environment and see downscheduling as a threat to their nice little money-earners.
       </p>
       <p>
        There's no reason the entire cannabis product offering that the TGA has authorised for prescription under their restrictive pathways program could not be offered in schedule 4, for any doctor to prescribe—products that have already been prescribed successfully and safely for many years. The minister could use a regulatory instrument to make it happen today, yet he will not, because predatory billionaire owners of pharmaceutical companies pull the strings in Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians with a medical need for cannabis don't get a look-in. This government is saying to everyday Australians, 'Your needs don't matter.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The TGA monitors impacts of cannabis and has found that medicinal cannabis has a lower adverse event rate than prescribed pharmaceuticals. Sensible downregulation will save lives. It will provide hundreds of tailored strains of medicinal cannabis designed to ease suffering and improve the health of our society, while taking the profit and control away from crime gangs. I look forward to working with cannabis.org.au to make this happen.

        Madam Acting Deputy President, as a servant to the many different people in our one Queensland community, my second topic tonight is solar and wind energy's financial failure. The tide is now against out-of-touch elitists whose income insulates them from the hardship their virtue-signalling, feelings based beliefs cause Australians. The recent referendum showed that the good sense of everyday Australians will shine through. Recent polling shows working Australians deserting the Albanese government over the cost of living, housing and immigration—crises due to virtue-signalling, feelings based urban elitist policies.

        Look at disasters in recent months engulfing the green dream. Orsted, the huge offshore wind charlatan, booked a

        $5.5 billion writedown on the value of its offshore wind installations, and the stock price this year is down 50 per cent. Last week, Norway's Equinor booked a $300 million writedown on its offshore wind portfolio. Its share price, though, was saved due to its investment in oil and gas.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens_Energy" rel="nofollow">

        is down 60 per cent after losses in offshore wind caused a return on investment of minus 17 per cent—negative. Vestas is down a third after announcing losses in its wind division and is now offering a return to investors of minus 11 per cent. This is from the

        Recent large demonstrations against offshore wind should have caused Minister Bowen to take stock, yet he's now full steam ahead and damn the torpedoes. Ignorance never ends well. Sydney's inner-city elites will not have to look at these monstrosities, because the Labor Party are installing huge wind turbines off the workers' suburbs in Newcastle and Wollongong.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESG" rel="nofollow">
         ESG
        </a>
        corporate blackmail is hitting resistance. In the last week, United Kingdom investors withdrew $1 billion from ESG funds, making it five months in a row of negative inflows. Last year a paper showed that ESG funds do not offer returns superior to those of regular investment funds, which is why Vanguard pulled out of the Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative last December due to poor returns and risk. Last July, the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "Green" investing has hit a crisis. Mounting questions over standards and effectiveness have been building for years. This year, investors voted with their feet and rushed for the exits.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Whatever way you cut it ESG is a thematic – in creating exclusions it means investors will have more volatile returns than a fund that simply invests for the best return.
       </p>
       <p>
        Large corporates, superannuation firms and investment funds have a fiduciary duty to investors to operate for the best and safest returns. ESG is not safe and not profitable. ESG initiatives rely on government handouts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our economy is being destroyed. The urban elites' wealth and income can only last so long before feeling the pain they're now inflicting on everyday Australians. The green dream becomes a nightmare when the government stops propping it up with taxpayers' money.
       </p>
       <p>
        Make the decision today to start putting everyday Australians first. We have one flag; we are one community; we are one nation.
