        ( ):Over the past few years there has been a marked departure from established standards of parliamentary debate and a tolerance shown towards certain expressions and imputations that were considered unparliamentary in the past and remain contrary to the standing orders today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Expressions that would until recently have been identified as disorderly, including allegations that members of parliament have lied, have been allowed to stand unchallenged even though they are clearly contrary to standing order 193(3). This rule provides:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A senator shall not use offensive words against either
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         House of Parliament
        </a>
        or of a House of a state or territory parliament, or any member of such House, or against a judicial officer, and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the 13th edition of
        <i>
         Odgers
        </i>
        <i>
         '
        </i>
        <i>
         Australian Senate Practice
        </i>
        explains at page 260:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is for the chair to determine what constitutes offensive words, imputations of improper motives and personal reflections under this standing order. In doing so, the chair has regard to the connotations of expressions and the context in which they are used.
       </p>
       <p>
        All suggestions that members have lied—that is, deliberately and knowingly made untrue statements—are disorderly. Remarks to the effect that senators' statements are untrue or misleading are not necessarily out of order; for the chair to intervene there must be some implication that a senator has deliberately or knowingly made untrue statements. It is for the chair to judge whether that implication is present in any particular instance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Deputy President and I have recently met with all temporary chairs to discuss these issues. Senators are advised that chairs will be enforcing these established practices, along with all other rules of debate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table a publication summarising these practices, entitled
