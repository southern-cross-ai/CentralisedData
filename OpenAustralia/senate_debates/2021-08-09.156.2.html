        Introduction
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government welcomes the opportunity to respond to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Human Rights Sub-Committee (the Sub-committee) on its inquiry into the use of targeted sanctions to address human rights abuses:
        <i>
         Criminality, corruption and impunity: Should Australia join the Global Magnitsky movement?
        </i>
        (the report).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        recognises and appreciates the work of the Sub-committee. It is a comprehensive and detailed report, with 33 recommendations relevant to both the focus of the inquiry and to the administration of Australia's established sanctions framework more broadly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government has carefully considered the report and agrees with the majority of the Sub-committee's recommendations. Australia has a proud history of protecting and promoting human rights globally, and implementation of the majority of the Sub-Committee's recommendations will expand the range of tools available to the Government to respond to situations of international concern involving human rights violations and abuses. Given the broad range of recommendations and their relevance to established processes, the Government's consideration of the report has included close scrutiny of Australia's existing sanctions posture, and whether broader reforms are warranted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In responding to the Sub-committee's report, the Government will undertake a wide range of reforms to the existing autonomous sanctions framework. Such reforms will be aimed at modernising the legislative basis for Australian autonomous sanctions and ensuring that our autonomous sanctions regimes can adapt to Australia's evolving national interests and more swiftly and effectively be used to respond to situations of international concern. The Government will reform the existing autonomous sanctions framework to identify broad categories of situations in relation to which sanctions can be applied. These situations will include the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, threats to international peace and security, such as serious human rights violations and abuses and malicious cyber activity, and activities undermining the rule of law and good governance, such as corruption. The reforms will include establishing thematic criteria for sanctions listings which will enable the Minister for Foreign Affairs to impose sanctions on individuals and entities in response to serious human rights violations and abuses and serious corruption occurring anywhere in the world. The reforms will also provide the opportunity to address inconsistent and ambiguous phraseology in the existing sanctions legislation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia can, and already does, impose autonomous sanctions in response to situations of international concern within its existing country-based sanctions regimes. The expansion of the autonomous sanctions framework to include thematic sanctions will build on this existing approach, and enhance the Government's flexibility to deploy sanctions in response to situations of international concern, if deemed appropriate and in our national interest, including in collaboration with our closest partners who have such powers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will undertake a broader review of Australia's autonomous sanctions framework within 12 months of commencement of the amended legislation to ensure the framework is aligned with contemporary foreign policy objectives. The review-the first of its kind since the establishment of the autonomous sanctions framework a decade ago-will provide the opportunity to achieve efficiencies in existing sanctions processes and ensure that the sanctions regulatory, compliance and enforcement toolkit remains fit-for-purpose. It will provide the opportunity to consider the efficacy of the human rights and corruption-related amendments, including the decision-making processes, and it will include consideration of whether additional legislative reform is necessary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the broader review will consider a range of issues, including compliance and enforcement of our sanctions regimes, the Government does not support any reform that would substantially diminish Ministerial discretion in the making of sanctions listings, facilitate unlimited debate about potential listings, or forewarn potential targets. Accordingly, the Government does not support recommendations made by the Sub-committee that would have such impacts and undermine the effectiveness of sanctions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The listings of individuals and entities for sanctions will continue to be considered on a case-by-case basis, following consideration of all relevant international obligations, foreign policy considerations and risks. Coordinated sanctions action with international partners will continue to be an option, to be undertaken when Australia deems it in our national interest.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australians and international partners rightly have high expectations of Australia, and Australia acts decisively and impactfully for the broader good. The Government recognises the importance of safeguarding our economy from the proceeds of the most egregious human rights violations and abuses and corruption. Such reform serves to not only bar such perpetrators from benefitting from the fruits of our democracy, but also to curb criminal foreign influence in our banking systems. Positioning Australia to act more quickly to freeze out perpetrators and beneficiaries in cooperation with likeminded partners will ensure that we do not become an isolated, attractive safehaven for such proceeds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government's response to the Sub-committee's report will ensure that Australia's sanctions framework continues to play an important role in our foreign policy, in defining, defending and demonstrating our values, and supporting our ability to act in support of the international rulesÂ­ based order.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government thanks the Sub-committee for its work in preparing its report, including considering 162 written submissions and holding 8 days of hearings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sub-committee Recommendations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 1
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The Sub-committee recommends that the Australian Government enact stand-alone targeted sanctions legislation to address human rights violations and corruption, similar to the United States' Magnitsky Act 2012.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees to introduce a new thematic sanctions regime targeting serious human rights violations and abuses, and serious corruption, as part of broader reforms to the existing autonomous sanctions framework, through amending the
        <i>
         Autonomous Sanctions Act 2011
        </i>
        and making consequential amendments to the
        <i>
         Autonomous Sanctions Regulations 2011
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The existing autonomous sanctions regime provides a framework for the imposition of sanctions, including targeted financial sanctions and travel bans, although to date such sanctions have been primarily country-based.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reforms will:

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Incorporating new thematic criteria into the existing autonomous sanctions framework will ensure consistency of powers, offences and procedural safeguards across Australia's broader autonomous sanctions framework. It will also enable implementation using existing processes and legislative schemes, consistent with Recommendation 30.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will undertake a broader review of Australia's autonomous sanctions framework within 12 months of the commencement of the amended legislation to ensure the framework is aligned with contemporary foreign policy objectives. It will provide the opportunity to consider the efficacy of the human rights and corruption-related amendments, including the decision-making processes, and it will include consideration of whether additional legislative reform is necessary.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 2
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The legislation should include a preamble, which would set out the broad purposes and general principles of the Act.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of broader reforms to the autonomous sanctions framework, the Government will amend the
        <i>
         Autonomous Sanctions Act 2011
        </i>
        (the Act) to identify broad categories of situations in relation to which autonomous sanctions may be applied. Such situations will include serious human rights violations and abuses and serious corruption. Consistent with legislative drafting practice, the amendments will introduce a new objects clause into the Act. The policy objectives and intended purpose of the amendments will be set out in the explanatory memorandum. The Government will issue public-facing guidance to support understanding of and compliance with the new thematic sanctions regime. This will be in addition to existing support mechanisms available through the Australian Sanctions Office within the

        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The range of conduct that may be sanctioned should include serious human rights abuse and serious corruption.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees to make reforms to the existing autonomous sanctions regime to provide that targeted sanctions can be imposed on the basis of serious human rights violations and abuses, and serious corruption . The Government will give careful consideration to the scope of conduct that will constitute serious human rights violations and abuses and serious corruption.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The new targeted sanctions legislation should apply to 'serious human rights abuses' with further guidance on thresholds and applicable conduct provided in the preamble.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees to amend the existing autonomous sanctions framework to identify broad categories of situations in relation to which autonomous sanctions may be applied, and to include new thematic human rights and corruption-based criteria for sanctioning individuals or entities. The new listing criteria will have a high threshold that applies to serious human rights violations and abuses, and serious corruption, reflecting that the new regime is a foreign policy tool designed to respond to the most egregious situations of international concern.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In respect of human rights, the new thematic criteria will be focused on three particular rights relating to physical integrity: (i) the right to life; (ii) the right to be free from slavery, not to be held in servitude or required to perform forced or compulsory labour; and (iii) the right to not be subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. The regime will also focus on serious corruption.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although Australia does not recognise a hierarchy of human rights, violations and abuses of these particular rights can have a devastating and often irreversible impact on the physical and mental integrity of a person, as well as on wider society. Focusing on these three rights enables clear criteria to be set for the application of the regime.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the need for guidance on thresholds and applicable conduct, to ensure the new thematic regime is as accessible as possible. The policy objectives and intended purpose of the amendments, and examples of sanctionable conduct, will be set out in the explanatory memorandum and in public-facing guidance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The efficacy of the human rights and corruption-related amendments to the autonomous sanctions framework will be considered as part of the broader legislative and regulatory review of the autonomous sanctions framework.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The preamble acknowledge the importance of maintaining journalist and human rights defenders' human rights and expressly state that systematic extrajudicial actions that intend to limit media freedom can be considered human rights abuses.
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed in principle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees with the importance of maintaining journalist and human rights defenders' human rights. Adverse conduct relating to media freedom could give rise to a range of human rights violations and abuses which would fall within the scope of the new regime, depending on the individual circumstances of a case. The new thematic listing criteria will capture limits to media freedom where such limitations involve serious violations or abuses of one of the three specified rights under the regime, such as activities involving the killing, torture or enslavement of journalists.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As per the Government's response to Recommendations 2 and 4, the policy objectives and intended purpose of the amendments, and examples of sanctionable conduct, will be set out in the explanatory memorandum and in public-facing guidance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia actively supports media freedom and the protection of journalists in our region and globally in a number of other direct and practical ways including: advocating for the protection of journalists, bilaterally and in multilateral forums including the

        Response: Noted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important that Australia's autonomous sanctions framework is as accessible and comprehensible to the public as possible, now and into the future. The reforms will identify the conduct in relation to which sanctions can be imposed. The Government will seek to ensure that the framework is not limited by context-specific terminology. The amendments will be accessible, consistent with clarity of laws principles, and drafted in accordance with the Office of Parliamentary Counsel's Drafting Directions.

       <p class="italic">
        Response: Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consistent with several of Australia's existing country-based autonomous sanctions regimes, the Government agrees that the new regime should be capable of being applied broadly (including capturing immediate family and direct beneficiaries of relevant conduct), and subject to ministerial discretion based on analysis of the relevant listing criteria, risks and Australia's national interest, in addition to considerations of procedural fairness and the protection of human rights. It will be critical to ensure the regime has an appropriate level of flexibility to ensure all relevant considerations can be taken into account, and sanctions are only applied beyond the immediate perpetrators of the relevant serious human rights violation or abuse where it is reasonable to do so.

This may capture associated entities, depending on the circumstances.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australian autonomous sanctions are a foreign policy tool, used in pursuit of foreign policy goals. Under the new regime, sanctions will be able to be imposed on any person, including Australian citizens or residents, where a sufficient connection is established between that person and the relevant conduct of concern in a foreign country. Australia's current autonomous sanctions framework does not specifically exclude Australian citizens from the imposition of targeted financial sanctions and travel bans. To date, it has been Australia's practice not to apply sanctions to individuals within its territorial jurisdiction due to the availability of other measures, including criminal justice processes, and the disproportionate impact of those sanctions on the broader community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As with existing autonomous sanctions regimes, the appropriateness of imposing sanctions under the new regime will be considered on a case-by-case basis with regard to the particular circumstances and Australia's national interest.

Decisions to impose targeted financial sanctions and travel bans appropriately rest with the Minister for Foreign Affairs (as per Recommendation 17). Such decisions are made in light of careful consideration of all foreign policy considerations, risks and Australia's national interest. It is important that the Government retain appropriate flexibility in the application of sanctions, as acknowledged by the Sub-committee in its report.

        The Government notes that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade (JSCFADT) could perform some of the functions of an independent advisory body, and inquire into and make recommendations on possible listings under the new regime in respect of particular situations of international concern, following referral by the Minister for Foreign Affairs or either

It would also be open to the JSCFADT Human Rights Sub-committee to request that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade provide private briefings on human rights situations in particular countries. The JSCFADT is just one means of achieving independent advice, and any such referrals could complement existing procedures that inform Ministerial decisions on sanctions listings.
