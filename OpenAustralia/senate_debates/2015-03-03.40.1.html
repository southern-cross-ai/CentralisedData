        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. I refer to the government's decision to tear up the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guideline and the Prime Minister's statement:

       <p class="italic">
        I want to make it absolutely crystal clear that no cleaner's pay is reduced.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister confirm that cleaners at the Department of Immigration and Border Protection have suffered a pay cut of $2 per hour as a result of yet another broken promise by the Prime Minister?

         for the question. The simple reality is that when the guidelines were removed in July, nobody's pay was cut. Nor was anybody's pay cut in August or in September or in October. I understand that a situation has arisen in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection where some workers are now subject to a new contract regime. So let's get this clear: it had nothing to do with the removal of guidelines, which was a vote of no confidence both in the trade union movement and in the Fair Work Commission. What these guidelines basically meant was that the union movement's enterprise bargaining agreements were not seen as good enough where the unions had signed off on them and where they had gone to the Fair Work Commission in the modern award saying, 'This is something that we agreed to', and signed off on. What they did as a government towards the end of their term was to seek to boost certain wage outcomes in only a very few offices of one per cent of cleaners, where you had, for example, offices owned or operated by Comcare being cleaned by cleaners on different pay scales.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we say to those opposite is very clear: wages should be set either by an enterprise agreement or under the modern award and not by government interference. The changes that have occurred at the Department of Immigration and Border Protection are a result of new contractual arrangements because the contract—

                 Those opposite are just shouting their no confidence in the trade union movement's capacity to negotiate enterprise bargaining agreements. What you are saying is: the enterprise bargaining agreement, under which these workers are now operating, is unsatisfactory and is not paying workers what they deserve. If that is the case, they should go to the Fair Work Commission, argue their case and get a pay increase through that mechanism rather than have a Labor Party government, as happened, trying to throw around money to placate a trade union including, as part of the deal, that every cleaner had to be introduced to the trade union. I wonder why that might be! It was for the dividend, which would have cost more than $2 an hour, I am sure.

                      , I raise a point of order on relevance. The question was about cleaners in the department of immigration. It is not about any other industrial matter, as much as the minister would like to ignore it. While I am on my feet, if I may, Mr President, could I respectfully request that you consider the
