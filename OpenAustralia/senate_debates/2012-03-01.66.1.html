        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy, regarding the dumping of dredge spoil in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        . The public found out last weekend, on the front page of the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        , that the government is proposing to impose a fee for dumping dredge spoil—spoil which has been ripped off the sea floor in the first place—right back onto the reef. Only selected closed consultation was undertaken by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
        </a>
        Authority on this incredible proposal, so the Australian people know very little about it. My question is: what on earth was the government thinking with this proposal to force the authority charged with protecting the reef to raise money from polluting it and when did the government plan to tell the Australian public about its plans to turn the reef into a marine rubbish tip?

         I think Senator Waters for her question, but I would caution her—and I am sure all of our colleagues sitting around the chamber would join me in this—not to take anything on the front page of the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         as a given fact. I am sure I do not need to explain that to your colleagues.

         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef
         </a>
         is, as you know, one of the world's great treasures and the Australian government is committed to responsible management of this region to protect it for future generations. Disposing of dredge material in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
         </a>
         is absolutely a last option and all proposals are subject to a rigorous environmental impact assessment process before a permit is granted. The Australian government has asked the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority
         </a>
         to consult on a proposed environmental management charge for the disposal of dredge material in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.
        </p>
        <p>
         The authority is perfectly capable of making decisions to protect the reef regardless of how revenue is raised. You only have to look at Mr Burke's response to the Hummock Hill Island proposal, which would have increased revenue through the tourism management charge, to see this. It is absurd that tourism operators have to pay a charge to operate in the reef but that dredgers do not.

         Marine Park is widely recognised as one of the best managed marine protected areas in the world. It is a multiple use marine park which supports a range of activities, industries, communities and businesses. The Australian government has asked that consultation occur in relation to the possible introduction of an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMC" rel="nofollow">
          EMC

However, it is recognised that, in some circumstances, the disposal of dredge material in the marine park is the only feasible option.

                values, with the proposed more than trebling of shipping through reef ports and with the unprecedented dredging—to facilitate fossil fuel exports—in the World Heritage area, has the government told UNESCO about these pay-to-pollute dumping plans? What is the government doing to stop Australia joining Yemen, Afghanistan and the

                 It should be noted that dredge spoil has been disposed of in the marine park over many years in accordance with strict permit conditions. The proposal to introduce an
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMC" rel="nofollow">
                  EMC

                 for dredge material will provide for additional measures to protect the

                 . It is anticipated that by having a charge fewer applications will actually be received to dispose of dredge material in the marine park. If there is any further information that I can add or that the minister would like to add to that, I will take any further parts of your question on notice.
