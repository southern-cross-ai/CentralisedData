        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Why does the government claim that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        is costing $35.7 billion when it is clear from the summary of the NBN business case that the real cost of this project is in fact $49.5 billion, representing a $6.5 billion blow-out on the government’s previously stated worst-case scenario?

         It is regrettable that the good senator has not had the opportunity to speak to the shadow minister on this issue and instead has read some of the articles that have appeared in the newspapers. I think the senator is trying to add together the figure for capital expenditure and the figure for operational expenditure. That is a definitional ‘apples and oranges’ problem. I think the senator will find that even Mr Turnbull is no longer pressing this issue. It is unfortunate that he did not give you a call before question time to let you know that was no longer the line.

           I was just going to say that that might have something to do with the events of a year ago. The reality is that, if you read the business case summary which was released, it is quite clear what the capital expenditure amount is. As you know, it is substantially less than the implementation study previously concluded. That is very good news, because the business case tells us, in the information that the government has received, that this project can be rolled out more cheaply and to more homes than was previously thought.
          </p>
          <p>
           If you were interested in the transformational technology that broadband is, you would actually welcome that, but what we have from the opposition is this mindless opposition to anything of substance, including on this issue. Extraordinarily, we saw today the opposition, who say they want scrutiny, filibustering and playing procedural games so as to avoid debating the bill.

             The government is very clear about the importance of this project, because we understand that broadband is the infrastructure of the 21st century. This is the roads, rails and ports of this century. We also understand the importance—

I asked the minister very specifically what would happen if the independent review she commissioned found that the business case was no good. The minister is giving me some sort of a generic statement about the merits of the

                Mr President
               </a>
               , one of the challenges Senator Cormann has in asking a question like that is that it is hypothetical—it asks: what would happen—and he confirmed that with his point of order. Clearly it is a hypothetical question. It should in ordinary circumstances be ruled out of order. The point of it is of little value to the opposition, but the minister in answering the question can answer that part of the question that is capable of being answered, from a senator from the other side who is clearly out of his depth when asking a question of a hypothetical nature, as he has done.

                    I do not accept the premise of the question. We have a very clear view about the financial viability of this project, and that is a view based on the studies undertaken, the expert panel, the implementation study and the business case which has been received and, of course, the consideration the government will give this. It has been quite clearly indicated by the government that we believe this project is clearly financially viable. There has been a lot of discussion in this place and elsewhere about the fact that there is an internal rate of return above the long-term bond rate. This project stacks up. The reality is that the opposition are not interested in whether the project stacks up. They are not interested in whether this is good policy. They are only interested in opposing it—that is all; just opposition.
