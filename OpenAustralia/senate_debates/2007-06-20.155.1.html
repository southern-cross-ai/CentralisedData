         Labor welcomes grassroots political activity such as that demonstrated by the 10,000 demonstrators referred to in this motion. However, Labor opposes this motion as it is merely an act of political sabotage rather than a genuine attempt to advance the debate on the proposed pulp mill. The government has established an environmental assessment process under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
         </a>
         1999 for the proposed pulp mill near Launceston. The government has committed to achieving balanced environmental, economic and social outcomes and using due process and great thoroughness in the assessment of the pulp mill proposal. Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Brown" rel="nofollow">
          Bob Brown
         </a>
         is attempting to muddy the waters with regard to the proposed pulp mill with this motion. Senator Bob Brown wants to debate issues that are not related to the environmental assessment process that the government is undertaking. Instead, Senator Bob Brown wants to sidetrack the debate so that he can fight against the proposed pulp mill on a purely emotional basis rather than on the basis of informed judgements based on environmental studies. Labor opposes the motion. However Labor has always supported grassroots participation in the political process and will continue to do so in the future. Senator Bob Brown’s motion has nothing to do with grassroots politics and everything to do with distorting the true debate.

          The motion reads:

         <p class="moved">
          That the Senate congratulates the 10 000 or more Tasmanians who turned out in Launceston on Saturday, 16 June 2007 to protest against the proposed

          pulp mill, for their civic pride, concern for the environment and peaceful expression of opinion in the best of democratic traditions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Labor and, indeed, the government cannot have it both ways. If ever there was an expression of grassroots support for a cause—which is for the protection of the living environment and the forests in Tasmania and against the pulp mill—it was the 10,000 or more citizens of Tasmania who turned out in Launceston on Saturday. When the Premier,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Lennon" rel="nofollow">
           Paul Lennon
          </a>
          , called a meeting in favour of the pulp mill some weeks ago, 47 people turned up. My submission here is that the people opposed to this pulp mill have every right to express that opinion peaceably, as they did.
