        I have a series of questions for the minister. Again, I'm supportive of the bill. I'm supportive of the stability and assurance that the bill provides to people who are beneficiaries of the PBS but also the companies that engage with the government in relation to this. Minister, can you confirm that the catch-up provisions in the bill are only meant to apply to those listed brands that have been on the PBS for 15 years?

            I might come back to that. It was reported in PharmaDispatch on 10 November 2021 that catch-up price reductions will contribute to something like $1.9 billion in savings in the course of five years because of the agreement between Medicines Australia and the federal government. In terms of calculating that saving—and I'm happy for you to present a different number if that's not correct—I'm wondering which of the brands listed on the PBS are subject to the cuts, because that clearly must have been included as part of the calculation.

             The catch-up reductions are one part of the contribution to that $1.9 billion, and the schedule of drugs that it's calculated from will be made available in 2022.

              In some sense this goes to secrecy, which, as you know, I don't like very much. If you're not listing the drugs now, why is that the case? Why won't you at least let people see which drugs are going to be affected? That, in my view, is consistent with the general principle of setting up an arrangement that does give companies surety and, indeed, allows the users of the PBS to see what will and won't be affected.

                If you've calculated some cost savings, you must have done that on the basis of some calculations at least. I accept that there are a couple of moving parts to this, but you must have come to that number by doing at least some analysis.

                     The projection can be made with reasonable accuracy because there are some drugs that are five years older and we know they're going to fall into the net, but there are a number, a smaller number, that are unconfirmed at this point in time.

                          The bill sets out a schedule that deals with changes at different points in time, one of which is 15 years. My question, really, is going to whether there is a possibility that some of the brands that are currently on the list but haven't been on there for 15 years will be affected by the 15-year change.

                                      Under five companies? Thank you very much. I presume we've had discretions in the past. You've talked about discretions that are already in place. Can you give me some idea of how that discretion has been exercised in the past, in terms of, perhaps, the number of applications versus the number of exemptions that have been made using the discretion.
