        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Watt. We've heard already about the good news of China lifting its trade barriers in relation to barley. I note the government's support for the agriculture industry's ambition to achieve $100 billion in farmgate output by 2030. When speaking with farmers, they constantly tell me that boosting trade and market access for our premium agricultural product is critical to achieving this objective. How is the Albanese government's strong focus on improving agricultural trade outcomes benefiting farmers on the ground here in Australia?

         Thank you, Senator Sterle, for asking the third question this week from Labor senators about agriculture, which I think is as many as the opposition have asked in the entire parliament. That's how interested they are in agriculture. The Albanese government, as you said, Senator Sterle, is putting the runs on the board this year to ensure Australian farmers, processors and exporters have the best possible access to international markets.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Across Australia
         </a>
         , one in four jobs rely on trade, so access to international markets is essential for the profitability of Australia's export focused agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Recently, there have been positive developments in the reinstatement of trade in cotton, horticulture and timber and the removal of tariffs from Australian barley going to China. Our calm persistence and sensible dialogue has expedited an outcome for Australian barley producers, with the removal of tariff barriers. I am aware a small number of key grains exporters are still suspended from accessing the Chinese market, and we are working with industry and the Chinese customs agency to ensure that all producers are now promptly registered and allowed access to the market. Just yesterday Minister Farrell wrote to his Chinese counterpart, Minister Wang Wentao, to seek his assistance to promptly conclude the relisting of these exporters. There is also more work to be done to remove the trade barriers that remain on wine, beef and lobster going into the Chinese market, and the Albanese government will continue that work.
        </p>
        <p>
         While our government is working incredibly hard to restore market access with our largest trading partner, the first half of this year has also been very successful in opening the agriculture sector to new markets as well as improving and maintaining existing markets. The barley industry has been a diversification success story. Producers have increased their exports to the rest of the world from $400 million to $3 billion. More broadly, our trade strategy is paying dividends for Aussie farmers. Through expanding markets, the Albanese government is delivering a growth agenda for Australian agriculture.

           Thank you, Senator Sterle; I would love to do that. The Albanese government is committed to protecting and growing our agricultural trade markets, and expanding exports is a key part of that. Last year we recorded 107 technical market access achievements worth a potential $5.47 billion, and 2023 is continuing to advance these successes.
          </p>
          <p>
           India continues to be a fruitful trading partner for Australian agriculture and one that has massive potential as the market opens up. During my recent trip to India, where I was accompanied by about a dozen agricultural leaders, it was great to see such cooperation between our two countries. The recent Australia-India economic cooperation and trade agreement has seen improved conditions and new market access opened to enable trade of Australian Hass avocados. We have also successfully removed tariffs on the export of Australian sheepmeat, rock lobster, wool, most woods and pulps, and hides and skins to India. New markets mean new business for Aussie farmers, and the Albanese government is delivering that.

              They might want to listen over there. Clearly the Albanese government is on the side of farmers and the agricultural sector, especially those areas looking to expand into new markets around the world. Bearing all that in mind, Minister, how is this news being received in regional Australia?

               decision to drop its tariffs is a huge boost to the government and a blow to the opposition. The government's ability to unlock a billion dollar buyer of Australian barley is a major coup. The coalition government was unable to broker an end to the crippling sanctions because of a series of perceived snubs towards China, not least from former Prime Minister Scott Morrison.'
