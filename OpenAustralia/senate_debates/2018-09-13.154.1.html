             port to the Carmichael coalmine in central Queensland? I ask the minister: can he advise the Senate just how important this 200-kilometre-long rail line that has a capacity of some 40 million tonnes of coal per annum is? How important is that to Queensland and Australia as a whole?

              I thank Senator Macdonald for his question. As he rightly outlined, it is a very important question about the future of not just
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
               North Queensland
              </a>
              but also our nation. Adani made a very important announcement today in Rockhampton that they are proceeding with this project with a changed design for their rail line. Their original design was a 388-kilometre rail line, which was sabotaged for political reasons by the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
               Queensland Labor Party
              </a>
              to try to win an election, sabotaged to try to trade off jobs in Northern and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
               Central Queensland
              </a>
              for votes in Brisbane. That's what they were trying to do. But isn't it great news that, despite the best efforts of the Labor Party, these jobs may still be delivered for North and Central Queensland and for Australia? This announcement shows there is a commitment to open up the Galilee Basin, a commitment that would unlock not just this particular mine but other mines as well that could deliver up to 15,000 direct mining jobs across the region that are extremely important for our country.
             </p>
             <p>
              The problem is that we still have questions about the position of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Labor Party
              </a>
              on this project. Earlier this year Mr Shorten was asked for his thoughts on Adani, and Mr Shorten said, 'I make no secret that I don't like it very much.' That was Mr Shorten's view. He doesn't like the creation of jobs. There is still, however, a problem, because we still have a bit of a secret about the position of people on the other side. There's Senator Watt, who is a regular fly-in fly-out visitor to Rockhampton. We don't know what his view is on this issue. Does he not like it very much when thousands of new members are created for the CFMMEU? He might not like it very much, but we don't really know. What's Senator Ketter's position on this? Does he like it very much when thousands of North Queenslanders get opportunities to have a job and have a go in life? Does he like that very much? I'm not going to miss you, Senator Chisholm. What's Senator Chisholm's view on this project? We still don't know if they are going to have a senator in Central Queensland; we don't know their view of this imaginary Central Queensland senator.

                             As Senator Macdonald outlined, there are other opportunities here beyond just this particular proposal. There are six proposed mines at the moment in the Galilee Basin, delivering more than 15,000 jobs. This particular rail line would kickstart those opportunities. It would open up those opportunities through the basin. The important thing about today's announcement is that while Adani's proposed new line is shorter than their previous proposal—it will hook into the existing Aurizon rail network—it will still be able to take the proposed original 40 million tonnes per annum along that line. In Adani's first stage, they are proposing to use 27.5 million tonnes of that capacity. There is still capacity there for new projects. I'm advised that, with minimal upgrades, the capacity could be up to 100 million tonnes per annum. That means more revenue for our country, more royalties for the Queensland government, more tax revenue for Australia and better services for all Australians.

                                saying that the global coal market is in structural decline. Just to clarify the facts in this place, in the 12 months to July coal not only achieved a record amount of exports for Australia but became the biggest export in our nation. In the 12 months to July it overtook iron ore as our biggest export. But according to the Labor Party, who apparently represent CFMMEU workers, it is a market in structural decline. They are talking down the job prospects and livelihoods of their own voters and their own members for political purposes.

                                It has been a great week for coal, because not only have we had this announcement today but we also had Clean Coal Day in Japan this week. They are celebrating coal in Japan. I couldn't make it, unfortunately; but the Victorian government sent someone, so that was something. We celebrate coal on this side of politics, and we celebrate its jobs. Isn't it great to see more of them being created?
