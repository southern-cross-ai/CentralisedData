        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Supreme Court
        </a>
        today determined that COVID-19 vaccine mandates imposed on police and health workers were unlawful.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Queensland Police Service and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Health
        </a>
        were wrong to force mandates on their organisations. I said, from the start, these mandates were wrong. I said, from the start, they contravened section 51(xxiiiA) of the Constitution, which prohibits civil conscription through the provision of medical services.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        was the only party saying it. I said, from the start, the mandates should be unlawful. I introduced legislation in this parliament that would have made certain they were unlawful. With a couple of notable exceptions, the government, the opposition, the Greens, Jacqui Lambie, and others, Independents, refused to support my bill. You all got it wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        I feel vindicated, once again, that I have got things right and I'm in tune with the Australian people. You didn't care that people were being coerced into vaccination, at risk of their jobs. You didn't care that the individual freedoms and rights you were supposed to defend and protect were under attack. You relished the power that state governments were taking from their citizens. You cheered them on. You were wrong. One Nation was right, because we were standing up for the individual freedoms and constitutional authority that underpin Australian democracy. You didn't, and you attacked us for it. You were wrong.
       </p>
       <p>
        This decision by Queensland's Supreme Court makes it paramount that we have a royal commission into the COVID-19 pandemic. The Prime Minister's toothless inquiry must be abandoned. Only a royal commission can compel the secret advice that led to these unlawful vaccine mandates in Queensland. And I feel for the firefighters that have gone through it as well in
