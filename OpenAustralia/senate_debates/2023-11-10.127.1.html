        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. This week in the Senate the vast majority of legislation passed were bills brought forward by Senators Lambie and Pocock. These four bills were passed without any voices against and therefore without a division being called. The Labor Party did not oppose these four bills. Given Labor's support for these bills, will the government give their commitment to treat the Senate, and Senators Lambie and Pocock in particular, with appropriate respect by allowing these bills to be debated and voted on in the House of Representatives next week?

         First, I note: is this not Senator Babet's question? No, this is yours. Have you handed it to the Libs?
        </p>
        <p>
         Oh, now we know. We already knew. Are you going to join? Maybe you should. I would just make the point that I'm interested to get a question on legislation from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Opposition_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
         </a>
         , whose leadership is so fragile that he holds up a bill that he supports and that is important for Santos in his home town because Senator Canavan wants an inquiry, and he lines up his people to vote with the Greens to prevent legislation he supports. I mean, that is the Senate legislation program. It's all about the internals of the Liberal Party and the National Party. That is all it's about. So, if you want to come in here and talk about the legislation program, can you explain to Santos, to South Australians, to the people—oh, yes, I'm unsurprised—

          President, a point of order: the question was very clearly about the industrial relations bills that related and were moved by Senators Lambie and Pocock, not any other legislation before the Senate. And of course they were bills the government itself was too weak to even call a division over.

              I didn't really see the other side disagree, because they know what is happening. You are voting with the Greens against legislation you support. Maybe those who care about national security should think about the fact that the governments of Korea and Japan have been asking us to pass the legislation. You're lining up with the Greens. And this is a party of government! Look at what they have become.

                This week in the Senate the government has failed miserably to manage its own legislative program. In five days not a single government bill that wasn't non-contro has passed, yet the government has not once asked for extra hours nor extra sitting time, nor did it put to the coalition any cooperative proposal—just a guillotine, take it or leave it. Will the government come to the Senate next week with less arrogance and more willingness to show the give and take that has always been required and shown to get things done in this Senate?

                                 I respect, but disagree with, the position of the Greens. They have been consistent, but I do not respect a party of government that votes against something for five days in the Senate, then complains about it—votes against it because they want an inquiry to shore up their internals. That's not how parties of government behave.
