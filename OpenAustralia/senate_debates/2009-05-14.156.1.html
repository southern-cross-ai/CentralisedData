        Last Sunday was Mother’s Day and each year thousands of women, men and children participate in the Mother’s Day Classic, the biggest community fundraising event for breast cancer research in Australia. One in nine women will be diagnosed with breast cancer during their lifetime and only knowledge, awareness and investment in research will ensure this statistic improves.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother" rel="nofollow">
         The Mother
        </a>
        ’s Day Classic is a fantastic community event that promotes awareness of breast cancer. It also highlights the importance of improving the quality of life of those suffering from the disease and how inspirational their stories and the stories of breast cancer survivors can be.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, survival from breast cancer in Australia has been on the increase for several years. About 90 per cent of women aged between 40 and 69 years when diagnosed will be alive after five years. For younger women, the statistics are not so favourable. Survival is lower. Only around 82.4 per cent of those aged 20 to 29 years and 84.8 per cent of those aged 30 to 39 years will still be alive five years after being diagnosed with the illness. The bravery and strength of breast cancer survivors cannot be underestimated. Treatment is draining and sometimes invasive. It is at times like this when the support of family and friends is crucial for making these challenges that little bit easier to face.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to honour the memory of a dear friend of mine, Francesca, or Fran, Gwyther, who lost her battle with breast cancer in November 2008. Fran was a woman who left an impression on everyone she met. I was honoured and fortunate to know Fran during my years at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Manufacturing_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , where she was a great support to my colleagues and me during some of the more difficult times. She was a tremendously talented women, an expert in the printing and mailing industry. Fran was loyal and had enormous energy, integrity and a great sense of humour. Married to John, mother to three young children—Ellie, Kate and Mark—and successful in business with her printing and mailing company, G&amp;G Trade Publishing, Fran lived a full life—a life full of achievements, family happiness and commitment to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Never content with simply watching from the sidelines, Fran put her heart and soul into everything she did. The Boroondara and

        netball associations, where she was a multiple premiership coach, Balwyn Combined Football Club and Balwyn Primary School are just a few of the many organisations Fran devoted her time to. She approached her community commitments with enthusiasm and energy. Fran put her heart and soul into everything she did—whether it was parenting, sport, coaching or being a fan of the

        </a>
        . Fran was passionate about the Carlton Football Club and was a proud member of the club. She attended games even on the days when her illness dictated she should have stayed at home. Fran was a member of the Women of Carlton group and, always true to her strong sense of social justice, Fran fought strongly for the rights of her fellow Carlton members.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fran was a champion of working people and always fought for the underdog. She was a generous person who was always prepared to give people a fair go. Fran was never judgmental and helped many young people get a start in their working life. Her desire to protect the rights of her peers and to speak her mind was apparent even during her school days. This was never more evident than when she called

        ’s made her class let the hems of their skirts down because they were too short.
       </p>
       <p>
        Running her own business for over 20 years gave Fran the opportunity to put her strong sense of integrity and social justice into practice. She was always open to giving people a chance and did whatever she could to help anyone she knew who was unemployed or struggling financially. Fran really understood the importance of self-respect. Giving people a reason to get out of bed and the opportunity to recognise they had something to give to society was more valuable to Fran than material wealth. Fran pursued not a life of riches but the richness of life. Despite her hectic schedule, Fran’s No. 1 priority was her family and friends. Being a mother brought her happiness and joy. Growing up, Fran had a close, loving relationship with her family and was the favourite of her father, Lennie, a hardworking and proud Italian migrant. She was a loyal sister to her two brothers and sister, and the friends she made during her years at school became friends for life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The strong sense of fun and curiosity she had as a child remained with her until the end. It is heartbreaking when someone so young, so loved and so vibrant leaves us before we are ready to say goodbye. After a four-year battle with breast cancer, Fran remained strong and positive well beyond a time when she could have easily given up. Questions about how she was going were always answered with humour and a smile. I will never forget the way Fran embraced life with such energy and courage. Her commitment to the union movement, her commitment to her family and her commitment to giving the underdog a chance will always remain with me. My thoughts are with her family, who displayed incredible strength during this difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The premature loss of exceptional people like Fran is a reminder to us all that so much more work needs to be done in the field of breast cancer research. As one of the top five causes of death in Australian women and the leading cause of death in 45- to 64-year-olds, breast cancer is a mystery far from being solved. However, there have been some recent medical breakthroughs and encouraging initiatives to make the lives of Australian women with breast cancer that little bit easier. These initiatives do not make things any easier for Fran’s family, who have already watched a loved one lose her battle with cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fran’s story is a sad one but one of courage—a loving wife and mother and a fantastic friend to all who knew her. Vale, Fran. You will be missed by your family; you will be missed by your friends. Your family and friends paid their respects at a packed and overflowing St Bede’s church. You will always be remembered as a beautiful, intelligent and courageous woman. Thank you for giving me the honour of being your friend.
