        As a number of requests for amendments have been circulated, I advise that senators proposing requests must circulate a statement of reasons for framing them as requests, together with a statement by the Clerk on whether the amendments would be regarded as requests under the precedence of the Senate. Is it the wish of the committee that the statements accompanying the circulated requests be incorporated in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        immediately after the requests to which they relate? There being no objection, it is so ordered. The question is that the bill be agreed to without amendments or requests.

         We have a series of questions which I would like to ask fairly quickly. I don't intend to hold up the chamber, but I'm wondering if we could address those and then move to deal with the amendments? Okay. Thank you. I presume the government will be circulating some amendments.

          Yes, we will. That should be imminent—in the next few minutes. I explained what the amendments would do in my summing-up speech. I'm happy to go through that again. The key is that the amendments will provide an expanded regulation-making power to the minister to address the issues that we indicated we would address. Specifically, we are in a position to flag very clearly that the minister intends to use this power imminently to make student payments—for Abstudy, Austudy and youth allowance (student)—and to make changes to the partner income test to make sure that they are captured by the coronavirus supplement arrangements.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are some other things that these amendments will enable us to do. Essentially, they will increase the flexibility for us to deal with a whole range of things—from payment rates to means-testing arrangements, eligibility criteria, waiting periods and residency requirements—to respond to things in a flexible, measured and timely manner. The amendments themselves don't make the change; they give us the power to make the change.

           I thank the minister for that response. There are some specific issues in both the existing provisions in the bill and the new ones that you're going to circulate through the amendment. At the moment, the supplement is $550. I understand that the minister has the capacity to vary that after six months. That's already there. Can the rate of that supplement payment be varied before the six months is up?

             <p>
              That could be done. But I've got to say that that is not our intention as I stand here today, the reason being that we have focused on targeting the income support very specifically on those who've been impacted by a significant change in circumstance. We can have an argument about the level of income support across different income categories, but one cannot argue that there has been a dramatic change in circumstance in the level of income before and after the coronavirus hit in relation to, for example, disability support pensions. What we have done is made a decision for a second $750 payment that goes to all those that are not eligible for the coronavirus supplement.

               Minister, I've had contact with—and I'm sure many of my colleagues across the chamber have had contact with—disabled people that are on
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSP" rel="nofollow">
                DSP
               </a>
               who believe and very strongly argue that they will have additional costs because of their disability. I put that on the record, and we'll be coming back to the government about that, but I'm asking specifically about people on the disability support pension who work, who lose their jobs. I gave an example in my second reading contribution where somebody is in a circumstance where they're continuing to work when they probably shouldn't be, because they're worried about the economic impact of having to stop work. This supplement is not going to be available to them. If they're a parent, they're on DSP and they have to give up their job because of the health threat—because they've got disabilities—how can they make up that additional money that they're losing?

                        Thank you, Senator Siewert; I now understand what you are asking. We have applied an absolute maximum amount of resources across the entire social security system so that we can supercharge the speed with which we are able to process payments across the entire range of either changes or existing payments that have been increased so that people are able to get access to this money as quickly as possible. In terms of giving an exact time, I'll have to take that on notice.

                         Thank you, Minister. You have given a commitment to, in some instances, five days. I find it hard to believe that you can get your income support payment, jobseeker payment and Indue card in that length of time. Could you also take on notice, please, what length of time you calculate it will take.

                          As I said in my speech earlier, my office has been inundated with messages from students, many of whom are already below the poverty line. They are really concerned about not being included in the coronavirus supplement. Last night the Prime Minister said that they were included; youth allowance was included in the coronavirus supplement. I can't find it there at the moment. I know my colleagues here and in the other place have been asking questions today about this, but haven't got clarity on this. So could you clarify if students on youth allowance, Abstudy and Austudy are included in the coronavirus supplement?

                           I have addressed that on a number of occasions now. Firstly, the Prime Minister was right. Youth allowance (other), as it's called, has been part of the coronavirus supplement payment arrangements from the outset. But, as we have indicated, the government has decided to move an amendment, which I will move now, given I'm on my feet. I move government amendment (1) on sheet

What the government and the minister have made clear is that we intend to use this power immediately on passage of this legislation, and after royal assent has been received, to make student payments—Abstudy, Austudy and youth allowance (student)—eligible for the coronavirus supplement on the same basis as the other jobseeker payment. Sorry, I thought I'd made that clear before.

                              Subject to the passage of this suite of bills, the access criteria will be largely dependent on the income test. If the individual meets the income test and can demonstrate that they have had a loss of income that takes them below that threshold, they will be eligible for the payment. We will be waiving a number of things and that will expand the eligibility. That includes: the one-week waiting period; the liquid assets waiting period, which relates to the $5,500 cash limit; and also the assets test, which is focused on sole traders and small businesses so that they are able to retain the assets of their business in the hope that, once they get through this crisis, they will be able to return to their businesses.

                                      I'm happy to take some legal advice in relation to the specific legal meaning of what you are referring to. But what I would say is that the purpose of these regulations is to make sure that anybody who was in employment who has lost their employment or had a substantial diminution in the money they are earning will be able to get access to welfare support payments, including the coronavirus supplement, so that they are able to make ends meet between now and when this crisis is over in the hope that they will be able to return to their existing employment. Apart from the income test that will still apply, there are really very few other requirements that we will expect an employee who has lost their job to meet in order for them to be eligible to receive payment over the next six-month period.

                                            Our policy intent is very clear. We're obviously now drafting this reasonably quickly. I'm happy to take this back for a moment, to address that and have a proper sunset clause.

                                               Senator, I'm going to take that on notice to give you an exact answer, but I can tell you that over the last few days every resource that has been available within Centrelink and all external resources that we have been able to access have been moved into the processing of the new payments that are coming online. So, whilst I'm not going to absolutely say no, I think the answer is no, but I will confirm that for you, because over the coming months our only focus is going to be making sure that we apply every resource that is at our disposal to process new applications as quickly as we can.

As opposed to that, the changes that are enabled by the amendment would actually allow changes for temporary visa holders outside of the scope of the existing measures that are contained in the special benefit.

So what this amendment would do is allow people who have not been here for that period of time to perhaps, if you make a regulation, to access income support? Is that one of the ways this is varied?

That exists in the primary legislation. This regulation will enable changes to be made outside of that. So that actually is contained in the primary legislation already.

It's about 1.6 million people, as I understand it. Could you first confirm, Minister, that there is the capacity under the amendments that you have just tabled for support to be provided to people who are in Australia and on temporary protection visas and for various reasons are not able to leave the country or who actually live in the country but do not have access to income supports. So, firstly, does that capacity exist under this amendment? Secondly, is it the government's policy intent to provide those people, many of whom are seeking asylum, many of whom are

The government is indeed introducing a coronavirus supplement of $550 per fortnight where the eligibility is driven by a residency-in-Australia requirement. Access to jobseeker payment and youth allowance, however, is available to people residing in Australia who are Australian citizens and permanent residents, assuming all other eligibility criteria are met. It will not be available to people in Australia on temporary visas, other than some people in limited circumstances on special category visas.

                                                            Australia's social security system is a non-contributory, residents based system. It is primarily designed to support Australian citizens and permanent residents. In order to enhance access to these payments for permanent residents we are temporarily waiving the newly arrived residents waiting period in order to assist permanent residents to get access to jobseeker payments. Generally residency requirements still apply, and most temporary visa holders do not qualify for jobseeker payments and other forms of income support.

Classes of temporary visa holders eligible for special benefit are specified in the legislative instrument and currently include temporary partner visas, temporary humanitarian visas and bridging visas for victims of human trafficking.

Visa types such as temporary resident, other employment and temporary resident skilled employment will be included by the minister in the near future. Special benefit is paid at the same rate as jobseeker payment—previously Newstart allowance—for those aged 22 years and older or youth allowance for those aged under 22 years. To qualify for special benefit people must be in financial hardship and unable to earn a sufficient livelihood for themselves and any dependents. Claims must meet a hardship test based on their liquid assets. Those who're expected to only need payment for less than 13 weeks must have liquid assets of less than two weeks worth of payment, $565.70 for a single person with no children aged 22 years or older. To access the special benefit, in addition to meeting the hardship test, they must have experienced a substantial change in circumstances. Special benefit has a stronger income test than other payments. Any income or income support—for example, free accommodation—is deducted dollar for dollar. Other payments have a tapered income test.

                                                            The short answer is that we are not proposing to extend those arrangements to visa holders beyond newly arrived residents with permanent residency still serving their newly arrived residents waiting period and those who are temporary resident, other employment and temporary resident skilled employment visa holders. They are the ones that will be covered by this supplement beyond youth allowance, jobseeker payments, recipients of parenting payment, recipients of partner and single farm household allowance, and special benefit recipients.

                                                             I do thank the minister for that clarification. Minister, the simple fact remains that your government cut many thousands of people seeking asylum off the Status Resolution Support Services program, which left them with no income support at all from government. What I'm hearing from you this evening is that you have no intention of providing income support for those people. They're losing their jobs too. What are they supposed to do? They are going to lose their homes. Do you expect them to be thrown out on the street? It's beyond belief, having cut them off the SRSS a few years ago and effectively forcing them into work—whatever they could get. Are they now to be left with no income at all and face homelessness and destitution, as well as their families and their children? It's cruel and callous, and quite frankly it beggars belief.

My Tasmanian colleague and Greens federal small business portfolio holder Senator Peter Whish-Wilson is obviously not here this evening. We already explained that a number of our senators were not able to come to participate in this extraordinary session. He and his team have been working round the clock to make sure that they are listening to the needs and desires of small businesses, including many microbusinesses like sole traders. Sole traders include many farmers, stay-at-home entrepreneurs—whether they be in the arts and creative space or in various health fields—tourism operators and musicians. Much like in my home state of

                                                               South Australia

                                                              I want to ask the minister exactly what they are going to do to make sure that these people have everything they need to not have to fold their business. As you would know, in many of these small towns, being already on such a tight margin is hard enough. If these businesses fold, the cascading effect throughout regional areas and towns is going to be huge. The question to the minister is: why won't you do what

I know that Senator Whish-Wilson, if he were here tonight, would be asking some very direct questions of you. I hope that we can have some short answers this evening.

In fact, they were helped on both sides of the package. One part of the package was focused on those people who either have lost their jobs or have had a substantial reduction in their income. That's where we have given sole traders access to jobseeker payment without the mutual obligations that would normally require them to give up their businesses. The sole trader has immediately got access to welfare payments, including the coronavirus supplement, and at the same time can continue working in their sole trading or their small business. That will be considered as part of their mutual obligation, because we want those people to stay in their businesses. We want them to stay there, and we want those businesses to continue to be in place when we get to the other side of the coronavirus crisis.

                                                               On the other side, on making sure that businesses can continue to be in business and continue to employ people, Senator Cash put a raft of small business initiatives in place for small and medium sized businesses with a turnover of under $50 million. They included a range of things, including grants of up to $100,000 for businesses based on payroll, with a minimum amount of $20,000 available to a business. This is payable on their payroll and their pay-as-you-go returns for April, if we are talking about businesses that make their returns quarterly. In addition, a range of different regulatory relief is available to these small businesses. There are a number of broader initiatives that have been contained in the package. Senator Hanson-Young, it may be useful to suggest to your colleague Senator Whish-Wilson that there is a lot of information on the government website about the specific details of benefits that are being made available to small businesses, sole traders and employees to get them through this particular period.

They will be forced to either seek work or keep seeking work. They will lack the capacity to self-isolate, if they are so directed, unless they can access some form of support. I encourage the government to consider what steps it's going to take after 30 March for those people who will essentially be trapped within Australian borders, unable to leave the country.

The capacity exists, because we're seeking to build flexibility going forward so that we can continue to monitor the situation. I am not making any announcements tonight about what's in and what's out in relation to temporary visa holders, but we have given you the advice about the changes that we are intending to make immediately. Senator Cormann outlined that when he spoke to his amendment in the first place. I reiterate: the capacity exists, through this regulation, for us to be quick and flexible in making changes if the situation changes such that we should choose to do so.

I would like to encourage the government to remember that the status resolution support services payment, which is available to temporary protection visa holder and safe haven enterprise visa holders, was cut by the government. Many people were cut off that payment and told to go out and work. It was already a precarious situation for those people to get jobs because they had a temporary visa and were living in precarious circumstances. It is now even more difficult for them to maintain employment. I am aware, from asylum seeker services in both

                                                                   </p>

I encourage the government to remember that it is in the interests of all Australians. A virus does not discriminate; it does not check your visa status before it infects you. If people are trapped here in this country, after 30 March in particular, it is in the interests of every single one of us in this country that every single one of us, citizen or not, has access to health care and income support if we are required to self-isolate.

Seriously, there are people here who will be destitute, who will be unable to self-isolate, because your government completely cut them off the SRSS and basically threw them out on the streets at the mercy of the whims of fate to rely on organisations in the non-government sector and in the charitable sector for their very survival. I urge the government to come to grips with a looming humanitarian and health disaster. I want to be very clear: that is what we are facing here, and I urge Minister Ruston, Minister Cormann and Minister Dutton—if he is at work or whoever is doing his job at the moment—to come to grips with this issue.
                                                                     </p>

There needs to be a mechanism that provides for the extension of the expiry dates of temporary protection visas that would expire during the period of the coronavirus crisis. This is not rocket science; this is actually government 101. I'm appalled and disappointed that these matters have not been addressed by government and apparently are yet to even be considered by government.
                                                                     </p>

Two is that a number of people whose temporary protection visas will expire during the coronavirus crisis and who, through no fault of their own, won't able to leave the country, need to have their visas extended, otherwise you know what is going to happen? You're going to chuck them all into immigration detention, which you so much love for people who have overstayed visas in this country. By the way, while you are at it, you can free low-risk people who have spent more than one week in immigration detention, because, if the coronavirus gets into immigration detention centres—and already at least one guard of an onshore immigration detention facility in Australia has tested positive to COVID-19—it will spread like wildfire, people will die and their blood will be on your hands.

Labor won't be supporting this amendment. We have consistently raised concerns about the design of some measures in the stimulus package, such as the cash-flow boost not being linked specifically with the retention of employees. We have made it very clear that we have concerns around that. While we appreciate the intent of this amendment, there could be unintended effects. We already know that small businesses are reluctant to take on more debt, particularly in uncertain times. We saw that with the loans offered in response to the bushfires. This proposed requirement, whilst also being hard to enforce, could heighten the reluctance of struggling businesses to take on more debt, choose to end the business completely or retrench any remaining staff completely, which would be an even more diabolical situation.

We need to have flexibility in any approach to ensure that we are not ruling companies out as a result of legislative criteria. By being prescriptive, we may actually make it harder for companies that should get access to the money and they might miss out. The banks will have skin in the game by sharing the risk; and, as they assess the loans, they will be looking to support companies to be able to get through the impact of the virus. Given how fast the circumstances are changing, we need to ensure there is flexibility in the legislative instrument that may need to be amended to deal with those circumstances. Ultimately every business will need to be looked at on an individual basis and that is why we are getting the banks and non-bank lenders to decide on this as they know their customers better than the government.

                                                                               </a>

This is an important amendment, and we acknowledge that it gives unprecedentedly broad powers to the minister to change arrangements for a whole range of social security payments. It is unprecedented, but we think that flexibility is going to be required and it goes to a number of the issues we've raised about gaps and potential gaps and increasing pressure for some of those people to be eligible for certain payments over the next few months, but also those who might not have been included in the first and second of the stimulus packages. We did believe that this needed an expiry date because of the significant powers that are being delegated from legislation to regulation at the executive's own discretion, so that has been rolled in.
                                                                              </p>

                                                                               Essentially this responds to concerns that Labor has been raising. The concerns were raised directly by the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Albanese, with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer today. We don't want to delay the passage of this legislation. We've made that clear. We want to support the government where we can. We think there are gaps. We think there are issues that will be coming to everyone's electorate office and every senator's office about people who might not be getting the help they need, and this will give the government the power and ability to respond to that without the parliament sitting. It is unprecedented. Broad powers like these would never, in any normal situation, be given to the executive, but this is a very unusual world that we are living in now, and we acknowledge that the government will have to respond and will have to respond at different times and in different ways over the next few months.
                                                                              </p>

                                                                               We thank the government for working with us and listening to our very genuine suggestions that this matter needed to be dealt with. It is outlined in the amendment, and I seek other senators' support for this, noting that it expires on 31 December. We genuinely hope this amendment gives the government the power to do good for people who are going to be suffering significant hardship over the next few months as this crisis unfolds. Perhaps we can't even predict the position that some will be in at the moment, and that's why the Senate and the parliament will give this power to the minister to be used wisely, carefully and in response to the desperation and anxiety that many in the community are feeling about their own personal circumstances and those of their families over the next few months.

Heaven forbid that it goes past this date. The point I'm making is that, while I agree with the need to curtail or sunset this for the reasons that have just been articulated, I'm concerned. We've just had a very positive move in terms of being told that students on youth allowance, for example, will get the supplement through this mechanism. My deep concern is that, if we are in a situation where there is a need for the other supplement payments to continue, anybody granted payments under this provision will then automatically drop off those payments. That is my concern. So I'm seeking some assurance that, if we accept the sunset clause, the government will then act to address that particular issue. I'm looking at the worst case scenario, I know, but the government has looked at the worst case scenario by enabling the minister to make these rolling payments in the event that the crisis isn't over.

Sorry, it's three months at a time by instrument. I can come back three months at a time by instrument. This sunsets on 31 December. We would imagine that between now and 31 December this place would require to make a further determination if we decided that we needed to extend these provisions past 31 December 2020. As you say, it is something that is too horrid to think about. However, this place would need to make a determination to enable me to go past 31 December with the provisions contained in these regulations.

The problem is that we have to come back for this particular provision but not the other provisions, because they're delegated instruments. So what I'm seeking is an assurance that, in the worst-case scenario, if the other payments are continuing, the government will act to make sure that students aren't dropped off when nobody else is dropped off. Again, I'm looking at the worst-case scenarios here. You've clearly done that with the provisions that you've put in place, which is good. It's not a criticism. It's good. But I want to make sure that young people are also protected through the mechanisms that you're setting in place through this particular provision.

If there is a circumstance where we are required to have things in place past 30 December 2020, we would come back to this place, in whatever format that had to take, and seek the agreement of this place to continue the provisions that are contained in this regulation. Because of the nature of the way the regulation is written, we chose to sunset it on 30 December to give us the three months past the end of the six-month period, which is the second of the rolling three-month periods that we have in the primary legislation. But I assure you, I assure this place and I assure anybody that's listening that the government will be supporting Australians in every way it possibly can to get them from here to the other side of this crisis.

I've articulated that during my second reading speech. I know that people want to deal with this expeditiously, so, other than urging the government and the opposition to look at the impact this crisis is having on families and to make sure that they are supported, as the minister said, to get to the other side of this crisis, I'll leave my comments at that.

I have a question for the minister, and that is: why were low-income healthcare cardholders left out of the bonus of $750? Given it's a low-income healthcare card and, by its very nature, it's for people who are on low incomes, why were they left out when people holding seniors healthcare cards were included?

Quite frankly, I don't care if they didn't get it before. They probably should have got it before. They certainly should get it now. Quite frankly, it's unprecedented that you would double the jobseeker payment—not that I'm opposing that. As you know, I'm strongly supportive of it. But, for heaven's sake, these are people of low income. They should be supported. They should get access to those additional resources. If anybody needs it, it's those on low incomes.

We know that the government's already been in significant conversations and discussions with airlines. These amendments ensure appropriate protections for workers and taxpayers in any airline bailout. We think it is absolutely essential that, if the Australian people and taxpayers are going to participate in these types of bailouts, they get something in return. We need to make sure, as these amendments insist, that they require any bailout to take place via an equity stake rather than just handing over the cash to these big corporations. It beggars belief that we'd just do this and not take the opportunity to ensure that the Australian people are indeed represented at the table. We need to make sure workers keep their jobs and that protections for their jobs are ongoing, at the very least in the medium term, when the whole point of this type of extraordinary support from government is to ensure that the people working for these corporations actually get looked after and get to keep their jobs.
                                                                                             </p>

                                                                                              We have heard referenced many times in this place and the other place today the extraordinary situation where, after being given significant support from the government, Qantas stood down 20,000 staff members in one day. We know that the industry has effectively been grounded. We get that. But we need to make sure that, if we're going to be putting up big loads of cash for these corporations, the workers themselves are the ones that these benefits flow to.
                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                              I was listening to a report in the evening following that decision by Qantas that numerous households around the country had just lost both incomes because there were couples—living together, sharing household costs and bills, and who have families—who were both employed by Qantas. Both, on the same day, lost their jobs. This is the type of protection, for people like those families and others, that we need to insist on if we're going to stump up this large amount of money. What this amendment does is gives protection for workers but also ensures that the Australian people are represented. We would like to see a requirement that board seats are put aside for the Australian taxpayer, represented by the government, and for workers. It is the very least that can happen at an extraordinary time like this, and I urge the opposition to support this amendment.

The government will consider further support for our aviation sector through an unprecedented period of disruption to international and domestic air travel. The proposed amendments would require the Commonwealth to take an equity stake in an airline as a condition for providing any future financial support. The Commonwealth will consider any further support according to the sound principles we have already set out, but the proposed amendments would unnecessarily constrain the government's ability to tailor any future support according to the needs of the sector and the interests of the nation.

In other words, it makes sure that this money isn't put on the cashless debit card, because we don't think that is appropriate, and also, the community, judging by the response that people have had, don't think it's a good idea.

This is because, as I highlighted in my second reading contribution, we think these groups of people deserve to get the $550 supplement. We disagree with the government. We think there will be extra costs for these particular groups of people because disabled people will face increased costs in accessing services and basic household goods. Because many of them are very vulnerable to this particular virus, they will need very good personal protection equipment in order to remain healthy. Those that are on carer payments will also be at increased risk and they will also have increased costs.
                                                                                                   </p>

                                                                                                    We know that a lot of older Australians and people on the age pension are living in poverty. And that group living in poverty is very strongly dominated by those that don't own their own home and are paying rent. Let's face it, that particular group of people need to be particularly careful about self-isolating because they are extremely vulnerable to coronavirus. We know that from what's happening globally. That's why we think it's important that these particular groups of people should also get access to the supplement. There are provisions in the bill to enable the minister to make the supplement available to other payments—and we have discussed that. Again, as I highlighted in my second reading contribution, we want to end the uncertainty for people to make sure that they get access to the payment as soon as possible.

The legislation already allows for the government to include additional cohorts of people on income support payments through a legislative instrument if and when required. People receiving other payments are provided income support for other reasons. At this point, the government is focused on providing additional support to jobseekers. The coronavirus supplement is designed to cushion the impact of any downturn in the economy on workers and people looking for work, people on jobseeker payment and youth allowance (other) for the purpose of looking for work. We understand the labour market will likely face, or will be facing, significant challenges over coming months.

We have the ability, under the legislation we're putting to the parliament, to make additional payments eligible for the coronavirus supplement. We will keep a close eye on economic conditions and what is occurring in Australia and make appropriate, prudent and measured decisions to respond to circumstances as they continue to evolve.

In response to one of my previous questions on this issue, he mentioned that the government's focus was on Australians and Australian residents. Well, Minister, a lot of people are about to become effective Australian residents because they simply can't get out of the country, through no fault of their own. As Senator Keneally quite rightly pointed out, this is a public health issue as well as an issue of equity, fairness and humanity. No matter whether someone is ordinarily resident in Australia or ordinarily resident overseas with a temporary visa in Australia, they could still contract coronavirus just as easily as anybody else. If you want to run a comprehensive, holistic public health response to coronavirus, you need to have a financial package supporting everybody in the country so that they can self-isolate. I can't put it any more clearly than that. Your normal tricks are not going to fly here. You're in an emergency. We're all in an emergency together. That includes people in this country on temporary visas.

If those are the parameters of the package, it won't go far enough. Everyone who is in Australia right now should be regarded as a resident of this country for the purposes of the coronavirus response, and everybody in that category needs income support so they can have a house or a home in which they can self-isolate should they be required to.

There are about another million visa holders that we have added—and I've said previously, earlier today. Access to jobseeker payment and youth allowance is available to people residing in Australia who are Australian citizens and permanent residents. It will not be available to people in Australia on temporary visas, other than some people in limited circumstances on special category visas. Australia's social security system is a non-contributory, residence based system. It is designed to support primarily Australian citizens and permanent residents. In relation to those on a permanent residency visa, for those who are still serving a newly arrived resident's waiting period, as I've indicated to the chamber before, the government has decided to waive the newly arrived resident's waiting period temporarily, in order to assist permanent residents to get access to the jobseeker payment. Generally, residency requirements will still apply, and most temporary visa holders do not qualify for jobseeker payment and other forms of income support. However, special benefit is available to specified temporary visa holders, as I've also previously advised the chamber.

So the Greens want to add local government as recipients of these funds, so community projects can continue to be funded in the time of this crisis—community projects such as maternal and child health care, youth services and support for local art and cultural activities, amongst the many other wonderful community projects that local communities and councils run.

I understand that this funding is around $1 billion, so we really do need some transparency on that. This amendment will insert requirements to publish details of the contracts that are signed, with the full text of all agreements to be published within two weeks of finalising. It will also require the publication of a quarterly list of all agreements, including the recipient, the amount, the date of the payments and the nature of the agreement.
