         The Hastings Public School is a matter that has received considerable public attention of late. I notice it is in the
         <i>
          Australian

         again. Obviously, we have a model of behaviour here whereby the Liberal opposition feels it necessary to have
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Limited" rel="nofollow">
          News Limited
         </a>
         do their research for them. It is a very risky proposition. In respect of Hastings Public School, I can confirm that approximately two weeks ago the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         minister, after consultation, I might add, with Minister Arbib’s office, agreed to an independent audit of the cost of the covered outdoor learning area, or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COLA" rel="nofollow">
          COLA
         </a>
         . This was well in advance of the issue being raised in the media by the opposition. I am advised that the audit has been carried out and that a quantity surveyor has looked at the costs incurred in constructing this structure and whether they are reasonable in all the circumstances. This audit, and all such audits, is a detailed investigation that involves interviewing the school principal or whoever raised the concern. It includes a review of the tender documents as well as the estimated construction sum documents.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised the audit will be finalised by the end of the week and that the New South Wales minister will advise the Deputy Prime Minister of the outcome of the audit early next week. This is a proper and responsible way to react to these allegations by receiving expert independent advice before acting. It is a pity the opposition did not follow that course of action instead of relying upon out-of-date information.

How can the government maintain that this $16 billion fiasco is a good spend of taxpayers’ money if nearly 60 per cent of schools themselves disagree, or does the government know best?

                     It is quite clear that the opposition would prefer young Australians to study in conditions of monastic austerity, armed only with quills and pens, in a world ruled by mad monks. That is not a view that this government shares. We take the view that Australians are entitled to have the very best facilities that this country can provide.

                            What we have here is a very clear example where the Rudd Labor government has, within the space of a little over two years, doubled the amount of money that has been available for improving the learning conditions of Australian children across 10,000 schools right across this country. Principal after principal across this country has endorsed the opportunities that have now arisen as a result of this government’s programs. We have a situation whereby, as a result of this program, we have 10,000 schools better off as a result of the actions taken by this government, in sharp contrast with the neglect that we have seen by the previous government. In fact, it is said the view that has been taken is that this is wasteful. This is a view that the conservatives of this country hold. It is not the view that Australians hold.
