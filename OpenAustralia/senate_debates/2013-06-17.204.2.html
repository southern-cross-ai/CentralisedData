        That the Senate take note of the report.

       <p>
        This is the report of the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations References Committee inquiry into employment conditions of state public sector employees and the adequacy of the protection of their rights at work as compared with other employees. I make the point that state governments have primary responsibility for the bargaining and working conditions of state public sector employees. There are significant constitutional limitations on the Commonwealth's ability to influence these conditions which serve to maintain the capacity of states to function as independent members of our federation. The committee believes these limitations are appropriate and that the authority of the states in these matters cannot and indeed should not be undermined. The committee acknowledges that changes to public sector employment can be difficult, especially when they involve voluntary redundancies for some employees. Nonetheless, the committee understands the need for state governments to take action when such reforms are necessary to ensure the continued viability of the state public sector, to create flexible service delivery and to balance state budgets. The committee's report has drawn upon some 39 submissions received. On behalf of the committee, I thank those individuals and organisations who made submissions. I also thank my colleagues and the secretariat who assisted.
