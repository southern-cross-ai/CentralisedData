        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) In the 2010-11 Budget, the Government announced that it would fund a body of research into the staffing inputs that are adequate to provide good quality care, supervision and support for particular resident profiles. The Department received a submission from the ANF which met the requirements of this research project and delivered value for money. A grant was then provided in accordance with the Commonwealth Grant Guidelines.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) Due to an administrative error, details of the grant provided to conduct a research study on staffing levels, skills mix and residential care needs were initially posted on the AusTender site on 14 July 2011, as opposed to the grants reporting webpage of the Department’s internet site. Details of the grant were removed from AusTender and published on the Department’s grants reporting webpage on 15 August 2011.
