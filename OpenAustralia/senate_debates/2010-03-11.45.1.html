        I present a third interim report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on import restrictions on beef, and seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate adopt the recommendation of the report relating to an extension of time for the inquiry to 18 March 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to make a few brief comments to inform the Senate, and I do thank the Senate for its indulgence in allowing the committee an extension of time. Obviously, it has been quite a lengthy process so far in terms of the committee inquiring into the relaxation of the importation rules for beef that has come from countries that have had

        or mad cow disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have seen a change of decision by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and the Labor government to conduct a full import risk analysis on the importation of beef. The coalition has been very strongly calling for this for a long period of time. In light of the governmentâ€™s change of mind and now its agreement to conduct a full import risk analysis, the committee finds itself in the position of, again, having to ask the Senate for an extension of time to report. We do believe that it is necessary and entirely appropriate to hold a further hearing to determine the exact nature of the import risk analysis that the minister has indicated that he requires. In light of that, we will be reporting at a later date, of which the Senate will be advised as soon as possible.

        Question agreed to.
