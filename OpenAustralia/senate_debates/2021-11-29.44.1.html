        There are a few important things to know about today's COVID update in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . We've just confirmed our first case of the omicron COVID-19 variant and, while this is concerning, it is reassuring to know that the man has been in quarantine at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Howard Springs
        </a>
        facility since arriving in the Northern Territory last week. Our world-class Howard Springs facility is separated by different zones so our international repatriations do not interact with any of our local community members who are also quarantining. Two teenagers from the remote community of Binjari have also tested positive to COVID-19, but one was already in quarantine and the other is now going to Howard Springs. I certainly wish all of those who are in Howard Springs a speedy recovery.

        It is not an easy task in the Territory to ensure that our health workers are out there around the clock assisting all Territorians in terms of the vaccination program. With soaring temperatures and some of the most remote communities where English is not the first language, healthcare workers will be out in remote communities every day this week, and this includes, in the centre region, Yuendumu,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_River" rel="nofollow">
         Docker River
        </a>
        , Papunya and Canteen Creek. The community outbreak in the Territory stands at 58. This number would be much higher if it weren't for the work of our healthcare workers but also our elders in each of our communities who are encouraging people to get vaccinated. I cannot say enough: please get vaccinated. COVID is well and truly in the Northern Territory. To each and every resident in our communities right across the Territory: please get vaccinated. It is absolutely important. We do have enough supply there. I urge you not to listen to any misinformation, or even lies, out there. Please get vaccinated.
