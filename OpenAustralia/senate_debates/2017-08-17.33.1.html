           The government will not be supporting this motion as it duplicates the work already underway by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Following the 2016 election, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
            Special Minister of State
           </a>
           referred a range of issues to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. The inquiry's wide-ranging terms of reference include donations to political parties and other political entities. The government looks forward to receiving the JSCEM's report on these matters.

              The opposition will be supporting this motion. In doing so, we do need to pay regard to the work of the members of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, who have put in significant work on the issue of political donations, amongst many other issues. The issue of political donations has been at the forefront of Labor's policy agenda and we have legislation before the parliament that seeks to improve transparency and accountability regarding donations. This select committee, although focused on an issue of JSCEM, is targeted at political donations, an issue of utmost importance for the Australian community and one that does deserve specific focus.
