         Unfortunately, Senator Smith, I am, and the incident in Queensland is not an isolated event. One
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         union official who has a record of violence and threatening and intimidating behaviour is WA CFMEU official Luke Collier. Mr Collier, because of his deplorable criminal record, is unable to obtain a right-of-entry permit onto building sites, and yet the WA CFMEU proudly lists him on its website as their labour-hire youth organiser. One might ask: what example does this set for young people?
        </p>
        <p>
         Luke Collier, as many will be aware, was jailed in 2016 for assault. He also threatened a female Fair Work Building and Construction inspector, making vile statements. Again, I shall not repeat them in this chamber, as they are so offensive, but they did involve vile sexual language. He once spat at an inspector's feet and told them to lick it up. He was also charged with aggravated assault against his former girlfriend after she reported to police that she had been beaten on multiple occasions, including suffering a broken arm.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just last week, Mr Collier was again charged with assault in our home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , and he is set to appear in the Fremantle magistrates court next month. Interestingly, though, there are CFMEU members in WA who are voicing their concerns at Mr Collier and his actions. People, for example, are questioning how they can spend their union's money on a bloke who can't go onto a job and do anything and why they have inherited a bloke from the east coast who has a track record.

             CFMEU
            </a>
            , wrote a letter to the

             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">
              Sydney Morning Herald
             </a>
            </i>
            in May 2015, saying that they abhorred violence against women. His letter said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            There is no double standard by the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union on the issue of violence against women. The CFMEU has taken a strong and public position against violence towards women â€¦ We will not stand by an official where there is evidence they have engaged in this kind of behaviour.
           </p>
           <p>
            And yet here we are today with the CFMEU continuing to stand by Mr Luke Collier, giving him a notable position within their WA organisation, despite his history of violence against women and his criminal record. So much for 'no double standard'.

               As I've stated, the concerns about Mr Collier are exceptionally well known. He has been jailed for assault, has threatened Commonwealth public servants, has engaged in violence against women and has now brought this behaviour to my home state of

               continue to defend him, as do many on the other side. I've raised this before: Senator Cameron asked no fewer than 61 questions at Senate estimates in October 2014, defending Mr Collier, and then, of course, in 2015, Senator Cameron wrote a letter on his parliamentary letterhead advocating on behalf of Mr Collier. Just in case there's any doubt, I will table the letter.
