         I thank Senator Back for his question, his interest and his attendance today at

          ADFA

         for the launch of the white paper. As the senator observed, earlier today was the official release of the defence white paper. That was done in conjunction with an integrated investment plan and a new defence industry policy statement. Our nation has extraordinary opportunities for great prosperity and development over the coming decades—that is absolutely true. At the same time, we face very complex security challenges and, indeed, growing uncertainty in our strategic environment.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Indo-Pacific region, we are in a period of unprecedented transformation as the balance of economic and political power shifts both within and, in fact, to our region. What this white paper does is present to the nation the Turnbull government's strategy for our nation's future defence and security, and it is the right strategy for a modern Australia in an increasingly complex world. Our strategy and our plans are underpinned by an in-depth assessment of Australia's long-term strategic outlook. In the presentation that we have made today, we have, in fact, presented the most comprehensive defence white paper in Australia's history. What it does is set out the government's commitment to realign defence strategy, capability and resourcing. Most importantly, it will deliver to Australia a more capable, agile and potent

         , which will be ready to respond wherever Australia's interests are engaged—whether that is here within our region or, more broadly, internationally. Given the breadth of our activity at the moment, it very aptly demonstrates the need for this assessment and the timeliness of the

          <p>
           That is actually a very important question from Senator Back, and I appreciate his interest. What the new strategic framework for our defence policy focuses on is three strategic defence interests—that is to say, the outcomes we want—and three strategic defence objectives. It is, effectively, what we need our
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Defence Force
           </a>
           to be able to do to achieve those outcomes and to achieve our interests.
          </p>
          <p>
           All three of the strategic defence objectives have guided the force structure and the force posture positions which are set out in this white paper. They are: to deter, deny and defeat attacks on or threats to Australia and its national interests and northern approaches; to make effective military contributions to support security and stability in our near region; and to contribute military capabilities to coalition operations that support Australia's interest in a rules based global order. This is a methodically and comprehensively prepared white paper that sets Australia up for the future.

              GDP
             </a>
             within the decade. In meeting this commitment, what the Turnbull government will provide is an additional $29.9 billion to Defence over 10 years.
            </p>
            <p>
             This defence white paper and the integrated investment plan that sits alongside it—and, indeed, the defence industry policy statement that also accompanies it—is an achievable and costed plan for Australia's future security and defence. We have been assiduous in doing that, because we know what happened to the white papers of those opposite in 2009 and 2013. We know the damage that that wrought on Defence and we have no intention of repeating those mistakes.
