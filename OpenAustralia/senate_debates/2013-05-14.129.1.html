        I rise in today's adjournment debate to add my support to the national apology for those affected by the past practices of forced adoptions. The apology was delivered on 21 March this year by Prime Minister Julia Gillard on behalf of the nation. It acknowledged the wrongs of the past and was extended in good faith and deep humility to mothers, fathers and children affected by forced adoption practices. As the Prime Minister said on the day:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We offer this apology in the hope that it will assist your healing and in order to shine a light on a dark period of our nation’s history.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To those who have fought for the truth to be heard, we hear you now. We acknowledge that many of you have suffered in silence for far too long.
       </p>
       <p>
        Forced adoption practices took place in Australia from the late 1940s until, in some cases, the late 1980s. The practice forced single mothers to give up their babies. This is indisputable.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a practice that affected all Australians—from the city and country, people born here, migrants and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        as well as those from different faiths and social classes. In most cases, the common theme was that these women were young and vulnerable. It is unimaginable in today's society to think that such practices could take place, but they did. It has left many of the mothers suffering from this traumatic experience, so it was important that the government acknowledge the wrongs of the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        The process that helped bring about this apology began with the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs' inquiry into the Commonwealth's contribution to former forced adoption policies and practices. The committee heard stories from mothers, fathers and children who had had the sacred bond between a mother and a child broken. This was a relationship broken by churches, families, medical staff and the state. In many cases it was forcibly broken by very traumatic means, including being coerced, drugged, tricked into signing adoption papers or being physically shackled to beds. These are indeed horrific circumstances, and should never, ever be forgotten. Indeed, the many women who shared their stories as part of the committee process are not just looking for an apology. They are looking for the acknowledgement that what took place was wrong and that these mothers did not choose to give up their child; they wanted their child to know that they had no choice and that the child was forcibly removed.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also important that whilst we acknowledge these wrongs and issue a national apology, we also provide resources to support people affected by forced adoption policies. The federal government will provide $5 million to improve access to specialist support and records tracing for those affected by forced adoptions. We will work with the states and territories to help improve these services. We will also deliver $5 million so that the mental health professionals can better assist in providing support for those affected by forced adoption. We will provide $1.5 million for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives" rel="nofollow">
         National Archives
        </a>
        to record, through a special exhibition, the experiences of those affected by forced adoption. This is an important step to ensure that the horrific events of the past are never repeated and the brave women who shared their stories about this horrible practice are never forgotten. Indeed, it was one of the measures that was asked for by the women who gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge here all of the states and territories who offered apologies to those people affected by forced adoptions. I understand the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        is yet to do that. I want to particularly acknowledge the Premier of my home state of Tasmania, the Hon. Lara Giddings MP, who showed great leadership and delivered an extremely heartfelt and moving apology.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Tasmania, we have two courageous ladies affected by former forced adoption practices who have taken the lead on promoting this issue in the local community. Christine Burke and Margaret Singline appeared at the Hobart hearing as part of the inquiry. They both told their stories about what they had experienced and what they were subjected to. Christine and Margaret's stories were told by the media following the hearing. That led to a number of Tasmanian women contacting each other to share similar experiences Together, Christine and Margaret recently started and launched a dedicated support group for Tasmanian women who had been affected by the practice of former forced adoptions. The support group, Connections, meets monthly and is the only one of its kind in Tasmania.
