        </a>
        TRANSPARENT HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM) BILL 2017
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Purpose of the Bill
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will ensure a stronger, more innovative and fairer system of higher education that preserves equity of access while achieving savings outlined in the Budget, including by:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>

       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of the bill as soon as possible is essential in order for the higher education sector and affected agencies to implement the new measures, many of which commence from 1 January 2018. The bill will reinvigorate higher education in Australia by implementing a range of measures. These measures are designed to preserve access to tertiary education while achieving necessary savings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The 2014-15 Budget reforms to higher education were ambitious. Some measures have passed while others have been set aside or deferred. This bill resolves the uncertainty of the past two years and contributes to Budget repair.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures reflect a widespread and careful consultation process with the community, students, business and industry, the sector and expert advisers. Many of these stakeholders accept that there are further efficiencies to be gained within the multi-billion dollar annual Commonwealth contribution to higher education. This bill will require universities to identify those efficiencies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill also requires students to absorb a modest rise in the costs of their tuition, while still maintaining a strong taxpayer contribution towards these costs. Across all students, the taxpayer will continue to meet the majority of the costs of teaching and learning in universities.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">

        , that require lead time to implement systems changes and to communicate with their clients about how the changes affect them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will incentivise course innovation and expand student choice, particularly in non-research postgraduate study and in sub-bachelor and enabling courses. It will also enhance transparency and accountability within the sector by requiring greater transparency in financial matters and by linking a portion of a provider's Commonwealth grants to improvements in performance, using criteria to be agreed with the sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of this bill as soon as possible will provide the necessary time for the education sector, students, and affected agencies to prepare for the changes commencing in 2018.

       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important that there are preventative controls in place throughout the supply chain to provide assurance of food safety.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reasons for Urgency
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Passage of the Bill during the spring 2017 sittings will ensure that Australia continues to have a robust and word-class food management system. The department currently relies on a risk-based inspection scheme and at-border testing. The Bill will enhance the current food safety system by introducing a new capacity for the department to hold food at the border where there are concerns about the safety of the food and the scientific approach to assess its safety is not established.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments will ensure that we can respond to new and emerging risks that may leave consumers vulnerable to unsafe food entering the domestic food system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The states and territories also play an essential part in Australia's domestic food safety management system. Passage of the Bill in the 2017 spring sittings will enable Commonwealth legislation to align with state and territory legislation, reducing unnecessary regulatory burden for Australian businesses. The amendments will strengthen Australia's food safety system by enabling the Australian government to share information to support jurisdictions to effectively perform their role in food safety management.
