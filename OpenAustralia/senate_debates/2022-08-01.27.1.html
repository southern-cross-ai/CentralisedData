        I want to give a plug to Canice's Kitchen in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Elizabeth Bay
        </a>
        in Sydney. It has been providing meals and services for more than 30 years to people who are doing it tough. This year I'm going to be running the City to Surf for Canice's Kitchen.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">
         The City
        </a>
        to Surf hasn't run for two years, because of the dreaded COVID disease, which is a real shame. It has been a great event for the last 51 years where people have had the opportunity to raise funds for important causes.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the past few weeks, I have been able to duck down to Canice's Kitchen. It is a one-stop shop for people who are down on their luck. You can go there for a hot meal, but you can also access the services that you would need to get back into the workforce, including an ironed shirt and a practice interview, and access to other services that will help you get back into the workforce and back on your feet.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met with Carrie Deane, who is running Canice's Kitchen, and a number of her volunteers. She has more volunteers than you can poke a stick at. It really is a great service that she is providing the community there in Elizabeth Bay, and I expect much further beyond Elizabeth Bay. So I'm running the City to Surf for Canice's Kitchen and we are looking for people to provide some support for Canice's Kitchen, which is pretty much running on the smell of an oily rag through the goodwill of the people in the community, without much government support. The City Surf is a good race and Canice's Kitchen is a good cause.
