                 I have been interjected upon before, but not by grunting! But Senator Macdonald can choose to grunt if he wishes. I am aware that the government has flagged a discussion paper on amendments. I do not have any information as to whether further details of that have been released. If those have been released, I will see if anything further can be provided to the senator. But, as I said, I understand that the Attorney-General has flagged a discussion paper on amendments to national security and counterterrorism laws.

Would not the government’s commitment to counterterrorism be taken more seriously if it stopped cutting the funding of Australia’s front-line national security agencies?

                   As has previously been the case, it is the fact that this government has provided additional funding—particularly, for example, in border security. You might recall—through you,

                    Mr President
                   </a>
                   —that in the 2009-10 budget, for example, the government committed some $654 million to fund a whole-of-government strategy to combat people smuggling and border protection. We have also created the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
                    Australian Customs

                   and Border Protection Service, to provide unified operational control.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Those opposite might want to try and play a bit of politics with this issue, but the fact is that this government has provided very substantial provision through the budget to our security agencies, including the

                    AFP

                   , and additional funding was announced in the 19th budget to combat people smuggling and to enhance border protection.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Wouldn’t the war on terrorism be better prosecuted by properly resourcing the national security agencies than by engaging in hairy-chested rhetoric about new laws? Isn’t this just another example of Rudd government rhetoric saying one thing but the government’s spending priorities showing the opposite?

                     I again remind Senator Brandis that this government is providing some $1.3 billion over six years for non-defence national security and border protection measures and that this year’s budget included significant new funding for counterterrorism, people smuggling, border protection and surveillance, national disaster resilience, e-security, aviation and airport security, regional cooperation and international deployments, as well as the national security public information campaign. The government recognises that there is an ongoing threat from terrorism. We remain committed to Australia’s national security. We remain committed to protecting Australia’s borders. The second budget continued the strong focus on Australia’s security needs, ensuring that we continue to meet the challenges of the future.
