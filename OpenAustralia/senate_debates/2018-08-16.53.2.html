           The opposition will not be supporting this motion from Senator Di Natale. We have made clear our position on the actions of others in this place who have sought to use race as an instrument of division and who have conducted themselves in a way that does not conform with the standards the Australian people expect of us. Labor has led the charge in encouraging parliamentarians to express their support for a voluntary commitment to inclusion and race ethics. The invitation from the Leader of the Opposition to the Prime Minister for government members to join all opposition members in signing this statement remains open.
          </p>
          <p>
           We welcome the support across the chamber for Senator Wong's motion yesterday. Further, we fully support the comments of the President in his statement to the chamber on Monday this week. Consistent with our past actions and the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure, the opposition does not support the inclusion of a code of conduct in the standing orders of the Senate, recognising that standing orders 193 and 203 already regulate conduct in the chamber.

              We should be held to a higher standard than the standard that we set within our community, not to a lower standard. If it's hate speech outside the parliament; it's hate speech inside the parliament. People will tell you it's not appropriate to be wearing a burqa to completely belittle a religious community. People will tell you it's inappropriate to use sexist, misogynist language directly against a member of this place. People will tell you it is not appropriate to invoke the Holocaust to support your racist views of the world. It is no good to simply say, 'We condemn the behaviour,' when then you go ahead and vote against a censure motion, as the government and the

              did yesterday. They now won't back up their words with serious action. It is long overdue that this parliament had a code of conduct that defined what was acceptable behaviour and that we all stuck to it.
