        OVERSEAS SERVICE) BILL 2014
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is one of the few remaining democracies that can legally deploy its defence forces into conflict zones without recourse to the Parliament: the decision is reserved to the executive alone. As kindred democracies around the world have enacted reforms to vest the so-called 'War Power' in elected Parliaments, Australia has remained anchored to a pre-democratic tradition founded in hereditary monarchies and feudal states.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If this anachronism had served Australia well, it might be possible to mount an argument that "if it isn't broken, it doesn't need fixing."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the horror unfolding in Iraq does not comprehensively put this view to rest, it is difficult to imagine what would. On the basis of fabricated and wilfully misinterpreted intelligence,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         Prime Minister John Howard
        </a>
        followed the United States and the United Kingdom into an illegal and open-ended war in Iraq. Our Parliament, and by extension the voting public of Australia, were cut out of the decision, despite the fact that hundreds of millions of people around the world organised and campaigned against the decision to go to war.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are few credible analysts left anywhere who do not regard the decision by hardliners within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_Administration" rel="nofollow">

        to invade Iraq as one of the most grievous strategic disasters in modern history. The vast majority of Australians were right, and the executive authorities in the US, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        and Australia, were wrong. No inquiry into the decision to go to war has ever been held in Australia, only a handful of piecemeal attempts to pin the blame on intelligence services and shift focus away from the actions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Government" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the time, Iraq was not threatening war. There was no connection or allegiance between the secular Baathist regime that ruled Iraq and the fundamentalist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Qaeda" rel="nofollow">
         Al Qaeda

        networks responsible for the 9/11 attacks. There were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and hadn't been since 1991. Intelligence agencies within the US, the UK and Australia understood these facts, but inflexible groupthink prevailed within the

        and the Prime Minister's office here in Australia. It was rumoured at the time that Australian Special Forces units were among the very first on the ground inside Iraq, even before
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush" rel="nofollow">
         President Bush

        went on live television to announce that

         Operation Iraqi Freedom
        </a>
        had commenced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is entirely complicit in the violent, decade-long occupation that shattered Iraq's social and economic structures, and ignited long-dormant sectarian tensions that now threaten to plunge the crippled country into full-blown civil war.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the time of speaking, Sunni fundamentalists considered too extreme to remain part of Al Qaeda have established a new Caliphate in territory carved out of Syria and Iraq. The brittle institutions of Iraqi governance, bombed into existence by the United States, now threaten to collapse entirely.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If there is a strategic policy failure more complete than the catastrophic invasion of Iraq, it is difficult to recall it. This dismal outcome was predicted at the time by many of those who opposed the war, but the executive's lock on the process means that the normal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary
        </a>
        processes of critique and accountability were bypassed. Somewhere between 100,000 and one million Iraqis have paid for this obscene oversight with their lives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Should Prime Minister Abbott decide to compound the strategic incompetence of 2003 with a further deployment as the security environment in Iraq deteriorates, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Parliament
        </a>
        , and the Australian people, would be cut out of the decision again.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Concurrently with the Iraq deployment, Australia has also fought a long, costly, and ultimately futile war in Afghanistan. The heaviest cost was carried by the Afghan people: tens of thousands of civilians killed, maimed and traumatised as the US Government's saturation bombing campaign transitioned into a long, untenable occupation. Forty one Australian soldiers have lost their lives in Afghanistan. Out of respect to them and their families, Parliament pauses to acknowledge their sacrifice when news breaks of another death. No such respects are paid to those Afghans who also paid the ultimate price; no-one even appears to be keeping count.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is no longer tenable that the decision to deploy into conflict zones should be left to the executive alone. Our current Defence Act does not allow for any level of transparent decision making, scrutiny and debate, but this is an artefact of legislation, not the natural order of things.

        This Bill was initiated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Democrats" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Democrats
        </a>
        and supported by the

         Australian Greens

        , who took carriage of the Bill after 2007. It is the latest iteration of a Bill introduced into the Senate in 1985. In 2015 it will mark its 30th year of languishing in plain sight while Liberal and Labor Prime Ministers alike reserve this power to themselves, plunging Australia into a tragic series of overseas expeditionary wars that have had little or nothing to do with the defence of Australia or collective security.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In August 2009, I referred the Bill to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The majority of the committee resolved to refuse to take evidence in a hearing. Nonetheless, the Committee made a useful critique of the Bill without undermining its essential purpose, in its report of February 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My dissenting report into the Bill provided the transcript of an informal hearing that we held, after the majority committee's short-sighted decision not to take evidence directly from witnesses.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill would bring Australia into conformity with principles and practices utilised in other democracies including Denmark, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Slovakia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">

        , Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey, where troop deployment is set down in constitutional or legislative provisions. Some form of parliamentary approval or consultation is also routinely undertaken in Austria, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Czech_Republic" rel="nofollow">
         Czech Republic
        </a>
        , Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Norway. Our ally the United States has a similar provision that subjects the decision to go to war to a broader forumâ€”section 8 of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_I" rel="nofollow">
         Article I
        </a>
        of the US Constitution quite clearly says, "Congress shall have power to declare war". In the wake of the disaster in Iraq, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westminster_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Westminster Parliament
        </a>
        now holds the de-facto war power, a new convention that prevented a rushed deployment into Syria earlier in 2014.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Arguments against vesting the power over troop deployment to Parliament include that it would be impractical, restrictive and inefficient. Such arguments ignore the fact that parliaments can and do make complex and nuanced decisions, rapidly when necessary. As we have seen, decisions about war and peace made in undue haste that do not enjoy the mandate of the population â€“ expressed through the Parliament, if nowhere else â€“ have no legitimacy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are appropriate exemptions made in this Bill to avoid interfering with the non-warlike overseas service with which Australian troops are engaged â€“ referring in particular to new subsection 50C(11). There are also appropriate exemptions in the Bill to provide for the practicalities of situations where Parliament cannot immediately meet â€“ referring to subsections 50(3) and (7), which provide for the Governor-General to be able to make a proclamation regarding the declaration of war, provided that Parliament is then recalled within a period of two days.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is time that Australia joined its closest allies and like-minded democratic states by involving the Parliament in the decision to deploy the ADF. The entwined tragedies of our recent military misadventures, and the threat that history may soon repeat, make passage of this Bill more urgent than ever.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Once again, I commend the Bill to the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
