        My question is to the Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Watt, on a very serious subject. Minister, currently my state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        is being impacted by around 50 fires that are burning at advice level. In the past four weeks we've seen significant fire activity across New South Wales, Queensland,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . And, in Victoria, we saw concurrent fires and floods. Can the minister please advise the Senate on what the Commonwealth is doing to support these communities?

         Thanks, Senator Sheldon, for your ongoing interest in these issues.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         start by acknowledging that there are a number fires currently burning at advice level in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , and of course there are also bushfires underway in Queensland and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         . In terms of the New South Wales fires, Senator Sheldon, while at this stage there is no immediate threat to communities, it is important that people who live in the vicinity of those fires monitor the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
          NSW
         </a>
         Rural Fire Service's website or Hazards Near Me app in case there is a change in conditions. I've seen some weather forecasts for the next week which indicate quite a lot of hot and windy weather coming across the continent, so we all really need to stay aware of conditions in our local communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, as you would have seen, this week we received the very sad confirmation that a man died in a fire near Kempsey, in New South Wales. While investigations are continuing into the circumstances surrounding that incident, I'd like to send our deepest condolences to that man's family, friends and community. That death is a stark reminder of the types of fast-moving and erratic fires we are expecting to see this fire season, and I really do ask everyone to have a plan in place in advance of fires and, wherever possible, to avoid bushfire risk areas on days of catastrophic fire risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, earlier this month we saw fires in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bega_Valley" rel="nofollow">
          Bega Valley
         </a>
         , which impacted upon four homes, and at the very same time we saw in Victoria severe weather and flooding occurring in Gippsland.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         has worked with the New South Wales and Victorian governments to activate support for those incidents through our disaster recovery funding arrangements. In New South Wales, assistance has been made available in the Bega Valley shire for eligible people who need assistance following those events. There is essential financial assistance made possible and concessional interest rate loans. In Victoria, assistance has been made available as well.

           I thank the minister for the update. I'm sure the Senate also sends their condolences to the family of that Kempsey man who lost his life. While fires and floods have already begun impacting on Australia, we know that the season has only just begun. What work has the Commonwealth undertaken to ensure that we are prepared for the natural disaster season?

            The Albanese government is highly cognisant of the increased level of risk facing communities across the country in the upcoming high-risk weather season. We are continuing to support those communities who are still recovering from two years of successive record-breaking floods, but we've also been preparing for the drying conditions that we're now seeing from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Nino" rel="nofollow">
             El Nino
            </a>
            and the switch back to dry and hot conditions that that is causing this summer.
           </p>
           <p>
            In fact, the Albanese government, through the National Emergency Management Agency, began preparations for the coming disaster season before the last disaster season had even finished, because we knew we were going to be facing difficult conditions this summer. Since then,

            has been pressing ahead with an expanded high-risk weather season preparedness program, which has included a disaster recovery funding arrangements roadshow, focused on informing and supporting disaster impacted local governments. Late last month we also held the inaugural high-risk weather season summit here at

               Of course, the Albanese government are tackling the root cause of increasing extreme weather—climate change—by legislating much more ambitious emission reduction targets than we saw previously and doubling our renewable energy projects, because, unlike those opposite, we accept the science of climate change. This week I met with bushfire survivors—
