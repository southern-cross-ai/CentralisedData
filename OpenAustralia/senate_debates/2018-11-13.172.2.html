        The Australian Research Council grant that has been referred to in media reports and on which the Senator's question is based, is a grant to the University of Melbourne. It is not a grant to any company. Under the relevant grant program, universities partner with the private sector on research projects.

       <p class="italic">
        The private sector entities do not receive the grants; in fact, they have to contribute in cash or in-kind to the relevant research projects.

        I write with regard to a question I took on notice from Senator Farrell during Question Time on Monday, 12 November 2018, regarding the publication of contracts from Tourism Australia on the AustTender website.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Tourism Australia's response to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Audit_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian National Audit Office
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
         ANAO
        </a>
        ) Report of 2008 made clear that the contracts referred to by Senator Farrell were entered into in 2005 and 2006. I have been advised that the
        <i>
         Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines 2004
        </i>
        did not apply to Tourism Australia prior to 2005.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The obligation for publishing contracts on the AusTender website is the date the procurement commenced, not the date the contracts were entered into. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance
        </a>
        is working with Tourism Australia to determine when the procurement processes for the contracts in question commenced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have directed the Department of Finance to work with Tourism Australia to ensure that it understands the obligations that applied to the procurements in question. The Department of Finance will continue to assist Tourism Australia as required to meet their obligations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to note that the 2008 ANAO Report referred to by Senator Farrell did not raise any concerns relating to non-reporting of the contracts audited.

       <p class="italic">
        I have copied this letter to Senator Farrell.
