         The speech read as follows—
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many millions of Australians have had multiple superannuation accounts throughout their lives and many often leave these accounts untouched, only to find that have been eroded to virtually nothing through fees, charges and insurance premiums.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        is well aware of the widespread nature of this problem.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Almost every week someone writes to the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services to express their shock and disappointment at realising their hard-earned retirement nest egg has been eaten away.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Or that the growth of their children's, partner's or other family member's balance has been stunted before it had truly had the chance to start.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fact is, how well or how poorly your fund performs means absolutely nothing if your account balance is eroded to zero, or close to zero.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In a compulsory system, it simply isn't good enough.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And it's why the Government, through this Bill, is taking action to ensure people's hard-earned savings are protected from fees, inappropriate insurance arrangements and the inefficiencies which result from holding multiple accounts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill does so by amending the
        <i>
         Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act
        </i>
        <i>
         1993
        </i>
        , the
        <i>
         Superannuation (Unclaimed Money and Lost Members) Act
        </i>
        <i>
         1999,
        </i>
        the
        <i>
         Income Tax Assessment Act 1997
        </i>
        and the
        <i>
         Taxation Administration Act 1953
        </i>
        to improve the superannuation regulatory system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Firstly, the Bill will address the negative consequences of Labor's 2013 abolition of low balance protection as part of the MySuper changes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Low balance accounts are particularly vulnerable to erosion by fees and charges.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, because of decisions made by the now Leader of the Opposition, there are no special protections in place to prevent low balance accounts from being eroded.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the current rules for MySuper products, fees are generally required to be charged to all members on the same basis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Unfortunately, doing so can lead to significant erosion for low balance accounts, particularly where flat fees are imposed on small accounts receiving little or no contributions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 1 to this Bill addresses this problem by preventing trustees of superannuation funds from charging administration and investment fees exceeding 3 per cent per annum of the balance of accounts below $6,000.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Based on the most recent data, it's estimated around 7 million Australians will save around $570 million in fees in just the first year, thanks to the Government's reforms.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 1 also prevents trustees from charging exit fees on any superannuation product, no matter the member's balance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, exit fees act as a disincentive for people to move money between funds when they wish to consolidate accounts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        According to APRA data, approximately one-third of funds charged an exit fee in 2016-17, with all the fees collected across the industry totalling $52 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In combination, this Schedule will prevent erosion of low balance accounts by high passively-incurred fees, and will remove a disincentive to account consolidation or rollovers by members.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 to this Bill will address the provision of insurance through superannuation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that insurance through superannuation is valuable for many Australians. Through the consultation process for this package, the government heard numerous examples of how people have benefitted from having insurance in times of need.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, what is not always mentioned, and what people continue to write to the Government about, are those circumstances where a significant proportion of their retirement savings – quite often their entire account balance – is eroded by insurance premiums.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The now Leader of the Opposition's 2013 changes required trustees of default MySuper products to provide automatic life insurance, on an opt out basis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This has resulted in some members paying for cover they do not know they have, that goes beyond what they need, or which they cannot even claim on.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Insurance premiums can also reduce low income earners' retirement balances by
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        10 per cent or more, compared to having no insurance, with the impact increasing with every additional set of policies held by an individual.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through this Bill, the Government will ensure that members who are at particular risk of account balance erosion will not have insurance provided on a default basis unless they have directed otherwise.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will put members first and give them the choice.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Specifically, Schedule 2 of the Bill will require that insurance be provided on an opt in basis only for:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes will give around 5 million people the option to save up to an estimated
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        $3 billion in premiums each year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government of course recognises that many individuals already assess their insurance needs and make informed decisions to hold accounts with a certain level of insurance.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To ensure this measure does not disadvantage those engaged members, the legislation allows for a member to elect to obtain or maintain existing insurance cover, and where they do so, they will not be affected by the changes in this Bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of the deliberate decision to entrench superannuation within the industrial relations system in this country, when someone starts a new job, they are often directed – sometimes forced – to put their money into a different fund.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For many Australians, this results in multiple accounts, multiple sets of fees and multiple insurance premiums.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services recently met with someone who had seven accounts. After he heard the news about how much it could cost him in retirement savings, he consolidated them. But he had already been charged seven sets of fees and insurance premiums for far too long, costing him goodness knows how much.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is by no means an isolated example. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        estimates that as at 30 June 2017, of the 14.8 million people who had a superannuation account, 40 per cent had more than one account. Amazingly, around 1.2 per cent or about 176,000 individuals held six or more accounts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Productivity Commission, in its ground-breaking draft report on the efficiency and competitiveness of the superannuation system, estimated that 1 in every 3 accounts were unintended duplicates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government knows that multiple accounts mean multiple fees and multiple sets of insurance premiums, ultimately leading to tens, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars less at retirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That is why, through Schedule 3 to this Bill, the ATO will, for the first time, be given the ability to proactively return the balances of inactive accounts, along with existing unclaimed superannuation monies, to their rightful owner.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ATO estimates that it will be able to reunify amounts within a month of receiving the funds.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under this Schedule, from 1 July 2019, funds will also be required to transfer all inactive accounts without insurance cover and with a balance below $6,000 to the ATO.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Upon doing so, these accounts will be protected from fees and charges and the ATO can use data matching techniques to reunify the amounts with an active superannuation account.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of these changes, in just the first year around 3 million members will be automatically reunited with around $6 billion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Importantly, the changes in the Bill will not replace existing account consolidation processes, which will remain available to members. The changes will simply supplement the current arrangements and streamline consolidation for disengaged members, ensuring that Australian's superannuation savings are better protected.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consistent with the Government's continued focus, the measures in this Bill are deliberately targeted at improving outcomes for members.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following their announcement, the Financial Services Council said it

        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government would like to take the opportunity to thank all the stakeholders who engaged with the consultation process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government appreciate from the industry's perspective this will involve some substantial changes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the Government firmly believes that this Bill, which will benefit young members, members with low balances such as low income earners, and members with multiple accounts, is in the best interest of all Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After all, we must never forget the most important foundation stone in superannuation – your superannuation is your money.
