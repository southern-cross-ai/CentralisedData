          The iconic Longreach and Emerald training colleges are an important component in the Queensland agricultural sector. These colleges have operated for more than 50 years and seen multiple generations of students graduate from them. The colleges are vital to numerous rural and regional communities. I understand that meetings have taken place between the state Labor government and stakeholders. However, there has been no official announcement that these colleges will remain open. The state Labor government needs to publicly reverse the decision to close the training colleges and give certainty to an agricultural sector hit by flood, fire and drought.

             This is a blatant political attack by the coalition on a considered decision made by the state government, a decision based on an independent review where 70 stakeholders were consulted, including the local Queensland Liberal National member, Lachlan Millar. This is from a government that has withdrawn funding from Primary Industries Education Foundation Australia, funding that Labor will return. This is from a government that has cut more than $3 billion from vocational education and skills and has stood by while apprentice numbers have dropped by 140,000. This is from a coalition that has failed to create a viable vocational education and training policy after being in government for five years. Instead, they have stood by while

                s. The two major parties have used vocational training and TAFE as a political football for way too long. We have had enough. Through their bipartisan commitment to so-called contestability funding, public TAFE has been gutted. The closure of these two colleges by the Queensland Labor government should be condemned.

                I had an amendment to remove the point about the Skilling Australians Fund, a point which only serves to muddy the waters. Unfortunately, this was not agreed to. This motion says these colleges are being closed because the Queensland government refused the Skilling Australians Fund. These colleges aren't being closed because they refused the fund; rather, the Queensland government has failed to properly plan and attract students to the Emerald and Longreach agriculture colleges. They need to be rebuilt, not torn down.
