        That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions without notice asked by Senators O’Neill and Carr today relating to the final report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Review" rel="nofollow">
         Independent Review
        </a>
        into the Future Security of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electricity_Market" rel="nofollow">
         National Electricity Market
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to make some opening remarks and then will go to the detail of the questions that I asked, but I think I would have to characterise the senator's responses today as the sound of silence, an attempt to try to shut down debate to try to get out of this space as quickly as possible. They were the shortest answers that I can recall for a very long time. Matters of energy for Australia are not the focus of this government. They are focused entirely on themselves and they do not want Australians to pay attention. They do not want anybody to know that they are out of control and they are certainly not doing anything good for the electricity prices of Australians in business and in their residential properties across this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, they must be completely out of touch with reality. Have any of them over there paid an electricity bill recently? The fact is that, as every Australian knows—and people listening to this would absolutely be able to verify this from their own experience—power prices have doubled in the four years of this government. They have been going through the roof while this government has been on watch. Sadly, I can all too well remember the campaign where this government said that they were going to fix everybody's electricity prices. They were going to change the taxation of the country, and everybody would get $550 back. That is silence there. We are still waiting. Cheques must be in the mail, because Australians across this nation have not got any respite from increasing electricity prices.
       </p>
       <p>
        While they have been doing this terrible job engaging in a paralysis of policy on the nature of energy in Australia, in addition to their policy failure they have absolutely deliberately gone out to target very vulnerable people with the cost of energy, most recently cutting the energy supplement of $360 per year so that any new person who goes on a pension is not going to get that. So here we are. They stand there and say: 'Oh, we've got it all in control. We will take decisive action.' That is the claim that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        is making. The decisive action we are seeing is action of no benefit to the Australian population; in fact, it is action that is devastating people's experiences of access to energy for their businesses and for their homes.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week we saw the Finkel report come out, and this was supposed to be the line in the sand, the moment when we were actually able to start to see some redress of this policy vacuum that they have generated. With the arrival of the Finkel report, instead we have seen the chaos emerging at an extraordinary level within the government ranks. The Energy Council and other experts are all on the record as saying the greatest cause of increasing prices and threats to supply of electricity in Australia right now is policy paralysis. Indeed, the day before yesterday in their party room I understand Minister Frydenberg even admitted that that is the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        My three questions today were to Senator Brandis. He did not answer any of them. When the Business Council of Australia, usually a pretty good friend, says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia hasn't a moment to lose now that we have a comprehensive, independent blueprint to restore the security, reliability and affordability of our electricity system.
       </p>
       <p>
        the decisive action and the fulsome report that we got from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        was, I think, one or two words and a quick sit down. That was it. That was their version of decisive action. It was the shortest response that I have ever seen from the Attorney-General.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then we had the question about Mark Collette, who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Doing nothing means higher prices and less reliable energy for all customers.
       </p>
       <p>
        He could not answer a question about why the government cannot actually respond to this call from the energy sector itself. The head of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Energy Australia
        </a>
        is saying, 'It's time to sort it out, guys,' and the reason we did not get an answer is that the truth is this government is so internally divided, so out of touch that they are unable to have a conversation.

          My last question went to the reality of how broken the internals of the government are, with

            You hear everything in this place, don't you? You hear everything. The carbon tax we were never going to have, which we abolished, actually brought the prices down substantially when it was abolished.

              We will not harp on that. We will go back to the energy situation. I do not mind renewable energy; I am a supporter of renewable energy. That is one condition: it stands on its own. Senator Farrell is here from

                No, I enjoy electricity. I like to turn the switch and the light stays on, and it does not go into darkness. I am not regretting leaving the dark state 25 years ago. In fact, there was a sign at
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_Hill" rel="nofollow">
                 Broken Hill
                </a>
                , up there at Cockburn, when you went across the border: 'Last one out, please turn off the lights.' That was a sign when you left
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                 South Australia
                </a>
                . You do not have to worry about turning off lights; they just went off automatically with the lack of electricity.
               </p>
               <p>
                Here are the wind turbines. You put a wind turbine. It produces three megawatt hours. So what is the subsidy? Well, one megawatt hour is a renewable energy certificate, making $70 or $80. A three megawatt wind turbine means three certificates an hour, eight hours a day, 365 days a year. Multiply that by $70 or $80 and what have you got? You have got a $7,000-a-year subsidy to the wind turbine. That is for one. Of course, they are all over where I grew up at Jamestown. It was everywhere. A $7,000 subsidy for each tower.
               </p>
               <p>
                But who pays for it? I will tell you who pays for it: the poor widow who is living on her own as a pensioner. It goes onto her power bill, because the coal fired generators have to buy the renewable energy certificates. What happens? Then the wind turbines can sell electricity cheap because they are getting so much subsidy. I am sure that Senator Farrell would be aware of a place call

                    So those from the party of dictatorship, where you do as you are told, you just do as you are told and keep going. On our side of the politics, in the Liberal-National party, we are actually having a debate. We are having a discussion. We have got a report. We are sorting out what is the best. We have been in the party room for hours, working out what is the best situation to guarantee supply, to reduce costs and to do the right thing. That is because the situation we face is simple: if we do not have cheap, reliable electricity, we will not have manufacturing and we will not have jobs. We will not have anything. Everything will be moved overseas. That is the situation, and we will stick by it.

                     ask this government to give the Finkel report its full and fair consideration before rushing in and rigging the definition of 'clean energy'. But no, that cannot happen within this Turnbull Liberal government, because they are so divided when it comes to what clean energy even means. That is why, four years later, we are still in a situation of policy paralysis on clean energy, on the cost of electricity prices and on a way forward for investment in our country. So many groups have urged you, as a government, to stop this paralysis and to take some action to resolve this crisis. Labor have made it very clear that we are open to a clean energy target, and that is a big shift for Labor.

                     Despite all of that good will, despite all of the encouragement from all of those groups, including the opposition, this government simply cannot get their house in order; instead, they leave this country in a state of absolute paralysis when it comes to investment. What is the outcome? We have lost thousands of jobs that could have gone into that growth in renewable energy over the last four years. After all of the work that has been done by the

                     , we leave ourselves in a situation where we just do not know where this government is going to land. What we do know is that there is a situation of the tail wagging the dog. You have former Prime Minister Tony Abbott out there talking about his dislike for the recommendations in the Finkel review when he has not even read the report! He has not read the report but, because of his ideological beliefs against renewable energy, he has already decided, along with buddies such as

                    <p>
                     The idea that you can change the definition of something, that you can decide that clean energy has to include coal, is just bizarre. To have a definition of clean energy that includes new coal power stations just to placate the Tony Abbotts, the George Christensens and the Barnaby Joyces of this world makes a complete mockery of the seriousness of the work that the Chief Scientist, Dr Finkel, has done with his panel over the last number of months. I cannot understand where this government is coming from, but one thing does seem very clear and that is that we are not going to land in any space or time of certainty soon. They are simply too divided on where to go forward in relation to climate policy, so much so that I have just learnt today that

Its plan is for two wind turbines—just two—on Lord Howe Island to reduce its reliance by 70 per cent on diesel power, but it has been rejected by Minister Frydenberg. Let's look at what minister Frydenberg said: it would have 'clearly unacceptable impacts'. 'Clearly unacceptable impacts' is his take on it. He also said:

                    <p>
                     This is the environment minister, this is the energy minister, and he is basing his decision on the visual impact of two wind turbines on Lord Howe Island, when 92 per cent of the locals on Lord Howe Island support this proposal. They do not want to continue to rely on diesel generation. In fact,

                       . It is not climate policy; it is about the future of the security of the Australian energy market. And it was delivered to COAG. Do those opposite know why? Do they know why? We have had a lot of exponential increases in household energy prices at both the household and industry levels because state governments have a significant role to play in the price of the power bills for Australian households—how much it costs them to heat and cool their homes and to refrigerate their food. Importantly, those who are actually interested in the workers in this country—who are actually interested in energy-intensive industry and who are interested in the food-processing sector or manufacturing—know that those sectors in our economy are energy intensive and know that those industries under incredible pressure from the cost of doing business. Their power supplies are a significant component of that, and everybody knows that state governments have a crucial role in ensuring that supplies for energy generation are available to the domestic market.

                       I think of my home state of Victoria, and I call on the energy minister in Victoria to take her responsibility for this report—having been handed this report—and, with what the various state energy ministers have been tasked to do in this report, not to fob it off. She should actually take responsibility and think, 'How can I increase the supply of gas in a safe way and in a way that does not damage our waterways?' It needs to be in a way that ensures we get more supply into the market and increased investment.

Or to deal with the intermittent pulsation of renewable energy power supplies? They did not worry about that. You did not worry about that, because you are all about the emotional response. You do not care about engineering and you do not care about economics.

                         The things that will actually make a difference here in this country for the power prices that senators opposite were talking about is ensuring that state governments get on board and get serious about setting appropriate targets. I could go on and on. I am quite devastated that I now only have 30 seconds to go, because I did have a lot to say!

                         At a federal level, if the Labor Party are serious about jobs and about cost-of-living pressures then they will be looking at the Finkel review. They will be looking at how they can put pressure on their state colleagues to ensure that they are doing what they need to do so that we get access to reliable and affordable energy. The Chief Scientist says that coal is part of the mix. You do not like us to say it, but that is what the science tells us. You must accept the science.

Our once and possibly future Prime Minister, Mr Abbott, is such a brave person. He waded in knee-deep, opining that the Finkel review of the Electricity Market was deficient in many respects, despite then admitting to not having read it.

                          It is reported that many other members of the Liberal party room, a number speculated to be as high as 20, condemned it too on the 'vibe of the thing', as that famous Australian saying goes. Twenty is, of course, a very interesting number in Liberal partyroom dynamics. It is a very good start if you are contemplating mounting a coup. It is probably Mr Abbott's bedrock. It is a number, no doubt, keeping up the Prime Minister—

                            Yes, I think that is right, Senator Farrell—as he reflects on whether he can survive until Christmas: clinging to power, pleasing neither conservatives nor small 'l' Liberals, only occasionally winning favour among a diminishing number of scribes.

                            But of course what the people of Australia want is a Prime Minister who will reserve the best efforts of his care and attention to the people's business. And self-evidently vital to the welfare of the people of Australia, to jobs, is ensuring certainty into energy policy. Despite their weasel words, the Abbott-Turnbull government, perhaps soon to be the Dutton-Abbott government, have presided over great uncertainty and are in control of what is really best described as an energy crisis in Australia. Wholesale power prices have doubled in their four agonisingly incompetent years in office. And you do not have to be a Belgian detective to figure out that if wholesale electricity prices go up, retail prices will surely follow.

                            This building, this vast beautiful building constructed inside a hill, cost more than $1.1 billion to build in 1988 dollars. The representatives and senators who sit here cost the taxpayers around $500 million a year, every year. The taxpayers pay us to make decisions, to make the big calls that affect the future of the country. And yet this government, on so many issues, has shown itself incapable of making decisions. Those 20-plus coalition MPs know that indecision is killing their government. Who else knows this basic truth? Pretty much everyone else in Australia: peak industry groups, unions, welfare groups, farmers. Its policy paralysis on energy policy, a paralysis caused by a genuine confusion in the Liberal party room about whether they believe in climate change at all, is led by someone who actually does believe in climate change—but, of course, he is not really leading them. He is their Prime Minister in name only. The Energy Council has contributed soaring electricity prices to the government's inability to do its job to determine a coherent, consistent energy policy.

                            will always be focused on protecting and encouraging the creation of jobs in Australia. There is a straight line between cheaper, cleaner and more secure power and jobs. Labor will never indulge in the ideological zealotry of those who do not care about climate or those so rich—often so green—that they do not have to care about jobs. For Labor, our mission is clear and always has been: jobs, jobs, jobs. Under the Abbott-Turnbull-Dutton-Abbott-again government, there has been a crisis of indecision and incompetence on energy policy—a party room of climate sceptics notionally led by somebody who would probably be pedalling renewable schemes for
