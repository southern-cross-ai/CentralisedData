        I ask Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, a question. Senator Minchin referred to our conference, where we talked about and debated drought. I now ask Senator Abetz: how is the coalition government assisting farmers to mitigate the severe impact of drought?

         I thank Senator Boswell and acknowledge him as a great champion for the farmers of this country and as someone who is very aware of the growing crisis that our farm sector is facing because of drought. The present drought, which has continued since 2001, is the worst on record. At the moment, 38 per cent of agricultural land is exceptional circumstances drought declared.
        </p>
        <p>
         Rainfall data shows that August 2006 was the driest August in 100 years. Large parts of southern

          Western Australia
         </a>
         and south-eastern Australia have had the lowest rainfall on record. Rainfall from December 2005 to August 2006 was in the lowest 10 per cent on record for large areas of the Murray-Darling Basin. As a result,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABARE" rel="nofollow">
          ABARE
         </a>
         forecasts that grain and oilseed production will fall sharply by 34 per cent in 2005-06. Wheat production is forecast to fall by around 35 per cent, canola by 46 per cent and rice by 62 per cent. Unfortunately, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
          Bureau of Meteorology

         outlook for the end of 2006 is that conditions will not improve.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a grim picture. That is why this government will do everything in its power to help offset the damage to farmers and our rural communities from this crisis. Since 2001, the Howard government has provided more than $1.2 billion to more than 53,000 farm families. This figure is increasing by more than $1.7 million each week. At the moment the taxpayer is spending some $29 million a month on income support and interest rate subsidies for drought affected farmers.

                   , I have a point of order. I do not know whether Senator Abetz is selectively deaf, but you just drew his attention to the fact that he should ignore the interjection and return to the question—and the first thing he did was then start on again about the interjection. Would you please get him to at least abide by your ruling.

                     . The Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry today announced that the government would be extending this support until 31 March 2008 for all eligible producers, worth another estimated $350 million. This is in addition to ongoing Australian government support such as the Farm Management Deposits scheme, which allows taxable primary product income to be set aside in profitable years and withdrawn later.

                     No-one knows for sure what has caused this drought. What is clear is that no-one should be foolish enough to believe that it could have been avoided had Australia signed the Kyoto treaty. The facts are that, even without signing, Australia is one of the few countries to be well on track to meet the Kyoto targets. What this crisis requires is practical assistance for farmers, practical and sensible ways to reduce our greenhouse emissions, and improved coordination and conservation of our water resources. That is what we are dedicating ourselves to, ably assisted by Senator Boswell.
