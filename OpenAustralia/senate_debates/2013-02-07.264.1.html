         The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Fair Work Commission (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FWC" rel="nofollow">
          FWC
         </a>
         ) has provided the following response:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) With reference to the financial reporting requirements of registered organisations, can details be provided of the number of organisations that have failed to comply with the legislative target dates for each year since 2008, including:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) the names of each organisation; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) to what the target dates related.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         A reporting unit is required to lodge its financial report under section 268 of the
         <i>
          Fair Work (Registered Organsiations) Act 2009
         </i>
         (the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RO" rel="nofollow">
          RO
         </a>
         Act) with FWC within a maximum of six months and 14 days of the end of its financial year. Prior to that event, obligations prescribed in sections 265 and 266 arise in relation to the provision of reports to members and the presentation of reports to a meeting, being either a general meeting of members or (where rules make appropriate provision) a meeting of the committee of management.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Attachment A sets out each reporting unit of a registered organisation that has failed to lodge its audited financial report with FWC (or its predecessor as relevant) within the maximum allowable period of six months and 14 days. Global statistics are provided on the front page. Information for 2012 is incomplete as some reporting units are not yet required to lodge this financial report, depending upon the end of financial year date.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         All reporting units that have not lodged financial reports required by section 268 are being actioned in accordance with the
         <i>
          FWC Regulatory Compliance Policy
         </i>
         , including by commencing inquiries or investigations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Whilst compliance with the timeframes required by sections 265 and 266 is assessed and addressed for each reporting unit once a lodged report is examined by FWC, it is not presently possible to generate a report on compliance with target dates for these obligations.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) For the 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12 financial years, can details be provided of the number of registered organisations that failed to provide an auditor ' s report or statement referring specifically to the concise report as prescribed by section 265(3 ) ( c) of the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009 (the Act), including:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) when the failure occurred;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) whether the registered organisation has been required to correct the record and provide such an auditor ' s statement; if not, why not; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) the names of each organisation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         FWC does not accept lodgement of a financial report that does not contain an auditor ' s report as such a report would not constitute a " full report " as defined in subsection 265(1) of the RO Act.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         On occasion, a small number of reporting units will elect to provide members with a concise financial report. Subsection 265(3) requires that a concise report be separately audited (in addition to the audit of the " full " financial report). The following reporting units failed to lodge an auditor ' s report with respect to the concise financial report:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) For the 2009/10, 2010/11 and 2011/12 financial years, how many registered organisations have:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) failed to provide a full report to their membership within 6 months of the financial year, over the past three years; and

         the necessary documentation within 14 days of a general meeting.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There is no legislative requirement that a reporting unit provide its financial report to members within 6 months of the end of financial year. The legislative scheme requires either that: 1

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         o For those reporting units with a 31 December end of financial year - 9 June of the following year.
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         Please see answer to question (1) above.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) To the knowledge of FWA, how many registered organisations have failed to comply with subsection 254(2 ) ( d) of the Act.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         FWC is reliant upon self -disclosure by reporting units where officers or members meet the criterion set out in paragraph 254(2 ) ( d).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         FWC would act upon any complaint received concerning a contravention of s254(2 ) ( d).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) If this information has been withheld by organisations:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) why has FWA not demanded organisations provide completed records; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) does FWA simply request that requirements be met in the future without requiring that historical data be provided to both FWA and to the membership of the registered organisation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Refer to the answer to question (4) above.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) Given that subsection 237(1) of the Act requires certain steps if an individual grant or donation exceeds $1 000, has FWA sought historical data of registered organisations that are known not to have complied, in particular, matters in relation to United Voice Tasmania.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Each reporting unit is required by paragraph 11(f) of the Registrar ' s Reporting Guidelines to disclose items of expense for " grants or donations " . Where grants or donations are disclosed in the financial report but a statement of loans, grants and donations has not previously been lodged by the reporting unit under section 237 of the RO Act, FWC advises the reporting unit of the requirement to lodge such a statement should any of the individual grants or donations exceed the $1,000 threshold.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Regulatory Compliance Branch is currently drafting amendments to the Reporting Guidelines which will require disclosure in a financial report of all grants or donations that exceed the $1,000 threshold, thereby enabling FWC to determine whether the reporting unit has complied with section 237.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Lodgement by the Tasmanian Branch of the Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Union (as it then was) of a statement of loans, grants and donations for the financial years ended 30 June 2010 and 30 June 2011 is the subject of a current inquiry by the
