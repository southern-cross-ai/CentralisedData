        I have spoken many times on adjournment about the missing Australian diggers at Fromelles in northern France. It has been a story with many chapters. I am pleased to have been able to assist in getting the previous government to get on with the task many years ago. From the time Mr Englezos contacted my office seeking help, right through to the present, it has been a wonderful, wonderful story. Now, all has been revealed, except the identity of those 250 bodies recovered. For those listening and who may have missed the media coverage, I recommend that they log onto www.cwgc.org. That is the website for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth War Graves Commission
        </a>
        in London, which is the agency that has the responsibility for the recovery and the construction of the new cemetery on our behalf. The Department of Defence in Australia also has an informative site. On this site, relatives can register for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">

        matching.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I thought it would be useful to issue another chapter in the recovery of the missing at Fromelles. The 250 bodies from the six mass graves at Pheasant Wood have all now been exhumed. This is considerably fewer than the 400 originally expected—but the proportion of Australians, it appears, may be much higher. These soldiers have lain there since they were interred by the German army in late July 1916. The pits have been filled in and resown to pasture. Eventually, the site, which was donated by the owner, will become a commemorative site. It will be duly marked with a monument—and I understand planning is going on for a ceremonial event. Australian, British and French governments will participate in that ceremonial event. I also understand that it is considered appropriate that the German government be invited to participate. It is fitting, given the respect and care taken in the burial of these men so long ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Operating in parallel with the recovery, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission is constructing a new cemetery close to Pheasant Wood. It will be near the village church and in line of sight. It is also in sight of the battlefield where almost 2,000 Australians lost their lives on 19 July 1916.
       </p>
       <p>
        At present, the bodies recovered have been sampled for DNA testing purposes. They are in storage awaiting reburial. These samples will be analysed at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGC" rel="nofollow">
         LGC
        </a>
        forensic laboratories in the United Kingdom. DNA samples considered viable—which is estimated at better than 75 per cent—will then be matched using samples provided by relatives. I understand that some identifications have been made from anthropological evidence found. First, this might comprise artefacts, of which there are many. For example, badges, personal belongings and remnants of uniforms help target likely identities. Fortunately, we have a list complied from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        records of those thought to be buried at that time by the German army. In some cases, there are dental records which are quite conclusive. For others, physical features such as height also narrow the task. The immature finger knuckles of one confirm an age of just 15. DNA, while difficult, is the final test—made easier if the sample is from the female line. We can only hope that this process, which is extraordinarily time consuming, will eventually reveal the identity of a greater number of men.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, it is likely that, after all this time, some or many may remain unidentified. There may be no matches from living relatives or the DNA may be inadequate. As has been standard practice over time, those not identified will be marked by a headstone engraved ‘Known only to God’. I am advised that, as the cemetery becomes available, burials will commence with due ceremony until 19 July next year. At this time, the cemetery will be formally dedicated. Those whose identities become known over time will have their anonymous headstones replaced. Their names will be inscribed, as well as a family message—which was also the custom of the time. This, no doubt, will be a momentous day for all those who have followed this story over the last few years. No doubt, the DNA testing process will not be completed by that time. As has been the case with other discoveries, headstones will be replaced as identities become known over time. There will be many more stories of families being reunited with their deceased great uncles, grandfathers and great grandfathers.

        The story of the missing at Fromelles has captured the imagination of many Australians. Just as interesting has been the story behind the story. The research, which has been conducted in Munich and Geneva in particular, has shown just how extensive the records are, especially those made by the German army. It is unfortunate, however, that so much was lost in London and Germany during the fires caused by bombing through World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        . In fact, as far as Fromelles is concerned, we are very lucky that Captain Mills was there. Captain Mills was an Australian

        in Germany at the time. After the armistice, he collected the particular records made for those thought to be buried at Fromelles. Otherwise, it seems verification may have been at least very difficult but, more likely, almost impossible.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I again congratulate those who have worked so hard to bring this project to fruition. I am certainly very pleased to have been able to assist, particularly in the earlier stages—simply by supporting the efforts in this place and by keeping the Howard government up to the mark from time to time. I am sure there will be more to report in due course, and I hope that those listening and those who have an interest will log onto the websites that I mentioned and discover more for themselves.
