        , my question is to the Minister representing the Attorney-General, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister confirm reports that an agreement has been reached with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO

        to ensure that the 900-odd detainees at

        </a>
        found to be refugees but waiting for security checks will be processed within the next six weeks? Does the minister agree that the delay in completing these checks is a massive failure of policy and a reflection of the fact that the Labor government is no longer able to manage Australia’s borders?

         I thank Senator Trood for his question.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         ’s priority and responsibility is to ensure that Australia’s security is not compromised. Security assessments therefore must be thorough and ASIO is working closely with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIAC" rel="nofollow">
          DIAC
         </a>
         on the visa security assessment case load and agreed priorities. ASIO relies on DIAC to prioritise the case load so that it can be addressed. ASIO regularly reviews and revises the allocation of resources to security assessments as required through the rearrangement of resources. ASIO, I am advised, is able to respond to changing priorities and increase the workload where it is needed. So processing times, as I have said before in this chamber, do vary in accordance with several variable things such as the circumstances of each individual case, the size and complexity of the case load and the external factors beyond ASIO’s control.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the outset I reject the premise of the question. What ASIO is doing is working through the prioritised case load to ensure (a) that there are thorough security checks and (b) that they do work with DIAC to prioritise that work to ensure that they meet individual circumstances. This is what the opposition seem to miss in this: the time taken to process will vary depending on the individual circumstances of each individual case. It will vary because of the necessity to either gain information and wait for a response or alternatively the type or size or complexity of the individual case itself. So that is an explanation for the time it will take to assess cases.

          Thank you for that circumlocution, Minister. Perhaps you could mention six weeks in your answer. I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister assure the Senate that, in its haste to make up for its massive policy failure, the rigour of the security assessments will not be compromised and that Australians can be confident that no-one will be released from detention who has not been cleared?

           What the opposition failed to appreciate in the first question I answered, and the second question I am going to respond to, is that the security assessment process is and remains an important element of Australia’s robust border security regime and will not be compromised. That is what I said at the outset and we continue to do that. I know the supplementary question really rewords the first question, but I will continue nevertheless.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Australian public expects nothing less than that we will not compromise our border security and we will not compromise on the required checks that need to be done. With the security assessments over recent months there has been ongoing collaboration between the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Security_Intelligence_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Security Intelligence Organisation
           </a>
           and the immigration department to streamline security checking arrangements and to reduce processing time without compromising national security.

            , I have waited until the minister has almost exhausted his time before taking this point of order. But what the question asked was whether Australians can be confident that no-one will be released from detention who has not been cleared. That is the issue that he has not addressed. He has not addressed that issue. He can either give that assurance in the terms asked of him or he cannot.
