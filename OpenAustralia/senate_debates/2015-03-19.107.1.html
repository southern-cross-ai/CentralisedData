        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Brandis. I refer the minister to a letter from the Swedish government to the

         Defence Materiel Organisation

I am not familiar with the letter to which you refer, but I can inform you, Senator—I can refer honourable senators—that the government has, under the competitive evaluation process, very clear criteria for the selection of the construction of Australia's next submarine. That is a project that you would know, Senator Gallacher—although I am sure you would not admit—was neglected and placed in the too-hard basket for six years—

            from the first day of the Labor government to the last, through consecutive defence ministers, consecutive industry ministers—including you, Senator Carr. It was put in the too-hard basket from the first day to the last.

           <p>
            Nevertheless, Senator Gallacher, this is what the government is looking for. We are looking for a project which will serve the Australian national interest and Australia's needs. We are looking for appropriate range and endurance. We are looking for sensor performance and stealth characteristics that are superior to the Collins class submarine. We are looking for a combat system and heavyweight torpedo jointly developed between the United States and Australia as the preferred combat system and main armament. The government's acquisition strategy, Senator Gallacher, for the Future Submarine is based on a competitive evaluation process, as I said, which provides a pathway for Australian industry to maximise its involvement in the program while not compromising capability, cost, schedule or risk. And that is what we are going to deliver, Senator Gallacher. That is what we are going to deliver. We are going to put the best interest of Australia first, and we are not going to avoid the decision as the Labor government avoided the decision for six years.

             We note with regret that not one of the delegations visiting Sweden has had the expertise necessary for either technical or industrial analysis.

                 Senator Gallacher, no final decision has been made in relation to this matter. But I can assure you that when an international partner is chosen to partner with Australian industry to build the next generation Australian submarine it will be the international partner which is best placed to meet the criteria which the government has specified. That international partner will be chosen through the competitive evaluation process that we have been explaining to you for some weeks now, and Australia's national interest will be the first and last consideration.

                  , my final supplementary question is to the Attorney-General. On the day that Sweden was excluded from the government's competitive evaluation process it was reported that Sweden could build 12 submarines in Adelaide at a competitive cost to taxpayers. Is the exclusion of Sweden the result of the captain's pick to send Australia's submarine build overseas?
