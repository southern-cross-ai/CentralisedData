         (3)   With reference to the first 14 F-35 aircraft:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a)   On current plans, Australia's first two F-35s will be delivered in the United States in 2014 for training at the international F-35 pilot training centre. In relation to the timetable for delivery of the remaining 12 F-35As, on 3 May 2012, the Minister for Defence announced a two year deferral of the acquisitions of the 12 aircraft. The new schedule reflects decisions taken by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Government" rel="nofollow">
          United States Government
         </a>
         to restructure the Joint Strike Fighter program and defer the acquisition of some aircraft. Decisions will be taken in the course of 2012 in relations to any potential capability gap and the timing of the placing of orders for additional Joint Strike Fighters.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b)   See response to 3(a)
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c)   Assuming an operational life out to 2046, the estimated through life and operating cost of the first 14 F-35s (including capability upgrades but not including acquisition cost) will be approximately $9 billion (Then Year).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4)   With reference to the acquisition of additional F-35 aircraft, future numbers are subject to further Government consideration. No judgements or conclusions have been made.

        <p class="italic">
         (5)   Government is yet to decide on the acquisition of additional F-35s.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6)   This is a hypothetical question and could not be calculated.
