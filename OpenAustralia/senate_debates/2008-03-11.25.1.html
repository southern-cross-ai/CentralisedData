        My question is to Senator Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, representing the Minister for Education. Will the minister guarantee that the Rudd government will not axe successful education programs such as the summer school for teachers, the Teaching Australia initiative, grants for schools that achieve improvement in literacy and numeracy, and values education programs?

         I thank the senator for his question. The senator has raised a number of matters which were the subject of a report in the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         newspaper. These are matters that are being considered in a budget context and, as such, it is not appropriate for me to comment further on them. What I can say to the senator is that the Rudd government has already announced funding for this budget for the $1 billion National Secondary School Computer Fund, giving access to a computer to every student in years 9 to 12. The Rudd government has also committed to delivering trade training centres in secondary schools, providing $500 million to the end of December and $2.5 billion over 10 years. The schools partnership program of $62.5 million is to encourage local schools to share facilities and resources. The budget will also provide $489 million for schools to install solar power.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those are all matters that have been announced. I am able to confirm those matters because they have been announced. I am not able to confirm other speculation that has been raised through the pages of the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         newspaper. The forthcoming budget will be an opportunity for the Rudd Labor government to install its ongoing program in terms of the education revolution. It will be an opportunity to actually see substantial improvements in the provision of education across this country for all Australians. I have no doubt that the senator who has asked this question will be only too happy to support these measures in the forthcoming budget session.

          , I ask a supplementary question. In light of the minister’s refusal to guarantee the survival of these critical education programs, can the minister guarantee that no school and no student will be worse off?

           I can say to the senator that in any budget context there are issues that are considered. What we do have, however, is the incapacity to actually confirm the speculation that is being presented in the
           <i>
            Australian
           </i>
           newspaper. What I am able to say is that a series of initiatives have been announced by the government which will strengthen our education system, will strengthen the provision of schooling in Australia, will strengthen equality of opportunity in this country and will allow for a much higher level of participation in Australian society and the Australian economy as a direct result of this government’s education revolution. It is a tragedy that the previous government failed to respond to its obligations in this regard—
