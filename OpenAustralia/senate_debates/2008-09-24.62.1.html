        journalist Mr Philip Dorling yesterday morning. Can the minister inform the Senate of the reason for the raids? Is it not the case that the raids related to the article by Mr Dorling which appeared under his by-line on 14 June this year?

         Thank you, Senator Brandis, for the question. I understand that such a raid did occur and I have read the reportage of that, but my advice is that there is an ongoing

          , I rise on a point of order. I have carefully avoided directing any aspect of this question to any operational matter. It has been the convention in this chamber and in estimates committees—and I would invite you to rule on this—that a question in relation to an agency such as the

           AFP

Given the minister’s refusal to answer the question notwithstanding your invitation to do so, Mr President, how does the minister’s attitude sit with the Rudd government’s commitment announced by his colleague Minister Ludwig on 24 May 2007 to provide shield laws to journalists and to review laws that criminalise reporting of matters of public interest?

The supplementary question was directed to the statement of Labor Party policy by Senator Ludwig concerning shield laws for journalists, and to the significance of his refusal to answer the primary question in relation to Senator Ludwig’s statement. It was nothing to do with operational matters at all.
