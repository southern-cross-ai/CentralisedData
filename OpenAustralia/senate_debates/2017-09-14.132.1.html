         I will actually take Senator Wong's interjection: 'Will these merely be allegations?' To answer your question—no, they won't. Yesterday the Federal Court of Australia made a finding in relation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         . The CFMEU were fined $2.4 million.

         just repeat that—$2.4 million for breaking the law for conducting illegal strike action on the Barangaroo building site.

          What do we hear? I was going to say deafening silence, but it's not, is it? What we have is a defence of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
           CFMEU
          </a>
          , the most militant union in this country—a union that has no shame when it comes to undertaking some of the most disgusting and egregious behaviour and, in particular, when it comes to demeaning and degrading female inspectors on worksites. I, colleagues, am no longer allowed to say what they said because Senator Wong is offended by the words of inspectors of CFMEU officials being raised in this chamber, but she, along with other members of the Labor Party, make no defence at all.

             Thank you, Senator Cameron. In relation to the point of order, I intend at the end of question time today to rule on two matters that were raised by Senator Wong yesterday; so whether Senator Cash is anticipating what I may or may not say after question time, I don't know.

             remind all senators to be very cognisant of the language they use in the chamber, and I have reminded ministers of this in the past. There is no point of order against the minister. Minister, you have the call.

I do not hear anyone on the other side, even the feminists, mount a defence against the foul and abusive language used in particular by Luke Collier, a man who bashed his girlfriend—committed domestic violence.

                 In fact, Senator Macdonald, Justice Flick said that it was unlikely that deterrents could be achieved by the imposition of penalties comparable to those that have been imposed in the past. He said:

                 Maybe the penalties are ineffectual because those on the other side never condemn the behaviour. Those on the other side only ever come into this place and defend the CFMEU for all of their unlawful conduct. Those on the other side are part of the

                    Unfortunately, I am because, as we know, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Bill Shorten, has already stated that if they are ever given the keys to the office in this place again, they will abolish the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
                     ABCC
                    </a>
                    immediately and quite proudly. Why? Because they condone the behaviour of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
                     CFMEU
                    </a>
                    . Instead of being fined $2.4 million yesterday by the Federal Court, under Labor, the CFMEU would receive the fine of absolutely nothing, because the ABCC will be abolished by any future Labor government. Again, how can those on the other side come into this place and not stand up and condemn the behaviour, after the findings—decision after decision—of the Federal Court of unlawful behaviour by the most militant union in this country? It's because money talks.
