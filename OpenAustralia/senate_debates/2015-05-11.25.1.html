         I want to ask a question regarding government amendment (1) on sheet

          EH
         </a>
         158, relating to section 9A(3)(1). I am hoping that I am clear in what I am asking there. I apologise, but we did only receive these amendments very recently and I am trying to get my head around them. I am interested in clarifying. Does that particular amendment, which links the definition of the person who made the decision to a specific legislative regime, affect review rights?

           amendment (1) on sheet 7680:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (1) Page 6 (after line 5), after clause 3, insert:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           4 Review of operation of amendments
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (1) The Minister must cause a review of the operation of the amendments made by this Act to be undertaken as soon as practicable after the end of the period of 3 years after the commencement of Schedule 1.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (2) The review must consider:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (a) the effect of the amendments made by this Act; and
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (b) any other related matter that the Minister specifies.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (3) The person who undertakes the review must give the Minister a written report of the review within 6 months after the end of the 3-year period.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (4) The Minister must cause a copy of the report of the review to be tabled in each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of receiving it.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is the amendment that I foreshadowed in my speech in the second reading debate regarding a review of the newly amalgamated tribunal within 24 months of that tribunal being established to give users, practitioners, tribunal members and other interested stakeholders an opportunity to have input as to whether the stated aims of efficiency, efficacy and cost saving have been met, as well as whether or not the other objectives of a fair and reliable tribunal system have been met.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would urge the committee to support this amendment. As we have heard from various people who have contributed to the debate, it is a significant change. As I indicated too, it is not one that the Greens are necessarily opposed to. I think there is always a risk in these things that, once the deed has been done and significant changes have been made, there are significant aspects that have been lost as well. I would be urging the committee to support the Greens amendment to have a comprehensive review within 24 months of the establishment the tribunal.

            As indicated by Senator Wright, this amendment would require the Attorney-General to order an independent review of the operation of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
             AAT
            </a>
            two years after the bill commences. We thank the Greens for what we think is a sensible amendment. This is a complex piece of legislation. We are dealing with four large bodies; their consolidation can be expected to involve some teething issues. It will be prudent for a review to be conducted after an appropriate time to ensure that the amalgamation is proceeding as intended and that the objectives of the legislation are being achieved.
           </p>
           <p>
            I note that the amendment does not stipulate who should conduct the review. We would respectfully suggest to the Attorney-General that the appropriate body would be the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Review_Council" rel="nofollow">
             Administrative Review Council
            </a>
            . This organisation, with a long and distinguished background in overseeing Commonwealth administrative law, is well equipped to conduct the proposed review. I notice—I think I indicated it in my contribution to the second reading debate—that this amalgamation proposal, which has a very long history indeed, was first seriously proposed by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC" rel="nofollow">

             The government does not support this amendment, merely because it is unnecessary. A review is already provided for and $150,000 of funding has already been allocated for the conduct of a review to commence in the 2016-17 year with an obligation to report to government by 31 December 2017. Senator Wright, you propose a review after two years. This was already announced, by the way, in the additional estimates. There is going to be review in 2016-17 with a reporting date of 31 December 2017—you were obviously unaware of it. In view of that, perhaps you might care to reflect on whether you wish to persist with this amendment.

                   Labor will be supporting the government amendments, which, as Senator Brandis indicated, cover some minor inconsequential matters and transitional issues in relation to the bill. I should clarify, though, that my understanding in relation to opposition amendments is that the amendment that Senator Brandis referred to in relation to the seven-year terms is not actually within this bundle of amendments. My most recent advice is that we will be dealing with them in the opposition's amendment, with government support.

                   <p>
                    The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: I will now put the question in relation to amendments (2) and (7) on sheet EH158. The question is that items 19, 64 and 65 of schedule 1 stand as printed.
                   </p>

                     I can indicate that we will not be proceeding with that amendment. The issues that we clarified earlier with the government and that this is incorporated in the government's batch of amendments, as Senator Brandis indicated when he moved the last batch, has satisfied our concerns on that one.

                      <p>
                       We are happy to move to the next amendment, which is opposition amendment (2). I should say that there should be a revised amendment being circulated.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: Senator Collins, I understand that it has a new sheet number, 7696, which is what I referred to and what I was prompting you to move previously. It is now amendment (1).
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       I move opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7696:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       (1) Schedule 1, item 26, page 14 (lines 2 to 6), omit subsection 13(1), substitute:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       (1)
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Governor" rel="nofollow">
                        The Governor
                       </a>
                       -General may terminate the appointment of a member if an address praying for the termination, on one of the following grounds, is presented to the Governor-General by each House of the Parliament in the same session:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       (a) proved misbehaviour;
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       (b) the member is unable to perform the duties of his or her office because of physical or mental incapacity.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This amendment has been revised to reflect some advice we received back from the government about the most appropriate way to deal with the termination of a member but without compromising disability discrimination matters. My original advice, if it please the Senate, was that it was perhaps a bit too late to do this. I did not accept that that was the case, Attorney, and so we have sought through this revision to accept your advice on this point.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This amendment reflects a recommendation contained in the Labor senators' additional comments to the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. It would retain the current arrangements for dismissal of
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
                        AAT
                       </a>
                       members only on the address of each house of parliament, with the change I referred to a moment ago so that we are accommodating changes to disability discrimination matters. The bill would allow dismissal simply by the Governor-General.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Participants in the committee process raised concerns about the new arrangement proposed in the bill. Again, the explanatory memorandum explains that this change is intended to reflect standard practice with other statutory officers. However, this proposed change goes to the independence of the tribunal, which has a role very distinct from many other statutory bodies. No case has been made either in the committee or in this place which would justify departing from the current arrangements in the AAT.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The explanatory memorandum also makes the point that in the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSAT" rel="nofollow">

                       </a>
                       and the

                       </a>
                       removal of members is already by the Governor-General alone. However, as I said, I think in my second reading contribution, Labor believe that the amalgamation should see standards of independence raised across the board where possible and we see no reason to depart from the current practice in the AAT.

                        strongly support this amendment from the opposition. As I said in my second reading contribution, the independence of tribunals across Australia is absolutely fundamental to respect for the rule of law. I think this amendment does enhance the independence and security of tenure of tribunal members for the length of their appointment. I commend the opposition for moving this amendment.

                         This is not controversial. The government supports this amendment, and of course we support the independence of the tribunal. I do not know why Senator Wright raises an issue about this, because I am unaware of any suggestion that the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">

                         or the other merits review tribunals which will be amalgamated with it have ever had their independence compromised. It has never been suggested. Permitting members to be terminated for mental or physical incapacity only on an address by both houses of parliament is the established practice. It is a good practice in the view of the government. I note in passing the submissions of the Law Institute of Victoria and the

                          Labor moves this amendment to deal with the fallout from the government's Freedom of Information Amendment (New Arrangements) Bill 2014, which would abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner and make the AAT the first port of call for those seeking independent review of
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">

                          decisions. We oppose that bill and the crossbench opposes the bill. The government has been unable to explain, in the face of its failure to pass the ill-fated measure from last year's budget, how it will proceed. If the government is happy to undertake now that it will withdraw its freedom of information bill, the need for this amendment will fall way. But whilst the government persists with that bill this amendment is necessary. If the AAT is to be the main jurisdiction for handling FOI appeals, we must support the AAT to develop sufficient expertise, experience and specialisation in handling those matters. This amendment would go some way towards achieving that, though we are clear that the best case scenario is the withdrawal of the freedom of information bill itself.

                           The government is happy to support this amendment. We think it is not strictly necessary. What it does is establish in addition to the six core divisions of the tribunal an additional division dealing with

                           matters. Senator Collins refers to the government's proposal to abolish the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner. Although this is perhaps not the place to have that debate, can I respond to the observation you have made, Senator Collins, by pointing out the anomaly in the existing law that, unlike almost every other area of merits review, there was a double level of merits review in relation to
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">

                           </a>
                           matters. If the government's other legislation would be passed, there would be a single level of merits review, and that merits review would be conducted by the

                           . You propose that there be an FOI division. We would have thought that that could be perfectly well accommodated within the general division of the AAT. Nevertheless, rather than have a fight about it, if you are of the view that there should be an FOI division, as well as the other six divisions, of the AAT, we are happy to support your proposal.

The bill, for no clear reason we can discern, removes the present requirement for the registrar of the court to be appointed on the nomination of the president. This amendment would retain the present arrangement. Again, this amendment goes to the independence of the tribunal and, again, the explanatory memorandum to the bill explains that the nomination requirement in the current

                             Act is not a standard feature of statutory appointments. But, as we say, AAT appointments are not standard statutory appointments. The registrar is tasked by section 24B of the AAT Act with assisting the president in the management of the tribunal. This relationship and, by extension, the position of the president and the independence of the tribunal is protected by the nomination requirement in the act. No compelling reason has been provided for why this practice should be departed from.

                                 These amendments reflect the recommendation contained in the Labor senators' additional comments.

                                 in decisions relating to child support matters. We understand the government's attraction to the simplicity of having just one line of appeal out of the AAT. We see the appeal of simplicity and uniformity, but we do not want litigants or practitioners to be confused by appeal arrangements.

                                 However, we note that the Family Court has raised serious objections to this proposal, which have not been adequately answered by the government—unless, Senator Brandis, they are in the revised explanatory memorandum, which I have not had a chance to address.

                                 rightly notes that it has great expertise in child support matters and is therefore the natural jurisdiction. We are not convinced that this consideration is outweighed by the appeal of simplicity and streamlining. We would hope that the government would be able to come to the review of the amalgamation, which we propose for two years hence, and make a case for this change, if experience shows that it is required at that stage.

                                   The government does not support this amendment, because in our view it is unnecessary and will complicate the system for judicial review of tribunal decisions. The number of appeals heard by the Family Court in child support matters at the moment is very small—not more than about two per year. In practice, almost all child support appeals from the tribunal go to the Federal Circuit Court. Transferring the child support appeals workload to the Federal Court makes sense. These appeals are first and foremost about judicial review of decision making. The Federal Court has expertise in administrative law matters across a wide range of subjects and will capably handle these appeals within its existing resources.

                                   will be free to focus on the more complex and intractable disputes between parties in relation to property and the shared care of children, which is where its core expertise lies.

                                   I suppose this is a question of characterisation: ought this to be characterised as primarily dealing with child support matters or is the task to be characterised as the appropriate application of administrative law principles? We take the view that the appropriate characterisation is the latter, which is why we do not support this amendment. In our view, the amendment would result in child support matters being treated as both family law matters and administrative law matters with appeals available in two superior courts, which also raises the risk of inconsistent treatment of the same subject matter. For the reasons I have outlined, I hope that explains to you, Senator Collins, why the government does not support the amendment you have moved.
