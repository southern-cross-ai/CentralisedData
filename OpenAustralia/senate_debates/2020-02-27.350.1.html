        It is with sadness that I rise tonight to pay tribute to Launceston businessman Anthony Henrikus Montauban, better known as Tony, who died at his riverside home earlier this month. Tony will be sadly missed by his wife, children, stepchildren, grandchildren and his many friends. At his service at Franklin Grove Centre in Youngtown, on 12 February, Tony was remembered as a generous gentleman, mentor and an optimist with a positive outlook that was infectious to anyone around him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony was born in Amersfoort in Holland, on 20 September 1945, the youngest of five children. Tony had minimal English when he came to Tasmania from Holland with his parents, Corrie and Bert, in 1956, and settled in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Town" rel="nofollow">
         Campbell Town
        </a>
        in the Tasmanian Midlands. His difficulty early on in learning English made school challenging, but Tony was determined to get ahead in life. He gained a diploma of building at the technical college that we now know as Queechy High School, and helped build the family home at Riverside.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony worked in the family business with his father and brother and married Jenny, in the late 1960s. The couple became parents to Marc, Clare and Andrew. In the late 1980s, Tony married Jean, extending his family with stepchildren Narelle and Dayle.
       </p>
       <p>
        A street-smart businessman, Tony's passion for the tile industry led him to establish the highly successful Montile business in Launceston, in the early 1970s. Tony was considered a pioneer in the ceramic and tile industry in Tasmania and he grew the business across the state. He was instrumental in the formation of Tile Boutique, a network of 36 tile showrooms spanning the country that together provide customers with access to worldwide tile trends and technology. Tony was also well known for saying, 'Don't chew miss out', the tagline he adopted for his television and radio advertising.
       </p>
       <p>
        Montile gave Tony the opportunity to travel the world, researching new trends and products and meeting new people. His first solo trip to Japan at 28 years of age was the first of many international trips, allow him to develop strong friendships with business acquaintances throughout the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not just a businessman, Tony also loved waterskiing, fishing and farming. He raised goats, sheep, horses, cows, pigs, chickens, cats and dogs on his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Tamar Valley
        </a>
        farm and grew his own fine Tasmanian produce via his vineyard, vegetable gardens, fruit trees and greenhouses. Tony also enjoyed making smallgoods, wine and spirits, with many a visitor to the household enjoying wine, Limoncello, sausages, smoked salmon or gourmet pizza made by Tony's own hand. Nothing made Tony happier then eating a meal that he, or his family, had raised, grown, caught or produced themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony was a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Central Launceston, and previously a member of the Launceston Rotary Club. Tony enjoyed taking part in all Rotary activities, and generously hosted regular fishing weekends at Swanwick, as well as hosting international exchange students who became life-long friends, and often learned skills such as making sausages during their time with him. Tony was actively involved with the Rotary Club of Central Launceston's duck race throughout the 20-plus years it was held, often as organising director and regularly as a major sponsor; raising thousands of dollars for local Tasmanian causes each year. I am pretty sure that there is still a container of plastic coloured ducks at Tony's house waiting to be repurposed. Having also been the duck race director in recent years, I was fortunate to have the benefit of Tony's experience. He offered me advice, counsel and support throughout that process; as well as during my time as president and on the board of the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recognition of Tony's contribution, the Rotary Club of Central Launceston acknowledged him as a Paul Harris Fellow; and more recently presented him with a sapphire pin for his outstanding commitment and contribution to the club, our local community, and to Rotary more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony was always looking at what he could do to give back, or to help others. His community spirit extended beyond Rotary, with Tony regularly sponsoring Launceston's Clifford Craig ball, and cooking pizzas for the Ravenswood Heights Primary School students, amongst many other thingsâ€”all without the need for recognition. The giving was what gave Tony pleasure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony was a true and valued friend, and he will be missed by many throughout the state. I extend my condolences to Jean, his extended family and his friends.
