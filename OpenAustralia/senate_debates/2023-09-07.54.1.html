        I've previously participated in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        Parliamentary Program, which offers members of parliament the opportunity to visit Australian Defence Force units. We reciprocate each year, and this week I have hosted Squadron Leader Kirk Cartwright from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Air Force
        </a>
        , who is in the advisers box today. Before his return to duty, I'd like to share some of his reflections from his time with us:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It would be career limiting not to first express my gratitude to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Vice Chief of the Defence Force
        </a>
        for selecting me for this program.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's been an eye-opening experience, giving me valuable insights into how government operatesâ€”an area I knew little about. I am truly grateful to Senator Colbeck, his support staff, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        team, for your commitment to enriching this experience.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Meeting some of you has been a highlight, and I am inspired by the dedication to your work. The days here are long, and witnessing question time, often thankless. What occurs behind the scenes, however, leaves me with a newfound respect for the effort it takes to exercise our democracy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Tomorrow, I return to my duties with a better appreciation for our system of government and its leaders. The devotion of the parliamentarians and support staff would be evident to anyone given the opportunity to observe you at work.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I hope this program continues to grow, offering more of my colleagues the chance to participate and, in-kind, host you at our operational units.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank Squadron Leader Cartwright for his time. It's been a delight to have him in the office and to learn about what he does. Perhaps it's a bit ironic to have an air crash investigator working in a senator's office, but it has been a good week, and I wish him the best as he continues to progress through his career.
