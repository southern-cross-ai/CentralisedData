        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Cash. Can the minister update the Senate on why the Australian Building and Construction Commission is vital to maintaining the rule of law on Australian building sites?

         I thank Senator Duniam for his question. The reintroduction of the Australian Building and Construction Commission by the Turnbull government is, as we know, working to restore law and order on building sites in Australia. This is despite those on the other side and their masters in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         who fought us every step of the way to try and ensure the CFMEU continued to control the building and construction industry in Australia. I have been overwhelmed by support coming from, in particular, small and medium subcontractors in the building and construction industry, in particular following the Senate last week upholding the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Code" rel="nofollow">
          Building Code
         </a>
         in Australia. Again, this was despite some of the most disgraceful bullying, thuggery and intimidation I have ever seen. I again thank the Nick Xenophon Team,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauline_Hanson's_One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          Pauline Hanson's One Nation
         </a>
         and Senators Hinch, Leyonhjelm, Bernardi and Gichuhi for their support but in particular for throwing their support behind the small and medium subcontractors in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we know, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
          ABCC
         </a>
         is working. It is working to ensure that the lawless action on our building sites by the CFMEU is stopped. All too often what we see in Australia is sites closed down because of action that is taken by the CFMEU. At this point in time, it is a reminder that there are around 93 CFMEU officials before the courts for more than 1,369 suspected contraventions. As we know, in recent years the courts have imposed more than $10 million in fines against the CFMEU. In the words of a Federal Court judge: 'The CFMEU's record of noncompliance with the law is notorious. Their record ought to be an embarrassment to the trade union movement.'

             Australian Labor Party
            </a>
            who have made it very, very clear that if they are ever elected to office again in this country the first thing they will do is abolish the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
             ABCC
            </a>
            and hand over the building and construction sector to the

             CFMEU
            </a>
            . So to all of those mum and dad subcontractors out there, to all of those small and medium businesses, which we on this side of the chamber will back every single day of the week: be very, very careful, because the jobs that you have will be gone under those on the other side.
           </p>
           <p>
            In 2012, when the ABCC was first abolished, what happened to disputes in the construction sector? They increased against the national average, which was decreasing. What happened to the cost of national infrastructure? It increased by up to 30 per cent. What's more, the fines against the CFMEU were substantially reduced, making them merely the cost of doing business.

There are nearly 350,000 small businesses involved in the building industry, with 98 per cent of all of these businesses employing fewer than 20 employees. Our construction industry builds offices, apartments, roads, shopping centres, hospitals, universities, schools, airports—the infrastructure that we as Australians rely on every single day of the week. This industry is far too important to all of us in Australia for it to be handed back to the lawless
