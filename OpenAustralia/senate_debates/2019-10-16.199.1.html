         I'll be resigning from the Senate in mid-November after eight years in this chamber and four decades in and around politics and government. It has been a privilege to serve. I love this place and all that it stands for. I did not grow up thinking I'd become a politician. I've always been an avid follower of news, current affairs and politics. I studied economics to learn how the world works. I joined the Public Service to apply those principles to real world problems. I joined

        <p>
         I returned to Treasury in 1989, when he lost the leadership, but I came back in 1995, when he became opposition leader again. His career is testament to the benefits of recycling! I stayed with him until 2006, serving for nine years as prime ministerial chief of staff. When I left in 2006, I thought I was done with politics—been there, done that, the whole shebang!—but

My wife, Elizabeth, was cautious at first but backed me, encouraging me to have a go, for which I will always be grateful. I have more about her later. Thank you to Marise and Connie for escorting me into the chamber that October in 2011. Well done, Marise, our first female defence minister, who is doing a sterling job in foreign affairs. Connie remains a good friend, and I think she did an outstanding job as our Pacific minister.

         But the best part of my job has been to meet so many of my fellow Australians from different parts of this great continent. Whatever our race, colour or creed, we are bound together by our good fortune in being born here or making the brave decision to forsake ancestral homes and settle
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Down_Under" rel="nofollow">
          Down Under
         </a>
         , the best country in the world. For me, Australia is an immigrant nation. It is in our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA" rel="nofollow">
          DNA
         </a>
         . So too is our unique Indigenous heritage, with over 65,000 years of ongoing relationship with the land. This is a big country worthy of big ambitions. We should be infinitely optimistic about the possibilities that lie before us. Australia's best days lie ahead. We owe it to ourselves and to the world to make the most of our stewardship of this place. We are and should always be a beacon of hope to the rest of the world. For me the Australian way is to live and let live, engage in fair play and leave no-one behind.
        </p>
        <p>
         We owe a special obligation to the minorities in our midst. These are the quiet Australians who need our help most. That includes
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , who seek more control over policies implemented in their name; disabled Australians, who want to be defined by their potential and not their disability; and those other marginalised Australians looking for gainful employment and social acceptance. The test of being an Australian is not genealogy but whether we adhere to timeless values that make our democracy work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Politics is a noble calling, a vocation that puts the community and its aspirations before our own, and this parliament, as I said in my maiden speech, is still the pinnacle of the Australian achievement. Our liberal democracy, with the rule of law, an independent judiciary, English as our national language and our free press—all of these things have helped to sustain our prosperity and social harmony. Institutions matter. Respect for tradition and conventions matters, particularly in this age of disruption—technological, political and cultural. My brand of liberalism seeks to conserve the best of the past while adapting to the future. It is constructive progress and not change for change's sake.
        </p>
        <p>
         And how rapidly the world around us is changing! Trust in our established institutions, such as politics, business, the churches and the media, has been weakened, and there is a palpable anger in so much of the public discourse. Democracy is increasingly questioned. There is a reheated romance in some quarters with old-fashioned socialism, and one person's push for diversity and inclusion is another person's divisive identity politics. We complain of a lack of privacy and in the same breath gladly surrender so much of our personal information to vast platforms and networks. Our data is being monetised to create new goods and services to our benefit but not necessarily always with our knowledge. These platforms have also created new possibilities for control and intimidation of citizens. Information is being fragmented and weaponised. The broadcast media is increasingly polarised and politicised, and the proliferation of media outlets means that people can select their news and facts to suit their own preconceptions and biases. The universities, hitherto bastions of free speech, are under attack from within and from outside. The scientific method is under attack, even as we benefit daily from the fruits of rigorous, evidence based inquiry. If we cannot even agree on basic facts, how can we have a civilised discourse? Look at the climate change debate. In the age of Twitter, the court of public opinion can be quickly turned into a kangaroo court, and natural justice runs a poor second. Intuitive responses are preferred to mature reflection.
        </p>
        <p>
         The liberal democracies are open societies. That is our strength and vulnerability. We cannot meet threats to our democratic institutions by adopting the tactics of authoritarian regimes. That undermines our fundamental values and beliefs. Our role in this place is to stand up and defend those beliefs and to remind successive generations of the price that has been paid to build the democratic institutions that we enjoy today. As a liberal, for me first and foremost that means upholding the sanctity and freedom of the individual and her or his capacity to exercise responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
         The role of government is to preserve and, where possible, extend the domain of human freedom and opportunity. Freedom is right and freedom works. The success of the Australian economy over the last three decades is no accident of resource endowment or geography. It is overwhelmingly a testament to the benefits of economic freedom. The opening up of the Australian economy to market forces has not been easy. Along the way, there have been winners and losers, but the benefits are overwhelmingly positive. We are bigger, stronger and more resilient to external shocks. Look at how we dealt with the Asian financial crisis and absorbed the resources boom and its aftermath. There has been no repeat of the stop-start policies of the eighties and nineties, when inflation was snuffed out through swingeing increases in interest rates, precipitating major economic downturns.
        </p>
        <p>
         The productivity impulse generated by earlier reform programs has ebbed in recent years. Reform is a journey, not an endpoint. We need to double our rate of productivity growth to maintain the average income growth of recent decades. That will require more freedom and more investment—public and private, domestic and foreign. The world is awash with savings looking for a home. Improving investment returns will require more focus on science and innovation, to build new industries and jobs; ongoing action to reduce the costs of doing business, including streamlined regulation; and, in the absence of lower company taxes, other investment incentives as foreshadowed by the Treasurer.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ben Morton's deregulation agenda should encompass not only paperwork and process but structural impediments to competition, innovation and growth. The Australian economy needs more competition. Governments should be removing barriers to entry and policies that benefit large incumbents. That's why I support consumer data rights and open banking, and the possible extensions of that to telcos and energy companies. That's why I think differences in the capital treatment of large and small banks should also be ironed out to create a more level playing field.
        </p>
        <p>
         The compulsory super system should also be as open and competitive as possible. We need to tackle the structural causes of high fees and address the fate of low-income earners who accumulate balances that are largely eaten up by fees. The income threshold at which compulsory super cuts in has been the same since the super guarantee was introduced in 1992.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know this caused us grief at the time, but I strongly support the changes to super that we made in our 2016 budget. They were necessary to create more equity in the system going forward. We could not preach expenditure restraint to the public at large while protecting concessions that largely benefited only a few. I applaud the policy courage of the then Treasurer, who is now our Prime Minister, and of the continuing finance minister, in prosecuting the case. The focus of the review should be on structural changes to address the ageing of our population and not short-term revenue-raising.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister is right to pursue mutually beneficial evidence based reform of industrial relations that does not undermine terms and conditions. The world of work is changing around us. Flexible workplaces, digitally enabled, are the way of the future. New types of jobs are being created. Learning is lifelong, and the pace of change is throwing up opportunities in the new services economy. I am very optimistic about the net jobs benefits of automation, which will free up workers for higher level tasks. Machines should do machine work, not people. History demonstrates the benefits of technological change. We don't need a universal basic income, but governments creating opportunity for workers to acquire the skills to embrace this new world and the dignity of work. If we prepare properly, we can become empowered and confident to embrace new technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government's skills agenda is central to this process. We can imagine the jobs of the future using tools like Faethm, an Australian company. Michael Priddis and his colleagues have created a powerful tool to analyse the impact of automation on jobs, companies, industries and entire economies. Their platform is an essential planning tool that other governments are using to guide policy development. We should too.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am passionate about the role of government in catalysing new industry development to capitalise on emerging technological trends. I was proud to initiate the review of Australia's space industry capability and to appoint

         recently announced overseas will encourage Australian companies to become part of the supply chains for new space ventures.
        </p>
        <p>
         The cyber sector is also one of great potential for Australia. I believe we can be a world leader. AustCyber, under
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Price" rel="nofollow">
          Michelle Price
         </a>
         , is doing a great job in tackling impediments to that development. On my watch, the Commonwealth supported another Michelle, Michelle Simmons, a former Australian of the Year, by providing funds into the joint public-private venture that is working on a functional quantum computer, the next frontier in revolutionising computing capacity. The point of doing this sort of stuff at the government level is to help Australian industries get in on the ground floor of new developments. That's when you can create a world-leading edge—and that's very important going forward.
        </p>
        <p>
         Embracing alternative energy sources such as renewables is an opportunity rather than a cost. The transition in the energy system cannot be reversed, and technology is constantly evolving to create appropriate firming and backup that is essential to avoiding volatility as more renewables enter the power grid. I am optimistic that new technologies will keep reducing the cost of energy and lowering greenhouse gas emissions. We should keep our options open on nuclear energy, but that raises a host of broader issues I dare not go into here. I am proud of what the

        <p>
         When it comes to climate change, policymakers have to act on the basis of the best scientific evidence available. We rely on the intelligence agencies to give us their best advice on security threats; of course, final decisions always rest with us as the elected representatives. The same model should apply to climate matters and almost everything else impinging on our health and the natural world. I once tried to get Senator Roberts together with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
          CSIRO
         </a>
         to have a debate about climate change. We had, I think, about two or three meetings, Senator Roberts, and I think the CSIRO scientists are still in rehab recovering from those meetings! That was part of what I thought was important in my role as science minister—to get people together and actually talk about these things and try to find common ground where possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         I enjoyed the role of Cabinet Secretary. I dealt across the breadth of executive government and had the opportunity to contribute across all portfolio areas. I had no personal agenda or axes to grind. My interest was in good process as a basis for good policy and ensuring that the cabinet agenda reflected the government's overall aims and objectives. The aim was to ensure that the facts and subsidiary issues had been sorted out so that the cabinet only needed to focus on the major decisions required. A well-functioning cabinet is at the core of good government. Prime ministers must give their colleagues the full opportunity to have their say and sum up fairly and comprehensively the mood of the meeting. That is the best guarantee that ministers will respect the process and observe cabinet confidentiality, without which there can be no frank and free exchange of ideas and advice. One of the things I noticed, working both in the Prime Minister's office and in the cabinet, is that in our system prime ministers can have a lot of power because they can determine not only who gets into cabinet but also what the agenda is. We need a system of collective decision-making because a team approach is always better than a one-man-band approach.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank the many public servants I've worked with over the years—most recently, the secretaries and deputy secretaries, principally Martin Parkinson, who I've known for over 30 years;

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">
          APS
         </a>
         is more important than ever. I hope the Thodey review of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Public Service
         </a>
         sets the scene for continued investment in capability and there is more focus on working across the silos and engaging in scenario planning on major cross-portfolio issues like the ageing of the population. How's that for a bit of jargon!
        </p>
        <p>
         The Turnbull government's development of City Deals is something I was particularly keen to support because I believe it will revolutionise how the three tiers of government cooperate to develop coherent infrastructure and planning policies to maximise the prospects of cities and regions. I remain a believer in a bigger Australia. I support the proposed population planning framework—Tudgey has gone now, but the PM's here; welcome, PM—to coordinate state and federal infrastructure and other services with our immigration and settlement policies. Allied with our initiatives for fast transport links with the regions, this can give substance to decentralisation policies and improve housing affordability.
        </p>
        <p>
         Governments have an important influence on the economics of regions. In some cases it's about how we keep existing regional industries going; in others, it's about how we facilitate transition. As industry minister, I worked closely with South Australia and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rowan_Ramsey" rel="nofollow">
          Rowan Ramsey
         </a>
         , the local member, to find a buyer for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whyalla_Steelworks" rel="nofollow">
          Whyalla Steelworks
         </a>
         . There were no short- or medium-term alternatives to provide a jobs hub for the region. I'm pleased that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFG" rel="nofollow">
          GFG
         </a>
         Alliance stepped up to give Whyalla a new start.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both in the Howard era and as patron senator for the Hunter, I was privileged to participate in efforts to redevelop the region after the closure of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
          BHP
         </a>
         steelworks. Once the region processed the closure of the steelworks and was ready to move on, there was an opportunity to focus on building on areas of comparative advantage to create new industries. This was facilitated by the adoption of what's called a smart specialisation strategy and utilising the firepower of that great regional university the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle" rel="nofollow">
          University of Newcastle
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Reflecting on my time in the industry portfolio, there are just three issues I want to call out. We must keep up the pressure for more collaboration between the knowledge creators and industry to maximise the commercialisation of domestic ideas. I laud what we've done on industry growth centres, our reform of research block grant funding arrangements and the development of innovation precincts. We should build out the ecosystem, as the Canadians have done with their
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MaRS_Discovery_District" rel="nofollow">
          MaRS Discovery District
         </a>
         , so we can fuel the growth of Australian based unicorns serving global markets.
        </p>

         My second point is that I support big science—that is, capital facilities that allow Australian researchers to do leading-edge research here and to be preferred partners for international researchers. Blue-sky research, or what we used to call fundamental or basic research, is not only vital in itself; it's the foundation of so many great inventions and innovations. With my good friend Senator Birmingham, I developed a road map for funding such infrastructure. While I'm on the subject of Senator Birmingham, I thank him for his policy courage in the education portfolio. He reformed child care. What he did on school funding was hard, and I know we had to make compromises along the way, but he set out a framework to clean up the sector. Well done, Simon.
        </p>
        <p>
         I signed off on our $129 million 10-year big science strategic partnership with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Southern_Observatory" rel="nofollow">
          European Southern Observatory
         </a>
         to secure the future of optical astronomy. That was a down payment on the agenda of looking after research infrastructure. I was also gratified that, by the end of 2017, resourcing the next iteration of high performance computers was agreed.
        </p>
        <p>
         My third point on industry is very straightforward. I'm a strong proponent of strategic government procurement in industry development. The best example I can think of is what we've done with the creation of the defence industry portfolio. It will encourage domestic spin-offs from our record defence spending to help create sovereign industry capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The rise of an assertive and powerful new superpower, China, is challenging the liberal order built up painstakingly over 70 years. Now is not the time to retreat from that order or for nations to practice beggar-thy-neighbour policies. We have all gained immeasurably from the peace and globalisation of trade and investment that has resulted from the international rules based order. The liberal West must be united in resolute defence of the decent, humane universal values that underpin that order and continue to find ways to deepen China's engagement and commitment to that order. The world needs a strong and prosperous China that has a meaningful stake in the existing order.
        </p>
        <p>
         The lesson we should take from history is not the winner-take-all approach of Versailles in 1919 but the generosity of the postwar 1945 settlement, when the United States led the creation of a new order encompassing allies and former enemies. It was one of the most generous acts of enlightened self-interest in recorded history. But if I can paraphrase

         , I think we should maybe 'talk softly but carry a big stick'. As a country we must keep building up our military capability and continue to strengthen our core alliance with the United States and our strategic partnerships in the Indo-Pacific.

         We can be very confident about our ability to punch above our weight internationally in pursuit of our national interest. The resuscitation of the Trans-Pacific Partnership minus the

         I want to thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to continue to serve this great country. The celebrated election win was, in my view, no accident. It was the product of a lot of hard work and campaigning experience by a leader who is probably the most complete politician of his generation. I want to thank John Howard for being the best boss ever. When I left in 2006 I respected him even more than at the beginning, not only as a reformer but also as a role model in all ways.

         branch of the Liberal Party. I know this branch sometimes gets bad press but, I have to say, I've been struck by a number of things. The first thing is that when you join a party your obligation is to uphold its name and live up to its ideals. It's not a vehicle for personal ambition but a movement for the advancement of the community. As elected representatives we have to keep faith with our lay members and volunteers, because, overwhelmingly, in dealing with the New South Wales branch, what I've found is people who seek nothing for themselves but everything for their country and their party. They are the decent backbone of this country.

          I rise to pay tribute to our good friend and valued colleague Senator the Hon.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Sinodinos" rel="nofollow">
           Arthur Sinodinos
          </a>
          . Arthur has provided outstanding public service to Australia for about four decades. He's now preparing to take on his next assignment for Australia, to represent our country with our most significant friend, ally and economic partner, the United States.
         </p>
         <p>
          Over the past 40 years, the last eight years as a senator for the great state of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          , Arthur has served our country and, for most of that period, our Liberal cause with dedication, commitment and great distinction. When he entered the Senate in 2011, replacing
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Coonan" rel="nofollow">
           Helen Coonan
          </a>
          , as a senator for New South Wales Arthur was already a formidable presence of long standing in coalition circles. He was a giant of our Liberal cause already. He clearly stood out from other first-term politicians with his strong reputation as a respected political and policy contributor preceding him.
         </p>
         <p>
          Arthur's rise began in earnest in 1987 when he took the position of senior economic adviser to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
           John Howard
          </a>
          , then the federal Leader of the Opposition and to become our longest-serving recent Liberal Prime Minister—and I would argue certainly one of our greatest Liberal prime ministers and our greatest prime ministers of Australia ever. It was that initial two-year stint which laid the foundation for Arthur's incredible distinguished career of service to our country and the Liberal cause so far. In 1995 he returned to John Howard's office. Within two years he was appointed as his chief of staff. As a close confidant to the Prime Minister he was widely recognised as one of the most influential contributors in Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          When Arthur entered this chamber eight years ago it marked the return of an extremely skilled operator, and one of our best policy brains, to the coalition ranks. In opposition Arthur played a key role in developing the policies that drove the coalition to victory at the 2013 election. He chaired the coalition's deregulation task force to cut government red and green tape, which led to significant reform, reducing the cost of doing business in Australia after our election to government in September 2013.
         </p>
         <p>
          As Assistant Treasurer in the Abbott government he invested his significant expertise on economic and fiscal policy matters to help the new government build and foster a stronger and stable economy. As
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary" rel="nofollow">
           Cabinet Secretary
          </a>
          in the Turnbull government he provided significant strategic advice at the heart of the government while ensuring that all the important processes of government ran smoothly and that all the different policy perspectives on different issues had been appropriately heard and considered before a decision was made.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 2017 Arthur became the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science, and later that year it was Arthur who led the charge and who put Australia onto the path towards the establishment of a national space agency, and as he indicated in his remarks it was announced soon thereafter. Recent announcements of further investment in our space industry underscore the importance of Arthur's vision for space exploration. When Arthur delivered his first speech he described John Howard as:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … a fighter who was prepared the knocks to take for what he believed, pick himself up and keep going.
         </p>
         <p>
          Arthur has emulated his distinguished former boss in many ways, but it was in his private life that Arthur was forced to really channel this fighting spirit when in 2017 he was diagnosed with cancer and forced to take leave to get well again. It was so good to see Arthur return to the Senate in good health, after his tough 18-month battle, cancer-free, and just in time to help us win the 2019 election. Talk about a fighting spirit! As Arthur embraced the survivorship phase of his battle with cancer earlier this year, he fittingly announced government funding for services at Sydney Cancer Centre, a facility of Chris O'Brien Lifehouse.
         </p>
         <p>
          Politics is about helping people and improving lives. Arthur's altruistic nature is not just confined to politics. He has been a member of a wide range of pro bono boards, including the Mary MacKillop Foundation, the Aboriginal Employment Strategy and the Australian Institute of Management. He is, of course, a proud Australian of Greek heritage and has always been active in the local Greek community here in Australia. It was the combination of his strong community involvement, his public service to our nation and his contribution to the development of economic policy and reform which saw him recognised through his appointment as an
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Officer of the Order of Australia
          </a>
          in 2008.
         </p>
         <p>
          Arthur has forged an incredibly impressive career and, unsurprisingly, there is more to come. Through his longstanding and very senior contribution to our country, from the back room to the front line of politics, Arthur is the perfect fit to pick up from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
           Joe Hockey
          </a>
          as our top international envoy. As our next ambassador to the United States, Arthur goes to Washington at a pivotal time in our deep and enduring relationship with America. As we have recently celebrated 100 years of mateship between our countries, Arthur will help us lay the foundations for the next 100 years.
         </p>
         <p>
          Arthur, we wish you well as you depart this place for the international stage, and we know you will represent Australia's interests with distinction, as you always have. In your first speech, in 2011, you said that you hoped to be able to look back on your career and say that, in a small way, you helped make the best country in the world even better—something that you also referenced today in your remarks. Australia is in a much better and stronger position today, and Australians have better opportunities to get ahead today because of the contribution that you have made so far. And, of course, there is more to come. Our country is fortunate to retain your services in Washington. On behalf of the coalition team in the Senate, we wish you all the very best in your future endeavours and, in particular, in taking on the responsibilities as our ambassador to the United States. Thank you for your service so far.

          <p>
           I rise on behalf of the opposition to acknowledge the valedictory remarks of Senator the Hon.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Sinodinos" rel="nofollow">
            Arthur Sinodinos
           </a>
           AO and to reflect on his career. At the outset, I express the regret of Senator Wong that she could not be here to deliver these remarks. She absolutely wanted to do that personally. I may lack Senator Wong's gravitas, but I'll give it my best shot anyway.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Sinodinos has had a career spent substantially in public service. He was a Treasury officer, he served as chief of staff to Prime Minister
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
            John Howard
           </a>
           for a decade, he has served as a senator since 2011 and he will serve as Australia's next ambassador to the United States of America. Public service is, indeed, a noble calling. Unlike our leader, Senator Wong, Senator Arthur Sinodinos was born in Australia. But, like many others in this place, they share a great pride in their multicultural heritage. That the son of a merchant mariner, who was also a lifelong member of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seamen's_Union_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Seamen's Union of Australia
           </a>
           , and a part-time seamstress, both of whom were Greek migrants, could take a seat in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Senate
           </a>
           says much about our country.
          </p>
          <p>
           In his first speech, in 2011, Senator Sinodinos correctly identified the enabling power of education and its importance in ensuring that our children grow up with a global outlook. This remains as relevant as ever today. As a minister, Senator Sinodinos often actually answered the question. This, we believe, is an example that others can learn from. In 2014, after a typically unproductive series of exchanges with Senator Cormann, Senator Wong did make this point in an estimates hearing:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           It was so much better when Senator Sinodinos was here. Notwithstanding the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
            ICAC
           </a>
           problem, as least we got questions up. Can we bring back Arthur—even if he is conflicted?
          </p>
          <p>
           On another occasion, in 2015, Senator Wong asked:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Can we have Arthur Sinodinos back? It was more fun.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Cormann had refused to answer that question too!
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that Senator Sinodinos has confronted significant personal health challenges in recent times. It is a reminder to us all to keep our work and conflict here in perspective. It is a tribute to his determination and tenacity that he not only returned to the Senate but now prepares to undertake a new and demanding role.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Sinodinos and Senator Wong also sat next to each other on the election-night panel on ABC television this year. It is fair to say that he probably had a more enjoyable night than she did! But Senator Wong—and she particularly wanted me to emphasise this point—would like to acknowledge and thank you, publicly, for the gracious way you conducted yourself that night, a difficult night for those of us in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           . Many others would have been much quicker to gloat in victory—but Senator Sinodinos did not, reflecting much about his character.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, Senator Sinodinos and Senator Wong have not had a completely deferential relationship. It would be accurate to say that, during the life of the Abbott government, Senator Sinodinos came under sustained attack from the opposition in connection with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           Independent Commission Against Corruption. It was not always smooth sailing. In March 2014, the opposition spent the best part of a morning attempting to require Senator Sinodinos to make a statement to the chamber, only to have the motion fail. I'm confident that his colleagues are very grateful for the practice the opposition got in these circumstances, which has enabled us to refine our approach and achieve a greater degree of success on subsequent occasions with other ministers. Whilst the opposition will never shy away from applying appropriate parliamentary scrutiny where necessary, I'm sure Senator Sinodinos will be very happy if he is never again asked to remember anything to do with Australian Water Holdings.
          </p>

           Senator Sinodinos will take up leadership in one of our most significant and consequential overseas posts—our embassy in the United States of America. The relationship with the United States has been one of the central pillars of Australian foreign policy since the

           is one of Australia's closest friends and staunchest allies, and the enduring nature of the alliance between our countries reflects the fact that we have shared histories, interests and values—values like democracy and freedom, and respect for the rule of law. Both countries benefit from the relationship, which has succeeded and deepened over many decades under the leadership of both major parties in both countries. Senator Sinodinos will join a distinguished lineage of occupants of the post of ambassador which includes

          <p>
           Of course, the closeness of our alliance does not mean that we will always agree with every aspect of American policy. One of the challenges Senator Sinodinos will face is communicating Australia's position respectfully but clearly when policies are introduced that we do not think are in Australia's best interests. Of critical importance for Senator Sinodinos will be developing, maintaining and strengthening relationships across different branches and levels of government. Whilst much of the public focus is on the presidency and our relations with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">
            White House
           </a>
           , this cannot be the sole point of connection. There is also vital cooperation on counterterrorism and defence. Often overlooked is the work our diplomats do to engage and build networks within the United States congress, which is critical if we are to advance crucial interests on matters such as trade and investment. So, too, are direct relationships at state level often bypassed in conversations about the alliance, yet there are great opportunities for Australia that can be harnessed through meaningful engagement at this level.

           Senator Arthur Sinodinos has confronted political and personal adversity during his time as a senator. Throughout this, he was anchored by personal convictions, shaped by values, character and belief. Senator Wong reflected on the fact that he has been a worthy opponent and a respected colleague. The opposition thanks Senator Arthur Sinodinos for his service in this Senate, and wishes him well as the principal representative of Australia in the United States.

            I'm going to take this opportunity—a rare opportunity from the chair—to make some comments following Senator Sinodinos's valedictory speech. I'd like to reiterate everything Senator Cormann said on behalf of the government and the Liberal Party, and add a few of my own observations from working so closely with Arthur.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those of us who remember the years before 1996 and the early days of the Howard government—even at a very young level—Arthur is a giant. He took over his role as chief of staff there in difficult days. He mentioned his offsider, Tony Nutt. They formed a duo that is probably the best political staffing combination that this building has seen. Arthur was always present for key decisions, rarely sought attention and rarely sought credit but was always integral to so many of the successes of that government.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I'd like to talk about Arthur the person. Arthur's capability and the confidence he inspired in people was demonstrated by the address he just gave, one that not many of us could necessarily make upon our valedictory. Working with Arthur was always one of learning the importance of politeness, of being open-minded and of humility, and how that can inspire confidence in people around you and in the people who work for you. The inflamed rhetoric that occasionally takes over modern politics is not for Arthur; it is always the reason, the idea and treating people well.
           </p>
           <p>
            I was privileged to serve as parliamentary secretary. It was actually a job I requested at the time. We shared a lot. I gained a lot more than I think I contributed, and I learned a great deal by working with him. He's always been open to ideas. He's always been offering very helpful advice, including to some of us who might be occasionally young and impulsive or a little bit passionate about things. But the advice and the way in which he worked with others is an exemplar to all of us in this building.
           </p>
           <p>
            Arthur and I also shared some health challenges at around a similar time. Mine was serious but not as challenging or as critical as Arthur's. The way he kept in contact with me and the way he came through that is a testament to the character of the person. The speech Arthur just gave encapsulates what drove so many of us into politics in the 1990s and what we aspired to do—the values, the commitment to open minds, the commitment to the greater good and, most importantly, the commitment to share and ensure that others enjoy the opportunities that he so proudly outlines he has had. Arthur's departure is a loss to this parliament but, proudly, not a loss to the people of Australia through the office he is going to serve now at a very important time. We are fortunate to have worked together, I am fortunate to have worked with him and I am fortunate to call him a friend.

             on the astounding contribution he has made to our great nation through his service in this place both as a staff member and as a senator and to lament his leaving. It isn't a stretch to call Senator Sinodinos a great Australian. He served for nine years as chief of staff to the great
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
              John Howard
             </a>
             , prosecuting the reform agenda that helped to insulate Australia from the global financial crisis. But not content to leave his contribution to our country at that, he was then appointed to the Senate to replace another great senator, Senator
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Coonan" rel="nofollow">
              Helen Coonan
             </a>
             . Since then, Senator Sinodinos has provided leadership, sage advice and intelligence to all of us on this side of parliament. He has certainly treated us in the Nationals as part of that team.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Sinodinos, though a Liberal, is a staunch coalitionist and has almost always been a friend to the Nationals. We on the conservative side of politics will be forever grateful for the senator's policy acumen and practical political skills. No-one brings policy and politics together quite like Senator Sinodinos. In fact, he wrote the rulebook for that marriage for the Howard government. The synthesis of these two attributes has also contributed strongly to the longstanding coalition between the Nationals and the Liberals. For example, my former boss Senator Ron Boswell, a great friend and an absolutely genuine and hardworking advocate for the bush, would often drop by the Prime Minister's office unannounced and felt absolutely comfortable doing so. However, when the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
              PM
             </a>
             wasn't available, which wasn't surprising, Senator Sinodinos would graciously meet Ron and faithfully pass on the nature of the discussions to the PM—particularly, at that point in time, on Telstra, which was the subject of numerous robust discussions. This was a policy area of particular interest to Senator Boswell, and Senator Sinodinos used his ministerial positions once he joined the Senate to the betterment of Australia—as Assistant Treasurer, as
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_Secretary" rel="nofollow">
              Cabinet Secretary
             </a>
             and as Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science. And I note what he's done for the nuclear industry at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Heights" rel="nofollow">
              Lucas Heights
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             As the senator said in his maiden speech:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Observing John Howard convinced me that politics is not worth a candle unless you are fighting for something.
            </p>
            <p>
             These words resonate with all of us in the Nats, because that's why we are here. We're here to fight rural and regional Australia. People like me and my colleagues, who live and work and raise families in rural and regional Australia, deserve the same opportunities and prosperity as others. So we need to take a leaf out of Senator Sinodinos's book and work the politics and the policy to deliver for the people we represent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Senator Sinodinos's term hasn't always been plain sailing, and we acknowledge the quiet dignity that he took in 2017, stepping back from his ministerial duties and ultimately the parliament to concentrate on his health. His approach to his leukaemia diagnosis was the same as his approach to solving policy and political conundrums—no fanfare, instead discreet and humble determination. These must have been troubling times for the senator and his family, and both sides of the chamber were very relieved and pleased to see him return. Since then, the senator's advocacy for others who experience leukaemia is an absolute inspiration. He is a living and breathing demonstration that cancer doesn't always win.
            </p>
            <p>
             The next chapter of his service to Australia will take place in Washington rather than Canberra. While we will miss him in this place, his appointment as the next Australian Ambassador to the United States means he won't be lost to public life and public service. I sincerely thank Senator Sinodinos for his service here as a senator, a minister, a coalition partner and a friend to the Nationals. Australia and our closest strategic ally are both looking forward to your next chapter. All the best.

              It is a great honour, indeed, to take a few moments of the Senate's time to reflect on a great man—one of the greatest sons of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
               New South Wales
              </a>
              division of the Liberal Party and a really amazing supporter of other people—Senator Sinodinos. I know that this evening people have reflected, rightly, on Senator Sinodinos's professional career and his enormous contribution to our country as a patriot. I want to mainly spend this time on the personal side. Yes, Senator Sinodinos served for 10 years as
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
               John Howard
              </a>
              's chief of staff. Yes, he was a cabinet minister. Yes, he will be a great ambassador. Yes, he's been a president of the New South Wales division. Perhaps the greatest thing he's achieved professionally has been to win the universal respect of the New South Wales division of the Liberal Party—no mean feat!
             </p>
             <p>
              Senator Sinodinos has a particular form of liberalism which I think is compelling, and it is, as he described it in his own words, 'Live and let live.' Very much I think that is a good approach. But it's more than just live and let live. Forged from his economic training as a brilliant Treasury economist, he knows that you can't do anything as a country unless you secure the economic footing, and I think that has been reflected in all of the contributions that the senator has made. Even in his valedictory speech, he was still making the case, still presenting new economic ideas, still seeing that as the foundation for the success of our nation.
             </p>
             <p>
              I have done some digging around for these remarks, and I can reveal that, as a young boy in Newcastle, the senator was interested in playing war games and toy soldiers—there you go! Of course, he's also a very proud member of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Australian" rel="nofollow">
               Greek Australian
              </a>
              community. His antecedents came from Cephalonia, and he's maintained a very strong link to the Sydney Greek community.
             </p>
             <p>
              I just want to say, briefly, something on the personal side. It is sometimes a difficult thing to get into this business. As a new person in this place, I can say that no-one helped me more on the pastoral side than Senator Sinodinos. Whether it was writing a reference or giving me a call or seeing how I was going, he was always there for me. Every significant event I've held, as far as I can remember, Senator Sinodinos has been there for me, because he's always supported other people. It has been a selfless journey, and I think there is so much we can learn from his career of service at the Treasury, as chief of staff, as a minister and so much more to come. I'm so much looking forward to your contribution in Washington. Thank you very much.
