        The Leader of the Opposition,

        , just says no to everything and goes down the political path of fear and division because it's all he knows. The Albanese government is getting on with historic reforms to make our country fairer and stronger. These reforms include wage increases for people on the minimum wage and aged care workers; tripling the bulk-billing incentives to save people money when they visit their

        Unfortunately, we expect that, as usual, Mr Dutton and the opposition will come to Canberra with one word—no—and one setting: anger. That is to be expected. We know the calibre of Mr Dutton. He's the man who vilifies the most marginalised in this country, the man who boycotted the apology to the stolen generation, the man who said his Labor opponent was using her disability as an excuse and the man who joked about sea-level rises in the Pacific. This is the opposition leader. As a government we are working responsibly to take pressure off families and to deliver better wages and conditions for working Australians. The opposition offer nothing positive, just delay and division, which is sad because the Australian people deserve so much better from the opposition.
