         I thank Senator Reynolds for her very important question. Prior to the week before last, my department did have existing rehabilitation arrangements. It was my very strong view that they were not sufficient, and we have moved to address that. In Brisbane, on 12 September, I announced a trial program involving 50 wounded, injured and ill former Defence personnel who we are going to match with employers as part of a short-term trial—hopefully with some long-term outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The gap in the rehabilitation services that we had been providing was that whilst we had been doing all those things, including training, there had not been sufficient work put into matching potential employers with potential employees—the wounded, injured and ill. This trial sets out to match the requirements of the wounded, injured and ill personnel and the needs of employers so that the department can understand the needs of the Defence personnel and also of the employers.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was joined at the launch by 'Terry', who said this: 'I feel honoured to be part of this employment assistance initiative announcement. Completing a program and getting a permanent job at

         has changed my life. Before I joined Downer, I was a heavy vehicle mechanic in the Army for 17 years. I got injured and I could not do my job properly. Being forced to leave a job that I loved, and one that I thought I would spend the rest of my working days in was a life-changing moment. I felt very down and had the feeling that I had failed myself because I had not fulfilled my goals within the Army. I really enjoy my job at Downer at the moment—

           I thank the senator again. I will finish off that quote from Terry—

          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Cameron might be interested in hearing it. Terry said: 'I really enjoy my job at Downer at the moment. I find it stressful at times but it really is rewarding. I really think other injured soldiers should get out there and give it a go with this new program and try to get the most out of it.'
          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to Senator Reynolds' question, it seems remarkable to me that those who were transitioning out of Defence could not be contacted by my department unless they actually lodged a claim. Ridiculous! Privacy laws precluded that. So I worked with the department, and the secretary will now write to every transitioning member telling them exactly what the department offers and, just as importantly, telling their families what the department offers. It has filled a massive gap, and ex-service personnel or those transitioning deserve to know what is available.

             I thank Senator Reynolds, who of course has a very personal interest in this matter. The department recently did some work, and we were concerned to find that many transitioning members did not understand what was available to them. We are addressing that by way of a letter via the

             video which talks about some of the initiatives that are there. This government is absolutely serious about tackling mental health issues. We have a number of programs that I have actually implemented now—

             . The one thing that Senator Lambie has got to learn is that using the suicides of ex-personnel has got to be done very, very, very carefully. I have heard Senator Lambie make allegations that the department is covering up about those people. We most certainly are not and I emphatically reject it.
