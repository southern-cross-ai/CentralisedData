         This is a crisis that continues to shock and appal the international community.

         estimates that more than 10,000 lives have been lost since March last year. The Assad regime continues to ignore its obligations under the six-point peace plan of the UN and

          The Senate
         </a>
         will recall that the essence of the peace plan is a ceasefire and a political dialogue. Syria's downing three days ago of a Turkish military aircraft reinforces the regime's willingness to provoke the international community. It is imperative that we intensify pressure on Damascus to stop a slow descent into civil war.

         Australia continues to urge the UN
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Security Council
         </a>
         to consider chapter VII action and impose international legally binding sanctions. Until this can be agreed by the Security Council, countries like Australia must do all we can through autonomous means. This week I announced a significant expansion of Australia's sanctions. These measures will restrict dealings with Syria's oil and petroleum and with the financial sectors, restrict trade in luxury goods, precious metals and gems, and restrict trade in equipment intended for monitoring or intercepting communications. We already impose an arms embargo. We also have financial and travel sanctions against 106 individuals and 28 entities. We plan to add further names to this list.

         has overnight expanded its own sanctions including by adding new individuals and entities and the banning of insurance for arms shipments to Syria.

         also has a robust set of measures in place. When I met the President of the Syrian National Council, Abdulbaset Sieda, I underlined Australia's commitment to the Syrian people.

           estimates that as many as 1.5 million people are in need of assistance, including over half a million internally displaced people. Australia has been at the forefront of international efforts to respond to this crisis, having contributed $11 million in humanitarian support. This has helped international organisations to provide medical supplies and evacuate the wounded. It has helped the

           to provide direct food assistance to half a million Syrians. Also, it has helped the UN increase humanitarian access for aid and providers. Australia is now the fourth largest humanitarian donor to the UN Syria Emergency Appeal. The Australian government will continue to show international leadership in responding to the needs of the Syrian people.

             Yesterday I argued that Russia is the key to facilitating political transition in Syria. Russia has a relationship with the Assad regime. It has of course so far resisted UN

              Security Council

             measures. However, this places a particular onus on Moscow to use its influence to persuade Assad to move aside and usher in an inclusive political transition. Russia has an opportunity to demonstrate that it is a global power prepared to show leadership and help resolve this crisis.
