        This is not my maiden speech. My question is to the Minister for Communications. Minister, earlier this month you sent a letter to the chairman of the board of West Television in Perth advising that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        station must transition to an online-only service after 30 June 2017. How many applications has the

         I thank Senator Georgiou for his question. Colleagues may be aware that around the nation there have been a number of community
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
          TV
         </a>
         stations such as Channel 31 in my home state of Victoria and that referenced by Senator Georgiou.
        </p>
        <p>
         In late 2014, the previous communications minister wrote to the community TV stations advising them that there would be a conclusion to their access to the spectrum that they use. The previous communications minister also gave funding to those community TV stations to assist them in transitioning to online platforms. That money was accepted by those community TV stations on the basis that they would make that transition.
        </p>
        <p>
         Subsequent to that, community TV stations around Australia asked for a one-year extension of access to spectrum, which I granted. That was due to conclude at the end of last year, but the community TV stations asked for a further extension of six months, which, again, I granted. Both the first and second extensions, as well as the money which was provided to community TV stations, were granted on the understanding that community TV stations would shift to online platforms. So the access to spectrum is scheduled to come to a conclusion at the end of this month, and part of the rationale is that there are other potential uses for that spectrum, Specifically, in answer to the question, I understand that there are some propositions to utilise that spectrum.

            , which manages the spectrum, would have received propositions as well. I am very happy to arrange a briefing for Senator Georgiou as to the nature and type of propositions which have come forward and for which that spectrum could potentially be used.

               I have some positive news for colleagues in relation to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                NBN
               </a>
               : it is now available nationwide to around 4.8 million premises. By 30 June, it will be available to 5.4 million premises nationwide, which represents 50 per cent of the nation. The state-by-state breakdowns are similar for each jurisdiction. There are over two million people who can currently access the NBN. One of the reasons why this government has put such a focus on the NBN is because of what we inherited from our predecessors, which was what was essentially a failed project. But Senator Georgiou is right: the NBN is important and it will be providing important new opportunities online.
