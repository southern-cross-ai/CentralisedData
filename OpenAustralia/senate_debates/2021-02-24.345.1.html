         I thank Senator Patrick for the question. I can advise as follows: the government is in daily discussions with airlines to understand the needs of the sector and to ensure our programs are supporting the communities that they fly to. You'd understand, though, that decisions on network configurations and scheduling are ultimately a commercial matter for the airlines themselves. This includes, as you've referred to in your question, Rex's decision to cease the Adelaide to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Kangaroo Island
         </a>
         route.
        </p>
        <p>
         The regional aviation network support does not compel airlines to fly to particular routes. However, we continue to monitor the need for future support, whether it be through aviation measures or broader economic measures. You'd be aware that Rex is one of 15 operators receiving funding to ensure critical aviation services, particularly in regional and remote Australia, through the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact on the aviation sector, to ensure essential workers can travel domestically, to support health transport services, and to distribute critical goods and equipment. The regional aviation network support, as you'd be aware, currently runs until March. I am advised that, obviously as a government, we'll continue to monitor the situation and continue further support if necessary. Qantas themselves, in a media release, have stated:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We'll be reviewing our network and consider whether we can offer services on any of the routes that Rex is threatening to pull out of.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think you know, from the government's perspective, we've always been of the opinion that Australia's aviation industry does have a bright future ahead. I'm confident that we will rebuild throughout 2021 and beyond.

            Again, I refer to my answer to your first question. The government is in daily discussions with airlines to understand the needs of the sector and to ensure our programs are supporting the communities they fly to. The government also expects all state and territory governments to engage with airlines to ensure the required support for their local communities and regions is considered, particularly with interstate and intrastate routes. Airlines, as you know, are receiving government assistance under different government programs based on their specific circumstances, and, as stated in my previous answer—

                   I can advise that in June 2020 the government directed the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                    Australian Competition and Consumer Commission
                   </a>
                   , the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                    ACCC
                   </a>
                   , to monitor the prices, costs and profits of Australia's domestic airline industry and provide quarterly reports to inform government policy. The ACCC continues to monitor airline activity and has published two quarterly reports on airline competition in Australia, in September and December 2020. The programs that the government itself has put in place have been targeted specifically to the needs of Australian communities and developed, as you know, in close consultation with the sector. The focus of the Australian government's efforts has been to keep essential services running, and this has enabled funding to flow through to the aviation sector, ensuring that the maximum number of jobs can be supported. Unfortunately I don't have time, but I could take you through the five-year plan we have for aviation. But that will wait for another day.
