         I acknowledge that this is Senator Hume's first question in this place, and also congratulate her on a magnificent first speech last night.

          Mr President
         </a>
         , colleagues: I think we are all aware that technology, the avenues that that provides the people to consume media and the choices that consumers must themselves make are rendering our existing media laws progressively redundant. They simply do not reflect the world that we currently live in.
        </p>
        <p>
         At present, we have five media laws with quaint names—the five-four rule, the two-to-a-market rule, the one-to-a-market rule, the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two out of three rule. What the government is proposing is to abolish the 75 per cent audience reach rule and the two out of three rule, and to leave the other media rules in place. Now, if the parliament chose to do that, it would represent the most significant media reform in a generation. The purpose of reforming our media laws is to enable Australia's media organisations to configure themselves in ways that best suit their business and best support their viability. It will give media organisations, if they choose, the opportunity to build scale through changing their configurations.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think it is important for colleagues to know that changes to media laws will not see any changes to the existing requirements from, and scrutiny by, the

          ACCC
         </a>
         , or any changes to Foreign Investment Review Board requirements, should those apply to any proposition. In fact, the government has asked the ACCC to update its public guidance on its approach to media mergers, to provide transparent information on how these would be treated—

            I think all of us recognise the importance of local content in local media. It is important for those communities. So as part of the government's proposed package, we will be strengthening local television content requirements to ensure local content continues to be provided in regional Australia. We are proposing that, following a change in control that results in an entity controlling licences that reach more than 75 per cent of the population, higher local content requirements would be in place. This would increase the minimum local content points required from the current 720 over a six-week period to 900 points over a six-week period. Also, importantly, in regional markets where there are currently no local content requirements, we would introduce, for the first time, local content requirements of 360 points over a six-week period. That is good news for the regions.

               I am aware of some commentary, and the parliament will have the opportunity to examine that proposed rule change. The fact is Australians do have access to an incredibly diverse array of media sources. The online sources are in abundance. In fact, the existence of the two-out-of-three rule not only no longer protects diversity but, I would contend, prevents media companies from building scale. That, in itself, is a threat to ongoing media diversity.

              <p class="italic">
               We are yet to hear any rational argument in favour of keeping the two out of three rule, which only applies to three offline media platforms and doesn’t even recognise the existence of the internet. It is illogical and antiquated and threatens local diversity by constraining Australian media companies in our efforts to grow and compete.
