        <p class="italic">
         (2)   (a) Serco has advised that for operational and security reasons Serco does not believe that it is appropriate to make staffing numbers public as it may compromise Serco's ability to maintain the security of detention facilities and the good order within detention facilities, endangering the safety of staff and those in the Department's care.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) There were 380 detainees accommodated at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Immigration_Detention_Centre" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Immigration Detention Centre
         </a>
         as at close of business 18 October 2011.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) Serco advise that staffing numbers are constantly reviewed to ensure they are operationally appropriate and in accordance with the services contract. Serco further advise that it would be unusual for there to be no officers be present in a compound. This would generally only occur during a critical incident where it is no longer safe for staff to remain in the compound. In this scenario staff would be withdrawn until a risk assessment had been completed.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) Serco policies and procedures stipulate that debriefs occur after each critical incident. Debriefing following a critical incident is essential to address any operational and welfare issues that may have arisen through the incident. Debriefs are mandatory following critical incidents involving serious injury, death, serious trauma or serious service interruption. These may include but are not limited to:
        </p>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>

        <ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
        <p class="italic">
         An opportunity to address issues arising from critical incidents is provided to affected staff. Stress responses to intense situations are common and a debrief to address and deconstruct the events, followed by further support from Serco's employee assistance program (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAP" rel="nofollow">
          EAP
         </a>
         ), may assist in identifying and supporting those staff who require it.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) No refer 2 (d).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (f) The Service Provider, Serco, and all its personnel must comply with all applicable laws and Australian standards relating to occupational health and safety (including the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1991 and the Work Health Safety Act 2011).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (g) Serco must comply with any reasonable safety directions given by the Department and must provide a monthly report detailing any injury, illness, death or property damage while also detailing any action taken to prevent any recurrence or minimise the impact should a recurrence occur. For these reasons the Department is satisfied that the mandated occupational health and safety standards are being met by Serco.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (h) The Department is not aware of any instances where the department has not received security incident reports from Serco.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i) The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDC" rel="nofollow">
          IDC

         Contract requires that Serco ensure that all incidents are reported and managed within the relevant timeframes. The Department monitors Serco's performance in relation to incident reporting as part of the monthly joint facility audit requirement. The Department is not aware of instances where security incident reports, completed by Serco officers, are not being provided to the department. There have, however, been instances where timeliness provisions relating to reporting of incidents were not adhered to.
