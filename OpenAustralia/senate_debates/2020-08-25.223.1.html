        I rise tonight to speak about the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on our way of life across the country and in my home state of Tasmania. Specifically, I want to reflect on the last four months, which have changed my perspective on our country and my home state.
       </p>
       <p>
        This pandemic has changed our country and the world more than we currently know. Its effects will last not for days, weeks or months but for years and possibly decades. Our way of life has been shaken and the lives of Tasmanians have been changed dramatically, with 230 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Tasmania and, sadly, 13 Tasmanians have lost their lives to this virus. Over the last few months, these families have had to mourn their loved ones in solitary confinement and without being able to say a proper goodbye. It's tragic and extremely sad for our community and for the Australian community more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senators in this place come from their respective states and territories across the country to meet here, and we all have a certain respect for one another because of our belief in our communities and our belief in representative democracy. We are all linked by this bond and know that we're extremely privileged that we're able to come into this place and contribute to the national debate. We know that we're lucky, as a country, that we have been able to navigate this pandemic in a way that has made me proud to be an Australian. Were there mistakes made? Yes. Should we learn from these mistakes? Of course we must, but we pull together as a nation in the most trying of circumstances. This is what we do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I'd like to acknowledge all the Tasmanians who have worked tirelessly on the front line in health care: our ambos, those in aged care and their workforces—whether they're in a caring role, or cleaners, or in admin, or doctors, or nurses or grounds staff. I would like to express my personal gratitude for your tireless work in protecting our fellow Tasmanians. Despite the uncertainties present, these workers have risked their lives and their bravery and should be commended, as this has been instrumental in keeping our society functioning.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Tasmanian nurses who have willingly travelled to Victoria to support aged-care facilities, working under immense pressure and having to undergo hotel quarantine upon return, I say thank you. To all our supermarket and essential retail workers, I acknowledge your contribution and say thank you. Despite the panic buying that ensued, there was always faith that shops would be restocked and that we could rely on them to access essential goods and services. To all our truckies, who kept Tasmania moving and transported medical supplies and food to Tasmanians who needed them in the most desperate of times, I say thank you. To all our teachers who quickly had to evolve and adapt to provide online learning for their students, and to those who risked their health to make sure that children had a safe place to go and study throughout the peak of the COVID restrictions, I say thank you.

        workers who had to deal with increased workloads and pressure, I say thank you. I feel particularly fortunate to represent the people of Tasmania—I always have, but this pandemic has provided a unique perspective.

        as something of a disadvantage, but the 500-kilometre stretch of beautiful but treacherous water separating Tasmania from mainland Australia has been the rock that Tasmania needed in this crisis. Many people have expressed its likeness to a moat protecting us from mainland counterparts which experience COVID-19 infections in far greater numbers. I am Tasmanian, and I know I'm lucky. I believe many Tasmanians feel the same way and a true sense of admiration and love for their state post COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p>
        The health and economic circumstances of this pandemic will be felt for years in my home state, and it has already experienced economic effects. We are a small island of 500,000 people and a destination that the world loves and wants to visit. They have not been able to visit, and they will not be able to visit for some time. Our industries have been decimated by the effects of social isolation. In particular, retail, restaurants, cafes, pubs, clubs and small businesses across many industries are still hurting.
       </p>
       <p>
        Small businesses in Tasmania are a backbone of the Tasmanian economy. There are over 40,000 businesses in our community, and 95 per cent of those are small businesses employing on average one to 19 employees. These businesses are made up of local people who deserve our support, because we are a close-knit community who support one another. As we emerge from this crisis, it is crucial that we support local small businesses in our cities, suburbs and regions. I ask you to do your bit wherever you can. There are many ways we can support local businesses, including: buying goods in person or online; liking, sharing or commenting on a business's social media; and not forgetting to tell your friends about a small business. Lastly, if you can buy from a local small business, do just that—no excuses. Be vocal and shop local.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must also provide further support for the nearly 30,000 Tasmanians who have now lost jobs or are underemployed as a result of this pandemic. Now is the time to invest in our people by providing free

        </a>
        so that when we emerge from this pandemic we have a skilled workforce who are equipped to face challenges and have the skills to help build our economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must not forget our agriculture industry in this pandemic. As we have become increasingly reliant on China as a destination for our exports and amidst the uncertainty of their punitive trade punishments, we need to diversify our export markets to help protect our world-class produce. We also need to reskill local Tasmanians to set them up for a career in agriculture, as, without domestic and international travel, they are currently facing severe labour shortages. We certainly have the supply of labour; however, there are barriers that need to be removed in order to encourage Tasmanians to work throughout the harvest.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has outperformed most countries in response to COVID-19, and it is truly indicative of our robust society. However, as we emerge in a different world—a COVID-19 world—the government must adapt its policy approach and institute significant structural change that will serve the interests of all Australians. As we spoke about in this chamber yesterday and today, there is no greater tragedy of COVID-19 than the effect on small business and our economy, but we also must ensure the health and welfare of all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have seen this government let down some of the most vulnerable members of our community—that is, those who are in residential aged care and those that receive home-care help. This government has failed older Australians and their families. We have acknowledged the tragedy of the now in excess of 335 older Australians who have died from COVID-19. We have spoken about the heartache of their families not being able to be there, to hold their hands, as they passed from this world. That is something those families will never, ever forget, and our hearts go out to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we can do better. This government must do better. It is unacceptable to say that we are doing better than other countries. One more death that could be avoided in residential aged care due to COVID-19, the lack of preparedness, the lack of a plan, the lack of resources and the lack of training are not going to be acceptable to the Australian people. This is a wake-up call to this government. They called a royal commission into their own failings. Every bit of evidence justifies our concerns—the concerns that have been expressed by senator after senator after senator on this side. We are the ones who are out in the community. We're getting the calls from desperate families who just want to know that their loved ones are going to be supported, cared for and given the best possible care they can have in residential aged care. Nothing is going to be acceptable other than a 100 per cent improvement by this government.
