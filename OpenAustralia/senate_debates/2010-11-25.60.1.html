         Digital Economy

              As to where they are currently up to, I am happy to seek that information for you, George. I am happy to see where those cash payments are up to. The rest of the money comes from bond raisings, which will be passed on, as needed, to the

              . Cash has already been moved across. There is more cash available to move across. As the cash expires, bonds will be issued. As to the bond issuance program, that is a finance department issue. All the cash coming across in the early years is clearly coming from the government. As to some of the other information that the senator is asking for, he will have to wait—

               Co. to Telstra? Someone has to pay for it. You indicated in the statement that you have given us that it will be paid by 2020. What I was asking—and I am repeating this after asking about what is secretive—is: how much of that will be government debt and equity and how much will there be when NBN makes its own funds? What is the expected changeover date?

                  , I rise on a point of order. The question was about relativity between debt and equity and it was about a date—the date when private debt and equity would overtake government debt and equity. The minister has merely, for the entire time he has been on his feet, abused the opposition and done nothing else. He has been neither directly nor indirectly relevant to either of the two matters he was asked about.

                   , on the point of order: Senator Brandis claims the minister has been abusing the opposition. That is untrue. The minister has been going through the business case and explaining it. It is clear that the minister has rejected some of the interjections and quite properly so, because interjections are disorderly. On the main point, the minister has been directly relevant and I humbly submit that there is no point of order.

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. I repeat for the third time: why is the information about who is paying the $13.8 billion that goes to Telstra such a secret? Isn’t it a fact that, if it is government equity and debt, that actually adds to the cost and makes a complete mockery of your allegation that costs are falling and it is a cost that has to be added on to the $35.7 billion
