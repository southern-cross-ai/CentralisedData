        The President has received letters from party leaders and an Independent senator seeking appointment to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Select Committee
        </a>
        on Climate Policy. There are two nominations for one position on the committee, the position to be nominated by the Independent senators. In accordance with standing orders, a ballot will be held to determine which one of the two senators who have nominated is to be appointed. I will first call the minister to seek leave to move a motion for the uncontested vacancies and then I understand that it is the wish of the Senate that the ballot for the position be held immediately.

       <p>
        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p>
        That senators be appointed to the Select Committee on Climate Policy as follows:

             No, pocket knives. I was really hoping that common sense would prevail and that it would not come down to a vote on the chamber floor. If you read the notice of motion that was passed by the chamber, it was that the committee should consist of 10 senators: four nominated by the

             , one nominated by the Leader of the

             and one nominated by any other minor party—that is,

             or Independent senators. There is one Independent senator, but I will not go there. The issue here is that the emissions trading scheme, or the system that we are developing, is a big issue—I will not go there. However, there are two inquiries, which have different terms of reference. One inquiry has been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Economics and Senator Xenophon is already on that committee. I just appeal to people that there is another inquiry with broader terms—that is, the select committee. Maybe this is a good way of doing it—I was hoping that the government would use one of their positions to nominate the senator who does not get voted for the select committee.
