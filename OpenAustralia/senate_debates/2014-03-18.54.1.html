        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. I refer the minister to his statement on 7 February, when he expressed his confidence in Defence personnel, saying, 'I'm backing them at every turn of every corner.' Why is this support not extended to the children of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        veterans that have been killed or injured? Why is the minister supporting the decision to cut payments to children of war veterans, including some who are homeless, all to save a measly $250,000 a year?

         I thank the senator for his question. All dependants who were eligible young persons immediately before the death, whether wholly, mainly or partly dependent, receive a tax-free lump sum compensation payment of $81,367.49 and education assistance under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme, while they remain an eligible young person. Education assistance includes an education allowance of $251.30 per year for primary school students and up to $421 per fortnight for secondary or tertiary students. This information is of course all available on the Defence website. If the eligible young person was wholly, mainly or partly dependent—

              As I was saying, if the eligible young person was wholly, mainly or partly dependent on the member or former member, while they remain an eligible young person they can also receive a weekly payment of $135.34; a gold repatriation health card, providing free medical care; and an

              supplement of $6.20 per fortnight.
             </p>
             <p>
              The payment that the senator refers to was tied to the mining tax, a tax that raised no money, a tax that actually cost taxpayers money. The brilliance of the previous government was such that they introduced a tax that actually raised no revenue and cost the taxpayer a motza. I do not think in the history of our country we have ever seen a more incompetent government, which would introduce a tax that actually raised no revenue and cost the taxpayer money and then sought to tie a whole lot of benefits to it, to rub salt into the wound. Of course, the senator does not understand any of that.

                  I reassert the proposition that I put: there is an existing program that deals with precisely the matters the senator has raised, if he is prepared to pay any attention to the answer that I gave him. But of course, on the subject of defence, the other side is so embroiled in the politics that they are not interested in following through what benefits are available to Defence beneficiaries, to children of former Defence members, so I am really obviously wasting my time. During their time in office, the only thing they had to concern themselves with about Defence was to treat it as an
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM" rel="nofollow">
                   ATM
                  </a>
                  and a cash cow and rip it off. And that is exactly what they did, to the tune of $18 billion in four years. So it is the height, may I say, of hypocrisy for the Labor Party to come in here with a question about Defence benefits.

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the minister's obvious support for these cuts and his decision to slash the pay and conditions of serving ADF personnel in the

                   , when will the minister start standing up for the current and former Defence Force members and their families?

                    , the defence state. When I talked about the amount of money that had been ripped out of the defence portfolio, where was the senator, because his defence state was the principal victim of his own government's maladministration of the portfolio? He sat quiet while people's jobs were sacrificed in South Australia because of politics. The defence state of South Australia suffered more than any other state, and where was the senator in the last four years—advocating for his state? He sat dumb while the defence state of South Australia was utterly ripped off by his own government.
