               These populations have been listed as a vulnerable species. This listing gives the koala an extra layer of protection. The koala is, as I have said, a national icon and national protection provides for consistent treatment of the koala under national environmental law and standards, rather than the previous state by state based approach. Any new developments likely to have a significant impact on koalas in Queensland,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
                ACT
               </a>
               must be assessed and approved under national environmental law. As a result of listing, a national recovery plan is being developed for koalas within Queensland, New South Wales and the ACT. The recovery plan will be multijurisdictional and will present a stronger scientific basis for the protection of the species. The Australian government has been leading a national environmental law reform process through
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
                COAG
               </a>
               . The COAG agreement is about streamlining the processes to give ministers answers on environmental decisions in a better time frame. It is about the state governments having to raise their standards to the Commonwealth standards. This Labor government has absolutely no intention of allowing any state to use the COAG process as a way of lowering environmental standards.

Minister Burke said last night that state processes were sending koalas on a path of extinction in the wild, which he said was absolutely not good enough and that that was why we had—

                  Minister Burke said that that was why we had environmental regulation. So what does the minister say to tourism operators about the federal government now ditching its new responsibilities to look after koalas and leaving their survival to the whim of the states, those same states which have driven the huge decline in koala numbers?

                   We reject the premise of that assertion. This government is serious about maintaining environmental standards, including for the koala and its habitat. The Gillard government has committed $300,000 of new funding under the National Environmental Research Program to find out more about koala habitat. This funding will be used to develop new survey methods that will improve our knowledge of the quality of koala habitat using remote sensing and will help fill important data gaps to enhance our understanding and ability to protect the species. Over $10 million was approved under the first round of the biodiversity fund for six projects in

                   and one in Victoria aimed at rehabilitation, restoration and linking of koala habitat. If there is any further information on the question I will seek that from Minister Burke.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Why is the government so eager to abandon its responsibility to protect our nationally significant environmental matters like koalas, other threatened species, migratory species, National Heritage places and Ramsar wetlands? How, given the consistent poor record of the states to protect those places or to comply with standards that already exist, can you possibly think that is consistent with our international obligations?

                     As I said, I and this government fundamentally reject the assertions that are the premise of that question. It is not true. I have just outlined on behalf of Minister Burke a whole range of protections and made the absolute point—and I will make it again—that we will not allow the lowering of standards as part of this process. We will not allow it, and we will not allow the Greens to represent that that is the case. If there is any further information that the minister might like to respond to, I will seek that for you.
