        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, my good friend Senator Farrell.

        make an important contribution to the economy and the diversity of communities across Australia. How is the international education sector faring in the aftermath of the pandemic, and what are the long-term effects of the former government's complete lack of support and the former Prime Minister telling students to go home?

          I'll take that interjection. I'll talk to you afterwards, but they're all good! I thank Senator O'Neill for that question. I know she has a great interest in education, particularly the topic of her question, which was international education.
         </p>
         <p>
          Regrettably, international education was one of hardest hit sectors of our economy during the pandemic. With students unable to travel to Australia, the former government's bungling meant that many educational institutions were not able to access financial support. Worst of all was the damage done by former prime minister

              made it very clear that his government didn't care about international students, didn't care about educational institutions and, most importantly, didn't care about those who relied on them to support their families. The message to parents of international students was that the Morrison government didn't care about their children and didn't want them here. In a single press conference the former Prime Minister caused a massive setback to a $40.3 billion industry.

                 I thank Senator O'Neill for her question. Of course, we hope that international travel is normalising, but, no thanks to the previous government, the international education sector remains one of the largest export industries. Its recovery is testament to the quality education our institutions offer and the hard work of industry and government agencies. In December, there were over 452,200 student visa holders in Australia. It's not at pre-COVID levels yet, but the industry, pleasingly, is recovering.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The Albanese Labor government is proud to be welcoming back international students from across the world. While China is still our largest and most valuable market, diversification is occurring, with growth in other markets including India, Nepal, Colombia and Vietnam. Last year, Austrade supported the Australia-India Comprehensive Strategic Partnership—
