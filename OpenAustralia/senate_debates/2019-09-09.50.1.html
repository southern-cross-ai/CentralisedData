         Thank you, Senator Davey. I'm sure all of our thoughts are with those communities who have been impacted by the bushfires in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Queensland, communities who are also struggling with the drought. I'd like to commend the efforts of our first responders, many of whom are volunteers, who are working day and night to keep these communities safe. The bushfires burning in southern Queensland and north-eastern New South Wales remain active and include an emerging situation at Shark Creek, near Yamba. The forecast of dry and windy conditions until Tuesday, with no sign of rain, means the fire situation will remain volatile. I urge everyone to stay aware of their surroundings and follow advice from local management authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The full impact of the fires is still being assessed. The impacts that have been confirmed so far include: in Queensland, 17 homes have been lost in Stanthorpe and fire has destroyed historic Binna Burra Lodge in the

         volunteer firefighter was seriously injured while fighting a fire near Tenterfield on Friday afternoon. Our thoughts and prayers are with the injured firefighter and his loved ones.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government is in regular contact with the affected jurisdictions and is positioned to provide assistance when required. On Friday 6 September, the Director-General of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Emergency Management Australia
         </a>
         approved the activation of a COMDISPLAN in relation to bushfires burning in South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales, which sees our Defence Force on the ground ready to assist in the recovery phase of the fires.

           in Queensland. It is important to note that the bushfire situation in both Queensland and New South Wales is considered active, and further assistance may be made available once the fires are controlled. The range of assistance available in New South Wales includes: personal hardship and distress assistance for individuals and families; support for affected local councils and state agencies to help with operational responses and restoring damaged essential public assets; concessional interest rate loans for small businesses, primary producers and not-for-profit organisations; freight subsidies for primary producers; and grants for eligible non-profit organisations. The assistance is administered by the New South Wales government, and anyone needing assistance should contact the New South Wales government Disaster Welfare Assistance Line on 1800018444.

             I also encourage all Australians to ensure they have in place their bushfire survival plan. This has been the driest year since 1970. This is especially the case over the southern half of the country, which has experienced the driest January to July on record. The east coasts of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, as well as parts of southern
