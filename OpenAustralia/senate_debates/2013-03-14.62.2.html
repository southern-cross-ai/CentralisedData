                            , I have a supplementary question. Can the minister explain any other steps the government is taking to promote transparency around costings prior to elections and how will the proposed process differ from what we have seen at previous elections?

And what did we see? We saw an $11 billion black hole in their costings. In fact, what is very interesting is that the economic team that is currently part of the coalition frontbench—that is the one that does not appear to be able to get its position through at shadow cabinet—have actually never once got their costings right, not in the election and certainly not when they have used a catering company to do their costings. What the government is doing is ensuring that this sort of con job cannot occur again.

                               may wish to avail himself of it. But as important is transparency. We on this side are determined that the sort of attempted con job that was put up last time to the Australian people by Mr Abbott and Mr Hockey cannot occur again, which is why we are saying there will be a post-election report, some 30 days after the election, which shows the true state of the budget as a result of a political party's commitments. What those opposite would like to be reminded of is that on the last occasion that would have shown the $11 billion black hole, and I say to the opposition: be aware that if you try and con people you will be found out. We on this side believe in transparency when it comes to budget costings.
