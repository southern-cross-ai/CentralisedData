           Thank you. We are in a situation here where Senator Joyce seeks to completely misrepresent. I invite Senator Joyce to actually read the substance of the bill. Take all the time you need and read the bill, because the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Competition and Consumer Safeguards) Bill 2010 is a fundamental and historic microeconomic reform and is in Australia’s long-term national interest. The reforms are designed to reshape regulation in the telecommunications sector in the interests of consumers, business—

They tried to get a cost-benefit analysis up in the other place and they lost. Then, just a few minutes ago in this chamber, they tried to gag debate on this bill.

                   NBN

                  are involved in between Telstra and the NBN. It is not about the

                  . The bill has nothing to do with the NBN. It is about a deal between the NBN Co. company and Telstra. But, as I was saying, just a short time ago in this chamber they tried to block debate on this bill yet again and they lost. Three times they have now tried to block this bill and block the rollout of the National Broadband Network and three times they have lost. I can understand that they want to come in here and create some colour and movement to hide the fact that the parliament continues to take the enlightened view about the future.
