        I have, and I assume Senator Cormann is going to raise this, an answer to question No. 598, given on 15 April. Senator Cormann did notify my office and I have spoken to Minister Shorten's office. I assume this is the matter he is raising. Firstly, I apologise on behalf of Minister Shorten's office. The answer should have been provided but, inadvertently, has not been. I seek leave to have the answer incorporated in
