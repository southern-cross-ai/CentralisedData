        As a servant to the many different people who make up our one Queensland community, this Easter I refer to Luke 23 describing governor of Judea
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontius_Pilate" rel="nofollow">
         Pontius Pilate
        </a>
        's trial of Jesus. Under the custom of thou shalt pardon, Pontius Pilate offered the Jerusalem Passover crowd a choice between pardoning two people convicted of sedition: Barabbas or Judas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Barabbas was a violent revolutionary who rebelled against Rome and killed indiscriminately. Jesus, though, was convicted of sedition following his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Sunday" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        arrival, which led to Pontius Pilate fearing for his own power. As history records, the crowd chose to spare Barabbas in the hope he would protect them from the Romans. The crowds shunned Jesus, who had spoken against violence and in favour of quiet endurance in the knowledge that better times would come.
       </p>
       <p>
        While Luke 23 is a parable about Jesus dying for the sins of others, there is another interpretation. The crowd chose a person who they falsely hoped would protect their physical selves over someone who fought for their spiritual selves. In a decision that mimics the Jerusalem crowd, during COVID many Australians abandoned spiritual values of love, family and fellowship to achieve what we now know was a false sense of physical safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians embraced the message from the Pfizer empire's modern day Pontius Pilate. It was a message broadcast in daily brainwashing sessions from politicians, health bureaucrats, media mouthpieces and over shopping centre public address systems, all with the same billionaire owners as Pfizer. They were messages designed to turn society against those who stayed true to spiritual beliefs.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Easter let's reflect on Pontius Pilate's faith. Emperor Caligula recalled Pilate to Rome, accused him of cruelty and oppression and then executed him. As it turns out, washing one's hands of blame does not work. In the end, God always wins.
