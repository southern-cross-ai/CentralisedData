        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. Can the minister confirm reports that a vessel containing up to 200 suspected asylum seekers is heading for Australia from

         Sri Lanka

        ? Can the minister further confirm that an additional two suspected asylum seeker vessels arrived on Friday, making 139 boat arrivals under the Rudd government, 71 just this year?

Clearly, that is a question of intelligence and not something that he would expect me to discuss in the Senate, so I will not be confirming press reports—

             Whether you would respond or not, I am telling you that this government will not be discussing the question of intelligence briefings to the government on sensitive national security issues and issues that may involve deployment of Navy and Customs vessels. Clearly, we will not be discussing those and I cannot think that you are serious in your question.
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of the second part of the question, the government is facing increased activity in unauthorised boat arrivals at this time. It is similar to three previous peaks in activity that this country has experienced over the last 35 years. The last one was between 1999 and 2001 when the Howard government had to deal with larger numbers of arrivals.

The minister has not addressed the second part of the question at all. He is merely being asked to confirm two figures.

                As I was saying, we have been in a period of time when we have seen an increased number of arrivals, similar to peaks in activity that we have had in previous years. As I said, the last peak was in the period 1999 to 2001—figures that the Liberal Party now deny and refuse to put in the graphs that they produce publicly. Amazingly, when they produce their material now everything starts at 2005. They have no pride in the first half of the Howard government’s era—no pride at all.

                 , I ask a supplementary question. Clearly, we will not get the answers. Let us try this: given the minister’s failure to tell us last week, will the minister confirm the Attorney-General’s advice to the House that on 11 June this year there were 508 children being held in detention? Was the Attorney right? Now, just 10 days later, how many more children are in detention?

                 <p>
                  I find the opposition’s concern for children in detention breathtaking, because this is a newly found concern. Where were the opposition when they had 1,923 children behind razor wire in detention camps—not in community detention, not in alternative places of detention like with this government but locked up behind razor wire in camps. This is the Liberal opposition whose current policy is to bundle them all up, try to find a third-country island and send those children back into detention. That is your policy now: ship them off to a third country, find an island and lock those kids up again. This government proudly states, ‘We do not lock kids up in detention centres.’ As I indicated the other day, this attack is morally bankrupt.

                   . I note the minister’s refusal once again to answer the questions. Does the minister now deny that Labor’s policy is encouraging the criminal behaviour of people smugglers, who are luring these families onto rickety boats, putting children’s lives at risk and, to quote one of the minister’s most senior departmental officials, ‘exposing more people to danger’?
