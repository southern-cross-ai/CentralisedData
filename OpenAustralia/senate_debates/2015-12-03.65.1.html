          My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Senator Colbeck. My question relates to the release of the updated WestConnex business case, which shows a massive cost blow-out, from $10 billion to $16.8 billion. Considering Infrastructure Australia's assessment of the previous business case—

             I do not have a particular brief on the specifics of Senator Rhiannon's question, but the coalition is obviously committed to its investment program into infrastructure, particularly the WestConnex project, which is something that we have been committed to for a considerable period of time. We are working closely with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             government on the delivery of the project, and we will continue to do so. We take our investment in infrastructure in this country very seriously. I will have to ask Minister Truss's office for further information regarding the specifics of the question, but I reiterate to the chamber that we remain committed to the project and we remain committed to working closely with the New South Wales government on delivery of what is a very, very important piece of infrastructure. It means a lot to those who are going to be impacted by reducing traffic congestion in those areas, and, despite the fact that we understand the Greens do not like the construction of major pieces of road infrastructure—which is their right, quite obviously, in a policy sense—we will continue to support the project.

              , I ask a supplementary question. As the minister is in the Turnbull government, it is surprising that he could not answer the question in terms of the responsible use of public money. Hopefully, he can answer this one: given the cost blow-out—and that the planning and delivery of WestConnex has been transferred to a private corporation, the Sydney Motorway Corporation, which is not subject to

                government on the delivery of this major piece of infrastructure. We see it as an important one. There are a range of checks and balances that are put into place with respect to the management of the project between the state and the Commonwealth to ensure that Commonwealth funds—and state funds, for that matter—are used correctly. Despite the Greens railing against these important pieces of infrastructure, we remain committed to these projects, which are very important for those who are going to be positively impacted by them. As I said in my previous answer, we remain committed to the project and we are committed to ensuring that taxpayers' money is properly used for the delivery of important infrastructure.

                  Cross City Tunnel

                 , the

                  Lane Cove Tunnel
                 </a>
                 , the CLEM7 Tunnel and the Brisbane airport link had traffic forecasts that were widely inflated. How can you justify gambling billions in federal funds on WestConnex, instead of spending it on public transport? That is how we can reduce congestion and decrease travel times.

                  In a policy sense, the Greens have their own policy priorities and the government has theirs.

                    are quite free to express their policy preferences, but the government is committed to this project. We remain committed to the project. It was a significant commitment that this government made coming through the last election, and we will roll the project out. The Greens can rail against it all they like; that is not going to change the circumstance. We will continue to support the project.
