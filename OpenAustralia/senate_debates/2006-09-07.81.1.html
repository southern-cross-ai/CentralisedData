        My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Treasurer. Given the government’s professed concern for small business and the agreement of all sides of parliament that small business needs to be able to collectively bargain more effectively with big business, why won’t the government pass legislation which would enable small business to negotiate on a more level playing field with big business?

         I think that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
          Senator Fielding
         </a>
         should be well aware that the government does indeed have a policy in that regard. The amendments arising out of the Dawson review in relation to collective bargaining are part of the Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill that we have prepared, and we are looking for the opportunity to proceed with that bill. I think that it is well known that this is a comprehensive package of amendments and that it does involve not only amendments relating to collective bargaining but also other amendments that take account of some of the difficulties which business has had with the operation of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Practices_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Trade Practices Act
         </a>
         more generally. We are anxious to proceed with that bill but we can only do so when we have some confidence of its passage through this chamber. As Senator Fielding should know, these are formally parts of the legislation which we would like to see pass this Senate, and the Treasurer is looking for the opportunity, and the point at which he can have the confidence that the bill will pass the parliament, to proceed with it.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, isn’t it true that the government is bending over backwards to help the big end of town and blackmailing the rest of us by making support for small business conditional upon supporting the big end of town?

           I think that is quite unfair of

           . This government has a significant and quite commendable small business bias. We have done an enormous amount in our 10 years to support small business, not the least of which was the removal of the unfair dismissal laws that so impacted on small business, as Senator Fielding well knows. He knows perfectly well that the package of trade practices amendments which we have before the parliament is a comprehensive package that assists medium to large businesses to operate, create jobs in this country and, indeed, create business for small business. Most small businesses in this country are significantly dependent upon the prosperity and vitality of medium to large businesses. We want them to survive and prosper in order that small business can prosper. So we do look forward to the opportunity to proceed with this comprehensive package of legislation.
