        , Senator Evans. Minister, can you inform the Senate of what measures the government has taken to send Australian election observers to Zimbabwe, to assist with the monitoring of the second round of presidential elections on 27 June, either individually or as part of the international community? If the government has not made approaches on this matter, will it undertake to do so?

         I thank Senator Sandy Macdonald for what is an important question. I do not have a brief on the particulars of the issue he raises. I did see the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">

         </i>
         I think it was last night—discussing his very serious concern and the government’s very serious concern, shared throughout the parliament, over the activities of Mr Mugabe in Zimbabwe and his attempts to undermine democratic election processes. I think increasingly the international community is looking to bring pressure on him to allow the presidential election to occur fairly. I am not aware that we are sending any election observers, and I suspect that is because they would not be welcome, but I will take on notice those elements of the questions. But, given our strong stance of criticism of the regime, I suspect the provision of our election observers and the support of our electoral officials, which has been such a strong part of Australia’s international effort over the years and has been a really important role that we have played, would not be welcome on this occasion.
        </p>

         Clearly, it would be highly beneficial if there were independent election observers present and active, and I think anything we can do to ensure fair elections for the presidency we should. But, as you know, Senator, the relationship with the Mugabe government is strained, to say the least. We are highly critical of them and are trying to encourage international action to examine what further we can do to apply pressure to them. But,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">

         , in terms of the specifics of his question, I will take those on notice and get back to him quickly with an answer.
