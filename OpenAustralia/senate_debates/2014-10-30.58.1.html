         I thank the senator for the question. The Working on Country Indigenous ranger program was a coalition government initiative commenced in 2007, and I would like to acknowledge the fact, and thank those opposite for continuing this good program during their term of government. Through the Indigenous ranger program, this government is delivering on the commitment to provide meaningful employment and training opportunities to Indigenous people that reflect the Indigenous aspirations and values of caring for land and sea. Their work is instrumental in protecting and conserving threatened species, marine ecosystems and cultural places, and is also primary in addressing environmental threats. That is why this government has brought the Working on Country program into the Indigenous Affairs portfolio. We have prioritised this program, as it is much more than an environmental programâ€”it is an employment program that will deliver training and jobs for Aboriginal and Islander people and build longer-term employment outcomes in these communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under this government, there are 764 Indigenous rangers employed in 105 ranger teams across the country. This well exceeds our commitment to have over 730 rangers trained and employed by June 2015. The expansion of Working on Country in the

         was a targeted initiative under the Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory jobs creation package to deliver 50 new Indigenous ranger positions by 2015-16. I am pleased to report to the parliament: this target has already been exceeded, with a current total of 53 positions.

           The coalition government's Dugong and Turtle Protection Plan was an election commitment aimed at strengthening the compliance and enforcement powers of Indigenous rangers in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
            North Queensland

           and the

            Torres Strait
           </a>
           . The specialised Indigenous ranger program was created to provide full-time Indigenous compliance officers in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park" rel="nofollow">
            Great Barrier Reef Marine Park

           Authority and in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Regional_Authority" rel="nofollow">
            Torres Strait Regional Authority
           </a>
           . In addition, 20 Indigenous rangers will receive nationally accredited compliance training by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park_Authority" rel="nofollow">
            Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority
           </a>
           . Upon successful completion of the training, the Indigenous rangers will be considered for appointment as marine park inspectors in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and I expect those appointments to be made. This program model could enable other Indigenous rangers to be appointed as compliance officers and undertake on-ground actions being tied into the relevant existing compliance framework and management regime. This will end the disparity where an Indigenous ranger somehow is different from some other sort of ranger because they lack compliance powers.

             The black-footed rock wallaby, known as warru, is an important creature in the culture of the Anangu people who inhabit the remote areas of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

              APY
             </a>
             Lands. In 2008, Anangu elders, scientists and rangers embarked on a rescue mission to protect one of South Australia's most endangered species, the warru. Ten Indigenous warru rangers are involved in monitoring warru survival rates, in predator control and in fire-management activities. The project involves the management of a 100-hectare predator enclosure north of Pukatja which serves as a hardening-off site for captive-bred warru, making sure that they are ready prior to their release into the wild. So rangers not only focus on the recovery of this species and the maintenance of their very important habitat but also run activities aimed at educating young Anangu about caring for country and about maintaining their culture.
