        My question is to the Minister for Defence and the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Faulkner. Can the minister inform the Senate of the latest developments relating to the crash of

         4684, went missing on the morning of 11 August this year while en route from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Moresby" rel="nofollow">
          Port Moresby
         </a>
         to Kokoda. Two crew and 11 passengers were on board the aircraft, and nine of the passengers were Australian. The missing plane has been located and it has been confirmed that the plane crashed.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am very sorry to have to inform the Senate that the Prime Minister has just informed the House of Representatives that the advice from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         is that there are no survivors of the crash. PNG police have deployed two teams into this location. It is a considerable march on foot—some three to four hours—and I can report that the search operation is being very well managed through the Papua New Guinea rescue coordination centre. There are, of course, as I am sure senators appreciate, a number of Australian agencies providing support to the task.
         <i>
          (Extension of time granted)
         </i>
         I appreciate that extension of time and, as that courtesy has been extended to me, I would not need a supplementary question to be asked of me. The high commissioner and the defence attache are fully engaged with the Papua New Guinea government, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

         and all the other search and rescue authorities and are providing the necessary coordination for the task ahead.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said to the Senate this morning, the weather is worsening in this location and it appears likely that it will impede some of the operations at the crash site. The

It includes a range of capabilities—a command element led by Wing Commander David Howard and an aeromedical evacuation team capable of dealing with whatever is required on the ground in PNG. There is a six-person mobile air load team who will be utilised on site, and there are also members of the

         will be sent to the crash site. Additional Australian Defence Force manpower, including engineering support, will be made available if required from personnel who are currently deployed to Papua New Guinea on exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
         Obviously, this is extraordinarily sad and difficult news. It is a terrible tragedy for all the families involved. I know that every senator in this place and so many outside it will be thinking of those people who have been so closely affected by this tragedy at this time. All our thoughts are with them.
