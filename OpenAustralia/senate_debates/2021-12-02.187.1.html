        My question is for the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. It was revealed publicly today that when Liberal MP Bridget Archer told Mr Morrison's office that she was considering voting against the cashless debit card, two senior members of his staff literally stood over her in her office. Ms Archer spoke against the cashless welfare card legislation, then abstained from voting. Ms Archer has said that she felt 'bullied, threatened and intimidated' by these staffers for almost two weeks. Is Mr Morrison aware of who the staffers are?

          for the question. The member for Bass is somebody whom I consider to be a good friend and who I know is a powerful advocate for her community, and she brings strong principles and strong opinions to this place. She, like many on this side of the chamber and all across the chamber, brings strong principles and strong opinions to her service. Now, like all parties, obviously, when people are looking to differ, then discussions are had, ideally, around those differences. On our side, ultimately, as Ms Archer did on that occasion, she was free as a Liberal Party MP to not necessarily vote—

                asked about public reports that Ms Archer said that she felt bullied, threatened and intimidated by prime ministerial staffers prior to the vote. So I put it to you that a reference to what happens after a vote is actually not relevant to the question. This is about activity or alleged behaviour by prime ministerial staff in the lead-up to a vote.

                  On the point of order: that's not what the minister was saying. He was clearly talking about the discussions that would happen before a vote—as he mentioned, an expulsion discussion. That would be the case, Labor Party. The question clearly goes to the appropriateness of discussions around a vote. Therefore, bringing in how that would be dealt with in other political parties, with other senators and members of this place, is clearly relevant to that question.

                    The point that I was making is that robust discussions are had in this place. They are had right here in the chamber about people's positions in relation to bills and votes. They are had in offices across the building about people's positions in relation to bills and votes. Only one side of politics has a structural threat in place as part of their rules that says very clearly in terms of the threat: 'If you go against us, you're out of here'. That is not what happens in our party. But, of course, discussions are had.

                       Mr Morrison has made clear his respect and support for the member for Bass and his ongoing engagement in discussions with her. Once again, as has been the case through many of the questions I've faced today—and it's not uncommon—what is put to me are assertions or direct quotes. They are not always completely direct quotes. As I have made clear, you would expect that discussions happen between party leaders and their members or senators and their officers. These are commonplace across the building. Of course, you can have strong disagreements, but they should be done respectfully. That's the way the Prime Minister always expects them to be conducted.

                          I don't accept the premise of all of that aspect of the question. I know there are many names you mentioned there, many individuals, who have been very courageous in public statements that they've made and who have played a role during the course of this year, in particular, in relation to driving some of the change that we've discussed and the Prime Minister has discussed very clearly this week. The Prime Minister has made clear that change is necessary in the parliament and that we need to ensure we have the reforms that are necessary for this place to operate effectively in the future. There's all manner of conduct that could do with improvement at times, and we want to make sure that those reforms occur to drive that change. But, frankly, conduct elsewhere in terms of the types of smearing, scaring and so on that those opposite like to engage in could also do with some help and some lifting.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          I reckon when you go out deliberately trying to scare Australia's pensioners, Senator Wong, as you like to do election after election with 'Mediscare' and—

                         <p>
                          it's pretty obvious that you are out there to try to threaten or intimate them too.
