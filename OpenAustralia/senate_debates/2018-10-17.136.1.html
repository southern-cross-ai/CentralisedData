        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs. Minister, I refer you to the ongoing humanitarian calamity your government has created and overseen on Nauru by running a systemic regime of torture and child abuse. Can you confirm that Australia's senior
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHMS" rel="nofollow">
         IHMS
        </a>
        medical officer on Nauru, Dr Nicole Montana, has been arrested overnight, issued with a deportation notice and has been deported—or very shortly is likely to be—from Nauru? This is after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medecins_Sans_Frontieres" rel="nofollow">
         Medecins Sans Frontieres
        </a>
        were booted off the island last week and after more than 5,500 doctors have demanded that the children you are torturing on Nauru and their families be brought to Australia for urgent medical treatment. Minister, why was Dr Montana deported and what are you doing about it?

            I was very clear not to accuse any individual senator in this place of engaging in child abuse. What I said, very clearly, is that the government is running a systemic regime of torture and child abuse—and I respectfully put it to you that that is not out of order.

            <p>
             On the point of order raised by Senator O'Sullivan, there is no use of unparliamentary language or reflection upon another senator because it was not directed at another senator. However, Senator
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKim" rel="nofollow">
              McKim
             </a>
             , I urge you to read standing order 73. I have had discussions with party leaders about standing order 73 and its particular restriction that says questions shall not contain arguments, inferences, imputations, epithets or ironical expressions, among others things. That question, in my view, does not comply with standing order 73. I will, as I have said before, invite the minister to answer the parts of that question which were in order—and there were parts of that question that were in order. But I have warned senators that I will start applying standing order 73.

              I'm assuming that, because we're on broadcast today, Senator
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKim" rel="nofollow">
               McKim
              </a>
              decided he would trump Senator Whish-Wilson and ask a question similar to that which he asked yesterday. But I completely dismiss the assertions that Senator McKim has made in relation to the situation on Nauru. I am aware of media reporting about the matter of an
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Health" rel="nofollow">
               International Health
              </a>
              and Medical Services senior medical officer departing Nauru on 17 October 2018. This is, of course, a matter for the government of Nauru. I am advised that there has been no impact to the continuity of care for transferees and refugees on Nauru and that another senior medical officer remains on the island. I am also advised that there are 65 health professionals contracted by the Australian government to provide health services on Nauru, including 33 mental health professionals. These services are available seven days a week and after hours. Colleagues may be interested to know that this equates to a ratio of one medical professional for every 11 transferees on the island.
             </p>
             <p>
              Again, though, Senator McKim does need to be reminded of why this situation has occurred. And, yet again, Senator McKim, as we move towards the election, there is a very clear choice between those of us in the coalition government, who will always ensure that Australia's borders are secure, and those in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Greens
              </a>
              and the

               Australian Labor Party

              , who the minute they get into office, if they are elected, would ensure that the calamity and chaos that occurred under the previous Rudd-Gillard Labor government will occur yet again.

                   . The point of order is on the basis of relevance. I understand that the minister has said the words that she rejects the premise of the question. I do understand that. The issue, though, Mr President, is that I have directly put to the minister that the information she just gave to the parliament in her previous answer is inaccurate. I use the word 'lie' in relation to what the

                   has said. It's the same as the minister has said. So could you please direct the minister to answer the question and to be clear about whether her rejection of the premise is actually a rejection of that assertion.

                     Again, then, for the record, I am advised that there has been no impact on the continuity of care for transferees and refugees on Nauru and that another senior medical officer remains on the island. I will also reiterate for the record that I'm advised that there are 65 health professionals contracted by the Australian government to provide health services on Nauru, including 33 mental health professionals. Again, these services are available seven days a weeks and after hours. Again, Senator

Can you please commit that you will seek further advice on this and remit to the Senate the response from the department specifically to my assertion, which I believe to be fact, that appointments have been cancelled today and no alternative appointments offered?
