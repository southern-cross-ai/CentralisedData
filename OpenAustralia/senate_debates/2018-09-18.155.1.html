         The amendments on JC502 address issues raised by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee and also facilitates the intended operation of the bill. The amendments give people with a family home a better opportunity to avoid bankruptcy and keep control of their home. The amendments also ensure that the protections afforded by the bill's payment-to-income ratio and the three-year proposal cap are better targeted at vulnerable debtors. I will outline the amendments on JC502.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments (1) and (4) lengthen the commencement of most of the bill's provisions from six to nine months post the royal assent. This extension is in recognition of the technical complexity of the amendments proposed in this bill which will require additional time to ensure the

         systems of the regulator, the Australian Financial Security Authority, are fully operational on commencement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments (2), (16), (26), (31) and (36) modify description of intent. These amendments modify the description of the fault element of applicable offences in the bill and the Bankruptcy Act 1966 from 'with a view to' to 'with the intention of'. The bill also introduces offences for debt agreement administrators that offer to give inducements to creditors to influence a debt agreement vote. These amendments ensure the framing of these offences introduced by the bill and the similar offences at section 60-21 of schedule 2 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 are consistent with the Criminal Code Act 1995.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments (2), (3), (9), (12), (14), (15), (22), (24), (25), (28), (29), (30), (36) and (33) prohibit self-administered debt agreements. These amendments expressly prohibit debtors from proposing to self-administer their own debt agreements. To ensure all debtors receive the benefit of an appropriately qualified debt agreement administrator, the bill mandates that only a registered debt agreement administrator, a registered trustee or the official trustee can be authorised to administer a debt agreement. The requirement for registration as a debt agreement administrator or trustee under the Bankruptcy Act 1966 prevents self-administered debt agreements from being established. Therefore, for clarity, and to prevent administrative inefficiencies, the amendments expressly prohibit the proposal of self-administered debt agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments (3), (6), (8), (10), (11), (13), (21) and (34), from the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, relate to the payment-to-income ratio. These particular amendments respond to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee query as to whether the Attorney-General should retain the power to alter the eligibility requirements for debt agreements. The bill allows the Attorney-General to alter the eligibility requirements for debt agreements through amending their permissible payment-to-income ratio. The introduction of this ratio will provide an important safeguard, ensuring debtors are not able to enter into repayment obligations that are unsustainable. This allows the Attorney-General to initially set and then amend the permissible level of this ratio, which is also important as it allows the ratio to be quickly amended to adjust to changing market conditions. However, taking on board the committee's comments, these amendments reduce the scope of debt agreements to which the ratio will apply and thereby limit the Attorney-General's ability to set the eligibility requirements. The amendments will allow debtors to exceed the payment-to-income ratio if their financial situation is subjected to heavier scrutiny by their administrator and the administrator concludes the proposed repayments are sustainable. A 60-penalty-unit strict liability offence applies to administrators that abuse this option.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments (5), (18) and (21) relate to debtors with a home to protect. In recognition of the fact that debtors with a home to protect stand to lose more under bankruptcy than other debtors, this amendment relaxes the debtor protection safeguards of the three-year debt agreement time frame limitation and the payment-to-income ratio. Together amendments (5), (18) and (21) give debtors with equity in their principal place of residence the flexibility to exceed the payment-to-income ratio and to propose a debt agreement of up to five years. These amendments extend the accessibility of the debt agreement system and provide debtors with a home to protect a viable alternative to bankruptcy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments (7), (8) and (21) respond to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee recommendations that the cost of living for low-income households, the average cost of housing and the potential
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
          CPI
         </a>
         increases be considered when setting the payment-to-income ratio. Therefore these amendments will modify the payment-to-income ratio formula to introduce a low-income debtor amount to the numerator so it can better take into account the circumstances of low-income debtors, who may be more vulnerable to financial stress. By adding a low-income debtor amount, the formula better accounts for two things—firstly, low-income debtors, who generally spend a high proportion of their income on basics, and, secondly, debtors who have atypical circumstances such as those receiving assistance from employers or family.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendment (17), (27), (32) and (36) respond to queries raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. The bill and section 60-21 of schedule 2 of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 include offences of three months imprisonment for commercial misconduct. These amendments increase these penalties to six months imprisonment to achieve consistency with principles in the guide on framing Commonwealth offences. The government considers that six months imprisonment is an appropriate punishment for commercial misconduct which unfairly disadvantages some creditors over other creditors.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amendments (18), (19), (20) and (23) will allow debtors to vary their debt agreements by up to five years in total if they suffer a substantial and unforeseen change in circumstances after the agreement has been established that is likely to prevent them from completing their debt agreement. These amendments respond to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee recommendation that the bill be amended to allow for debt agreements implemented under a three-year cap to be capable of being extended by up to an additional two years, by agreement of the debtor, creditor and debt agreement administrator. The amendments' requirement for a substantial and unforeseen change in the circumstances preserves the debtor protection safeguard of the three-year limitation on debt agreement proposals while introducing some flexibility to ensure debtors are not unfairly disadvantaged due to an unanticipated setback. Finally, amendment (35) corrects an erroneous reference in subsection 186A(2) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 which gives administrators an exception to satisfying the basic eligibility test.
