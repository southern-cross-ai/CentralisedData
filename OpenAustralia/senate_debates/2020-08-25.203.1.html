        Amendments made to the Act in 2018 authorised the Supreme Court to sit on the Australian mainland in the exercise of its civil and criminal jurisdiction. These amendments allowed for a matter to be heard and a jury to be empanelled in another state or territory. The measures were modelled on similar amendments made for

        The amendments in the bill address some technical issues with respect to these provisions regulating off-island sittings of the Supreme Court and also clarify the basis under which travelling allowances are determined for its judges.

        Charge) Bill 2020 provides for export charges to be imposed on dairy cattle and sets the rate of provision on a per head basis on the export of dairy cattle.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A range of statutory agricultural levies and charges are currently collected and disbursed on behalf of Australia's primary industries. These levies and charges are imposed at the request of relevant industries to enable the funding of essential services including research and development (R&amp;D) and marketing through the 15 research and development corporations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The livestock export industry has requested government to impose this statutory charge on dairy cattle exports of $6 per head of dairy cattle exported. This will replace the current voluntary $6 per head charge on exported dairy cattle which industry has identified is under-collected and is not sufficient to meet the needs of the sector.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Livestock Export Corporation (LiveCorp), as the research and development corporation which receives livestock export industry charges, will use the funds to meet the marketing and research and development needs of the dairy cattle export sector. This includes the funding of the Dairy Cattle Export Program, which aims to improve research and development specific to dairy cattle exports, focusing on animal health and welfare, supply chain efficiency and regulatory performance and market access for dairy cattle exports.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is a supplier of quality dairy cattle to the world, with Australian dairy cattle held in high regard due to their ability to consistently produce high quality fresh milk. Through the export of Australian dairy cattle to other markets, Australian farmers and exporters are helping to develop dairy herds while establishing strong relationships with key trading partners and our regional neighbours.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is a world leader in animal welfare practices and our involvement in the livestock export trade provides us with the opportunity to influence animal welfare conditions in importing countries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian livestock export industry is a valuable industry that supports the livelihoods of our rural and regional communities across Australia. The Australian livestock export industry contributes over $1.8 billion annually to the Australian economy and provides employment for many Australians either directly or in associated industries. Export of dairy cattle is an important alternate source of income for many dairy farmers, particularly those affected by drought and the current global pandemic. The dairy cattle export industry is valued at over $200 million, with over 100,000 cattle exported in 2019 to a number of markets, including China, Indonesia, Pakistan and Japan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This government is committed to supporting the goal of agriculture being a $100 billion industry by 2030. Getting the most from our investment in research and development and marketing is an important component to seeing this goal succeed.
       </p>

        This Bill introduces amendments to the

        to provide for export charges to be imposed on dairy cattle and set the rate of provision on a per head basis on the export of dairy cattle. The current export charge on beef and breeder cattle remains unchanged.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These measures will enable appropriate funding to be made available for marketing and R&amp;D activities for the dairy cattle export sector, to ensure a competitive, sustainable industry for the future.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superannuation" rel="nofollow">
         Superannuation
        </a>
        Amendment (PSSAP
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Membership" rel="nofollow">
         Membership
        </a>
        ) Bill 2020 extends membership of the Public Sector Superannuation Accumulation Plan to certain current and former Commonwealth employees who are not otherwise eligible to continue making contributions to a fund run by the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The PSSap, which was established on 1 July 2005, is the current default fund for new Commonwealth employees and employees of prescribed Commonwealth entities. As a fully funded accumulation scheme, the PSSap provides more modern, flexible superannuation arrangements than the older Commonwealth defined-benefit superannuation schemes, all of which are now closed to new members.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill ensures that the 'choice of fund' principle extends appropriately to Commonwealth public sector schemes. It allows current and former PSSap members to avoid paying multiple fees to maintain separate funds under different trustees. This bill will support them in saving for their retirement.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In 2017, changes to the PSSap were made to allow former PSSap members to use their existing PSSap account for future contributions if they are no longer in Commonwealth employment and are undertaking employment in which they receive superannuation guarantee contributions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will further expand the circumstances in which a former PSSap contributory member can use their existing PSSap account in respect of any employment, not just employment that attracts a superannuation guarantee obligation, and to make other contributions, such as non-concessional contributions. PSSap contributory members will also be able to make contributions to their account in respect of any non-Commonwealth employment that they undertake concurrently to their Commonwealth employment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill will also allow certain members of the main Australian government defined benefit civilian superannuation schemes, the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme and the Public Sector Superannuation Scheme who are currently contributing or preserved benefit members to establish a PSSap account where they choose to also have future superannuation contributions held by the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reforms contained in this bill are consistent with the government's broader superannuation objectives to lower the costs that members incur for the administration and management of their superannuation accounts.
       </p>
