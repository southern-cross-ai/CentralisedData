        I present the report of the Joint Standing Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital
        </a>
        and External Territories on the visit to Norfolk Island from 2 to 5 August 2006. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee undertook its recent visit to Norfolk Island in order to renew its relationship with the government and people and to engage in discussions on matters of mutual concern, particularly in light of the changes foreshadowed to the island’s governance arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        While on Norfolk Island, the committee held discussions with members of the Norfolk Island government and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legislative_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         Legislative Assembly
        </a>
        and members of the wider community. The committee was also given the opportunity to undertake a tour of the island’s facilities and infrastructure, including the hospital, waste management facilities, the Kingston Jetty and the Kingston and Arthur’s Vale Historic Area. In addition, the committee attended a reception hosted by the Administrator at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House" rel="nofollow">
         Government House
        </a>
        , a dinner hosted by the business community and a dinner hosted by the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly.
       </p>
       <p>
        It gives me great pleasure to report that the committee received a most cordial welcome and that our discussions with members of the community and their elected representatives were positive and constructive. We hope that this report, which examines matters raised during our recent visit, will provide some guidance to the Australian government regarding the current concerns and future needs of the people of Norfolk Island.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee notes that many of the issues raised during its recent visit are issues that have been raised before and addressed in the committee’s reports on Norfolk Island governance, tabled in December 2003 and November 2005. Our visit highlighted the fact that most of the actions recommended by the committee in its previous governance reports remain relevant to the process of reform of governance currently being undertaken.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee believes, as indicated in its previous reports, that the extension of Commonwealth laws to Norfolk Island is essential to the future wellbeing of the Norfolk Island community. As Australian citizens, the people of Norfolk Island should have access to the same benefits and share the same responsibilities as their fellow Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        In stating this, however, the committee understands the need to implement Australian law in a way that is sensitive to the unique circumstances of Norfolk Island. The Norfolk Island community must be given the opportunity to adjust to its new circumstances. This will require an investment in time and money on the part of the Commonwealth in order to bring services up to mainland standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        While making these observations, the committee notes that the process of reform on Norfolk Island has already taken a large step forward. On 21 August, the Norfolk Island government met with the minister for territories. That meeting concluded with positive indications of compromise for future negotiations on matters of detail.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee understands that in coming months the people of Norfolk Island will face significant challenges as a range of reforms are introduced to the system of governance. The committee is confident that the Norfolk Island community has the necessary resilience to overcome these challenges and move on to an even more prosperous future as an integral part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth of Australia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        While the committee was on Norfolk Island, the circumstances of certain landholders within the Kingston and Arthur’s Vale Historic Area were brought to its attention. These landholders have been denied permission to build on freehold land under the provisions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
        </a>
        1999. They have not received any compensation for the effective loss of their land and will apparently receive none. The result, in the committee’s view, is a denial of natural justice.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to express, on behalf of the committee, our gratitude to all those who made our visit such a success—in particular, the

I also thank my committee colleagues for their cooperation and contribution throughout the course of the visit.

        Mr Deputy President, on behalf of the committee I commend the report to the Senate.
