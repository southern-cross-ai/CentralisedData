        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator McKenzie. Can the minister please outline how our government is supporting regional Australians through the COVID-19 pandemic, including as part of the national plan agreed to by national cabinet?

         Thank you, Senator Davey, for your question. Our government understands regional Australians facing lockdowns are asking immediate questions about their incomes, about the weeks ahead and about the pathway back to a normal life when we learn to live with this virus. Rural and regional Australians are feeling the ongoing impact of the pandemic, particularly the delta variant, which has forced two entire states into lockdown and seen localised lockdowns within states, and border communities particularly are feeling the effects. However, until we reach the recommended vaccination targets, lockdowns are the most effective way to stop the spread and they will still be necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government are ensuring the financial security of those who live or work in a Commonwealth hotspot through the COVID disaster payment, and we have already delivered $4 billion in support to over 1.6 million Australians. Regional Australians, like others, are doing the right thingâ€”they are pulling up their sleeves and getting vaccinated in record numbers. We have already seen 17 million doses delivered so far, 4.6 million of those in regional Australia. We must back the science and the evidence that inform our national plan. Once we achieve our target of 70 to 80 per cent vaccinations, Australians will be able to get back to a sense of normality, restrictions will be able to be safely eased, and lockdowns will become a thing of the past. Our government is particularly committed to making that happen and to providing Australians with the necessary support so that we can learn to live with the virus, not fear it. We are assisting regional families with child care, providing gap-free waivers to relieve the burden of out-of-pocket costs when their children cannot attend care. We have also extended telehealth and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBS" rel="nofollow">
          NBS
         </a>
         items. Telehealth can't replace face-to-face health services but it is critical, particularly with the mental health impacts of lockdowns that we see now.

           We know regional businesses are suffering through the lockdowns as much as their urban counterparts, even where there has been no COVID. What is our government doing to help manage them through the impacts of the lockdowns and the border restrictions that are currently in place?

            Our government has partnered with each of the state and territory governments to roll out business support packages tailored to their specific needs. In my home state of Victoria, we've combined with the Andrews government to deliver $1.46 million to around 18,000 regional businesses doing it tough during lockdowns, to help them with those ongoing operational costs so that, when the lockdowns lift, they can get back to business and employ people as quickly as possible. We're assisting local businesses, such as childcare providers, with further support for the sector, which will benefit over 2,000 providers in regional Victoria and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
             NSW
            </a>
            . We've committed more than $4.9 billion to the aviation sector. Our primary producers are also supported, and we're addressing airfreight shortages and the disrupted supply chain for exports through the international freight assistance mechanisms. We've got the Agriculture Workers' Code. These measures are all vital to keeping our primary industry sector growing, harvesting and feeding not only our nation but the world.

               and Nationals government has stood ready to assist states and territories with additional support through this pandemic. Most recently, we deployed support to regional
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
                NSW
               </a>
               , where we've seen increasing case numbers. Around 50 ADF personnel are currently supporting NSW police in Dubbo, Bourke and Wilcannia, and an additional 70 ADF personnel are supporting the Western NSW Local Health District to provide pop-up vaccination clinics in remote and regional communities such as Walgett, Coonamble and Gilgandra.
              </p>
              <p>
               While this support is absolutely critical right now, it won't be required when we reach the vaccination targets outlined in the national plan. Our plan is based on the best available data and science and is agreed to by all state and territory governments as part of national cabinet. I am particularly buoyed by the support of the Labor Party, with Mr Albanese finally backing Bill and Joel in getting behind the national plan as the only way to end lockdowns and get back to normal.
