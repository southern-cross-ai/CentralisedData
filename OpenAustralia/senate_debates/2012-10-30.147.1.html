         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p>
         Army
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) (a) and (b) Army Reserve Training Days are not allocated per se, as differing ranks and trades have a different cost per day. An Army Reserve Training Salary budget is allocated to Commands and then to Units. For
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Year" rel="nofollow">
          Financial Year
         </a>
         2011/12, Army's total Army Reserve Training Salary budget allocation was $130.783 million. The amount expended during the second half of the Financial Year 2011/12 was $65.657 million. It should be noted that the initial allocation at the beginning of Financial Year 2011/12 was $122.281 million which was continuously adjusted throughout the Financial Year in response to the dynamic budget prioritisation process.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) (a) Approximately 357,780 Army Reserve Training Days were used by Army on a National basis in the second half of Financial Year 2011/12.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) An approximation, based upon a pro-rata calculation of the number of Active Reserve personnel in each state, as at 30 June 2012, and the actual expenditure to provide those Army Reserve Training Days, is as follows:
