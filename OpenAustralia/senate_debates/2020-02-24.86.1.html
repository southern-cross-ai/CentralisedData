         is, of course, entitled to his views but let me tell you what the government's position is. The government's position is that we will continue to make decisions that are environmentally effective and economically responsible. What we will not do is take the reckless approach of the Labor Party, which the Australian people rejected at the last election, and that is to make meaningless promises without a plan, without a costing, without any information to the Australian people on what the impacts on the economy, on jobs, on living standards and, indeed, on global emissions are going to be, because the Australian people actually understand this very well. Imposing burdens in Australia on Australian business will just lead to shifting emissions to other parts of the world where emissions will be higher for the same level of economic output. It is not helping to address climate change. It is imposing a sacrifice here in Australia but not actually helping the environment. I would have thought that out of all people Senator Kitching would have known about this given that she's a senior member of the Otis group.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, we know that there's an opportunity for bipartisan policy in relation to climate change and energy. Senator Farrell is leading the rebellion.

        </p>
        <p>
         I'm quite surprised that Senator Kitching would be asking me these questions. I would have thought that Senator Kitching would be supportive of our commitment to pursue policies that are environmentally effective and economically responsible.

           Cutting emissions is one of the most serious economic and environmental challenges and opportunities we collectively face.

           My focus is on developing an achievable road map which will get us to a point of net zero emissions by 2050, or earlier.

            I can tell you what the government's view is when it comes to emissions reductions and that is that we have committed to a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction target by 2030, which represents a 50 per cent reduction on a per capita basis, a two-thirds reduction on an emissions intensity basis. What is Labor's commitment to an emissions reduction target for 2030? You seem to have run for the hills when it comes to your 2030 emissions reduction target. I guess—

               We will make decisions in the national interest around a policy agenda that is environmentally effective and economically responsible. Let me tell you this: in Australia we are a net exporter of energy. We are net exporters of energy sources. You know what? Our energy supplies like
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
                LNG
               </a>
               , black coal and others can help reduce emissions by more. If we are not careful, in terms of the decisions that we make here, and if we don't properly calibrate the decisions when it comes to emissions in Australia, we could be doing harm to the global environment. That is why, unlike the Labor Party, unlike Mr Albanese and Mr Butler, who are pursuing an extremist, reckless and irresponsible approach when it comes to these issues, we will continue to make reasonable, responsible decisions focused on being environmentally effective and economically responsible.
