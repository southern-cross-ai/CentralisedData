         I thank the parliamentary secretary for his attendance today. I must in passing say that I admire his ability to come into the breach in the way that he has in what is a very difficult piece of legislation. I ask the parliamentary secretary if the change to the commencement date is about the two-year roundtable transition period and whether that is the only relevant alteration to this date.

          I thank the senator for his question. In the Senate on 10 October 2012, the government circulated proposed amendments to the legislation and we believe those amendments fully reflect the outcomes of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientist" rel="nofollow">
           Chief Scientist
          </a>
          's roundtable.
         </p>
         <p>
          Specifically concerning the transition period, the offence provisions relating to the bill's strengthened export control provisions will not take immediate effect, rather there will be a transition period of up to 24 months. We believe this will enable all relevant sectors to become familiar with their obligations under the bill.

           Much obliged to the minister for that. When the minister says a transitional period of up to 24 months, in dealing with criminal sanctions, I would have thought it is either 24 months or it is not. Could the minister clarify.

            As I understand it, the government had resolved to adopt a process where a period of up to 24 months was available, and it was open to accept a shorter period if that was the recommendation given to government. So it was a process that was flexible but, obviously up to 24 months, the government takes due regard for the concerns you are pointing out but does provide the flexibility to move faster than that if that is the advice government receives.

             That is the advice from the steering committee or is it ministerial discretion to abbreviate the 24-month period at his discretion absolutely?

                    The longer answer—the shorter one having failed, Senator—is this defence trade treaty was signed in 2007. As you are aware, the draft bill was released for public consultation on 15 July 2011. The bill was then introduced into the parliament on 2 November 2011 and has undergone detailed consideration by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. After two public hearings and considering some 31 submissions, the committee has now reported on the bill.

                      Yes. It is not a matter to which I have been advised, and I am not in a position to say there is any nexus between the two. I am, obviously, familiar with the political debates surrounding this legislation, and I appreciate the point that the senator is seeking to make in that political debate. But as far as this process is concerned that is not a matter that sits on my list of issues to deal with or respond to.

                       I enjoy reading between the lines of Senator Feeney's comments greatly! It is not in his set of talking points. The fact is that everybody is well aware of: this bill was being rushed through in flawed form, ambiguous form and extremely dangerous form, in my view—judging by the comments of some of the coalition senators and, indeed, Senator Feeney, by your own colleagues who are very schooled in this particular portfolio—to meet an artificial timetable of a press conference.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Presumably, Senator Feeney, you will be completely surprised when this comes up in the joint press conference that occurs in Perth next month.

                             290—it talks of provisions not commencing within the period of two years. How is anticipated, given the provisions of section 74, that those stakeholders—researchers educational and private—will know which portions of the legislation are not in effect during the period? How are we going to convey that, given that there is a 10-year jail sentence for a breach of some of these positions? How are we going to keep a weather eye out as to when these criminal sanctions actually apply?

Is it a gazette; is it a parliamentary statement? What is it?

                                     Minister, could you tell me what you mean by the word 'releases'? I have seen a few proclamations and they talk in broad terms of the bill. What we have is a whole host of sections within this that have an as yet undetermined commencement date. All I am looking for in this legislation is some certainty so that Australian citizens subjected to the legislation know and are deemed to know where they stand at any given time. How do they keep up with what has commenced and what has not commenced? Is there going to be a proclamation section by section?

                                      I suppose the only further description I can give is that the government will engage in outreach. There will be press releases, there will be information crafted for the stakeholder groups you have described. The government will make the appropriate effort to make sure all of those persons and institutions that are required to know, or that have an interest in the matter, have access to the appropriate information.

They will know by virtue of the fact that there will be an information and outreach campaign that is appropriate to this legislation, and while that will include the public utterances of the minister it is not the only mechanism for achieving that outreach.

                                         It is a remarkable deflection of Senator Johnston's question that when asked how this befuddled situation will be clarified the minister then pointed the senator to an amendment hammered out with the Australian Greens. We are voting against this bill. Let me be clear: I am not happy with the form of the amendments or with the form of the bill, no matter what occurs in the committee stage. I appreciate that the minister has opened up into negotiations on good faith, and I think we have something here that is an improvement on where it was, but it is remarkable to hear the parliamentary secretary refer the opposition by way of improvement to what we have managed to put together. I am glad we did; I am still going to vote against this bill.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Greens amendment (1) on sheet 7297 provides a timetable which outlines a schedule as to when penalties would apply, so this goes towards Senator Johnston's question from before. The amendment more accurately represents the results of the roundtable discussion between Defence and the universities, and serves to make clearer what conduct the law prohibits, what conduct would constitute an offence and when penalties would begin to kick in for each. Senator Johnston is quite right to point out the alarming degree of ambiguity that was introduced in the initial drafting.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         I am not necessarily convinced that this amendment completely cleans that up, by the way. This was the best we were able to achieve in the very limited time that we had. Because the government was present at the roundtable discussions—and I know this schedule more accurately represents what was decided—I understand and appreciate that the government is at least willing to support this amendment. It is worth acknowledging, because often you will see a government ploughing on, bloody-minded and not willing to acknowledge that a better way could have been found. This is one instance—and I suspect I have the coalition's support on this amendment as well—in which some ground was ceded and some negotiations were entered into. It is not perfect but it is better than it was, and I commend it to the Senate.

                                              I make the point that you are creating an offence for a person who engages in 'dealings relating to goods or technology'. My obvious follow-up question, if you cannot tell me what dealings means, is: what does 'relating to' actually mean? Bear in mind, again, that these are criminal sanctions.

                                                So in order to understand 'dealings' one has to go to the word 'supply'. Why was the word 'supply' not used? How does 'dealings' take the matter any further if 'supply' is the definition of 'dealings'? You say 'arrangement for other persons to engage in dealings relating to' and 'supply relating to' is what you are saying that means. Is that correct?

                                                  I do not think that answers my question. Paragraph (b) of part 2 of clause 3 says 'creates offences for persons who':

                                                  You have told me that 'dealings' is the supply of technology. This means to arrange for persons to engage in the 'supply' of technology relating to goods. Why have we chosen the word 'dealings' on that basis? Why are we using the word 'dealings', which is a very vague term, a term that I do not think it is in common parlance, a term that actually complicates and unnecessarily broadens the scope of the legislation? I will come back to the words 'supply' and 'arrange' in a moment, but after we have dealt with 'dealings', I want to deal with the words 'relating to'.

                                                   I think you are going to questions of drafting and the precise legal implications of using particular words. Those are not matters I can assist you with at the moment. Those are matters I will have to take on notice, because that goes to the advice and in particular the legal advice that formed the foundation for the drafting process.

                                                    I accept that, and in line with my original commentary about dealing with what is a very complex matter, we go to the word 'arrange' in 5A. In 5A you have sought to define the word 'arranges', a plural. The clause deals with the word 'arrange', which is singular. But let's ignore that for the moment for the sake of understanding where we are going. You have sought to set up a framework that identifies brokering arrangements. I am trying to clarify where this is going on two bases: firstly, commercial, so that if there is a fee payable or a benefit then that is a brokering; secondly, if someone is doing something but is motivated by political, religious or ideological motivations. But many people arrange things because they do things by way of assistance, by way of a charitable or benevolent motivation that is almost like a voluntary help scenario that involves no money. For instance, I am thinking of a freight forwarder who simply moves something from A to B, but it is not referable directly to a fee or a commercial return. Tell me how to get around that example.

Rather the target of the investigation, if I can use that phraseology, would be the person or organisation that had arranged the transaction.

How do you define in 5A(1)(a) an 'intermediary'? What is an 'intermediary' strictly?

                                                          I would like to take the minister back to the word 'supply'. In one of your amendments, we come to the word 'supply', and you have changed that. Let us just deal with that as if that amendment has gone through, so I will disregard the wording in the bill but look at your amendment—I think it is (5) on sheet
                                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BM" rel="nofollow">

                                                          Is the word 'access' such that there is an intent, so far as this bill goes, to provide such access? Do you envisage the word 'access' to be an active motivated action within the terms of the bill or does 'access' simply mean something that happens through lack of vigilance?
                                                         </p>

                                                          The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: Before I call the minister, I remind the committee that we are actually considering government amendment (2) on sheet BM290. Senator Johnston, you did jump forward to an amendment later on.
                                                         </p>

                                                          The reason I have done that is that the amendment we are dealing with now uses the word 'supply', which is subsequently changed. So I am just trying to be helpful—which is my nature—and deal with the amendment that we are dealing with but read into it the intended amendment. Maybe I should not do that and it is a bit presumptuous of me. I have advised the minister that we will be supporting that amendment, so I am trying to be helpful, which I probably should not be doing, but it is my nature.

This amendment is being similarly rushed. We will not call a division until a little bit later in the session, but I do want to strongly record the Greens' objections to the way the government has handled this debate.

As before, Senator Johnston should not have been put in this position; nor should his staff, for that matter. That we are analysing amendments that have been passed around the chamber shortly before we need to debate them and put them to the vote is a pretty contemptuous way of treating the Australian academic and research community quite frankly. It has put my staff through an enormous amount of stress and pressure trying to come up with ways of fixing this debacle.
                                                                </p>

                                                                 These amendments should have been, could have been, investigated, analysed and scrutinised by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee—as is its job—on which Senator Johnston sits. Again, when it comes to it, we will not be calling a division but I do record the Greens' objections to the way that this process has been handled. I look to Senator Johnston to see if he is ready to make his contribution on this amendment, otherwise we should simply put the question and move on.

You have two separate definitions there. In 5A (2), which is the definition of 'arranges', what is the reason and the motivation behind the subsection (2) that does not limit the meaning of 'arranges' for the purpose of the act. What does that mean?

I strongly believe that this bill will be passed into law in a flawed and unworkable form that will create unnecessary and dangerous ambiguity for people with no connection and no interest in doing defence research who will nonetheless be brought within the clauses of this bill. It is a grave mistake that the chamber is making today.

It does not do exactly what we were hoping it would do, and I will speak about that in a little more detail when we get to it, but it made more sense to move this one first.
                                                                                             </p>

I believe it may also be the preferred option to some of the universities and some of those who have taken an active stance in this debate. My understanding is also that it is not acceptable to the government—and I will let Senator Feeney speak for himself—because it could be interpreted as switching off the whole act for the information that is listed.

Our form of words carves out the information from the offences only by creating a defence, which I acknowledge is not the approach that Senator Johnston took.
                                                                                             </p>

I think the government feels that some of what is covered in our amendment is already covered in other parts of the bill and also that aspects of what we have proposed undermine the intent of the bill. The government has therefore proposed a statement of principle to supplement this, which goes some way towards allaying some concerns.
                                                                                             </p>

So, without a great deal of hope unless there has been a late change of heart, I commend this amendment to the chamber.

I can confirm that the government will not be supporting this particular amendment. The government's position is that the effect of the proposed amendment would be to exempt anybody claiming to be conducting research from the entire bill. This is a far broader effect than the US exception for fundamental research, and this is because Australia and the US have different legal and defence export arrangements. This type of exception is not required in Australia, because the bill does not contain any provisions which seek to regulate the outcomes of research. This amendment would undermine the basic intent of the legislation, which the government asserts is to control the intangible supply of technology related goods listed in the DSGL.
                                                                                               </p>

This includes how to manufacture and use sensitive equipment such as a mass spectrometer for a nuclear weapons laboratory and how to produce chemicals such as oxalyl chloride, required for chemical weapons. Apologies for any pronunciation errors there; my chemistry teacher will not be surprised!

The controls on intangible exports in the proposed legislation simply mean that the same goods cannot be virtually exported by giving information to a person overseas so they can make the same goods. The inclusion of such a broad loophole in Australia's legislation would fundamentally undermine the capacity of the bill to strengthen Australia's export controls relating to intangible technology. This would not meet the intent of Australia's commitment to the

The roundtable meetings recognised that not all research involving controlled technology will involve the level of detail that would require a permit. The agreed outcomes recognise that some research might involve the transfer of sensitive technology and that that should not be exempt from legislation. The agreed outcomes instead propose an implementation model which reduces the need to interact with government agencies on the legislative regime. This is specifically captured in the Chief Scientist's agreed outcomes as a model to be tested as part of the pilot. This model, to be tested during the transition period, involves academic institutions and a supplement to the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research. It enables institutions to access technology and to determine when a permit might be required. The steering group will report to parliament on the effectiveness of this model, and there will be an opportunity to amend the legislation based on the steering group report.

There are not many who have an interest in this subject matter, but those that do know that one of the abiding tenets that we wish to protect is that our competitive position in so far as research is concerned is not undermined in comparison to other countries of a similar capacity in Europe or
                                                                                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" rel="nofollow">

So we should not impose a burden, particularly on Australian universities, which are the essential and majority players in the research space in Australia, that other countries and other institutions within those countries are not subject to. In looking at this amendment we were conscious of the export administration regulations, particularly in the United States, and other provisions that relate from the

That is a matter for the government. I want to hear and I want to see the government say that that is not so, but, inevitably, this amendment talks about exclusions for research, education and information in the public domain and says that the act does not apply to:

This is probably the most contentious part of the legislation. The committee had a lot to say about this, and I think it is important that we put this on the record so that everybody knows what we are talking about in terms of this amendment and what we are talking about in terms of long-term oversight of research in Australia from the perspective of Wassenaar and other conventions and treaties controlling the export of DSGL technology, services, munitions lists, goods et cetera. I commend this amendment to the Senate.

The US export controls are complex, and this issue needs to be compared very carefully. As I am sure you have heard across this debate, Senator Johnston, we are not comparing apples with apples. It is simply not correct to suggest that universities and researchers in the United States do not have to comply with US export controls. US export control arrangements span multiple agencies and multiple control lists. There are numerous circumstances in which an export approval is required and numerous sets of exceptions that may apply.
                                                                                                 </p>

This type of exception does not apply in Australia because the bill does not contain any provisions that seek to regulate the outcomes of research.

The US government, the authority on US export controls, has made the following points very clear. First, there is no exception that allows controlled technology to be exported out of the US for fundamental research without US government authorisation. In fact, with limited exception, export controlled technology used by foreign researchers or students while in the US requires government authorisation prior to its transfer. This goes further than the provisions in this bill, which do not apply domestic controls within Australia.
                                                                                                 </p>

These include that the bill does not propose the conduct of research and, as a consequence, such safeguards are not relevant. The US system is quite a different model and regulates a much broader range of circumstances than are proposed by this bill. For example, foreign students are required to obtain permits to access or use controlled technology during their studies in the United States. In response to the university sector, Defence sought advice from the US government's agencies with responsibility for US export controls on the regulation of the US university and research sectors: both the Department of State and the Department of Commerce. This advice, which was duly provided by Ambassador Bleich to the Chief Scientist, is both clear and authoritative. It includes the following statements:

This means that foreign students, for example, are free to work and study here without the need for permits.
                                                                                                 </p>

A permit is only required if the researcher needs to share specific information about the controlled technology to a person overseas. I will, with the consent of the Senate, go through one example in an attempt to demonstrate this point. The example is a mass spectrometer. A sophisticated high-end mass spectrometer is a relatively common piece of laboratory equipment. It can be used by researchers to analyse water quality or in mining operations to analyse oil compositions. It is also used for measuring uranium isotopes and is a critical piece of equipment for a nuclear weapons program. This is why it is subject to export controls. Under the proposed legislation, a researcher in Australia would be able to use a mass spectrometer in their laboratory without restriction, regardless of their nationality. That researcher would also be able to use that mass spectrometer during the course of international collaboration on their research—again without restriction.
                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                 <p>
                                                                                                  The researcher could do their research, share the results of their research and indeed publish their results without any requirement to obtain a permit. A permit from Defence would only be required if that researcher were seeking to provide blueprints, design specifications or detailed instructions on how to use that mass spectrometer to a person overseas. It would be an offence to publish those blueprints, design specifications or detailed instructions in the public domain.
                                                                                                 </p>
                                                                                                 <p>

We say they are appropriate for the Australian environment. They also take account of our participation in international arrangements, like the Wassenaar arrangement, to which Senator Johnston referred earlier, and so continue Australia's contribution to counterproliferation of sensitive technologies.

                                                                                                  </p>

I think it certainly marks a major improvement on the drafting of the bill as it stands. I wish the Australian Greens amendment had carried, but, nonetheless, I am very happy to support the opposition's drafting.

The intent behind these rules is to identify as “fundamental research” basic and applied research in science and engineering, where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadly within the scientific community. Such research can be distinguished from proprietary research and from industrial development, design, production, and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restricted for proprietary reasons or specific national security reasons as defined in 734.11(b) of this part.

This document goes on to deal with the public domain. It also relates to a further description of fundamental research. This is 120.11 under the heading 'Public domain'; it sets out what that means. I will put that on the record in the two minutes I have left. I will continue on with this, Minister, when we get an opportunity.
