        We are marking one year since the tragic death of 'Jina' Mahsa Amini, who died in police custody after being arrested and beaten by Iran's morality police. Her horrific death sparked a mass movement in Iran. People from all walks of life joined together against the brutal regime. We saw incredible protests across Iran and the diaspora, and people from across the world joined in, including in Australia. Proudly, women are leading this revolution. We must acknowledge her Kurdish identity and the feminism of Kurdish women for an inclusive society and their struggle against an oppressive state. To this day, women and girls in Iran continue to march for freedom and lead with powerful acts of civil disobedience.

        are sick and tired of patriarchy and authoritarianism, which strives to control every aspect of their lives. They are taking action. They are not backing down, despite brutal repression. They are some of the bravest people on the planet, and I am in awe of their courage. We have mourned 'Jina' Mahsa Amini's loss and we have been inspired by the incredible strength in the movement as women, girls and allies call for change with such determination.

        The Labor government took far too long to take the little action that they announced today, but they are still not listening.

        to be listed as a terrorist organisation and we will continue to call on the international community to strongly condemn the ongoing human rights abuses. Things will change. The fire of change that has been ignited will only burn brighter. You are a formidable force and I am with you all the way.
