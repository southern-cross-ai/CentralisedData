         I thank Senator Payne for what is a very important question. I certainly acknowledge Senator Payne’s longstanding interest in matters relating to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         having regard to her position as chair of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. This is a very important question. On 25 August this year the Howard government announced funding of just under half a billion dollars for the Australian Federal Police. This has been the biggest funding boost for the Australian Federal Police since its inception in 1979. This funding will mean that the international deployment group will receive a boost of over 400 personnel in the very important work that it is doing overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
         In February 2004 we announced that there would be an international deployment group for the Australian Federal Police to cover the very good work that it does overseas. Of course, we have a longstanding tradition of assisting the

         , as we call it, has been doing great work in the Solomons, in

          East Timor
         </a>
         and in the region, in areas such as Vanuatu and Nauru. It is important that we put in place a plan for the future so that we can then deploy the Australian Federal Police where it is needed. The Howard government is totally committed to security in our region.

            That is not only in our region’s best interests but in the interests of this country. I know that Senators Conroy and Ludwig are not terribly interested by the comments that they are making but, of course, Australians are. This is a very important issue to Australians across—

                 Part of this announcement will include an operational response group of 150 personnel and that will ensure that we have a state of readiness should the need arise. We have seen in recent times, particularly this year in
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
                  East Timor
                 </a>
                 , even over recent days just how fragile the situation is in countries like East Timor and the Solomons. Of course, we realise we are there at their invitation and it is not a case of Australia just being able to barge in to another country and dictate terms of how we will assist. But we are certainly committed to assisting countries in our region in relation to capacity building for law enforcement and to assist them with issues which threaten their good governance and also threaten civil disruption.
                </p>
                <p>
                 This is a very significant announcement. It is a significant step forward for the Australian Federal Police and it is worthwhile to remember that as the Federal Police Commissioner,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Keelty" rel="nofollow">
                  Mick Keelty
                 </a>
                 , said, ‘There are in excess of 2,000 people who are queuing up to join the Australian Federal Police.’ That says a lot about the Australian Federal Police and the standing it enjoys in the Australian community and quite rightly so.
