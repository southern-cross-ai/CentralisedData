        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. When does the government expect to go past the current limit of $200 billion in total stock of Commonwealth government securities as approved by the parliament?

         I was going to let Senator Cormann know, because he made some comments publicly about this not being transparently disclosed in the budget papers, that this fact was disclosed in the budget papers, which I hope he would have had an opportunity to read in the six hours I assume he was in the lock-up. In fact, the Assistant Treasurer described this amendment to the

If you had done the work, Senator Cormann, you would have been aware of this as opposed to coming at it two days after the budget and leaping on it as if it was some sort of conspiracy in order to cover over your own incompetence in reading the budget papers.

               I am not sure I can control Senator Conroy. Others have tried, I suspect. It is the case that as a result of the lower levels of revenue that the government has experienced due to the global financial crisis and the impact of the natural disasters the debt cap will need to be extended.

On what day would the government's projections breach its effective debt ceiling currently approved by the parliament?

                    , the minister was very relevant because underlying that question was the issue that the minister was responding to. It would be inappropriate for me to use the point of order to do that, unlike how the opposition occasionally do. The minister has been dealing with the question by being directly relevant in responding to the question. I humbly submit that there is no point of order.

                      As I said, even Senator Joyce in public comments today made clear that even the opposition would not be so reckless as to oppose such an amendment. Senator Cormann knows that the amount of gross debt is articulated in the budget papers. It might assist him to be aware that the budget papers represent the market value of Commonwealth government securities as opposed to the legislation, which of course represents the face value.

                       , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the minister refers to all these special circumstancesâ€”floods, cyclones, tsunamis, the global financial crisis and so onâ€”why does the government then want a blank cheque from the parliament? Why does the government want to change the current requirement where the government has to declare special circumstances and table an explanation in both houses of parliament when it increases its debt above $75 billion? Why do you want to remove that requirement which is in the current legislation? Why do you want a blank cheque from the parliament?

They come in here and suggest that the government has not been transparent, when this is clearly articulated in the budget papers and in the appropriation bills. The question for the opposition is: if you are so concerned about debt, why are you opposing the government's savings measures? You cannot come in here and talk about debt while you are set to wreck the budget surplus.

                              My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. Can the minister outline to the Senate why it is important that budgets be framed within the government's strict fiscal rules?

                               I thank Senator Wortley for the question. The fact is that those on this side understand the need for budget discipline. Those on the other side are led by a man who is a risk to the Australian economy and a risk to the budget surplus. The fact is that the economic and fiscal circumstances in which the nation finds itself do require the sort of fiscal discipline the government is demonÂ­strating. We are moving, in this economy, from a period of short-term softness as a result of the patchwork economy, the high dollar and natural disastersâ€”all of which the opposition wish to ignoreâ€”to a period of long-term strength as the mining boom gathers pace. The budget we presented to this parliament recognises this. It puts in place strict spending discipline and builds surpluses in the years ahead so that government does not compound price pressÂ­ures in the economy.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               The issue is that those on the other side like to talk about budget discipline and they like to talk about surpluses. There is a lot of talk. But, to deliver a surplus, you have to ensure you put in place savings measures. Those on that side, who like to pretend they are fiscal conservatives, should explain to the Australian peopleâ€”

Senator Fifield worked for Mr Costello long enough to know you do not get a surplus without getting savings measures in place. But you have your shadow Treasurer and your leader out there opposing the government's savings measures. You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Senator Fifield.

                                        and Mr Abbott to consider the budget position properly. Mr Costello, when he was Treasurer, stated how an opposition should do a proper budget reply. He said:
                                       </p>
                                       <p class="italic">
                                        You do the tables as to what your policies are going to cost and how you're going to pay for them â€¦

                                        That is the test your guru, Mr Costello, set for your leader, Mr Abbott. Let us see how Mr Abbott measures up tonight. Will he actually put out policies which will bring the budget back to surplus, or will the coalition become the party of higher deficits? Now, just in case Mr Abbott does not, the government has in fact prepared very carefully what your budget position would look like, were you in government.

                                          . It is very simple. The government has put together the real story of Tony Abbott's budget reply, which showsâ€”because no doubt he will try and ensure he does not put any figures before the parliamentâ€”that the opposition is in deficit for every year of the budget period. You never come back to surplus. And do you know why? Because you run around talking about debt and surpluses without doing any of the work.
