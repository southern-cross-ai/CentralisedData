       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) Australians spend over one billion dollars per year on cosmetic surgery and cosmetic procedures,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) most of these surgeries and procedures occur outside of a hospital setting and, hence, escape regulatory oversight,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the cosmetic surgery and cosmetic procedure industry has expanded rapidly driven by the arrival of companies providing a low-cost, high-volume model, and driven by intense promotion on social media,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) there are a large variety of cosmetic procedures that aim to alter or modify a person's body or appearance, and all invasive cosmetic procedures carry risks,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) due to false and misleading advertising by unscrupulous businesses and untrained doctors these risks are minimised to entice patients into having risky cosmetic procedures,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) high-risk procedures include breast augmentation, which has grown from 5 000 patients a year to 20 000 patients in the past decade, and the use of certain Schedule 4 poisons, such as Botox or dermal fillers,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vii) the Therapeutic Goods Association says that the process of injecting dermal fillers is an invasive medical procedure that should only be undertaken by an experienced and qualified medical doctor, or a nurse under the direct supervision of a doctor,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (viii) these procedures are routinely performed by a person, other than a doctor, in locations such as beauty salons and private homes (in the form of Botox parties), where the risks can be catastrophic,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ix) in August 2017, a 35-year-old woman died two days after she suffered a cardiac arrest during a breast procedure at a Sydney beauty clinic performed by a person with no Australian medical qualifications,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (x) in April 2018, Australian doctors at the Ophthalmology Unit at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_of_Wales_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Prince of Wales Hospital
        </a>
        treated their first patient who was permanently blinded in one eye after being injected with a dermal filler in a beauty parlour,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (xi) many invasive cosmetic surgical procedures are being performed by doctors with a basic medical degree and no specialist surgical qualification, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (xii) these doctors have chosen to deliberately bypass formal accredited surgical training in Australia to cash-in on this booming market;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) recognises that practitioners of cosmetic surgery and cosmetic procedures must have patient safety as the paramount consideration, not profit; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) calls on the Federal Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) raise the issue of protecting the title 'cosmetic surgeon' with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        Health Council, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) work with the states to close registration loopholes, and enforce regulations to ensure no patient undergoing cosmetic surgery or procedures is harmed.
