       <p>
        I rise to raise serious concerns about the so-called 'Voices of' independent movement, funded by the big end of town, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Holmes" rel="nofollow">
         Simon Holmes
        </a>
        a Court's Climate 200 group, which is nothing more than a front for Labor and the Greens. When I dared to challenge Mr Holmes a Court over his disgraceful and offensive support of the failed section 44 challenge against the Treasurer founded on anti-Semitism, suggesting he may wish to pay the legal costs in Michael Staindl's failed court challenge, I was met with claims that I was some sort of 'crumb maiden'—that I was only here to pick up the crumbs of power, which apparently is what that means. This is sexist, denigrating and a clear case of misogyny.
       </p>
       <p>
        Climate 200's website says it wants to raise at least $15 million to $20 million for its 'independent' candidates. The website also refers to community groups which have formed to support pro climate, pro integrity and pro gender equality independents. There's nothing 'pro'—particularly nothing pro gender equality—about Mr Holmes a Court. He has a history of making offensive and disrespectful comments towards conservative women. He spoke of Senator Hume, accusing her of bitchiness and of not having a soul.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wrote to a number of independent candidates in Kooyong, Wentworth, Mackellar, Goldstein, Curtin and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        , asking whether, in light of these offensive comments, they would condemn Mr Holmes a Court, confirm that they support the respectful treatment of all women and confirm whether they would take any money from Mr Holmes a Court's Climate 200 group. Regrettably, there was absolutely no response from any of these so-called independent candidates, which says everything that electors need to know about their commitment to respect for all women.
