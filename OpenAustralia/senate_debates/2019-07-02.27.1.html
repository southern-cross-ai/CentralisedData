        I am pleased to advise that, at the election on 18 May 2019, Prime Minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Morrison
        </a>
        and the Liberal-National government were re-elected. Following this, the new ministry was sworn in on 29 May 2019. For the information of senators, I table the full ministry list, which includes representation arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        I advise the Senate that I have been reappointed as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        , and Senator Birmingham has been reappointed as the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. Senator Ruston has been appointed as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, and Senator Duniam has been appointed as the Deputy Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I can also advise that Senator Dean Smith has been re-elected as the Chief Government Whip in the Senate, and Senator McGrath and Senator Brockman have both been elected as deputy government whips in the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate those senators who have been appointed or reappointed to the ministry, as well as the 11 new senators who have joined us on this side of the chamber. I would also like to congratulate senators opposite who have been appointed to shadow ministerial or parliamentary roles, as well as those senators on the crossbench who were successful at the election. The government will continue to work with senators across the chamber to ensure the efficient and orderly management of the Senate and its business. I thank the Senate, and I seek leave to have the ministry list included in

        are shown in bold type. As a general rule, there is one department in each portfolio. The title of a department does not necessarily reflect the title of a minister in all cases. Ministers are sworn to administer the portfolio in which they are listed under the ‘Minister' column and may also be sworn to administer other portfolios in which they are not listed.
