         I have a question for the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Last night, when I circulated an amendment to the

         , you cried wolf about not having adequate time to even consider it. You said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Well, Senator Lambie, I don't think people just dump amendments on people and then expect them to vote for them. We will not be supporting the amendment. I'm reading this amendment for the first time myself.
        </p>
        <p>
         My amendment was one page and dealt with one issue. The government's amendments were circulated at 6.23 tonight. They're nine pages long. My question is simple: why are you not giving us adequate time to make informed decisions about how these changes will actually affect the people of Australia?

          As Senator Lambie would know, the amendments that have been circulated on behalf of the government deal with matters that have been well traversed in the public debate, especially over the last few days. They are a result of the discussions that the government has had with Senator

           Just moving on, in terms of Senator Lambie's statement to the Senate, I want to preface every single question that is being asked—I will say it by myself, but I'm sure that Senator Lambie, Senator Tyrrell and Senator Roberts will agree. I just want to remind the chamber and, in particular, the minister that the official records of parliamentary debates, which include questions in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_the_Whole" rel="nofollow">
            Committee of the Whole
           </a>
           stage, are a vital source of information when it comes to statutory interpretation. As Senator Lambie has rightly pointed out, at 6.23 pm the government's amendments to the most significant piece of industrial legislation that this place has seen for decades were circulated. One might say the government was treating the Senate with contempt, but that would be for some to say. There is significant uncertainty about how this legislation could be interpreted. Yes, we will be here till 11 pm, because there are so many questions that need to be asked and answered properly for the purposes of statutory interpretation going forward, and we will resume again tomorrow, and it is open-ended, but, due to the significant uncertainty about how this legislation could be interpreted—which, again, one may say, appears to be by deliberate design—it is important that we as a Senate, on behalf of every employer and employee in Australia, get clear and concise answers to provide guidance to those interpreting the government's legislative intent.
          </p>
          <p>
           In that regard, to be very clear on the
           <i>
            Hansard
           </i>
           record, I will quote from section 1 5AB of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 :
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the material that may be considered in accordance with that subsection in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           …    …    …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (e) any explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill containing the provision, or any other relevant document, that was laid before, or furnished to the members of, either House of the Parliament by a Minister before the time when the provision was enacted;
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (f) the speech made to a House of the Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill containing the provision be read a second time in that House;
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (g) any document (whether or not a document to which a preceding paragraph applies) that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document for the purposes of this section; and
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (h) any relevant material in the Journals of the Senate, in the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives or in any official record o f debates in the Parliament or either House of the Parliament.
          </p>
          <p>
           So I say to the Senate chamber that is the way in which I will be approaching each question that I ask.
          </p>
          <p>
           The questions I ask are being asked on behalf of employers in Australia. This bill will pass the Senate—we know that. Senator
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocock" rel="nofollow">
            Pocock
           </a>
           has given the government the vote that it needs. But after the bill passes the Senate, it goes back to the House. It will pass through the House of Representatives. The people of Australia deserve to know that employers are able to properly interpret the legislation and, in particular, the hundreds of questions that are going to be asked in committee stage that, to date, the government and the department either have been unable to or have failed to provide answers to.
          </p>
          <p>
           In that regard, before I turn to questions, in relation to the amendments that have been circulated by the minister on behalf of the government, can I ask: when were these amendments finalised—on what date and at what time?

            The short answer to your question is that the amendments were finalised today. But, as I said in response to Senator Lambie, the amendments all relate to matters that have been in the public arena since at least the weekend, after the government negotiated an outcome with Senator David
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocock" rel="nofollow">
             Pocock
            </a>
            . For the benefit of the chamber I'm happy to give a short explanation of what these amendments are.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government amendments in relation to bargaining include among the factors that the Fair Work Commission must take into account, in deciding which terms to include in a workplace determination, the significance to the employers and employees who will be covered by the workplace determination of any arrangements or benefits in a relevant enterprise agreement.
           </p>
           <p>
            They authorise the Fair Work Commission to have regard to 'reasonably foreseeable employees', make determinations on views about whether certain working arrangements are reasonably foreseeable and amend an agreement with retrospective effect, if necessary, to address a concern that the agreement does not pass the better off overall test as part of the new reconsideration process.
           </p>
           <p>
            The amendments provide that employers who employ fewer than 20 employees may not be added to a single-interest employer agreement or authorisation without their agreement.
           </p>
           <p>
            They provide that the operations and business activities of common-interest employers must be reasonably comparable for the purposes of making or varying a single-interest authorisation or agreement.
           </p>
           <p>
            They provide that for employers with 50 or more employees the onus is on the employer to establish that it is not a common-interest employer or that its operations and business activities are not reasonably comparable with the other employers.
           </p>
           <p>
            They provide the Fair Work Commission with discretion to refuse an application by a bargaining representative of an employee to add a new employer to a single-interest employer agreement or authorisation, if the Fair Work Commission is satisfied that on the day it will approve the relevant application less than nine months have passed since the most recent nominal expiry date of an effectively bargained agreement that covered the employer and relevant employees.
           </p>
           <p>
            They provide that the minister may make a declaration in relation to a particular industry, occupation or sector to facilitate entry into the supported bargaining stream.
           </p>
           <p>
            They provide that work in the civil construction sector is to be considered general building and construction work, which would mean that work in that sector would not be subject to multi-enterprise bargaining.
           </p>
           <p>
            They make clear that work in the asphalt industry is not considered to be general building and construction work.
           </p>
           <p>
            They allow bargaining representatives to apply to the Fair Work Commission for an order permitting an employer to put a multi-enterprise agreement to a vote if satisfied that employee organisations' failure to provide their written agreement is unreasonable.
           </p>
           <p>
            The amendments also provide for two things in relation to flexible work: firstly, they allow a pregnant employee to request a flexible working arrangement; and, secondly, they clarify the types of orders the Fair Work Commission may make when an employer has not adequately responded to a request for a flexible working arrangement.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to family and domestic violence leave, the amendments insert a new part 28 into the bill, which would make technical amendments in relation to paid family and domestic violence leave to enable regulations to prescribe requirements for payslips in relation to reporting of paid family and domestic violence leave so that it could be recorded on an employee's payslip as, for example, ordinary hours or training.
           </p>
           <p>
            In relation to the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act, the amendments omit the prescription of malignant mesothelioma from the bill so that the disease can instead be prescribed by regulations under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.
           </p>
           <p>
            They also amend subparagraph 7(9)(a) of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act to specify that an employee is taken to have been employed as a firefighter if firefighting duties made up a not insubstantial portion of their duties.
           </p>
           <p>
            Finally, they introduce the ability for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Capital Territory
            </a>
            to establish an
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
             ACT
            </a>
            firefighting advisory committee to assist in the determination of whether firefighting or related duties have made up a not insubstantial portion of the duties for ACT volunteer firefighters covered by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRC" rel="nofollow">
             SRC
            </a>
            Act.
           </p>
           <p>
            In short, the amendments the government has now sought leave to move all flow from the negotiation that the government undertook with Senator David Pocock. Each of those amendments has certainly been made public before, and anyone following this debate would be well aware of the terms of those amendments.

             Minister, you said the amendments were finalised today. At what time were they finalised? Did you withhold circulation until the start of the committee stage of the debate? I would like the minister or his office—they're listening in—to provide us with an answer as to exactly what time the amendments were finalised. Do the government amendments reflect all the changes announced by Senator
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocock" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
             on Sunday 27 November 2022? I'm more than happy for Senator Pocock, should he wish, to answer this question, but I understand that the minister has circulated the amendments. When did Senator Pocock or his office first receive a copy of the draft amendments? Was Senator Pocock or his office asked to provide any feedback on the amendments? Did Senator Pocock or his office provide the feedback on the amendments? When did Senator Pocock or his office receive a final copy of the amendments? Prior to the amendments being circulated in the parliament, as Senator Lambie has stated, at 6.23 pm, did anybody outside the government see the amendments, including members of any union movement in Australia? And, of all the government amendments on sheet

             124, can the minister please identify which amendments were the result of the committee recommendations, which were the result of negotiations with the

             and which were the result of negotiations with Senator Pocock? I'm happy for you to go through them dot point by dot point, as you just have, and advise, in relation to the dot points you just read out from the supplementary explanatory memorandum, whether they were committee recommendations, Australian Greens recommendations or Senator Pocock's recommendations.

                I'm advised—and, again, this has been in the public domain—that the amendment that says that employers who employ fewer than 20 employees must not be added to a single-interest employer agreement or authorisation without their agreement was a recommendation of the Senate inquiry. In fact, I think you were involved in the Senate inquiry, Senator

                , so you'd be familiar with that. I understand that the amendment in relation to the statutory review was also a recommendation of the Senate inquiry. I don't think it's any secret that most of the amendments have resulted from negotiations with Senator David

                 I want to now turn to the second reading speech to the House given by Minister Burke. In his second reading speech the minister said that 'bargaining at the enterprise level delivers strong productivity benefits and is intended to remain the primary and preferred type of agreement making.' Can the minister therefore guarantee that the percentage of employees covered by an enterprise-level agreement will increase as a result of the bargaining changes?

                  , as you've said, Minister Burke in the House debate pointed out that the government's strong preference is that individual employers and their workers and relevant unions reach agreements at the enterprise level. We know that that's fallen away under the system that the former government presided over, with the complete collapse of enterprise bargaining, and we think it is likely that the proportion of workplace arrangements governed by single-enterprise agreements would increase as a result of this legislation.

                   Thank you, Minister, for the response to the question. Based on the answer—that you do believe the number of enterprise-level agreements will increase as a result of the government's bargaining changes—does the government see this as a mark of success for the reforms?

                    I think there would be a number of marks of success of these reforms, such as getting wages moving again, increasing job security, closing the gender pay gap and increasing the proportion of single-enterprise agreements. I don't know that there's necessarily one test of success for this legislation, but, overall, the objective of this legislation and the measures of success are in the name of the bill—secure jobs and better pay.

                      For starters, of course, for any business or enterprise that is governed by an existing enterprise agreement, obviously that persists. That business would not be, as you would put it, 'roped into' or forced into multi-employer bargaining. In addition, under the legislation, as amended, there is what has been called a nine-month grace period after the expiry of an existing enterprise agreement. It is always open to an individual employer to reach an agreement with their employees. As I've already said, it's the government's preference that that occurs. But we also recognise that there are individual businesses and groups of employees that, for one reason or another—such as simplicity—may choose to go down the multi-employer bargaining path. I can think of many small businesses that wouldn't necessarily have the

                      </a>
                      to conduct negotiations or would prefer to not have to do that with their own employees and may choose to effectively sign up to a multi-employer bargain that is generated through negotiation by a peak industry body with unions and workers. But, as I say, pretty much every business has the option of reaching an agreement with their own employees.

                        There's no specific clause in the bill that says, in your words, 'An employer cannot be roped into a multi-employer bargain.' That's because there are many clauses within the bill that provide a range of options for employers and employees to strike a bargain, whether that be at the enterprise level or across multiple employers or multiple enterprises. Just because there isn't a sentence to the effect that you're talking about, it doesn't preclude the range of options that individual enterprises have for reaching agreements with their workforce.

                          . Because we are a government that wants to make our workplace laws as simple as possible for employers, employees and unions, we have, helpfully, set out the answer to your question in the revised explanatory memorandum. It's on page 188, helpfully, under item 636A, being the item that you referred to. We've made it very easy for people to cross-reference against the item of legislation. I'm happy to read that into the

                           Thank you for confirming that, because that's exactly what I had written in front of me. It now leads to my next line of questioning. Can the minister confirm what the government means by terms and conditions that are 'more than a marginal improvement on those contained in the relevant award'? A number of employers across Australia would like guidance—as I said, statutory interpretation—as to what the government means by 'marginal improvement'.

                            . As a former industrial relations minister and, I think, a former industrial relations practitioner as a lawyer, you would be well aware that the Fair Work Act, as it stands currently, and which you presided over, does not specify every detail that the Fair Work Commission would need to take into account. That, of course, would be a matter for the Fair Work Commission to determine, just as many matters under the existing legislation which you were the minister for left matters to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.

                             Thank you for that answer, but I hate to tell you that tonight we're actually discussing your legislation, not something that I did or did not do when we were in government. You would recall that this is actually your legislation from the Rudd-Gillard years which you are now amending, because you've decided that it failed Australia and Australians.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             I just want to confirm about the answer you've just given: what you've said to the employers of Australia is that the government, other than saying that the act itself does not specify each detail that the Fair Work Commission has to take into account, is actually unable to provide any further guidance. You have not bothered to provide an amendment to set out that guidance so that employers who are negotiating these agreements understand what is meant by 'marginal improvement'.

                              . When I'm speaking tonight I'm not just speaking to the employers of Australia, I am speaking to the employers and the workers of Australia. Unlike your government, we recognise that there are two different groups involved in a workplace—that is, employers and workers. We think that both of them have interests which need to be met by our workplace relations legislation. But what I can say to the employers and workers of Australia, and the trade unions of Australia who also of course have an important role in our workplace relations system, is that we are leaving a number of matters in this legislation to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission, including the example that you've given, and that is nothing out of the ordinary for the industrial relations legislation of Australia or, in fact, for many other pieces of legislation considered and passed by this parliament.

                                 I think we've now made it even more confusing. What does the government mean by 'has simply more than passed the better off overall test'? Again, can you quantify it in terms of a percentage improvement?

                                  No, I can't, and that's because under the existing legislation no government has directed the Fair Work Commission as to what better off overall is. That is a matter that is left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission. Your government and, indeed, former governments that've made provision for the better off overall test have ultimately left that to be a decision of the Fair Work Commission. No previous government has ever said better off overall means five per cent better, 10 per cent better, two per cent better, not one per cent worse. It has been left to the discretion of the commission and that's what we're doing here.

                                   Can the minister guarantee that businesses who can demonstrate a history of bargaining with employees at the enterprise level and who wish to continue to do so will not be roped into multi-employer bargaining because of a rigid and impractical application of the 'history of effectively bargaining test' by the Fair Work Commission?

                                    Again, I make the point that it is entirely open to an individual employer to reach an agreement with the relevant union and their workers at a single enterprise level. Part of the problem that we've seen, which the government is responding to, is that the bargaining system that we have inherited—as a new government—is so broken that it is either unworkable for employers and their workforce to reach a single enterprise bargain or for one reason or another, involving power imbalances and other factors, that just doesn't happen. It is always open to a single enterprise to reach agreement with their workforce. And, yes, both parties have to agree. That's what a bargain is. If you have an employer who is unreasonably refusing to bargain with their employees, then this legislation does provide other options. Similarly, if you have a group of employees who are unreasonably withholding their consent to bargain, then there are options for employers. That's the balanced system that we're putting in place.

As I said, it provides that the Fair Work Commission may make a single-interest employer authorisation that does not specify particular employees if Fair Work is satisfied that—and we've gone through section (b)—the employers and the relevant employees have a history of effectively bargaining. Can the minister guarantee that businesses—again, I need this for statutory interpretation purposes—who can demonstrate a history of bargaining with employees at the enterprise level and who wish to continue to do so will not be roped into multi-employer bargaining because of a rigid and impractical application of a history-of-effectively-bargaining test by the Fair Work Commission, given your comments that: 'The government does not specify each detail the Fair Work Commission needs to take into account'?

                                       I will just go back to the answer that you gave to the previous question in relation to marginal improvement. You said that no government has ever set out a formula by which marginal improvement is measured. What is the metric or metrics you are going to use to measure improvement? What happens if someone enters into an agreement and there's only a marginal improvement but we actually don't know whether or not the employees are now better off because there's no metric other than the

                                        , if an employer has a single-interest bargain that is still running and hasn't reached its nominal expiry date, then they can't be roped in. And, when it comes time to bargain again, where an employer can demonstrate, or is likely to have a history of, effective bargaining, then that's what these provisions would apply to. But, again, I feel very repetitive in saying that, just as the existing legislation does not give metrics as to what amounts to 'better off overall', because it respects the fact that the Fair Work Commission has some right to use its discretion to work out what 'better off overall' means, similarly, what we're doing here is leaving it to the commission to determine whether, in the circumstances of a particular agreement, looked at globally, there is more than a marginal improvement, and, as I say, that has to be more than simply 'exceed the better off overall test'.

Can the minister confirm what is meant by 'appropriate circumstances' and can the minister please provide examples that can then be utilised when looking at this for statutory interpretation purposes.

                                                , page 189, states that new subsection 250(3), which sets out when the Fair Work Commission may exercise its discretion to allow parties to continue to bargain for an enterprise-level agreement, 'would uphold and respect the ability of an employer to bargain with relevant employees in appropriate circumstances'. My question is: can the minister confirm what is meant by 'appropriate circumstances' and could you please provide some examples? If it may assist there, it commences at 1081, at the bottom of page 188: 'For the purposes of new paragraph 250(3)(b), an employer is likely to have a history of effectively bargaining et cetera'. My question is what are the 'appropriate circumstances'?

An important issue has arisen repeatedly throughout these hearings—the right of workers to disconnect from work once they've worked their paid hours. Can the minister please clarify how the bill will address the issues of workers' ability to disconnect from work so that they can protect family time, give care to others and rest?

                                                   , and thank you for your work on this bill—in fact, in this area for your entire career, but particularly in relation to this bill. The government considers that employees should be able to stop work when they have finished their paid hours. It's probably something that all of us could do a better job of, especially those of us in public life. It is appropriate that employees are protected from the intrusion of work into their private lives beyond their contracted hours. This is increasingly important as more women and carers form part of the Australian workforce.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   One way this issue can be dealt with is through the existing mechanism of enterprise agreements. A growing number of enterprise agreements are addressing this, including through clauses that enable employees to disconnect from digital technologies outside working hours, with employers not to contact employees outside working hours unless in exceptional circumstances or for wellbeing checks. For example, the recently negotiated Queensland state teachers enterprise agreement encourages employees to disconnect from digital technology and communications when their work is done and when they are on holidays except in exceptional circumstances. On the employer side, the education department in Queensland has committed to minimised digital communications with employees to ensure that they have an appropriate work-life balance.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                   It is also appropriate that award based employees have the chance to switch off from work after hours. The bill adds both job security and gender equality to the modern awards objectives and adds two new expert panels on pay equity and the care and community sector. These important changes will strengthen and clarify the Fair Work Commission's capacity to consider award matters to do with the work-life collision, including such things as the right to disconnect. It is appropriate in our changing world that the Fair Work Commission is required to consider gender equality and job security as essential parts of its role under the amended act.

                                                    Thank you, Minister, for that answer. That's a comfort, certainly, to know that these matters can be dealt with in awards as the changing technologies of work affect so many workers with caring responsibilities. My second question: we've similarly heard a great deal of evidence around Australia that many workers in industries like retail, hospitality and aged care need greater roster justice. They need predictable shifts, a say over shift changes and the chance to refuse extra hours or be paid appropriate penalty rates for working hours beyond contracted hours. How will this bill work to improve workers' rostering rights?

                                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocock" rel="nofollow">

                                                     . This is an issue that's very important to me on a personal level as well, because I've met many workers in my career both here in the parliament and previously as a lawyer for workers and for unions who have really experienced this form of job insecurity, and it makes it really hard for people not only to pay their bills but also to enjoy their family life and have other commitments as well. So these are really important issues.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                     Our workplace laws need to respond to the changing composition of our workforce, with more working carers at work and more women in all forms of employment. That's why we've introduced new objects in the act and in modern award objectives. The bill adds both job security and gender equality into the objects of the Fair Work Act, and the Fair Work Commission must take these into account when performing its functions or exercising powers. In addition, the objects of job security and gender equality are included in the modern awards objective. We will also strengthen the bargaining system so that employers and employees can negotiate mutually beneficial rostering arrangements and systems.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                     Security of working time and appropriate rostering are essential components of job security. Predictable working time and a say over rostering is very important to working carers, as your question suggests. And given that so many carers are women, this also makes it a gender equality question. The important changes made by the bill will strengthen and clarify the Fair Work Commission's capacity across all its functions, including in relation to modern awards, to address the work-life collision, including issues such as rostering, predictable shifts, employee agreement to and say over changes in rosters, and arrangements in relation to the minimum length of shifts and rates of pay for extra hours worked.

                                                      I will come back to this section, but I now have some comments and questions in relation to the common-interest test. I understand that's section 243. I have been inundated with questions from employers all over the country in relation to the common-interest test. This is something they have asked me to address in detail so they can start to get a much better understanding of whether or not they could or could not be compelled to bargain when they do not wish to. So the first question I ask is this. The section 'common interests', which is used in various positions throughout part 21 of the act, lists three conditions for identifying a potential common interest:

                                                        Unfortunately that answer is going to create great confusion tonight across Australia to employers who actually are listening in to this. This is the one section of questions that they are asking for answers to. You have said in your legislation three conditions for identifying a potential common interest: geographical location, the regulatory regime, and the nature of the enterprise and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises. You have now said, 'These are simply examples,' which now begs the question, given that is actually written in the legislation: what other examples are we now talking about for employers across Australia who, as I said, are listening in tonight?

                                                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cash" rel="nofollow">

                                                         . Again I make the point that the government is approaching this from the interests of employers, employees and unions, not just one group in this debate or in a workplace. It arises from the new clause as to whether common interest bargaining can occur and what constitutes a common interest employer. Section 249(3) says that the requirements of this subsection—which opens up common interest bargaining—are met if:
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p class="italic">
                                                         (b) the employers have clearly identifiable common interests;
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         Then subsection (3C) says:
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p class="italic">
                                                         For the purposes of paragraph (3)(b), matters that may be relevant to determining whether the employers have a common interest include the following:
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p class="italic">
                                                         (a) geographical location;
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p class="italic">
                                                         (b) regulatory regime;
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p class="italic">
                                                         (c) the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement will relate, and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         Again, this is a matter that is up to the commission to exercise its discretion in determining whether employers have clearly identifiable common interests. Guidance is provided to the commission via subsection (3A) as to what may be relevant in determining whether employers have a common interest.
                                                        </p>
                                                        <p>
                                                         You will have followed the public debate about this, and I've seen various opposition senators, including yourself, Senator Cash, put up nonsensical examples which are designed to scare employers and employees about the operation of this legislation. People are suggesting that a small corner shop might be roped in, to use your language, to some sort of a common interest bargain with Woolworths. Complete nonsense. I find it impossible to believe that any commission exercising its discretion would decide that Woolworths or Coles or Aldi or any of the big chains have common interests to a corner store that might employ two people. Similarly, I've heard wild claims made by members of the opposition that a large cafe somewhere outside Melbourne might be roped into a the same bargain as a small cafe in Cairns. Again, it's a matter for the discretion of the commission, but I find it impossible to believe that those sores of nonsensical, wild claims that have been made by members of the opposition, designed to scare people, would stand up on any fair reading of this subsection by the commission.

                                                          Yet again, with every word you have just said it's just got a whole lot worse for the employers in Australia, because they had questions about geographical location, the regulatory regime and the nature of the enterprise, and the terms and conditions of employment. You have now actually stated for the record that there are a whole lot of other common interests that may or may not be taken into consideration which the Fair Work Commission themselves may or may not dream up that employers in Australia are not aware of. We are now moving, Senator Watt, into very dangerous territory.

We are in the multi-employer single interest test. We're not in supported bargaining at this moment, so it is 21 or more. For the record, are you saying that you are formally ruling out whether a small shop of 21 or more—so we're right in—will not be compelled to bargain with a Woolworths-type store if they have the same geographical location or regulatory regime or nature of the enterprise. Are you ruling that in or out, because if you are ruling it in, we have a whole lot of other questions. If you are ruling it out, let's do it for the record now, and then we're going to work through the size of business that you are ruling out that will not be compelled to bargain with another business.

This test is that employers must be reasonably comparable to be covered by the same proposed agreements. And, again, in the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which has been tabled, it explains some of the new amendments that are being proposed. What we have said at paragraph 71 is:
                                                          </p>
                                                          <p class="italic">
                                                           Employers of very different size, scope and scale might, depending on all the circumstances, be found to have clearly identifiable common interests for the purpose of bargaining together. This amendment would ensure that the

                                                           must also be satisfied that the operations and business activities of an employer are reasonably comparable with the other employers. It may be open to the Fair Work Commission to conclude that despite two employers of a similar size, scope and scale operating in the same industry, they are not 'reasonably comparable' once the full extent of their business activities and operations are considered.
                                                          </p>

                                                           So, no, Senator

So I'm sorry to disappoint.

                                                           </p>

                                                            </a>
                                                            the minister told the House in question time that a small business—
                                                           </p>

                                                            so one with 21 or above—
                                                           </p>

                                                            located in a shopping centre with a large supermarket would not be compelled to bargain together with that supermarket. Given the bill specifically mentions geographical location as establishing the common interest that means a business can be dragged into multi-employer bargaining …
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p>
                                                            Minister Burke came back though with, 'The example given is wrong,' as you have now stated—that's good, because we've got to rule it out formally for the reason for statutory interpretation, so that's going to give a lot of relief to people when we formally rule out this. He says: 'The first reason is in terms of common interest.' He talks about the common interest—not comparability, but the common interest. So let's put comparability aside. He then says:
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p class="italic">
                                                            So, even if you got over the hurdle—and I don't know logically how you could get over the hurdle—on common interest, to claim that they're somehow reasonably comparable would just a beggar belief.
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p>
                                                            So I'll go back to the common interest: are you now saying that they are ruled out of the common interest?

                                                             , I think that in quoting Minister Burke you've answered your own question. I didn't catch every single word of what he said there, but I think he said something along the lines that it defies belief or defies logic that it would pass the common interest test. So the answer is there in what you've quoted.

What happens if we're at 50? Are we ruling in or are we ruling out in terms of this example? Where are you drawing the line? This is now of great use to employers around Australia, because they will be able to say to the Fair Work Commission, 'Minister Watt has ruled us formally out on behalf of the government.' So at 21 we're ruled out; that's good news for those with 21. At 25, 35 or 50, what are you formally ruling in and ruling out by way of numbers?

                                                               . I don't think that Senator Cash has accurately characterised what I've said. The bill is very clear, that employers who employ fewer than 20 employees may not be added to a single-interest employer agreement or authorisation without their agreement. If there are 20 or more employees then there are additional tests that need to be met for an employer to be added to a single-interest employer agreement. In short, they have to have clearly identifiable common interests with other employers. As I said, the factors that the commission can take into account in determining whether employers have a common interest include—include—geographical location, regulatory regime, the nature of the enterprises to which the agreement will relate and the terms and conditions of employment in those enterprises. In addition to that, for a business that employs over 20 employees, they also have to be demonstrated to be reasonably comparable to the other businesses. That is what is actually provided for by this bill, rather than however Senator Cash might try to characterise it.
                                                              </p>

                                                               In addition to all that, and as Senator Cash would be aware, the government has reached agreement with Senator David

But for businesses employing fewer than 50, the onus is on employees to establish that.

You can actually be compelled into the supported bargaining stream. We have a whole line of questions there in relation to compelling small businesses, but we are focusing on the single-interest test.

In questions to the department, we have got no further in relation to any guidance on what 'geographical location' actually means. So before we go through a set of specific questions, can you tell me what the government actually means by 'geographical location'?

I respect the commission enough to think that it's capable of determining what a common geographical location is for the purposes of this section. Essentially, what we're ruling out by saying this is are businesses which are on opposite sides of the coast forming part of the same agreement through this stream.

                                                                 </p>

To date every single answer that they are being provided with—because they're listening in—is: 'The government's not making it easier. There's nothing further for you to read. Go through all of these questions. There's nothing further for you to read.' I can read from the explanatory memorandum, but that's actually where all of the questions are coming from. I can look to Minister Burke, who insults the opposition in question time. That actually doesn't help me because you won't formally rule something in or rule something out. You keep saying you're making it simpler for business, but what we are now working through—and we've only been here for an hour and a half, so we've got a long way to go—is: 'It is being left to the discretion of the Fair Work Commission.'

I'll get your definition of the east coast, because that is also going to be very important going forward by way of statutory interpretation.

I've got a whole series of questions provided by the Western Australian mining industry. Does this legislation set a distance limit when considering a shared geographical location as a common interest? We've ruled out coast to coast, so I also need to understand how you ruled out coast to coast by way of geographical location. I need to understand why, because then we can actually start to work backwards. We've now got a distance—coast to coast.
