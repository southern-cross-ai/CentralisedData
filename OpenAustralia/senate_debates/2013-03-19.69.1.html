        My question is to the minister representing the minister for regional Australia, regional development and local government, Senator Conroy. I refer the minister to Regional Development Australia Fund grants in relation to Western Sydney. Can the minister advise why 10 days ago the Prime Minister suddenly invited 19 Western Sydney applicants for funding to submit full

        Fund applications during her week-long stay in Sydney's west? Why is it now the case, as reported in the
        <i>

        <i>
         Australian

        of 16 March, that apparently only three of these funding applications for projects in Western Sydney under the RDA Fund will now be allowed to proceed to full assessment status in this round, and how will those three be selected?

         The department of regional Australia and local government grants were announced to proceed to the next stage on, I think, 13 February—and as I have said, that is now just giving you some historical context—and since then, circumstances in Greater Western Sydney have changed. The New South Wales and Australian governments, as I have indicated, have established a memorandum of understanding. Australia is a nation of regions. Peri-urban and outer metropolitan areas are critical to our regional network. Metropolitan centres, peri-urban regions and outer metropolitan centres—

               Rounds 3 and 4, as I have indicated, were launched concurrently and are a comprehensive package to address the diverse priorities and needs of the regions. Round 3 provides small grants for projects located in small towns. Round 4 provides grants for strategic infrastructure projects. Each round has its own guidelines.

               s from across the region and selected up to five projects to proceed to full application for round 3. In round 3—and I am working my way systematically through all of these rounds because they are relevant to the question—440 EOIs were received, seeking more than $162 million in funding, and 216 EOIs, seeking $84.7 million in grant funding and investing $476 million in regional Australia, were selected to proceed to full application. In round 4, 478 applications were received.
