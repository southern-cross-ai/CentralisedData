        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. Can the minister inform the Senate of the steps the government is taking after six years of Labor budget cuts and inaction in defence to ensure that the

         I thank Senator Kroger for her question and for her commitment to the men and women of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         . As an island nation, one of our highest priorities is maritime security. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Navy
         </a>
         does an outstanding and professional job in fulfilling that role, but it must have, should have and, under us, will have the right equipment. Under Labor's watch, $16 billion was cut from defence. As a result, 119 projects were delayed, 43 were reduced and eight were cancelled. This is the mess we inherited. We were promised an updated Defence Capability Plan but this never eventuated. Such was the mess in this portfolio that Labor never even bothered to produce a defence policy going into the last election. They simply gave up.

         , commissioned in 1986, is old and in urgent need of replacement. Labor did nothing about this. We have taken decisive action. This is an absolutely vital capability providing fuel, aviation fuel, ammunition, and stores and provisions to our frigates as and when they move around our vast

Demonstrating that the air warfare destroyer program is able to provide value for money will be the crucial test. That will be the test by which we have a decent productive industry.

               What did the previous government do about Pacific class patrol boats? Nothing. We have put the money on the table to call for tenders for the production of more than 20 of those ships. But it gets worse. What did they do last year about
               <i>
                Aurora
               </i>
               <i>
                Australis
               </i>
               ? They ran a tender closing on 9 May. Did they stipulate that that 8,000-tonne ship built by Carrington Slipways in the Hunter should be an Australian production? No, they did not. That tender closed, and they are allowing an 8,000-tonne icebreaker to be built in Europe. Under their watch, bleating and complaining about the valley of death, they allowed a ship that was built in Australia to now be built offshore. I just wish hypocrisy was worth something, because the Labor Party would turn us into millionaires.
