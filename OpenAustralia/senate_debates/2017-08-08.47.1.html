         I thank Senator Bushby for his question, and disappointingly, yes, I can. I can advise the Senate that recently the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         was fined $430,000 by the Federal Court for unlawful strike action. Disappointingly, the strike action included action that delayed the construction of a children's hospital in Brisbane. That's right—the CFMEU, in their complete contempt for the law, will actually hold up, quite deliberately, the construction of a hospital that is there to help sick children.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the $430,000, it now gives the CFMEU the dubious record of having in excess of $10 million in penalties imposed against it and its representatives. That's right, $10 million. And, in handing down its decision, the Federal Court found that there was a pattern of behaviour by the CFMEU by which it routinely flouted industrial laws. In fact, the Federal Court stated: 'The most significant point to emerge from the schedules of past cases is that the CFMEU is a recidivist when it comes to contravening industrial laws. No penalties that have been imposed in the past have appeared to reduce its willingness to breach the law. It continues to thumb its nose at industrial laws.' With the imposition of this latest fine and the comments from the Federal Court, it is yet again clear that the CFMEU—it does not matter what you do—believes it is above the law, unlike the rest of us, unlike the rest of Australia and Australians.

            now has in excess of $10 million in penalties awarded against it. There is only one other figure that comes anywhere near matching the $10 million. Colleagues, what do you think that figure is?

           <p>
            An honourable senator: Donations!
           </p>
           <p>
            Donations. That's exactly right. And where have those donations gone, colleagues? Just look at those opposite. Eight million dollars has gone from the CFMEU to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Labor Party
            </a>
            to support things like refusing to restore law and order to the building and construction sector in Australia—$8 million of funds from the hardworking members. Ten million dollars of funds from the hardworking members has literally just gone to absolutely nothing, and the CFMEU is proud of that.

               With the support of the crossbench, you will be aware that late last year we restored the Australian Building and Construction Commission. And with the support of the crossbench, we restored law and order to the building and construction sector within Australia. We on this side of the chamber have said 'no' to deals being done between big unions and big employers. We have said enough is enough. It is time to level the playing field. It is time to stand up for the small and medium businesses in Australia. It is time to stand up for the small subcontractors. It is time to stand up for the mums and dads who are the victims of the deals done between big unions and big employers to the detriment of all Australians. Unlike those on the other side, we won't turn a blind eye to bullying, intimidation and thuggery, because that's not in the interests of all Australians.
