              , on the point of order, which apparently is not really a point of order, it would be helpful if the opposition indicated at the outset what point of order they are actually taking. One could not guess from a restatement or at least a short statement about what Senator Brandis thinks his question now is. From the opposition’s perspective, they are entitled to ask a question and a supplementary question and a further supplementary question but not to use a point of order to rephrase the primary question.

               Senator, this is not the time for debate on either side. Question time is a time for questions to be asked and answers to be given and not for interjections to override the questions. Interjections do not help question time in any way whatsoever. The minister has been going for 21 seconds. There are two minutes allocated for answering questions. The minister has a minute and 39 seconds remaining to answer the question.

                          , I rise on a point of order. The minister, in addressing you in that dismissive and contemptuous way—‘Mr President, I appreciate your advice’—has shown total disregard for your authority in the chair. If ever a president in command of this chamber were to sit a senator down, you ought to do that to this minister now.

Given that it is beyond the competency of this minister to read a document at a rate of more than 29 pages a day, isn’t it the case that the government has already identified the confidential information in the document and that it is hiding behind this excuse to prevent parliamentary scrutiny and to protect a minister who is fast losing the confidence of the public and the markets?

Yet again, those opposite have got to explain to the people of Australia, because Senator Barnaby Joyce let the cat out of the bag last week. For all the pomposity from those opposite, Senator Joyce let the cat out of the bag when he said, ‘It’s not about the details; it’s about destroying the

                                       . That will mean we can destroy the government.’ That is what Senator Joyce said last week. The cant and the hypocrisy which some of those opposite, particularly the questioners, like to display regularly in question time has been exposed—out of the mouth of Senator Joyce.

How will improvements in broadband speeds and broadband penetration help to grow the Australian economy?

It is an economic reform, and that is how we should regard it. We know that we need to improve broadband in this country. We know that in 2007 our broadband speeds lagged behind some 26

                                           is vital to our national economic success.

                                           Senator Joyce was very open about this over the last few days. He was not interested in discussing the benefits for regional Australia, he was not interested in discussing the economic benefits. What he made clear was the political agenda that lies behind the opposition’s approach, and that is nothing except wrecking this reform for their own political gain and putting their political gain ahead of the national interest.

                                             As I said, this is an overdue reform that will boost productivity growth in our economy. It is also a reform that will deliver better services to Australian consumers and Australian businesses. It is of particular benefit—and I would have thought the National Party would have considered this—to Australians in rural and regional Australia, who, despite their geographic isolation, will be able to use broadband quickly and efficiently to connect to the rest of Australia and to the world.

                                            <p>
                                             I am asked about some of the risks to consumers. We know that delays in implementing this reform will mean high prices and less competition. We know that this will hold back innovative improvements to the way in which Australians can do business, but unfortunately we also know that the opposition has only one priority. As Senator Joyce reminded us:

We understand that it is not acceptable to have broadband that is not acceptable to all of Australia—our regions as well as our cities. Paradoxically, those on the other side seem to be quite happy to accept the status quo when it comes to broadband. That is because they know only one approach when it comes to this reform and any reform, and that is to wreck and block. They are nothing but wreckers.

                                               What is interesting about what Senator Joyce said is that he told the Australian people what the real agenda is here: the political position of the opposition. It is about their perceived political gain. They are not interested in policy. Senator Joyce is not interested in broadband for the regions. He is not interested in that. He is not interested in broadband for regional Australia.
