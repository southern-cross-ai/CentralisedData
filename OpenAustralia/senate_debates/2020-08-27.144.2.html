        I have some further information to add in response to Senator Steele-John's question earlier, in question time. I can advise that, as I think I adverted to in my response, the government is currently considering the request made by the chair of the disability royal commission for amendments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        s Act 1902. This is an important issue and it is being given careful and detailed consideration by government, as you would expect. So I do not support Senator Steele-John's suggestion that the Attorney-General should apologise in this context, because it is under active consideration.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it is also important to highlight that information provided to a royal commission is already protected during the terms of the commission. There are already several ways that a royal commission can protect the information provided and the identity of the people providing itâ€”for example, through the use of private sessions or pseudonyms or by the making of 'do not publish' orders. Any information provided to the royal commission in connection with or during a private session is protected from disclosure by law, even after the inquiry has ended.
       </p>
       <p>
        Noting the matters that Senator Steele-John has raised, if there is anything further I can add in another response, after it has been considered by the Attorney-General, I will do so.
