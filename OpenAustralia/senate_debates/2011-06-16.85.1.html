        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Is the minister aware of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>

         I thank Senator Pratt for her question. This is a government that has as its first priority jobs. Our record speaks for itself. Over 700,000 jobs have been created in this country under our watch and there would be 200,000 fewer jobs if we had followed the opposition's advice during the economic crisis. Our record speaks for itself—700,000 jobs.

           We kept the economy strong and jobs secure through the worst economic crisis in living memory. Manufacturing is a critical part of that story. It employs a million Australians today and has done so for the better part of 50 years. Manufacturing employment will always fluctuate, as we saw during the economic crisis, and we have lost over 5,000 jobs in the last year. But throughout the decades of change it has always emerged much more robust, much more resilient and more productive. Manufacturing survived the rise of China, it has survived the rise of India and I am absolutely optimistic it will survive the new pressures of the resources boom.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our approach is to work with firms to build solutions and not just whinge about problems. We are about building an innova­tion agenda. We are about transforming every firm and every factory for the 21st century. We are about helping them build the capabilities to compete in a global market. We know that our programs work and we are ramping them up today. There is our Enterprise Connect, for instance; Com­mercialisation Australia; and the new supplier advocates.
          </p>
          <p>
           I frankly welcome Mr Abbott's interest—perhaps it is a new-found interest—in manufacturing because it certainly was not evident when he was the minister for industrial relations. Back then his only answer to manufacturing was to make it easier to sack people.

             Thank you. What I can say is that Mr Abbott's answer to manufacturing is to make it easier to sack workers—that is his approach: to sack workers. The best thing that Mr Abbott could do is to help those firms to support the government's new research and development tax credit.

               Our programs reach many, many firms. Our tax scheme is the most powerful lever we have to spread the transformation of our economy. The benefits that exist under the taxation concession are aimed at specifically assisting small and medium sized firms as well as helping larger firms. We think it is a better use of the $1.8 billion of taxpayers' funds than the current arrangements. We are particularly keen to see that smaller firms, who dominate our manufacturing sector, are able to claim renewed benefits. The new tax credit will redistribute support in favour of those firms. It is a simpler, it is a fairer and it is a more accessible incentive for genuine R&amp;D.
