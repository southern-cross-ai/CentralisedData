        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. A week ago the Prime Minister promised to build a new quarantine facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jandakot_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Jandakot Airport

         Department of Finance
        </a>
        recommended that site after a feasibility study. So why has Mr Morrison already broken that promise, announcing the quarantine station will now be moved to a new site near a contaminated

         [by video link] If Senator Pratt had bothered to look at any of the detail of what was said when the Jandakot site was announced as a preferred location a little over a week ago, she would have known that at the time I spoke very publicly about the fact that terms in relation to access to that site weren't settled, that contingency and back-up plans looking at other sites were underway and that the government was receiving advice. Indeed, the memorandum of understanding that we signed with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         n government, who are clearly far more mature on these issues than Senator Pratt or the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese" rel="nofollow">
          Anthony Albanese
         </a>
         opposition, acknowledged the fact that there were contingency sites underway. The WA government has been engaged in that and is aware of that. What we've done is we've moved to the Bullsbrook site, the defence training centre there, on the basis of it being the site that will enable us to most efficiently, in terms of time and money, get the project built and delivered. That's why we're going there. It's that simple.

            , today, she would see that we announced the contractor for construction on the Bullsbrook site yesterday. I thank Multiplex for the work they're doing on that site, as they are elsewhere around the country. They're in a position where they're going to get the designs and approvals finalised and construction underway the month after next.

               (—) (): [by video link] That's strike 3 from Senator Pratt—three questions, three failures and three statements that are completely false, incorrect or failing facts. As I made clear yesterday when Senator Pratt tried this on, the Prime Minister said no such thing. We're grateful for the fact that
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                Western Australia

               s want us to stick to a plan that gives them back the opportunity to engage with the rest of Australia and with the rest of the world. That's what our national plan is all about: driving the vaccination numbers for Australians to points where we can all get back those freedoms and liberties. Whether you live in Western Australia, Queensland,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
