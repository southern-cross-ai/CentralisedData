        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, Senator Evans. Minister, after months of denial, the worst-kept secret in Defence was revealed when the Singapore base shipyard

        to a double-hulled vessel. How can a Labor government, once the champion of Australian workers, tick off on this project when it is very clear that ST Marine is not required to adhere to Australian standards of occupational health and safety and entitlements for workers, as are Australian firms who employ Australian workers at award wages and conditions and who are more than capable and ready to do the job?

         I thank Senator Johnston for the question. I am not aware of the details of the contract that he refers to, but I think the suggestion was that we should not allow international competition for defence contracts. Was that the thrust of his question? My recollection is that it was Senator Minchin who was in charge when the preferred tenderers were selected. I may be wrong about that. That was my recollection. I may be wrong, but I stand to be corrected.

           I suppose that I am a bit surprised that the Liberal Party seems to have sunk to xenophobia on a range of fronts in recent times, be it on population, be it on foreign investment—and now it seems to be on the issue of defence contracting. Obviously the government are very much committed to supporting employment in this country and supporting defence contractors in this country. We have done a lot of work to try to support defence business in this country, to try to make sure that Australian companies get access to not only contracts here but also contracts in other nations. That has been highly successful in many respects. I know Senator Carr has taken an interest in this area through his industry portfolio, along with the previous Minister for Defence Materiel, Mr Combet. We are very committed to supporting jobs. That was a key part of our response to the global financial crisis. I am happy to take up any issue that Senator Johnston thinks he might want detailed information about.

             and their officials have to say. I also have a lot of interest in what former officials have to say. Senator Cameron has talked to me on many occasions about procurement and supporting Australian industry. This government has had a long interest in those matters and has sought on all occasions to try to maximise Australia’s share of contracts and procurement issues to try to maximise jobs for Australians. That is very much part of the government’s approach and we do pursue those opportunities at all times. It is also the case that we support an open economy and that we think the opening of Australia to international forces, the floating of the dollar and other economic reforms, are important reforms. And I would hate to think that the Liberal Party are turning their backs on those very important reforms.

               I cannot assist the senator with the advice about—what was it?—a double skinny? Was it a latte? Double skinny what? I am sorry, I am not familiar with the term and I am therefore not able to help the senator with an answer. Given he has raised a specific issue about the

                Success
               </i>
               , I am happy to take that onboard and see if I can get the minister to give the senator some further information about it. However, I do ask the senator to consider the tone of his questioning and whether this represents a bit of a drift into xenophobia inside the Liberal Party. There is a difference between supporting local jobs and perhaps sinking to a level that does not do him any justice.
