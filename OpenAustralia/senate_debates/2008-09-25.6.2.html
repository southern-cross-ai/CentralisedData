       <p class="italic">
        These two instruments that specify fees for water and sewerage services on the Islands are drafted in substantially similar, though not identical, terms. Clause 5 of each instrument lists definitions which are used to classify land for the purposes of determining appropriate fees for water and sewerage services. Paragraph 5(b) of the Christmas Island Determination defines the category of Commercial/Residential. The Cocos (Keeling) Islands Determination does not have a similar category.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Clause 5 in both instruments defines a category of ‘charitable purposes’ by reference to whether the Authority is of the opinion that the land is used for specified purposes. There is no indication in the

        The definition of ‘explanatory statement’ in section 4 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 requires an explanatory statement to explain the purpose and operation of the instrument. The Committee’s practice is to ask for an item-by-item explanation of provisions in an instrument. The Explanatory Statement that accompanies this instrument simply reproduces, in abridged form, the purpose provisions from each Chapter of the instrument. No further explanation of particular provisions is given. The Committee would therefore appreciate a revised and more detailed explanation for this instrument.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 12 September 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these Guidelines. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room

       <p class="italic">
        Part 6 of the Act provides for approval of existing higher education institutions or proposed institutions to be approved as various kinds of higher education entities and the accreditation of higher education courses of study, in each case in relation to an Australian external territory. This part of the Act also provides that persons who do not have approval or accreditation under this part of the Act may be guilty of an offence if they operate as a university or other higher education provider, offer higher education awards or describe themselves as universities.

        The National Guidelines have been agreed to by the relevant ministers in all jurisdictions. The National Guidelines are available at: http://www.mceetya.edu.au/mceetya/national protocols for higher education mainpage,15212.html.

        Chapter 1 provides an introduction to and outline of the guidelines broadly similar to this document. It explains that the HEET Guidelines give effect to the National Protocols and National Guidelines, as approved by MCEETYA in October 2007, in the Commonwealth’s jurisdiction. Potential applicants would be remiss if they failed to read these documents which are in the public domain.

        Section 2.5 requires applicants to write to request application forms which can then be provided by e-mail or physical post. Because the external Territories is a very small jurisdiction, it is desirable to establish early awareness of any interest in establishing a higher education entity to operate in an external Territory.

        Fees and charges are set in section 2.15 to reflect the costs expected to be incurred in an assessment process by the Commonwealth. As the external Territories include remote locations, the costs of an assessment process are likely to be high and because the number of applications is likely to be low due to the small size of the jurisdiction, there is unlikely to be potential to amortise costs over a number of potential higher education entities.
