           I thank Senator Colbeck for the opportunity to speak on this. We agree with the sentiment in this motion; however, we do not agree with the 24-hour caveat that it is in it. We believe that the interim report should be released and made public in a timely manner. If Senator Colbeck, for example, were to say ‘within five days’, we would agree to it. We think the 24 hours is just a bit sharp. I have spoken with my colleague Senator Milne about this. We do want the progress placed on the public record, and if Senator Colbeck is amenable to changing the 24 hours to five working days we will support the motion.

             It is a little bit of a surprise to hear Senator Brown talk about this. I would have appreciated a call; I would have been happy to respond to that. I have considered the time frames. I do not believe that there is any impediment to releasing the information as soon as it becomes available. It is my view that the government, on receipt, should proceed to the release of this information promptly so that there is the capacity for all of those who have a significant interest in this—and I understand and recognise that the Greens also have a significant interest in the negotiations that are being conducted at the moment—to respond in a timely way.
            </p>

             There are already press reports of what might or might not be discussed. The Tasmanian Premier indicated yesterday that she would be receiving the documentation imminently. I think it is fair that we all receive it as quickly as possible. I do not think there is anything there that is going to cause any great consternation or need for government consideration. So, unfortunately, Senator Brown, I cannot agree to your motion. From my perspective, there is nothing to stop the government from releasing the interim report and tabling it within the 24-hour time frame.
