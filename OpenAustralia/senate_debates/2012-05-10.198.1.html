         (c) The department does not purchase set-top boxes individually from manufacturers. Set-top boxes are supplied by service contractors. Service contractors are procured through an open and competitive tender process, which the department runs through AusTender, the Commonwealth's procurement website. The department selects successful tenderers (and their proposed set-top boxes) on an assessment of value for money, in accordance with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) The HAS is being rolled out region by region. Each region is made up of a collection of service areas. Each service contractor is allocated specific service areas and they provide the set-top box that the department has deemed provides the best value for money. With VAST services, the same set-top box is provided in each service area because there is only one VAST certified set-top box.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) As part of the quality assurance checks in each tender, service contractors provide test reports demonstrating compliance against Australian Standards for set-top boxes, to the department. The department use these test reports to judge the best value for money set-top boxes, which takes place during the tender evaluation process.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
          The Government
         </a>
         is not aware of any modifications that have been made to set-top boxes that have been imported to Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) (a) Each set-top box provided under HAS and SSS comes with a twelve month warranty period that protects the customer against faults in the set-top boxes. Any faulty set-top boxes are replaced by the service contractor, at their own expense.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Under the Deed of Agreement with the department, the head service contractor is responsible for providing an in-home, twelve month warranty for faulty parts, manufacture or workmanship relating to the set-top box, cabling, antenna, installation and satellite services provided to the customer. If the equipment cannot be replaced or fixed at the customer's premises, then the service contractor must arrange for the collection and delivery of the equipment to and from the customer's premises at no expense to the customer or the department.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) (a) Details regarding the price paid to service contractors for each set-top box cannot be provided, as these figures are commercial-in-confidence. The department does not intend to release these actual costs as this may impact the outcome of current and future procurement processes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Tenderers provide pricing for a range of cost elements which are assessed during the tender evaluation process. The department selects successful tenderers and their proposed set-top boxes on an assessment of value for money, in accordance with the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) The pricing for the set-top box covers the complete cost of the set-top box, including design to best assist HAS customers, manufacture, delivery to the service contractors, appropriate taxes and the twelve month warranty period.
