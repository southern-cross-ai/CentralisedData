        My question is to the Minister representing the minister for infrastructure, Minister Watt. Today I will table an open letter with nearly 2,300 signatures from doctors and medical professionals. The letter calls on the government to withdraw the $1.5 billion of taxpayer funds committed to enable a gas export and petrochemical processing hub at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Arm" rel="nofollow">
         Middle Arm
        </a>
        . In opposition the Prime Minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If there is one thing Australians have learned during the coronavirus crisis, it is that we should always listen to scientists.
       </p>
       <p>
        The experts, including scientists and many doctors who have joined us in parliament today, are saying we can't afford to proceed with this project. Minister, when will the Albanese government listen to the experts and withdraw funding from Middle Arm?

         (—) (): Thank you, Senator Pocock, for your question. As you're aware, the government will provide $1.5 billion in planned equity to support the development of the

         to Darwin. One thing I want to be clear about—and this is sometimes lost in the debate—is that this investment is not an investment in fracking, and it's very disingenuous that some people continue to ignore facts and fail to engage in the detail of the proposition the Australian government has put to the

           In fact, contrary to what many people are saying, our funding will go towards infrastructure that supports industries that are critical to meet our commitment to net zero. Those industries include hydrogen and the manufacture and export of lithium batteries.
          </p>
          <p>
           I know it suits the Greens party and a range of other people to characterise this investment as one thing, but in fact this investment is actually critical to meet the commitment we have, and I thought certain other people had, to reaching net zero—

             including by supporting hydrogen development and the manufacture and export of lithium batteries. The proposals involved include a hydrogen facility using solar energy; green ammonia production; critical minerals processing for use in energy storage batteries and precursor battery materials; and the manufacturing of these products. The truth is that gas remains an important energy source for Australia and our trading partners during the transition to net zero and decarbonisation. A lower

             emission liquefied natural gas export facility is also one of the proposals. This is about moving towards net zero, not against it.

                Thank you, Senator Pocock. I accept that both you and the people who have travelled to Canberra to voice their opinions are sincere in their beliefs, but they are not beliefs that are shared by the Australian government. As I say, this development, from our point of view, is all about helping facilitate the transition towards a net zero economy—and I know, Senator Pocock, that's something that you believe in. It's certainly something the Labor Party believes in, and I'm sure the people who have come to Canberra to speak with people share that view as well. This development, as I say, is about things like investing in and developing hydrogen facilities using solar energy, green ammonia production and critical minerals processing for use in energy storage batteries. These are the kinds of things that we are going to need if we are actually going to achieve the net zero transition that I believe in, that I think you believe in and that I'm sure that the people who have come to Canberra believe in.

                  Minister, your greenwashing is outrageous. You know that this will process gas, primarily. Tamboran are saying that. Santos have plans for Barossa. This will have real impacts for people in Darwin and people in the Beetaloo. Stop gaslighting us. Will the government undertake a health impact assessment of

                   As you have pointed out, there is yet to be an environmental impact statement undertaken in relation to this development, and that is something that will occur in due course. I know that Minister Plibersek will oversee that in her usual very professional fashion. Very often, those sorts of environmental assessments do consider the sorts of health issues that you're talking about. We are fully committed, as we are with any project, to making sure that the environmental sustainability of projects is fully assessed before they are approved.

                     Thank you, President. I have a point of order on relevance. I was really keen to hear, Minister Watt, if you will commit to a health assessment.

                       that is to be undertaken. As I said, it would be the usual course that health impacts are considered as part of that. As I said, the Albanese government has made climate change a national health priority by developing Australia's first
