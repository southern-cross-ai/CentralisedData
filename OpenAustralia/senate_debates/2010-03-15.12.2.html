        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. I draw the minister’s attention to figures from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
         UNHCR
        </a>
        which indicate that new asylum applications in Australia rose by 30 per cent in 2009—that does not include, of course, the 24 boats and, at last count, 1,200 arrivals this year—whereas applications in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        decreased by six per cent in 2009. Can the minister explain to the Senate why the global push factors he has spoken about before push asylum seekers towards Australia but do not appear to be pushing them towards Britain?

         I thank Senator Humphries for the question. Unfortunately, Senator Humphries again wishes to selectively use figures, as has the opposition spokesman, Mr Morrison, which misrepresent the situation in terms of asylum claims. It is also true to say that we have had a reduction in asylum claims from Serbians this year—but I do not put any great store in it. Clearly, people of various nationalities move within their regions seeking asylum. It is the case that since 2006 asylum applications by Afghans in industrialised countries worldwide have increased by 185 per cent. Asylum claims since 2006 by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
          Sri Lanka
         </a>
         ns have increased by 65 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         What happens is that we get our share. The vast majority still go to Europe, but other countries get their share. We have traditionally been a country of destination for Afghans seeking asylum. As the previous government learnt in 1999 to 2001, when there was a large outflow of Afghans, Australia was one of the destination countries they headed for. That flow ceased when the Taliban fell and Australia, along with other countries, was able to return in excess of, I think, three million—certainly a large number of Afghans—to their country because of the fall of the Taliban and better security conditions there.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Will the minister concede that the Rudd government’s failed border protection policy is proving to be an irresistible magnet to people smugglers, the very people that the Prime Minister himself referred to on 17 April last year as ‘representing the absolute scum of the earth’?

           It is true that this government takes a very strong view about people smugglers and trying to stamp out their trade. But it is, as I say, the case that worldwide there are people smugglers trying to take advantage of the plight of many persons seeking safety or seeking to flee their country of origin. We were very pleased the other day during the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
            President of Indonesia
           </a>
           ’s visit to this country that he announced their commitment this year to introduce legislation to criminalise people-smuggling in Indonesia. Quite frankly, that would be a very important development in terms of trying to stamp out people-smuggling in our region. As we have learnt in recent years, it is only by close cooperation in the region that one can combat these syndicates. We think a commitment by Indonesia to stamp out and criminalise people-smuggling in their country will go a long way towards assisting us in the battle against people-smuggling.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the 92 boats and almost 4,100 arrivals since Rudd Labor weakened Australia’s border protection policies, can the minister explain what the Prime Minister meant when he said on 17 April last year, ‘This government maintains its hardline, tough, targeted approach to maintaining border protection for Australia’? Or can we surmise that this is, yet again, a blatant example of all talk and no action?

             We do maintain a strong commitment to border protection. Boats are being intercepted and people are being taken to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
              Christmas Island
             </a>
             and mandatorily detained. I noticed that the other day the opposition tried to make a claim that they were fearful that boats may arrive on the mainland. I remind them of how many boats arrived on the mainland under the Howard government. This is an issue we have had to deal with for 30 years. It is an issue that confronts us that we have to take seriously. But strong border protection measures remain in place. We have more patrols than there were under the Howard government. We have dedicated more resources than were dedicated under the Howard government. And we have made enormous extra financial commitments to the fight against people-smuggling. But it is a challenge; it is difficult; it is hard. We are working very strongly with our neighbouring countries to try to address this global problem and we will keep working at it, but we will maintain strong border security, as we always have.
