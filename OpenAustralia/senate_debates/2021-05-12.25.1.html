          As I said in my speech on the second reading, the teachers are really concerned about the implications of this legislation, which is being rushed through. Teachers have raised concerns about the different curriculums in each state. What is being done to ensure that teachers are aware of the various curriculum requirements of each state and are being supported to teach them when they're teaching in a state they are not registered in?

           Under mutual recognition, a teacher can teach in another state, but, again—and I know you will be moving an amendment in relation to teachers—my understanding is that, based on the feedback, teachers were supportive of this bill. But, again, under the bill you are able, as an individual state, to exempt a category of industry.

             The bill received broad support. There will always be those who don't necessarily support a bill. But, as I said, the bill itself has received broad support. But, in any event, to go more specifically to the issue that you have put on the table: if a state believes that teachers should be exempt, it is able to exempt them.

              submission, the teachers have raised concerns that this bill will effectively cut funding for state teacher registration bodies because they will have to divert funds to the burdensome parallel registration obligations under this bill. Has the government analysed the cost this bill will bring for teacher registration boards?

This bill has been agreed to by national cabinet, the Council on Federal Financial Relations and officials from the Commonwealth, state and territory governments. As a result of that agreement, this bill has been brought forward.

                  <p>
                   Senator Faruqi, I assume that you are referring to the amendments that I referred to in my summing-up speech, when I said that the government is moving minor and technical amendments to the bill that will ensure that the scheme will be implemented as intended. We are simplifying the exemption provisions to provide greater certainty to workers, business and regulators and to ensure a smooth transition. Removing the word 'particular' from the criteria for a five-year exemption will clarify that conditions causing a significant risk do not have to be unique to the state declaring a registration to be exempt.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Businesses will also have greater clarity during the transition period, with state ministers no longer required to renew a temporary exemption declaration six months into the rollout. The government is also proposing technical updates to definitions in the bill, to ensure consistency with state legislation relating to the Mutual Recognition Act 1992 and to allow time for the legislative processes to be completed. The government is updating the commencement date to be a day fixed by proclamation. As I said to you, though, they are minor and technical amendments.
                  </p>

                      Minister, what is being done to address the concerns of construction workers that this bill will undermine their work health and safety? I understand that you said that state laws apply, but their concern is that this bill actually undermines that.

                      <p>
                       Senator Faruqi, thank you for that acknowledgement of my previous answer in terms of state safety laws applying, and, should a particular state wish to exempt, in this case, construction workers, as you have put before the Senate, it is able to do so. But I also do have some additional information that I can provide to you. Automatic mutual recognition builds on and improves the existing mutual recognition arrangements by maintaining existing protections in place nationally and in each jurisdiction. Workers must hold a substantive registration in their home state. Workers must comply with the laws of the state they are working in and satisfy financial public protection requirements. Workers will face oversight and disciplinary action consistent with the locally licensed workers, which could include financial penalties and licence suspension or cancellation. Under automatic mutual recognition, a second state can also require workers to first notify the regulator that they intend to work in its particular state. This protection enables regulators to communicate expectations for interstate workers where needed. Where there remains a significant risk, state ministers—and I think we've already discussed this—can exempt specific registrations for a renewable period of up to five years from automatic mutual recognition.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       This targeted approach ensures the economic benefits of automatic mutual recognition flow to workers, businesses and consumers, but, at the same time, addresses significant risks where they arise, and in this case you put before the Senate—construction workers. Automatic mutual recognition will also assist regulators to quickly share information with regulators in other jurisdictions, including where they actually take disciplinary action against licensed workers.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In terms of the funding, the Australian government have now announced $11 million over three years in the recent budget to support the initial implementation of the scheme. This includes $7.5 million in funding that is being provided through the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Research" rel="nofollow">
                        Business Research
                       </a>
                       and Innovation Initiative, to find solutions to information-sharing challenges faced by the states and territories. This fills a gap in the current arrangements with regulators so they'll be better able to target and manage their compliance and enforcement activities, focusing on high-risk occupations and activities. Businesses and consumers will benefit, as noncompliant workers will not be able to access automatic mutual recognition and, therefore, will not be able to work in another state. I hope that information assists you.

                        Minister, just coming back to teachers for a couple of more questions: because automatic registration isn't listed on a typical register, this bill creates a situation where individual principals and school administrators will have to manually investigate whether there are any conditions or any red flags on a prospective hire's registration in another jurisdiction. I'm just wondering if that seems reasonable to you.

                             I want to make a quick comment just to say again that the rushed nature of this bill is pretty despicable. There was absolutely no need to do that, but we have revised our amendments, given the very short period of time, to make sure that teachers as well as workers who are engaged in building, maintenance or construction industry activity or in electrical occupation activity are actually excluded from the operation of the mutual recognition processes established in the bill. This reflects workers' and unions' concerns with their inclusion in this government's slapdash scheme.

                              The government will not be supporting the Greens amendments. I am now noting the updated amendment (2) put before the Senate. This would completely, totally and utterly exclude these people, and as such people working in these industries would not be able to avail themselves of the copious benefits that we have been through of automatic mutual recognition. It also fails to properly understand the fact that if any particular state does have any concern, they themselves are actually able to put in place an exemption.
