         Mr President
        </a>
        , on behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
        </a>
        I have pleasure in presenting the Committee’s report entitled
        <i>
         Review of the re-listing of Ansar al-Islam, AAA, IAA, IMU, JeM and LeJ as terrorist organisations
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, this report has departed from the usual format of terrorist proscription reports. It has done so because the Committee has sought some improvements to the way in which statements of reasons are drafted.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        recommends that in future the Attorney-General provide the Committee with a statement of reasons where a decision is taken not to re-list an organisation similar to that now supplied when an organisation is listed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, there is no requirement for the Attorney-General to provide the Committee with detailed reasons when he decides not to re-list an organisation. The Committee, however, feels that it would be useful if, where the Attorney-General has decided he will not be re-listing an organisation as a terrorist organisation under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
         Criminal Code
        </a>
        , a statement of reasons explaining his decision is provided to the Committee and that there also be a publicly released statement of reasons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On the subject of decisions not to re-list the Committee was advised that the Attorney-General recently considered advice from the Director-General of Security with respect to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_Islamic_Jihad" rel="nofollow">
         Egyptian Islamic Jihad
        </a>
        (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIJ" rel="nofollow">
         EIJ
        </a>
        ). Based on this advice he stated he would not be re-listing EIJ as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code after the current listing expired on 30 March 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President I now turn to requested improvements to the statements of reasons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee in this Parliament and earlier Parliaments has taken the view that non-statutory guidelines used by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        are useful tools in evaluating the evidence supporting a listing or re-listing. The Committee believes it would be helpful in its role if the statements of reasons be written in a way that directly links the evidence with ASIO’s guidelines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This approach would also better inform public understanding of the listing process and outcomes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee has also requested that future statements of reasons be drafted, at least in part, in such a way that the information is directly referrable to the statutory criteria for listing contained within the Criminal Code.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President, to turn to the current regulations, they were signed by the Governor-General on 13 March 2009. They were then tabled in the House of Representatives and the Senate on 17 March 2009. The disallowance period of 15 sitting days for the Committee’s review of the listing began from the date of the tabling. Therefore the Committee was required to report to the Parliament by today, Monday 15 June 2009.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Notice of the inquiry was placed on the Committee’s website. One submission was received from a public organisation. Representatives of the Federation of Community Legal Centres (Vic) Inc, the Attorney-General’s Department and ASIO attended a private hearing on the listings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr President I will now take this opportunity to outline some brief information on each organisation and I will also outline the Committee’s findings in relation to each of these six organisations.
