          I wish the rabble across the other side of the chamber would just be quiet for a minute. Can the minister please inform the Senate of the importance of Australian Citizenship Day and the value of Australian citizenship? As you, as a proud Australian citizen, are aware it is very important to update the Senate on the citizenship ceremony that was conducted in the

           I thank the senator for the question. It is a great day for Australian democracy and citizenship when a Scotsman can ask a Welshman a question while being interjected upon by people from Germany, Belgium and

           . It says something about the country. Of course, all of them are now Australians; all are now citizens of this country. Not all of them use their hands as much as others, but nevertheless. We have been enriched by cultures and traditions from more than 200 countries. Since the introduction of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Citizenship Act
           </a>
           1949 over four million people have taken the pledge to become Australians. Australian citizenship is the bond that unites us all in one common endeavour. In a world increasingly devoid of boundaries and markers, Australian citizenship binds us together across heritage, culture, politics, wealth, religion, colour and—in some cases—language.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government believes that anyone who is of good character and has the will and commitment to learn about Australia should be able to become a citizen, to seize that opportunity. Today is an opportunity for all Australians, whether citizens by birth or by choice, to reflect on their rights and responsibilities and the role that Australian citizenship plays in building a strong, harmonious and united nation.
          </p>

           we made 15 or so people Australian citizens. They were from Zimbabwe, London and all round the world. They included a family with a

           father, a New Zealand mother and Australian born children. As the father said, they have the tri-nations covered. They are a great example of the diversity of the people who come to make their home here and contribute to Australia. That act of taking out citizenship is their commitment to their country and we are all richer for that.

            , I ask a supplementary question. What concepts do the government believe best represent what it means to be an Australian citizen? How has the government ensured that they are reflected in the newly announced citizenship test resource book?

             The government is committed to promoting an understanding of what it means to become an Australian citizen. We are committed to ensuring that all migrants to this country learn more about how the nation works, what their rights are and what their responsibilities are. We are keen to make sure that there are pathways, not false barriers, to people taking up the opportunity to become an Australian citizen.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today I released the new citizenship test resource book. This is a result of the citizenship test review committee’s findings that the old book was inaccessible to many migrants, that the language used was often complex and overly sophisticated and that it hindered the ability of some people in gaining a good understanding of what becoming an Australian meant. The new book has been designed in plain English by educational civic experts and I think that it will ensure that people have a better understanding of their responsibilities and rights when they become Australian citizens. It is based on the pledge of commitment. It gives a structure to what we believe people need to understand.

               One of the reasons citizenship is important is that it lets that individual contribute fully to Australian society. It also ensures that we get full benefit from their skills and abilities. It also helps build social inclusion. People who are included and who feel part of a community are more likely to contribute and more likely to be part of a cohesive society. That is something that this country has done very well over many years. We have seen migrants come to this country, become citizens and make a contribution—people like

               . There are four migrants in the cabinet. You may not regard that as a good contribution, but four of them are in the cabinet, including the Deputy Prime Minister. I am pleased to say that new migrants are represented right around this chamber and all are making a contribution to our democracy.
