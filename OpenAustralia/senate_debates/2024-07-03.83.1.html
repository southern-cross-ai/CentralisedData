         I thank Senator Hanson for the question. First, it is true that there is a very, very big change in Australia's energy system that is required, not just to deal with the transition to 2050, but to ensure that Australians have access to the cheapest form of new energy, which is renewables. It is true that our transmission system is very much predicated on what we have had for the last 50 years, which is large coal-fired power stations closer to urban areas, or able to service large urban areas, with the transmission system we have. So there is a big change.

         In relation to consultation, I think I've been asked about this before and I'll see if while I'm on my feet someone can find some additional information for you. I do understand—
        </p>
        <p>
         And I'm very upfront about this, Senator Cash. What I would say is it is important that social licence for this change continues to be sought. This change does require engagement, and I respect the fact that there are communities and landowners who are supportive and there are landowners and communities who are not. There is also the importance of engaging with

          First Nations
         </a>
         leaders as well. So I would say to you that consultation is happening. I accept that this requires ongoing discussion—

            Firstly, approvals in relation to environmental requirements, which are some of the things that you've referred to, would continue to be required under relevant state and federal legislation. I'll confirm if my answer is not correct. But my understanding is that you still have the regulatory framework in relation to environmental approvals. The social licence question I think is a different question. I can say to you that in the last budget the government invested about $20 million in three different initiatives: one, strengthening the governance of the Energy Infrastructure Commissioner to enhance its independence and its ability to address misinformation, to support
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             First Nations
            </a>
            peoples and to improve complaint resolutions; secondly, working with a diverse range of stakeholders on the introduction of a developer rating scheme to encourage best practice and to foster transparency and trust, and to explore options for better delivering benefits—

                communities and native title holders remain. There is, I think, a separate issue, which you have been advocating for, which is ensuring that regional communities in the broad are consulted about what is occurring in their communities—and also gain the benefits. The last point I was going to make was one of the measures that is being looked at by the government is whether or not you could deliver direct bill relief and additional benefits in regions most affected by renewable energy developments. In other words, can you provide some economic benefits, some way of demonstrating the economic benefit these communities are providing to the country in the region itself? These are all matters the government has—
