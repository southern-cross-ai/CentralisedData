        <i>

        </i>
        delivers for Defence bases and infrastructure across the country?

         I thank Senator Williams for that very important question. Reliable access to essential and contemporary facilities—whether they are military bases, wharves, port facilities, airbases, training ranges or fuel and explosive ordnance infrastructure—is absolutely vital to the ADF's ability to conduct and sustain operations in Australia and across the region. That is why the
         <i>
          2016 Defence white paper
         </i>
         has examined the issue of key enablers so closely and why we will invest over the next decade about $26 billion in upgrading and expanding those Defence facilities right across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also going to spend over the decade on the maintenance of our existing 600 Defence sites $19 billion, which will include refurbishment and garrison support. That is very, very important to the men and women of the ADF. In fact, every state and territory in Australia will benefit from this massive investment. Much of it, by virtue of the locations of many of these sites, will be in regional and remote Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         For far too long, the white paper confirms—and those who work within them would also say this—that critical Defence estate and infrastructure has been neglected. It has suffered from very significant underinvestment. In fact Labor cut almost $2.7 billion from Defence estate funding over the forward estimates period while they were in government. We recognise that to support our 21st century Defence Force they need 21st century facilities. With the white paper, the Turnbull government will absolutely revitalise the infrastructure that underpins our

           I thank Senator Williams for that supplementary question, because those Defence facilities span our nation, whether it is in an urban environment, like the location of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Base_East" rel="nofollow">
            Fleet Base East
           </a>
           in Sydney, or in some of our most regional and remote locations, like
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
            RAAF
           </a>

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           . When we are investing in these upgrades—the enhancements and refurbishments—we are actually also investing in those local communities. The purpose of the white paper in pursuing this investment is going to enable us to create local benefits and local jobs wherever there are Defence bases and wherever there are businesses that support Defence. The significant funding for Defence estate and infrastructure that I have already outlined will be spent locally and it will benefit local communities and regions.

             That would be 'our' home state, I think, Senator Williams. Over the next decade in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             alone, the investment in estate and infrastructure and the upgrading of Defence facilities will come to almost $6 billion. Much of that will actually be spent in regional New South Wales. For example, we will invest around $800 million, long overdue, in the Riverina region upgrading both Kapooka and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
              RAAF
             </a>
             Base Wagga over the next decade. We will invest around $50 million to refurbish very important key training facilities at Singleton, with a broader redevelopment of around $200 million over the decade from 2025 to support both our land and special forces capabilities. On the

              South Coast
             </a>
             we will be supporting the 24 Seahawk helicopters, which are currently be accepted into service at

             Albatross. To do that, the base will require an upgrade of around $100 million.
