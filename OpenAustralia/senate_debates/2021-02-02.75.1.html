         I thank Senator Smith for his question and his long interest in matters concerning Myanmar. The Australian government is, as I stated in a statement yesterday, deeply concerned that the Myanmar military, the Tatmadaw, has seized control of Myanmar. Early on 1 February, the Tatmadaw detained democratically elected leaders, including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, the President and others. The Tatmadaw has announced a state of emergency and the establishment of a caretaker government with the military-appointed Vice-President currently appointed caretaker President. He has handed authority to the commander-in-chief for one year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The situation does remain fluid. Communications, including phones and internet in the capital, Naypyidaw, and in the city of Yangon, are severely disrupted. The Tatmadaw are demanding revision of the November 2020 election results and have announced that they intend to hold new elections. I note for the record that Australia was part of international observer participation in relation to those elections through our post in Yangon. In the statement I released yesterday, we did call on the military to respect the rule of law, to resolve disputes according to lawful mechanisms and to release immediately all civilian leaders who had been detained unlawfully. The Australian government has called for the peaceful reconvening of the national assembly of Myanmar, consistent with the results of that November 2020 general election. Our embassy in Yangon is making inquiries regarding the safety and position of Australians, to the extent that disrupted communications allow.
        </p>
        <p>
         These events are particularly concerning, because the political stability of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         member states is essential to achieving a secure, peaceful region—a prosperous and open Indo-Pacific. ASEAN of course is at the centre of our vision for the Indo-Pacific region.

            We are in close contact with other countries, including through our embassy in Yangon, to discuss these developments and our respective responses. Like-minded democracies around the world have expressed that they share our deep concern. We welcome statements by regional partners and other governments, including

            Last week, on 29 January, we signed a joint statement affirming our support for Myanmar's democratic transition, urging the military to adhere to democratic norms, with a number of like-minded countries represented in Yangon. We will continue to work through our overseas network to engage with other governments, particularly in our region.

               Australia has been a longstanding partner for Myanmar through both good times and more-difficult periods. We've consistently supported the move to democracy—that transition period—and the social and economic reform agenda. I visited Myanmar shortly after my appointment as foreign minister in December 2018, and I know Senator Smith has visited on previous occasions as well. Our development program there includes a focus on promoting peace and stability, on democratic institutions, on supporting elections, and on the peace process and women's empowerment and gender equality. Our commitment to Myanmar's development and Myanmar's people continues at this difficult time and includes support for vaccine access, for delivering humanitarian assistance and for supporting inclusive social and economic development. We sincerely hope to see Myanmar succeed, for the benefit of all of its people and for our region as a whole. And I do want to assure the people of Myanmar, and the many members in the diaspora here in Australia, that we will stand with them in this difficult time.
