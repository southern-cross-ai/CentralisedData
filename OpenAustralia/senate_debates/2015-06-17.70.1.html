         I thank Senator Johnston for his question. I was delighted to announce yesterday, with the education minister, Minister Pyne, the introduction of a simplified student visa framework (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSVF" rel="nofollow">
          SSVF
         </a>
         ) to support Australia's international education services sector. The simplified student visa framework will provide incentives for all education providers in all sectors to recruit genuine students.
        </p>
        <p>
         Stakeholders have indicated that a new framework was required that maintained the benefits of streamlined visa processing but addressed issues such as the regulatory costs of the arrangements. The simplified student visa framework is expected to support the sustainable growth of the international sector by simplifying the student visa framework and reducing red tape; by creating a level playing field for all education providers; and by delivering a targeted and nuanced approach to immigration integrity. The new framework will replace both the streamlined visa processing arrangements and the current assessment level framework, and will apply to all international students. The changes outlined this week will mean a reduction in the number of student visa subclasses from eight down to two, and the introduction of a simplified, single immigration framework for all international students. An improved approach to the administration of student visas as part of the new framework will have clear benefits and reduce complexity within the current framework. The new framework will combine the immigration risk associated with both the student's intended education provider and the country of citizenship into a single immigration risk model. There will be no additional obligations or burdens placed on education providers. This government welcomes genuine international students and we are committed to improving and protecting the integrity of our immigration system to facilitate their entry to Australia.

           (â€”) (): This government regards its discussions with relevant key sectors as critically important to improving immigration services. The changes that we have announced follow consultations on the government discussion paper,
           <i>
            Future directions for streamlined visa processing
           </i>
           . Written submissions were invited from members of the Education Visa Consultative Committee (EVCC) and other key stakeholders in response to the formal discussion paper, and a total of 32 submissions were received. Individual meetings were also held with individual stakeholders and discussions were held at quarterly EVCC meetings. The changes have been welcomed by the education sector, including today by representatives of

           for Private Education and Training, and the International Education Association of Australia. But we do not stop there. Our consultation with the sector will continue, and a working group with international education sector stakeholders is being formed to guide implementation of the new framework.

             Again, the government is committed to maintaining a competitive student visa process that supports sustainable growth in the international education sector, whilst maintaining high levels of immigration integrity. The simplified student visa framework will enhance integrity by limiting streamline evidence requirements to only the lowest immigration risk providers in the highest risk markets, providing greater discretion to visa-processing officers to request evidence of financial and English language capacity from streamlined students, where it is deemed appropriate, and reviewing and updating the risk ratings every six months.
            </p>
            <p>
             The genuine temporary entrant requirement, established by a publicly available ministerial discretion or direction, will continue to be the main integrity safeguard and will enable decision makers to refuse non-genuine applicants. This government is committed to our international education sector, while at all times ensuring that immigration risk is properly managed.
