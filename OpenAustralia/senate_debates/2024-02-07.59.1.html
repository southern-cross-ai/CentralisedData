        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Minister Wong. The Prime Minister said last night:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I was pretty up-front in December. I said we were looking at ways for cost-of-living pressures to be relieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Treasury confirmed on Monday that it was preparing work on changing the stage 3 tax cuts from 11 December, and, when asked about this on 21 December, the Prime Minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Well, we've made no decisions along those lines. We're not reconsidering that position.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will you now apologise on behalf of the Prime Minister for the deliberate way in which he has misled the Australian people?

        <p>
         Well, on the second day of question time after we table in the House this important legislation, finally the coalition get close to asking a question on the tax package, but they don't actually want to ask about the content. They have to ask about time lines. It's pretty extraordinary, isn't it? Well, you know what? What is so interesting is that you fulminated, you used words such as that this was such a betrayal, a treachery or a trickery—all of these things—and now you're voting for it. If you really thought this was the wrong thing to do, you would vote against it and you would say you'd repeal it. You know it's the right thing to do, and the fact that you are voting for it simply proves that.

             . I was struck by the way in which the approach of the then Treasurer, Mr Morrison, to tax reform was to leak it. There was the Prime Minister of the day and the

                     After the Prime Minister clearly demonstrates that when he says, 'We have no plans; we are not considering that,' what that actually means is, 'We are planning to do exactly that,' how do you expect Australians to believe you when you say, as you said recently, that Labor has no plans to introduce changes to negative gearing?

                      It's interesting, isn't it? I'm asked how Australians can believe anybody. Well, how are they supposed to believe a coalition that actually is complaining about a change it's voting for? How are they supposed to believe that, and how are they supposed to believe that you're the party of lower taxes?

But I think you are now debating with Senator Wong. I am going to listen carefully to the minister's response. If there is a need to redirect, I will.

They want us to rule things in or out, but I notice the deputy leader of the opposition is ducking and weaving and doesn't want to rule things in or out anyway. This lot over here used to be to the party of lower taxes. We're the party of lower taxes. This is what the Dutton opposition has sunk to.
