        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Minister Wong. In recent weeks, we saw shocking revelations that the man appointed as the chair of the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency, Mr Hugh Woodbury, stood on his pregnant partner's stomach, slammed her in a door and repeatedly yelled derogatory slurs at her in front of their toddler. So far as we can tell, the only action taken by this government is to ask the board to participate in a discussion, without taking any concrete action. Does NAAJA continue to receive Commonwealth funding?

         Thank you to Senator Nampijinpa Price for the question. I first start by saying that violence is unacceptable, and the sort of violence which was described in her question and which has been reported is completely unacceptable and is very disturbing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first point I would make is that the government—and, I know, Minister Burney—expects all organisations funded by the

             The advice I have is that—I'm sorry; I'm just trying to work out where this brief is from. Minister Burney and the Northern Territory Attorney-General have met with the board. It is critical that the board ensure that Aboriginal people that need services from NAAJA get them. We do agree that it is time for the board of NAAJA to show leadership when it comes to family violence. We all have a responsibility to lead by example.

               The board continues to defend the chair. However, does the government agree with the Territory Labor domestic violence minister, Kate Worden, who said that it was totally inappropriate for Mr Woodbury to lead NAAJA and said that it was a matter for the federal government to intervene?

                First, if I could correct something I said in my first answer, what I should have said is that the Attorney-General has met Ms Burney and the Northern Territory Attorney-General in relation to this matter.

               <p>

                    Order! The senator is on her feet. I invite other senators to make a contribution at some other time, not question time. Senator Nampijinpa Price, second supplementary?

                     . It's an organisation that repeatedly took a taxpayer funded trip to Darwin against legal advice. It is an organisation that has had its most senior female executive resign, and, as we learned last week, it's an organisation that was found by the Federal Court to have unlawfully sacked its former
