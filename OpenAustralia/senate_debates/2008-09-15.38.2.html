        Section 11 in each Determinations permit relevant information to be disclosed if it is necessary to brief a Minister in relation to issues that are, or will be, raised publicly by the person to whom the relevant information relates, so that the Minister can correct, amongst other things, ‘an incorrectly held opinion’.

         The Committee
        </a>
        sought clarification on the intended meaning of this term. The Minister advised that the provision ‘an incorrectly held opinion’ is intended to refer to the situation where opinions are formed on the basis of incorrect information. Given this explanation, the Committee has written to the Minister seeking an amendment to the Guidelines to make this clear by referring to ‘opinions formed on the basis of incorrect information’ rather than ‘incorrectly held opinions’.
