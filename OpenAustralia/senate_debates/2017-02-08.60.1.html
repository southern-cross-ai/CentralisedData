        My question is to the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield. On 31 January the ABC shut down its shortwave service in outback Australia, cutting of Australians living in remote and regional areas from vital information provided by our national broadcaster. Why has the minister allowed the service to be scrapped on his watch?

         do not have access to ABC shortwave services. It used to be common around the country but, progressively, over the best part of about 10 years, these services have been discontinued.
        </p>
        <p>
         I should make clear that this was a decision made by the board and management of the ABC. As colleagues would be aware the ABC has legislative independence—independence that this parliament has given them—in relation to operational matters. I should also point out that the ABC's decision is in no way related to government funding.

        </p>
        <p>
         The ABC's view is that the validity of this particular technology is something that has been eroded over time, that it provides a poor-quality service, and that the cost, in the view of the ABC, is disproportionate to its maintenance. I will have some further things to say, no doubt, in response to Senator McCarthy's next question.

           I should indicate that while I recognise that this is entirely a decision of the ABC I think the consultation that the ABC undertook could have been more extensive. Also, the ABC did give a limited period of notice. These are views that I have conveyed to the ABC and I think the ABC has learnt some valuable lessons when it comes to consultation and engagement with rural and regional Australia. I am also pleased that the ABC has now announced that there will be some transitional arrangements to assist people in the

            Northern Territory

           who may have been in receipt of shortwave transmissions to use other mechanisms to connect with the ABC as an organisation. I will share some of those in the answer to the next question.

             Given that the Turnbull government has slashed funding to the ABC by $254 million, is it not clear, Minister, that those living in regional and remote areas who are losing this vital service only have the Turnbull government to blame?
