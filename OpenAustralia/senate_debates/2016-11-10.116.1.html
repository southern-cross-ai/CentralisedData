        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. I refer to the public commentary of numerous coalition backbenchers on the US election. This morning the member for Hughes said about President-elect Trump's plea to cancel the Paris agreement on climate change:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Paris is cactus.
       </p>
       <p>
        Is the comment consistent with the Prime Minister's announcement today that Australia has ratified its Paris climate targets?

                There is no point of order. That is a debating point. I would ask senators to observe silence when senators are asking questions and giving answers. You may commence your question again, Senator O'Neill. We will reset the clock.

                      I will come to your question in a moment, Senator O'Neill, but I wonder why it is that you would preface your question with the words 'Senator Bernardi, who is currently on a taxpayer funded trip to the

                       United Nations

                      ' while omitting to mention that your colleague Senator

                       Lisa Singh
                      </a>
                      is on the same taxpayer funded visit to the United Nations which has been a convention of this parliament for many, many years. The innuendo against Senator Bernardi seems to be both unfair and borderline dishonest.

                     <p>
                      There is no doubt that there will be an enormous amount of commentary on what everybody acknowledges to have been a very, very historic election, an election that was unexpected by most. Senator Bernardi is perfectly entitled to make comments. The comment that has been attributed to him has been made by many others.

                             I thank Senator Back for a very sensible question on the US election outcome. Let me restate that, in the first instance, Australia's highest priority in security and strategic terms is and will continue to be our alliance with the United States in terms of protecting our own national security and our own position. Indeed, as the Prime Minister himself discussed with President Trump this morning, this very strong and deep alliance remains at the core of Australia's security and defence planning.

Our support to that alliance is unwavering. For the past 70 years, as the defence white paper states and as I alluded to earlier, the strong presence of the United States has underpinned the stability of this region and around the world.

                             I look forward to continuing the relationships that we have built up over the time of this government through this transition period and then with the new Trump administration after the inauguration. My recent visit to Washington, and that of the Prime Minister and the

                             , reinforced those key personal relationships with interlocutors across the spectrum in Washington and enabled us to inform ourselves of activities around the election campaign itself and the future, as it may arrive, in the post-election environment. Through early engagement with the new administration, I and our colleagues will be resolute in working closely with the new administration in support of our common regional and security interests. This government is committed to deepening our longstanding defence cooperation with the United States in the pursuit of peace, security and stability in our region.
