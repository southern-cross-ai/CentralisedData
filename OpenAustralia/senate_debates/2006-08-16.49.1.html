        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison. Will the minister please update the Senate on the progress in establishing the Australian government’s new family relationship centres?

         I thank Senator Troeth for what is a very important question which concerns many Australians. In one of the most significant reforms to family law in this country in 30 years, we have now introduced the family relationship centres. On 3 July this year 15 centres opened. It is great to see that they are in action and to see the work that is being done. But we should remember what these centres are aimed at—at assisting families who are having relationship difficulties and, indeed, where relationships have broken down. Unfortunately it is a fact of life in Australia today that not all relationships are lasting and, in many of those situations, there are children involved.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am pleased to say that, in relation to the 15 family relationship centres which have opened, over 2,000 telephone calls have been received, 720 people have dropped into a centre for assistance with family relationship issues and some 1,020 interviews have been conducted with an equal percentage of female and male clients. As well as that, 255 clients have attended group sessions and the family relationships advice line has received some 8,600 calls. As well as the 31,000 information kits which has been mailed out some 10,000 kits have been distributed as a result of requests from people in relation to the new family relationship centres. I urge all senators to have a look at these kits because they spell out of the new family law system and, interestingly, they have on their cover
         <i>
          Putting the focus on kids
         </i>
         . It has in it some very important messages for people who are going through relationship difficulties and indeed the breakdown of relationships—and importantly so where children are involved. I think that this sort of material can be of great benefit to those people who are in that situation.
        </p>
        <p>
         These 15 family relationship centres are located at Joondalup in my home state of

         ; and here in Canberra—such is the diversity of the location of these relationship centres, and of course there are more to come. Next year we will see further relationship centres rolled out. The target is that we will have a further 25 in July 2007 and another 25 in July 2008, bringing it to a total of 65 family relationship centres across Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a significant reform to family law in this country. It is an initiative which is designed to streamline and make less complicated the advice that is available to families who are having difficulties in relationships and, importantly, it is placing great focus on the children who are subject to those difficulties and, in some, cases separation. I commend all senators to take up the offer of the Attorney-General to look at these kits and at the good work being done by family relationship centres.
