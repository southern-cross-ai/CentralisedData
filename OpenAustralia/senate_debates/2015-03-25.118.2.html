        My question is to the diligent Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash, in her capacity representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the minister inform the Senate of how the coalition government is delivering on its promise to build the infrastructure of the 21st century?

         I thank Senator Sinodinos for his question. This government promised the Australian people that if we were elected to govern we would deliver to them the infrastructure of the 21st century, and that is exactly what we are doing. This government has made a historic investment into infrastructure of $50 billion through to 2019-20. I remind senators that our investment into infrastructure is $16.4 billion more than what those opposite promised. That is right: $16.4 billion more than what those opposite promised. Under this government, 84 projects are currently under construction right across Australia, with another 88 projects in detailed planning stages, with construction expected to commence in the near future.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of major works, they include the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Highway
         </a>
         , in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , for which 60 per cent, or 397 kilometres, of the final highway length has already been duplicated, with a further 123 kilometres under construction. A total of 2,137 construction workers were on-site across the Pacific Highway at the end of last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Then, of course, under this government there is the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney

         commenced in January 2015. We said we would deliver on infrastructure and that is exactly what this government is doing.

            As Senator Sinodinos knows, investing in infrastructure is critical for the people of Sydney and the surrounding areas, as well as those living in the regional areas of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

            . Our decision to work with Premier Mike Baird, Deputy Premier Troy Grant and the rest of the New South Wales coalition government to invest in infrastructure is ensuring that the people of New South Wales have a strong and prosperous economy. Their economy has been boosted and productivity has increased, and we have created thousands of jobs for people on the ground.
