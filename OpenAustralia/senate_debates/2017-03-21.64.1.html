        If you will be quiet, please, Senator Wong, I will continue. Can the minister update the Senate on the coalition government's plans for regional Australia and in particular the establishment of a new regional ministerial taskforce, which met for the first time last week? How will a new task force deliver for people living in rural, regional and remote communities?

         I thank the honourable senator for his question. I know only too well how much importance he, as a senator from Inverell, places on the future of regional Australia. We all know that he is facing some health challenges at the moment. We certainly acknowledge his bravery. Senator Williams, I am sure you have the support of all senators in this place.

         I am absolutely delighted to inform those who have not already heard that last week the Prime Minister and I announced the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Regional Australia
         </a>
         Ministerial Taskforce. This task force is going to bring forward cross-portfolio ministers across a whole range of areas that are going to ensure that we have a very strong future for regional Australia—across health, education, industry, employment, agriculture, resources, regional development and communications. This is going to have a cross-portfolio, whole-of-government approach that is going to see even more importance placed on regional communities. I think that indicates the importance that this coalition government places on regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         We saw that this was very well received. The

          It is incredibly disappointing that those sitting on the other side of the chamber choose just to use the opportunity to interject, which just indicates the lack of importance they place on regional Australia.

             Those of us on this side of the chamber know that, when we have strong regions, we have a strong nation. In spite of the fact that only a third of the people in this nation live outside of the capital cities, we are responsible for two-thirds of the nation's exports. Around 67 per cent of the exports are driven by regional Australia.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">

            </p>
            <p>
             On this side of the chamber, we know that this country can only prosper if our regions prosper. We want to make sure that we help build strong and secure regional communities into the future so that our children and our grandchildren either want to stay in those communities or come back to those communities. The coalition understands, unlike those opposite, that when we invest in regional communities it gives them confidence, and that is what they need to take their communities forward.

                Oh, I certainly am, and it is the Labor Party's policy failures in regional Australia that I am aware of. I might even need an extension of time, because this list is so long. What did we see from those opposite in government? We saw the carbon tax that decimated regional Australia. We saw those opposite ban live export to Indonesia, the cattle trade, decimating communities across the North of Australia and below. There were cost blowouts and delays to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
                 NBN
                </a>
                . When it comes to mobile phone black spots, how many were addressed? We remember from last time: zero. Then we have the former failed minister Senator Wong's water stuff-ups: $303 million to buy back water from Twynam—only 20 per cent—and $34 million for Tandou—supplementary water which they only got in a flood. These are Labor's failures in the regions.
