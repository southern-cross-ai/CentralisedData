        Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, or SIGAR, released their 41st quarterly report on 30 October, revealing that billions of dollars in Western foreign aid has been lost to widespread waste, lax oversight and endemic corruption. Special Inspector John Sopko stated that aid had been used to build medical clinics with no power or water, schools without children and programs that hired ghost workers—non-existent bureaucrats, police and soldiers. SIGAR highlighted major probity issues with two key funds: the

         I thank Senator Bernardi for his question. Australia makes a very significant contribution to security and to development assistance in Afghanistan and has done over many years now. In fact, a significant number of Australians have paid for our support for counterterrorism efforts and freedom in Afghanistan with their lives. The issues that Senator Bernardi raises in relation to integrity, transparency and accountability in terms of the delivery of development assistance are, of course, very important ones. They are ones that we take seriously in the administration of our own contributions. I will take the detail of Senator Bernardi's question on notice in relation to specific aspects of the report that he has raised and return to the chamber with further information.

            World Bank
           </a>
           did not know how the money was being spent and:

          <p class="italic">

          </p>
          <p>
           From 2003 to 2020, Australia may be exposed to the tune of $520 million to the World Bank fund and $70 million to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
            UN

           fund. What exactly are Australia's past, present and future commitments to these funds, and what assurances can the government give that Australian taxpayer money isn't being lost in this black hole of corrupt bureaucracy?

            Australia has historically taken and continues to take a very responsible approach to the delivery of our development assistance not just in Afghanistan but, indeed, much more broadly. We are very focused on ensuring that what we contribute is delivered in an appropriate way and is delivered in an accountable and transparent way. As I have said in relation to the specific details of the report, I will take those questions on notice and return to the chamber.

             <p>
              In light of this damning evidence of corruption, waste and stupidity, why would we send another cent of Australian taxpayers' money to Afghanistan before we can be assured the funds are being equipped with due probity?

               I think it would be unfortunate if the chamber were not reminded of some of the extraordinary achievements that we have made in Afghanistan in recent years, in delivering support, for example, for the education of girls. The number of girls in education in Afghanistan has increased exponentially in the years in which we have been involved through the

                 I do have a point of order. My question was specifically about the funds we are delivering to these two organisations that have been found to be corrupt ghost programs—not extraneous commitments or anything else. I'm asking about the probity and accountability of these organisations with Australian money.
