        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Given that later this year Australians will have the opportunity to vote 'yes' to a Voice which will finally recognise Aboriginal and

        people in our Constitution and pay respect to 65,000 years of culture and tradition and will help us listen to advice from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, can the minister explain to the Senate how constitutional recognition through a Voice will make a practical difference and improve the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people?

         Thank you to Senator Smith. She's an outstanding advocate on these issues in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         and more broadly for her state. The question goes to the heart of what the Voice is about: recognising Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people in our Constitution and respecting 65,000 years of culture and tradition. It's about listening to advice from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people about matters that affect their lives so governments can make better decisions, and about making practical progress in Indigenous health, education, employment and housing so people can have a better life. That's what the Voice is about.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all know that governments have spent billions trying to deal with these issues. Many of us have been in this chamber for many years and have made contributions on the Closing the Gap statements. The extent of the task before the nation is clear. We have not achieved the results we all want. The gap between Indigenous and non-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australian
         </a>
         s is not closing. We know there are enormous challenges facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: life expectancy eight years shorter than for non-
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , worse rates of suicide, worse rates of disease, worse rates of infant mortality, and fewer opportunities for education and training.
        </p>
        <p>
         The current approach is broken, and the Voice is our best chance to fix that. Voting 'no' means nothing will change, and it means accepting that we can't do better. I don't think Australians accept that, which is why those opposite keep trying to change the conversation. They keep trying to change the conversation from what the Voice will do, to other matters. The fact is the Voice is a vehicle to deliver real improvements for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in health, life expectancy, education and employment and housing. What we know is that, when governments listen to people about issues that affect them, they make better decisions, they get better results and they get better value for money.

            Senator Smith is right. The call for constitutional recognition through a voice didn't come from politicians.

            s have asked us to help make a practical change and to create a better future for all Australians. In 2017, after many years of work and countless conversations in every part of the country, nearly 250 Aboriginal and

             Torres Strait Islander
            </a>
            leaders and elders called for a voice. It was an invitation to help make a practical change to their lives and to create better opportunities for future generations, and it is backed by 80 per cent, eight out of 10, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Aunty
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
             Pat Anderson
            </a>
            , a respected Indigenous advocate and elder, says this about the Voice:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            When you involve people, you make better decisions and the money you spend goes where it's needed most: to the people on the ground.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is what a 'yes' vote will do. It will give people a say on issues that affect them and make a practical difference that improves lives.

               s, face worse life expectancy, worse results in education and employment, worse outcomes in health and so much more. Regrettably, there are too many in this debate who are prepared to look to their own political interests rather than the interests of the nation. I remind the Senate of what I spoke about yesterday, which was Mr Coorey being told by a colleague—maybe one of those opposite, or certainly a colleague of those opposite:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               We can't win the election unless we defeat the Voice solidly, ie we need to defeat it to get to the election starting line.
              </p>
              <p>
               I know those opposite might not like that, but I think what it demonstrates is, yet again, their habit of putting politics over people. That is the approach we remember from the Morrison-Dutton government, and we see that now.
