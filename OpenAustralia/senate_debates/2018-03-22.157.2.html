        I rise to address reports that, in line with its ideology of outsourcing and job destruction, the Turnbull government is planning to select a private sector visa service provider to replace jobs currently being performed by public servants at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        . Not only is this policy a risk to Australian jobs, threatening over 100 jobs in my home state of Tasmania; it also, in my view, potentially puts at risk matters of privacy and security as well as over 2,000 jobs across the country. In the wake of so many recent data breaches and hacking scandals, it's hard to imagine that any government would consider replacing public sector jobs with a private company, but it's been reported that a tender process could begin as early as July this year. With the government already having awarded a contract to Datacom to take over the immigration call centre work, we know the direction that we're being taken in.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Dutton started his new job as Minister for Home Affairs by outsourcing 250 Public Service jobs to a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        company. The outsourcing of these jobs follows an ongoing dispute between the out-of-touch Turnbull government and thousands of Immigration and Border Protection employees over pay and conditions. Unfortunately it seems like the government doesn't care about the jobs of everyday Australians. Well, Labor does. Labor values the important work of public servants as well as the expertise and experience of our frontline workers in the Department of Home Affairs. We are acutely aware that all this and more is at risk if the government manages to privatise our visa-processing services.
       </p>
       <p>
        I personally have been contacted by Tasmanian workers who are worried about their jobs being lost if the government privatises visa processing in Australia. They're worried about what this will mean for their jobs, for privacy and security and for the integrity of Australia's migration program. One constituent said that the possible privatisation:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … has the potential to see the loss of a substantial number of public service jobs, including my own and many more of my dedicated and highly skilled colleagues. My job is important to me. I proudly undertake my duties and serve the Australian community with integrity, diligence, courtesy, honesty and most importantly, a great sense of responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        This constituent is right. They take pride in their work and they have a right to be concerned about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Turnbull government has been notably silent on its plans for the future of visa services, but Labor took the initiative, at a recent Senate estimates hearing, to question the Department of Home Affairs about these plans. The department confirmed that the future of visa service delivery will ultimately be a decision for the Turnbull government. That's why I rise today to urge the government to be up-front and honest with the visa processing staff in the department and to reconsider any plans for the privatisation of Australia's visa processing arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Turnbull government, because of its conservative, cost-cutting ideology, is incapable of treating Australia's public servants with the respect they deserve. Unlike the Turnbull government, Labor values the important work of Australia's public servants and the expertise and experience of our frontline workers. We'll continue to hold the government to account and ask questions about where the Turnbull government is taking us. As the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPSU" rel="nofollow">
         CPSU
        </a>
        said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … when public services are privatised Australian taxpayers end up paying more and getting poorer services.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a matter of importance for all Australians. It's an issue that could impact the jobs of over 2,000 Australians. The Turnbull government has shown itself ready, time and again, to put the profits of private companies ahead of the jobs of ordinary Australians. It's time this government finally gets behind Australian workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another issue I'd like to raise today in the adjournment debate is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Down_Syndrome_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Down Syndrome Day
        </a>
        , an international event that aims to promote a better understanding of Down syndrome and to remove the stigma and the misunderstandings surrounding it. It was wonderful to have had the opportunity during World Down Syndrome Day yesterday to meet with members of the Down Syndrome Advisory Network and hear from such engaging speakers as Claire Mitchell, who spoke of her experiences living with Down syndrome. The Down Syndrome Advisory Network exists to provide advice directly to the board of Down Syndrome Australia and to help it understand the needs of people living with Down syndrome.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was lucky enough to meet some of the members, including Ebony Beveridge, a 21-year-old from my home state of Tasmania, who represents people with Down syndrome at workshops for teachers and teaching assistants. I also met with Ursula, who took the time to come to parliament to share her experience and help raise awareness of Down syndrome. I met Kylie and her mother. Kylie attends various conferences, presenting to various audiences, and runs her own public speaking business. What I shared with so many of these people was a real excitement to be able to be in parliament to celebrate this day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The co-convenors of the Parliamentary Friends of Disability Group, Senators Linda Reynolds and Jordon Steele-John, and I moved a motion in the Senate yesterday to celebrate this day and to note the ongoing barriers that society creates for people with disabilities to participating fully in society. The theme of this year's celebration is 'What I Bring to the Community', and this theme shows that, just like everybody in attendance yesterday, those living with Down syndrome hope to live in and contribute to the community. That's why Down Syndrome Australia ran a 21-day countdown profiling 21 people to highlight the many different ways that people with Down syndrome are involved in the community. I'd encourage everyone to go onto the Down Syndrome Australia website and have a look at these stories to learn more about the many ways that people living with Down syndrome are giving so much to their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the event yesterday, we also saw a film by CoorDown about inclusive education in our society. The film chronicled a young girl, Lea, living with Down syndrome. It showed that, despite suggestions from others that she attend a 'special school', she preferred to be treated like everybody else, attending school and working in the same way as everybody else. What this film demonstrates is that people living with Down syndrome want to participate and give back to society in the same way all Australians do. This means treating all people in the same inclusive way, hence the hashtag #IncludeUsFromTheStart. We need to welcome all students in our schooling system and ensure that every student has the chance to participate in our education system to achieve to the best of their abilities. Certainly, there may be challenges in doing this, but, as the advert so beautifully ends, in the words of Lea, 'Who says that easy is better?'
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank Down Syndrome Australia for their work in organising this event. I'd like to thank my colleagues for their attendance and their commitment to this important cause. Most of all, I'd like to thank those who made the journey to parliament to celebrate the day yesterday. You've shown us what living with Down syndrome can mean and how important days like this are for celebrating what you bring to the community.
