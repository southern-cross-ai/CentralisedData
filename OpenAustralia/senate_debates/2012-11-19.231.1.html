        <p class="italic">
         (1) The portfolio collects information from stakeholders and the broader community.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Information is collected using forms, both paper-based and electronic, and face to face interviews, formal advisory committees, stakeholder engagement programs, partnership arrangements with industry, public consultation periods, informal networks and meetings.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) The portfolio uses a large number of paper-based and electronic forms with the exact figure being unavailable.

An indication about how long the survey would take is provided at the commencement of the phone call and in the opening paragraph of the electronic form. Generally, portfolio forms do not provide an estimate of the time taken to complete.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) For a current online survey regarding the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area Strategic Assessment, respondents have been asked how long it takes to complete the survey and this information will be available once the survey closes. However, generally speaking, the portfolio does not collect data on how long it takes to complete each form.
