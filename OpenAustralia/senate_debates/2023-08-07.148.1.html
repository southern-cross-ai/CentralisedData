             The comments that Senator Reynolds made about the

              Western Australia

             </a>
             government, and it's a matter for them to respond to that political commentary. In relation to the question about the Commonwealth, Minister Plibersek made it very clear last week that there will not be a Commonwealth takeover of laws and that the Albanese government will not be adopting or duplicating existing state and territory regimes. So that is the response to the issues that the senator has raised. I would make the point again that I understand that, from time to time, we all come here to play a bit of state and territory politics in this chamber. I think everybody does that occasionally, but—

             Yes, it is the states' house—I'm trying not to respond to some of the interjections here—but, ultimately, those laws are matters for state parliaments. We're here to deal with federal parliament matters. I make the point that I made previously, which is that the cultural heritage laws were part of a discussion that Ms Ley initiated, so it was, in fact, initiated by those on the other side. But I understand that there is no scare campaign that they don't wish to adopt in relation to the Voice.

               I am sure all senators here really enjoyed that lesson on the Constitution—probably somewhat unnecessary. My second question is: did Mr Albanese or anyone in his office talk to or pressure the

                I note that, of course, that was the default under Mr Morrison and Mr Dutton and that blaming the states or having a fight with the states was a very, very common way in which they dealt with any political issues. I'm sure that would be the instinctive response from those who were members of the Morrison-Dutton cabinet. I have no knowledge of any such discussions being had.

                state legislation. The opposition have spent some time playing a lot of politics with this issue in this chamber and in Western Australia, and I make the same point again: they are matters for the Western Australian government and Ms Ley herself commenced the discussion about cultural heritage. I have responded on that, Senator.

                   I would make the point that I think the senator is asking me a question about the consultation process which is still underway and which her deputy leader, not Senator Cash but Ms Ley, commenced. It was a process for discussion that was supported by calls from the member for Leichhardt. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:

                      As I said, this process was begun under Ms Ley. I was trying to quote Senator Duniam, but I can understand why people might want to interject. He said the Juukan Gorge events were:

                       Again, President, I raise a point of order on direct relevance. The question was: how many times specifically has the minister—as in Minister Plibersek—consulted? There are four seconds to go and the minister has gone nowhere near answering that.
