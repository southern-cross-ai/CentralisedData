        My question is to the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, Senator Carr. Can the minister inform the Senate on the government’s proposed research and development tax credit? What is the structure of the credit? How will it benefit Australian business, especially small business? How does it differ from the existing tax concession?

         I thank Senator Cameron for the question and acknowledge his longstanding interest in these issues. The research and development tax credit is the most important reform to Australian business innovation support in a generation, and I am sure that

         s win in new R&amp;D tax breaks plan’. There will be a 45 per cent refundable tax credit for companies turning over less than $20 million and a 40 per cent non-refundable tax credit for all other companies. The 45 per cent credit doubles the base rate of support available to small- and medium-sized enterprises from 7½c in the dollar to 15c in the dollar. That is equivalent to a 150 per cent tax concession. The 40 per cent non-refundable tax offset raises the base rate for large companies by a third, from 7½c to 10c in the dollar. It is equivalent to a 133 per cent tax concession. Small, innovative firms are big winners from the new R&amp;D tax credit. They will enjoy more generous rates of assistance and better access to cash refunds for their R&amp;D expenditure, and under the present arrangements a company in tax loss turning over $10 million and spending $1 million on eligible R&amp;D might eventually receive a tax deduction of $375,000 when it turns a profit. Under the new scheme—

Is the concession being used inappropriately? Are there problems with the definition and interpretation of research and development?

           As I was indicating, under the new scheme, benefits in the case I mentioned are increased from $375,000 to $450,000, so it is a major reform to extend R&amp;D support to a new generation of companies that unlocks creativity right across the economy. The R&amp;D tax concession is a great Labor reform and, of course, in its day was obviously a matter of urgent need, but it is now time for a replacement. Those opposite halved its value and ignored the problems that emerged over time in its administration. They have a legacy whereby a mining company that does $20 million worth of R&amp;D is able to claim $500 million for normal mine operations and mineral exploration associated with R&amp;D. They might have a situation under present arrangements where a construction company that does $15 million worth of R&amp;D on air-conditioning systems can potentially claim the $100 million cost of construction of a whole building on the grounds—
