        Exeter market is now one of the biggest markets in Tassie. When I was there earlier this month, there were 190 stores and thousands of people. It's not a tourist market; it's a community market. People travel from all over the region to visit, shop and meet up with friends. I set up a stall, because I'm one of their friends, so people can have their say. They can pop a ball into a tube to show what issues they would fix if they had a magic wand. The tubes for housing, cost of living and health were overflowing by the end of the day. I met Michael, a young bloke who has to wait nine months to see a psychiatrist for help with a severe mental health condition. I spoke with Shirley, a retired lady with several chronic health conditions. She has difficulties getting medical appointments when she needs them. And there was Kate, a mum who is desperate because her autistic son is falling behind at school. The teacher is managing a large classroom with no support and has no time for her son's specific needs. Our friend Annabelle travelled down from Latrobe to give us all cupcakes. Thanks, Annabelle, you are the best!

        â€”the basics on which we all rely.

        We have one of the richest countries in the world, but we can't provide citizens with these basics. It's not good enough. The people I spoke to want to see politicians working together to fix issues. They want to feel like they are being heard and listened to. At least, that's what the people at the Exeter market tell me. Guess what? I listened.
