        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Prime Minster. I refer to the embarrassing and damaging leak of Monday night's cabinet agenda to
        <i>
         Seven
        </i>
        <i>
         News
        </i>
        . Can the minister confirm that the Prime Minister threatened to punish cabinet leakers and that the response, as Seven's Mark Riley said, was to immediately leak the cabinet agenda?

         I suspect that the workings of cabinet will be something that Senator Sterle will never experience, either shadow or government. I indicate to the honourable senator that, of course, we will not be commenting on matters that may or may not occur in cabinet. I do note that, when Senator Sterle sat on this side of the chamber, the cabinet basically could have been put into a little motor vehicle with two in the front and two in the back. It was a cabinet of four, and all the other cabinet ministers used to comment and leak about that fact, saying that they had been cut out of the equation and were not part of the decision making.

           I rise on a point of order on relevance. The question was very succinct. I ask you to draw the minister's attention to the question, rather than him attacking individuals who are asking questions, when the people he really wants to attack are sitting behind him.

             The responsibility of a cabinet is to provide good government to this country, and that is what we are seeking to do by getting on with the business of creating jobs. We have created 336,000 jobs, four times the rate of job creation in the last year of the Labor government. We are growing our economy and jobs in Australia at a faster rate than the United States, the United Kingdom, the G7 and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
              New Zealand
             </a>
             . Having said that, we do need to do more. We will not rest on our laurels, but, rather than dealing in the gossip columns of newspapers, as Senator Sterle and his colleague do, we actually get on with the business of government, creating a future for northern Australia, creating a dynamic future for the agricultural sector, ensuring that our renewable energy target and our commitments internationally are world leading yet economically responsible. They are the matters that we devote ourselves to, unlike those on the other side.

               Senator Sterle has fallen into the trap, and, regrettably, taken the lead from Senator Cameron and others, to misquote. All I said—and I have the transcript right in front of me—was:

              <p>
               Anybody that has unattributed comments to them in the media—and indeed we recall them by the bucket loads under Mr Rudd's Prime Ministership, we remember them against Ms Gillard from people who are

               as I speak because they are reminded of the way they background briefed against Ms Gillard and undoubtedly are reminded of their dastardly attacks from their own Prime Minister.

                  They are, once again, trawling through the gossip columns of the newspapers and referring to unattributed comments. That is what excites Senator Sterle and that is what excites Senator Wong. That is what excites the Labor Party. Do you know what excites us? What excites us are the 336,000 new jobs since we got into government; a plan for the expansion of our agriculture sector; a plan for northern Australia; and a plan to ensure that we can stand within the world community, providing a 50 per cent per capita reduction in our

                  emissions without destroying jobs and our economy. They are the things that motivate us. That is what excites me and, I must say, makes me very thankful that I am privileged to be part of a coalition government dedicated to the service of the people of Australia, rather than dealing in innuendo and gossip columns, which are of no benefit to the people of Australia.
