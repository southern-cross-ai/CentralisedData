        I rise to ask a question of the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. On what date did Mr Morrison first become aware of Mr Christensen's posts which incited threats of violence against Premier Andrews and

         A few things in relation to this question: I'm not aware of precise dates in relation to those posts. As I said earlier this week, I certainly was only aware of them when Senator Keneally asked. The next point I'd make is that I think it is important that we are clear in relation to these matters. I've not seen the comments that Senator Keneally has been asking about during the week, but these are comments that have been made on Mr Christensen's posts, not the posts themselves, in relation to acts of violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         While I'm on my feet, I also wish to correct the record in relation to the answer I gave Senator Keneally earlier today. I understand, as I indicated at the time, that the Prime Minister has publicly urged all Australians to show responsibility in relation to social media platforms and the like in relation to conversations with the member for Dawson about responsibility on social media platforms and the like. Those conversations have been had by the Leader of the National Party, the Deputy Prime Minister.

           I would hope that the minister might take the last question on notice, seeing as he was unable to provide an answer to a very specific question. My next question is about another date. On what date did Mr Morrison discuss these posts with Mr Christensen, and was that via telephone or face to face?

                 As members of parliament we are all responsible for our own actions and for those actions in terms of the way in which we engage. In relation to the member for Dawson, it is well known that the member for Dawson is a vocal participant in public debate. I again draw the distinction between the comments that Senator Keneally alleges have been posted—of course, I'm sure on nearly all of our different social media platforms we have had cause at times to delete comments that've been made that are completely inappropriate and that deserve condemnation. I would urge all of us, including the member for Dawson, to be so vigilant in doing so.
