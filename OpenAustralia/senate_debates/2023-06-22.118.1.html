        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing, and the Minister for Homelessness, Senator Farrell. I keep hearing from constituents and stakeholders about the urgent need for more affordable housing in Australia to meet the unmet need from Australians struggling to put a roof over their head. The Labor government has a clear and ambitious housing reform agenda to deliver houses for Australians who need them. I am particularly interested in a specific component of that, the Housing Australia Future Fund, which I understand will improve housing outcomes and affordability. Could you please outline what this fund will do and what, if anything, is preventing this from becoming a reality today?

         I thank Senator Bilyk for her ongoing interest in the issue of housing and homelessness, particularly in her home state of Tasmania. I can answer her question because the Albanese government wants every Australian to have the security of a roof over their head. Fundamental to our plan is increasing the supply of new housing, which is exactly what the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will do. The fund would deliver 30,000 social and affordable rental homes in its first five years, including a minimum of 1,200 in your home state of Tasmania, Senator Bilyk.

           Yes, Senator Duniam. It will deliver housing for people escaping family violence, for veterans and for First Nations Australians. Sadly this week the Liberals and the Nationals and the newest member of their coalition, the Greens political party, teamed up to reject the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill. The actions of the Greens stopped the Housing Australia Future Fund from starting to enter into commitments for new homes from 1 July this year. They did this because the Greens love to campaign about more housing, but, when it comes to it, the Greens do everything they can to block more affordable housing for vulnerable Australian. Just two days after the Greens rejected the fund in the Senate, Yarra city Greens councillors voted against social housing in their area. While explaining their opposition to the new social housing on council owned land, one Greens councillor said the land was better used for 'other things than social housing'. Another Greens councillor complained that social housing wasn't inclusive. Sadly, the Greens talk the talk on affordable housing, but, when it comes to actually supporting specific projects, they vote it down. We will not be deterred by the Greens political games.

             I, like all on this side, was hugely disappointed that the Housing Australia Future Fund will be delayed. I know these delays will have impacts on the delivery of this important component of the government's housing reform agenda and will have an effect on Australians who are in urgent need of safe and affordable homes. Can the minister explain to the Senate what the impact of these delays will be?

              (—) (): I thank Senator Bilyk for her first supplementary question. We have seen the Greens claiming that there is no cost to the rejection of the Housing Australia Future Fund. The reality is that that is not true. The cost of the Greens's delay has been made very clear by many. Those opposite, the strange new coalition of the Greens, Liberals and Nationals, should be ashamed of themselves. The actions of the Greens mean less access to affordable housing for those who most need it in this country.

              </a>
              know that every day the fund is delayed past 1 July, another $1.3 million won't be going into social and affordable housing in Australia. The Greens want to play their political games, but we want to get on with doing what the Australian people elected us to do, delivering housing. The Greens are about protest, and we are about homes for people. Because of this—

                Thank you for that answer, Minister. But it wasn't just those on this side that were frustrated at the delays. I'm aware that stakeholders have been calling for the parliament to pass the government's housing agenda and that stakeholders have expressed frustration at the delays which are being faced by people in need of housing. Can the minister provide an update to the Senate on how the opposition to the Albanese government's housing agenda has been received by these stakeholders?
