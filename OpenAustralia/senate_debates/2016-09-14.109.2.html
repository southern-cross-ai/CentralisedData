           The coalition government strongly supports Australia's dairy farmers and dairy industry. We are delivering a $579 million dairy assistance package to help dairy farmers experiencing hardship as a result of low global dairy commodity prices and the decisions of major dairy processors Murray Goulburn and Fonterra to cut farm gate milk prices in the 2016-17 year. There was no assistance under Labor in 2009, when farm gate milk prices were lower. The

            ACCC
           </a>
           is currently investigating the farm gate milk-pricing decisions of Murray Goulburn and Fonterra. ASIC is also investigating Murray Goulburn. The government has requested that the ACCC undertake a market inquiry into the Australian dairy industry. It will commence by November 2016. The ACCC will have powers to compel evidence.

              As this motion notes, the Australian dairy industry is facing an unprecedented crisis, with the retail cost of bottled milk per litre often being less than the retail cost of bottled water. Australia's largest dairy producer and milk price setter, Murray Goulburn, has been allowed to force onto its suppliers unprecedented milk contracts and/or agreements, ensuring that dairy farmers are burdened with retrospective debts ranging from tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Australian rural and regional communities face losing millions of dollars and thousands of jobs if a fair long-term solution to Australia's dairy prices is not found. I urge all senators, particular those from the National Party, to stand up for the rural and regional communities that are doing it tough and vote for this motion to establish a Senate investigation in order to establish a fair long-term solution to Australia's dairy crisis.
