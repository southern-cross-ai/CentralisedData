        I rise to ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Resources, Minister Farrell. Just last week, Energy Resources Australia announced their intention to apply for an extension of their lease at Jabiluka mine, which sits within
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakadu_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Kakadu National Park
        </a>
        . It is estimated that the uranium deposit is one of the largest in the world. This comes off the back of concerns of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERA" rel="nofollow">
         ERA
        </a>
        being able to fund rehabilitation in the nearby Ranger mine. It also occurs in the context of Australia not being a party to the Treaty on the Prohibition of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Weapons" rel="nofollow">
         Nuclear Weapons
        </a>
        . My question to the Minister is: has the government had an application for the extension of uranium mining at Jabiluka?

         I thank Senator Cox for her question and her courtesy in giving us some advance notice about the nature of the question. An application for the renewal of the Jabiluka mineral lease is not currently before the government, so if
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ERA" rel="nofollow">
          ERA
         </a>
         have made that statement, they have not formally made an application for an extension of that licence. However, we will consider information about Jabiluka at the appropriate time. As you say, it is in the heart of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakadu_National_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Kakadu National Park

         . That discussion will take place in good faith with all of the parties involved.
        </p>
        <p>
         If ERA do finally apply for the renewal of the lease, it's the

         have expressed commitments to the longstanding Jabiluka long-term care and maintenance agreement that provides that Jabiluka will not be developed without the consent of Mirrar traditional owners. It's understandable that the traditional owners and those working on country apply appropriate scrutiny to any decision or any application that might be made. The Albanese government is committed to sustainable mining to protect our pristine environment, and that's why we're establishing the national—

                I apologise to Senator Cox and the President, because I was just distracted, but I would raise again that it doesn't sound to me like this is a supplementary question from the original question. In fact, the treaty—TPNW—is probably better addressed to my portfolio, not the resources portfolio, and a number of others have raised it. Certainly I don't recall the treaty being discussed in the primary question. Obviously, the minister can answer what he's able to in his portfolio, but I again request that we look at whether or not supplementary questions are in fact supplementary.
