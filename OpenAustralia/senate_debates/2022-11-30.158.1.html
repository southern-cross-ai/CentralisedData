        2003 to support students through fairer grandfathering provisions and support our rural, remote and very remote communities by encouraging our medical graduates to provide services in those areas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When the former Government's Job-ready Graduates scheme was introduced in late 2020 it grandfathered students who were already studying at 1 January 2021 so they could finish their course at the same student contribution rates as when they started.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In a lapsed bill the former Government introduced a correction to those grandfathering provisions to include honours course students who had started but not finished their original course at 1 January 2021. That correction is included in this bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the first weeks of this Government, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Morning Herald
        </a>
        published a story that revealed that a number of other students were also left out of grandfathering because their courses were changed or cancelled by their Universities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's not fair that students face higher student contribution rates because of decisions taken by their University and which are out of their control.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill fixes that.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        will be reviewing the Job-ready Graduates program as part of the Universities Accord which will commence soon, but it's important that these measures are introduced now so that these students are treated fairly.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill also introduces measures from a lapsed bill to encourage doctors and nurse practitioners to live and work in rural, remote and very remote areas of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It puts in place a scheme for eligible doctors and nurse practitioners to have their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
         HELP
        </a>
        debts reduced or wiped if they live and work in those areas for a period based on the length of their degree.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Doctors and nurse practitioners who live and work in a remote or very remote community for the equivalent of half the length of their degree will be able to have 100 per cent of their HELP debt wiped.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Doctors and nurse practitioners who live and work in a large, medium or small rural town will have 100% of their HELP debt wiped if they live and work there for the equivalent of the length of their degree.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This means an eligible doctor with a HELP debt from a six year medical degree and who lives and provides services in a remote community like Broome or Bourke for three years will be able to have their HELP debt for that course wiped.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An eligible nurse practitioner who lives and works in a rural town like Parkes for two years will be able to have the HELP debt for their nurse practitioner course wiped.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Doctors and nurse practitioners who meet half of the time requirements will be able to access half of the HELP debt removal.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And doctors and nurse practitioners working in these areas will be able to apply for a waiver of indexation on their HELP debt whilst they live and work there.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The classification of rural and remote locations is based on the Modified Monash Model and the bill makes provision for Guidelines to define eligibility and service requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is expected to help around 850 medical practitioners a year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure will be effective from 1 January this year, and the Education and Health portfolios will work together to implement this scheme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The measures in this Bill further support the Government's commitment to fairness in our education sector and to support services in our rural and remote communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I commend to them to the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.
