        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I refer to the minister's pre-election comments in June 2013 about military pensions. I quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
         CPI
        </a>
        has not been a measure of cost- of-living for at least 15 years. Aged pensioners don’t have their index assessed in this way so they are falling further and further behind. It’s basically unfair where they’re at and they deserve a fair go and we’re going to give it to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, why then did an official from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        confirm at Senate estimates—with you sitting next to them—that the government's first budget slashed $65.1 million from the pensions of 280,000 veterans, war widows and orphans of veterans by using CPI-only indexation? How is this $65 million saving to the government not a loss to the weekly income of veterans and their dependants?

         I thank Senator Conroy for his question, which does give me the opportunity to talk about indexation as requested. Senator Conroy will be aware—and I presume this is the basis for his question—of the cross-portfolio decision made in relation to indexation measures which will take place in September of 2017.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Conroy will also be aware that, in the run-up to the last election, I went to many veterans' forums around the nation and said, in relation to the DFRDB/DFRB superannuation scheme, that I believe there should be expanded indexation measures. As Senator Conroy will also be equally aware, in this chamber I introduced a bill to achieve that. Senator Conroy needs to be reminded—

              Consumer Price Index

             Why then has the Prime Minister broken this promise and implemented

Senator Conroy, in three separate votes in relation to the DFRDB indexation, voted to keep

                  The absolute irony and hypocrisy! The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, who led the charge in this chamber as finance minister, called our decision to make these changes 'unaffordable' and 'a sham'.

                   only, axe the backdating of veterans' disability pensions for new recipients and scrap the seniors' supplement for some veterans, won't all of these combined measures have a disastrous impact on the cost of living for Australia's veterans?

                    I will go through a variety of measures. Senator Conroy asked me about indexation. Look at page 238 of the former government's 2009-10 budget measures.
