        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Conroy. What has been the total spending by the government on consultancies since coming to office two years ago? What has been the total spent on government advertising since coming to office? And can the minister confirm that Labor government waste and mismanagement has cost taxpayers around $3 billion so far?

          Thank you for that question, Senator Barnett. Agencies have identified initiatives totalling more than $100 million in 2009-10 and more than $290 million in 2010-11 ongoing—and this is one aspect of your answer—to reduce their information and communication technology spending. Half of these savings will be reinvested in projects, just to give you an indication. The government is confident that the Australian public service’s lead role in policy development is absolutely central. The government is committed to the development of evidence based policy making, with policy design and evaluation driven by analysis of all available options. Governments of different persuasions over a long period of time have used consultants, and that should not be seen as a vote of no-confidence in the public service. There are many circumstances in which it will be more effective to engage consultants—for example, for the provision of legal services. As the Minister for Finance and Deregulation stated—

           , I rise on a point of order on the question of relevance. The minister now has only 44 seconds to complete his answer and he has not touched in any way or in any respect upon the question—which about was the total spending by government on consultancies and advertising. Could you please draw that to the minister’s attention.

            , I rise on the point of order. What the minister has been responding to is the issue of consultancies. The minister has been directly relevant to the question and, given that there is still time to run, I am sure the minister can deal with all of the question that has been asked of the minister. I would submit that there is no point of order. It seems to be simply another way of restating the question.

                I did not realise that Mr Turnbull had received a cheque, but thanks for letting me know. Let us be clear: the government’s stimulus package delivered—it delivered to this country a cushion for the global financial crisis. Those opposite continue to dig their own grave—and one for Mr Turnbull because of his failed economic position. It should be very clear to them by now that they have got this dead wrong. The Australian public, the business community and the international community all recognise that Australia’s response to the global financial crisis was the model that other countries should have followed if they wanted to avoid going into recession, because that is exactly what we did. The education spending package, the infrastructure package and the cash payments to individuals to allow retail spending to survive through that period have all been acknowledged internationally.

Given other examples of waste and mismanagement, including the GROCERYchoice website debacle, record spending on legal fees and consultancies, the pink batts fiasco and the ‘Ms Gillard memorial school halls’ blow-out, does the minister now accept that Labor’s reckless spending after two years of government is out of control?

                  Similar questions have been asked of my colleague Senator Arbib on this matter. He has challenged those opposite—and I repeat that challenge to you, Senator Barnett—to name one of those schools that you would take that funding off. Name just one. Do not come in here and vote against it and then, after you and your colleagues have been wandering around the country turning up for the photo opportunities, come back in here and bag the program. You can tell all those tradies who have spent the last six or 12 months building these school halls that they did not deserve a job because we made the wrong economic call.
