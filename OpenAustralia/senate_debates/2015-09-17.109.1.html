        My question is to the Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. I refer the minister to revelations that Fair Work Commission Vice-President Michael Lawler took nine months of fully paid sick leave from his $435,000-a-year job at Fair Work in just one year. This is despite Mr Lawler admitting to the trade union royal commission staff that he had been constantly working on legal issues for his partner, the disgraced union official,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Jackson" rel="nofollow">
         Kathy Jackson
        </a>
        , during this period. Given Mr Lawler's own admission that he had been conducting complex legal work while claiming to be too sick to work, will the government investigate this apparent rorting of taxpayers' money?

         As the honourable senator should well know, the terms and conditions of Vice-President Lawler's appointment were determined by Labor's Fair Work Act. There are matters that need to be looked at exceptionally carefully. As I said to the honourable senator earlier this week—

            in response to a similar question, these matters need to be dealt with in a methodical manner, in a purposeful manner and in a manner that ensures natural justice.

            In relation to people taking sick leave from the Fair Work Commission, it should not surprise the honourable senator that that is not something that comes across my desk, but goes across the desk of the person in charge of the Fair Work Commission. If Senator Conroy is asserting that false medical certificates have been provided, let him assert that, especially outside of this place, and see what occurs. But, from my perspective, it is vitally important that we take these matters in a step-by-step manner to ensure that natural justice does occur.

            The bellicose shouting of the honourable senator clearly indicates that he has no interest in a proper course of action being undertaken but rather wants a vindictive outcome because Mr Lawler's partner,

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. Mr Lawler has performed complex legal work while taking a nine-month sickie, has acted as a legal advocate for his corrupt partner in the Federal Court, has been embroiled in a scandalous attempt to control an old man's finances, has had multiple complaints lodged regarding his professional conduct and has taken ownership of a house financed with stolen money. Does this government continue to support and protect Mr Lawler, or will it now act to end this chaotic saga?

                        I would trust that if there is one thing people might be agreed upon in this place it is that I would in no way, shape or form seek to protect any form of corruption. Other than Senators Conroy and Carr, who are motivated by things other than due process and the rule of law, these things need to be dealt with in a manner that is appropriate. I simply remind the honourable senator that it took over six years to bring Mr
