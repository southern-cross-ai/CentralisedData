        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Senator Scullion. I take this opportunity to say how delighted I am that Senator Scullion has been elevated to the front bench. I wish him a long and illustrious career in that position. Is the minister aware of the recent release of a report by the Queensland government highlighting Indigenous disadvantage in my home state of Queensland? What steps is the Australian government taking to assist Indigenous people to overcome this situation?

         I thank the senator for his question. I know that Senator Trood, along with his Senate colleagues from Queensland, is very committed to Indigenous affairs. They are committed, along with this government, to improving the living standards and opportunities for Indigenous people. I am aware of the report:
         <i>

          Policy in Queensland 2005-2010
         </i>
         . It was released earlier this week. This report paints a grim picture of despair and neglect. It is in stark contrast to the Queensland government’s own priorities. In the forward of the report the Queensland government’s own priorities read:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Improving social, health and economic outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples is a priority for the

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Unfortunately this record tells a completely different story. At the Intergovernmental Summit on Violence and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Abuse" rel="nofollow">
          Child Abuse
         </a>
         in Indigenous Communities last year, it amazed me that the Queensland government said: ‘Everything is cool bananas; everything is going to be all right. There are no problems with the communities of course.’ But when you look at the report it shows some horrifying data on child abuse. Indigenous children aged under four years old, our most vulnerable and our youngest Australians, comprised 40 per cent of hospital admissions for assault. These are not just those who have turned up after being assaulted, these are actually admitted—40 per cent are under four years old. Young children on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOGIT" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         communities, which is an acronym for deed of grant in trust, were between 23 and 24 times more likely to be hospitalised for assault.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand the report has been a long time coming. I can understand why the Queensland government has been sitting on it. They know that this is yet another example of how they have failed the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens of Queensland. The Beattie government, only a matter of months ago, in the way they responded, obviously knew about these issues. They have abolished Indigenous affairs from their portfolio: ‘We will get rid of that.’ It is a bit embarrassing, I imagine. They have somehow doctored it, there is no extra resource and it has slipped into some other portfolio. I have to say there is no better example of absolutely empty rhetoric on one of the most important issues facing Australia. They have made a complete mess of very important relationships between the Indigenous citizens in Queensland and the police force. Premier Beattie has lurched from one clumsy response to another, we have had cover-ups, and he has made walking backwards an art form.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, in all this, there are some positives. I have to say I am very pleased to see that Queensland has taken the opportunity to place more police officers in communities. It is fundamental because without the rule of law and the provision of housing, infrastructure and health care in the communities we are not going to get the effectiveness that we require. I am very pleased to see that has taken place. We are all doing our bit.

          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         is spending $3.3 billion this financial year on Indigenous specific programs, which is 40 per cent more in real terms than Labor spent in their last year in office. We depend on the states and territories to provide the basic rights. We have to get the kids to school, protect the citizens and provide essential services. It is time the Queensland government lived up to its obligations to all its citizens.
