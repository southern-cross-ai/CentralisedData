        , we've seen the loss of a very brave police officer,

        . On 8 June, Constable Woods and his partner were alerted to a vehicle displaying stolen numberplates. They followed and made a vehicle stop. The stolen car reversed at speed, trapping Constable Woods under the car and effectively murdering him. His police partner and responding officers made very valiant attempts to keep him alive until help came; however, he succumbed to his injuries on Sunday 11 June. The tragic loss of this officer in the prime of his life is indeed a sobering reflection of the risks that our police officers face in the course of their duties every day. As we know, everyone deserves to go to work and come home safe. I know that he is remembered by his family as a funny, hardworking man who loved the

        and mucking around with his mates, bringing light and laughter to every situation, and who had a wicked sense of humour.

        I want to thank Police Legacy for the work they do supporting the colleagues and families of brave officers like Anthony Woods. I met one such officer on 9 June, travelling back down from Broome to be with his work colleaguesâ€”as it turned out, just a couple of days before Anthony passed. On behalf of WA federal MPs and senators and everyone here, I'd like to express our sorrow and support for this devoted husband and loving son, brother, uncle and colleague, who was taken too soon.
