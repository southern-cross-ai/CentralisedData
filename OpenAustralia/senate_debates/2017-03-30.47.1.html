        My question is to the Minister for Defence and relates to tropical Cyclone Debbie, which ravaged parts of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        coast, including the Whitsundays and Mackay, earlier this week. In asking my question to the minister, I wonder if the Senate would allow me the indulgence of expressing the Senate's and the parliament's solidarity with those who have lost property and homes in the cyclone, and also acknowledging the volunteers and civilians who have done so much to help before, during and after the cyclone hit the coast. My question to the minister relates to the work that I know the ADF is doing. As I drove up to Townsville to come to Canberra yesterday, I passed convoys of Army trucks moving south towards the cyclone area. I ask the minister if she could indicate to the Senate how the

         I thank Senator Macdonald for the question and acknowledge both his personal and, clearly, professional interest and commitment to this issue at the moment. Of course, our thoughts continue to be with the people of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

         as they begin a massive clean-up and reconstruction process.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister and the opposition leader visited some of the worst affected areas this morning. More than 1,200 ADF personnel are assisting with the recovery efforts in North Queensland. The ADF is working very closely with the Queensland government and a range of state and federal agencies as part of a comprehensive, whole-of-government response.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have ongoing heavy rain and damaging wind gusts, which are affecting both the efforts to assess the damage from the cyclone and to begin the recovery process of affected communities between Ayr and Mackay. However, yesterday, two king aircraft completed wide area surveillance of potentially affected areas. As we have seen from the images online and further afield over the past two days, the damage to property in some areas is severe. Rotary-wing aircraft reconnaissance produced over 150 images for the Queensland Reconstruction Authority, while our

         , which is one of the Navy's hydrographic survey vessels, has completed port survey and rapid environment assessment of Abbott Point.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also important, I think, to acknowledge that the recovery work is in its early stages and the ADF is preparing itself for further requests for assistance. Those requests will of course be made in conjunction with the Queensland authorities and the other relevant federal authorities such as

          Emergency Management Australia

            I think we will all tolerate that partisan observation today in the circumstances, Senator Macdonald. But Senator Macdonald is correct; as we have seen, the Whitsundays is one of the hardest hit areas. Yesterday,

            90 helicopter embarked as well as medical personnel, and both the helicopter and the ship's landing craft will be used to take supplies directly onto the islands as she left from Brisbane yesterday afternoon. An Army amphibious landing craft is also transporting an amphibious beach team to the

            to conduct survey operations and inspect damage. HMAS

            as well with emergency support of fresh water and suppliers, and will carry out evacuations if they are required. These are examples of the unique capabilities that Defence is able to deploy to supplement state emergency services in harder to access areas so that we can provide immediate support to those affected and assist with long-term reconstruction.

               There is a broad range of activities in which the ADF can and will, I suspect, be engaged. ADF members from Navy, Army and
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Air Force
               </a>
               are helping with the evacuations; with aeromedical transport; with search and rescue; with assistance to restore critical infrastructure; with the road and route clearance—as the weather allows; with emergency food, water, fuel and shelter delivery and distribution; as well as with those reconnaissance surveillance and damage assessments I have mentioned.
              </p>
              <p>
               As the Prime Minister noted this morning, for example during his visit to Bowen, the ADF will also support the people of Bowen by transporting electricians by air from Townsville to help restore power in that area. As the picture on the ground becomes clearer, the ADF will begin to move out into the affected communities. It is a great effort from the ADF and the men and women who are working in the 1,200-strong joint task force. It illustrates the importance, I think of the pre-deployment of assets and personnel to ensure that assistance could flow immediately. The ADF is well experienced in such operations.
