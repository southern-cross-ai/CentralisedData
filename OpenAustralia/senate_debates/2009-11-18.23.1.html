        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans. How many refugees currently in Indonesia will be offered resettlement in 2009-10?

         It is a good question, because it goes to the heart of the reasons why we have reinvigorated the Bali process. We have a regional issue with unlawful movement among nations. Nations like Indonesia are saying that, as part of their commitment to action in the region, there ought to be a sharing of the burden of those persons moving through the region who are found to be refugees. That is why the previous government, the Howard government, sought to resettle people out of Indonesia, although in fairly small numbers. Of the 1,300 resettled in the last seven or eight years, 450 were resettled in Australia and the others in other resettlement countries.
        </p>
        <p>
         Last year, I began negotiations with the Indonesians about how we should deal with the protracted caseloads that they had inside Indonesia. They have people there who have been assessed as refugees and who have not been referred for resettlement. As part of the Bali process, we have been discussing with the other governments involved how we should tackle these problems of people who are found to be refugees, people moving unlawfully and people-trafficking. There has been an increased commitment to resettle people out of Indonesia. We have made it clear that we and other resettlement countries will look to take more than we have in the past to assist them and share the burden of dealing with these problems around the region. They have committed to anti-people-smuggling measures. They have committed to the Bali process.

          , I rise on a point of order on relevance. As you would know, Mr President, my question was specifically regarding how many refugees will be offered resettlement in 2009-10. Since we have some 13 seconds left, I wonder whether it would be possible to bring the minister to order.

             , on the point of order: the minister has been—and if the opposition had been listening carefully then they would realise this—answering the question, precisely the exact question. The minister had gone through how the Bali process had been reinvigorated, how there had been a national commitment to sharing the burden and, in addition to that, the precise issues surrounding how you then work through this matter. The minister has been dealing with that in a directly relevant way. It is a shame that you then seek to use the opportunity to raise it as a political message. What the minister has been doing is providing an exact answer to your question.

               As I was saying, there is a commitment by Australia and other nations to share the burden and to assist the Indonesians with resettlement out of Indonesia. It is a process that the former government was committed to, but we have looked to engage more actively—

                            It is true that we cooperated with Indonesia and encouraged them to intercept the vessel that is now docked at Merak. And, as I understand it, the 250 or so people who are on board are still refusing to disembark. But that is a matter that is in the hands of the Indonesian authorities. There are no Australian authorities involved in that process. I understand that the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOM" rel="nofollow">

                            has been involved, but that involvement may have ceased. There has been, as I understand it, some trouble on the boat, and some disagreement. I think that actually reached some level of violence the other day, but they have been there for a long time. The Indonesian government’s position, as I understand it, is that they will be processed once they disembark the vessel. That is obviously in their hands. I do not have any particular assurances as to how those people will be treated, because we have not been engaged actively in the handling of those persons on that boat in Merak.

                            What I can say to you, though, is that the press reports about them threatening to deport these people without proper refugee assessment beforehand are just that—claims in the press. I would point out to you that, to my knowledge, the Indonesians have not in the past sought to deport people before they have had asylum claims considered. All I can tell you is that the experience we have had with the Indonesians is that they have made safe places available for people inside Indonesia, they have allowed
