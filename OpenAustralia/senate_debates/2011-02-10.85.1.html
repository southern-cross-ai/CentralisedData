       <p class="italic">
        In Question Time yesterday I offered to provide further detail to Senator Abetz to answer a specific question he raised relating to the number of people who had received

        Disaster Recovery Payment from the Government.

        In his question, he asked :
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , I ask a supplementary question. How much money has the government already given to people described by the Treasurer as Sow-fifes’ who claimed $1,000 from Centrelink when all they suffered was a power outage? Are businesses that are economically impacted by the floods more or less deserving?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I can now furnish further information:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As at 8 February, 462,000 Australians had received the AGDRP (costing $545 million).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The AGDRP is being paid under the same guidelines that applied in the March 2009 floods, which are also the criteria that were supported by both the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Nationals

       <p class="italic">
        In Question Time yesterday I offered to provide further detail to Senator Joyce to answer a specific question he raised relating the powers under section 189 of the Water Act 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In his question, he asked : Mr President,...) am quite specific. Is the minister considering using powers under section 189 of the Water Act? He either is or is not.

       <p class="italic">
        I can now furnish further information:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities was careful in the appointment of the Chair. Mr Knowles was appointed having consulted with the State and Territory governments in the Basin and after feedback from stakeholders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Knowles has been appointed to the position of Chair of the Murray Darling Basin Authority. Mr Knowles has 10 years experience as a State government Minister, including direct experience in the water portfolio and on other natural resource issues. Mr Knowles has a strong track record on water reform including his work on the implementation of the National Water Initiative (

        Further information for Senator Bob Brown
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In Question Time yesterday I offered to provide further detail to Senator Brown to answer a specific question he raised relating Mr Habib and Mr Sulieman.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In his question, he asked : Mr President, I ask a further supplementary question. It is known by the government that Mr Habib was detained in Egypt. Has any member of the government or its intelligence services met Mr Suleiman? Were they involved in the detention and torture of Mr Habib in Egypt?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I can now furnish further information:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Habib’s allegations are not new. In 2005 the Australian Government asked Egypt to investigate Mr Habib’s claims of mistreatment.

        has advised that during 2001-2002 Department officials made several attempts at senior levels to confirm Mr Habib’s detention in Egypt and to obtain consular access.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Egypt never confirmed that Mr Habib was in custody and consular access was never granted. No Australian official ever saw Mr Habib in Egypt.

        Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officials have met Mr Suleiman, in particular in his capacity as a lead negotiator on
