         The Inland Rail project is one of the most iconic nation-building projects that Australia has ever seen and is being delivered by the National Party in a Liberal-National government.

         , as it makes its way north and south between Brisbane and Melbourne. It's a once-in-a-lifetime investment in regional Australia. As the current Deputy Prime Minister calls it, it will absolutely be 'a corridor of commerce'. I know some of the senators who take an interest in regional Australia's growth and development will have seen a fantastic—

           The point of order is on relevance. I know the minister is speaking to something important, but it is a very tightly worded question. It just seeks to know: when did the Deputy Prime Minister make the final decision and when did he advise Mr Littleproud and Senator MacDonald? There's no embroidery. It's just a simple factual question.

            I think the question goes to the decision-making, the alignment and the passing on of that to others. There are multiple elements of the question, but it goes to that. I have been listening, but I'm going to ask you to turn to those elements of the question, Senator

             In terms of the route decision, there has been no change to where that has been planned through a whole variety of infrastructure ministers over many, many years. There have been many studies and plans done, particularly on the border to Gowrie route. Cabinet agreed to a route and we as a government are sticking to that. We don't need more reviews into this. The local community has been consulted. The local MPs have been consulted, and my understanding is that—

                I think, with respect, the question did ask that. It asked about the alignment, and it asked about whether others were advised. I do believe the minister was being directly relevant when she was speaking about the route. I can't instruct them how to answer a question. The minister referred to decision-making upon a route by the cabinet. I can't rule that as not being directly relevant to the question being asked. Senator

                 I'm very happy to table the alignment of the Inland Rail route, which has been agreed for a long period of time. Cabinet has re-examined that and absolutely backs the decision of the infrastructure ministers on the current route as it stands, and that will not be changing.

                    Senator Watt, I've been very clear, as has the Deputy Prime Minister and as has the Deputy Leader of the Nationals. All National Party cabinet ministers support the decision of cabinet. They support the current route of the Inland Rail, and they've been very, very clear about that. What is clear also is that Labor has opposed the Inland Rail from the start.

                         pass, as you said you would in your point of order. The minister was answering the question by talking about the decision-making on the route and who supported it—it being a decision of the government. I can't instruct the minister how to answer a question. There's time to debate them in 10 minutes. Senator McKenzie.
