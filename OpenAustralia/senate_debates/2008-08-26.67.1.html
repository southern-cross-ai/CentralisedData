         <dd>
          Four years ago, more than 100 fishermen in Queensland were deemed criminals by the Federal Government for innocently dropping a fishing line in water which is part of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park" rel="nofollow">
           Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
          </a>
          . These fishermen had a criminal conviction recorded against them and were fined $2500 each.
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (b)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          These fishermen are your ‘average Joes’. They’re recreational fishermen; granddads taking their kids fishing or group of mates in a ‘tinnie’. What they have done, usually through ignorance or a lack of navigation skills, is simply drop a line in the wrong place, which does not warrant a criminal conviction.
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (c)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          Two years ago the Federal Government admitted it was wrong to give criminal convictions and downgraded the offence to an infringement, with an $1100 fine and no criminal conviction. However, the more than 100 fishermen originally convicted still have a criminal conviction recorded against their name.

          Having a criminal record can seriously damage a person’s life. You’re deemed in the eyes of the law to be a criminal which can make it impossible to get a job, insurance or a home loan. You can’t travel to certain countries and can’t get a licence for occupations like being a real estate agent or publican. Every government form requires you to declare if you have a criminal conviction.

         Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Without wishing to detract from the importance of the issue that
