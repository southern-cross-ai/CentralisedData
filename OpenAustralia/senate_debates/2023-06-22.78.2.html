        As the recent budget and this government's own commentary around inflation have demonstrated, when it comes to running the economy, Labor just doesn't get it. It's like an episode from the

        are trying to put a brake on the economy by raising interest rates, yet this government keeps pouring fuel on the inflation fire by increasing government spending and overseeing wage expansion without the dividend of growing productivity. We had the madness of the Prime Minister saying that higher wages in the care sector were essential to growing productivity.

        We all want higher wages, but they cannot come without lifting labour productivity. For the government to try to spend its way out of a high inflationary environment will only force the hand of the RBA to keep interest rates up, adding yet more cost-of-living pain and suffering for Australian families.
