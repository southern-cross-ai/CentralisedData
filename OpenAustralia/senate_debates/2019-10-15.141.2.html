           The Morrison government is committed to ongoing improvements to the family law system because this is a serious issue. Many Australians go through the system during an extremely traumatic time in their lives, and that's why the government intends to legislate to fix the broken split family law court system. The inquiry will provide an important opportunity for parliamentarians to hear from Australians. The inquiry will build on the action the government has already taken, including measures taken following the 2017

           Committee inquiry chaired by now-Senator Henderson. It includes passing legislation to ban the cross-examination, in the family law system, of family violence victims by alleged perpetrators. The government also continues to consider the review by the ALRC and intends to provide a response to the recommendations of that report has soon as possible. Since 2013, the government has invested over $840 million to address family and domestic violence.
