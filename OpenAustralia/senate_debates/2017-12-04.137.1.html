       <p class="italic">
        (ii) while significant advancements in treatment and diagnosis have been made over the past 30 years, HIV/AIDS remains a major health concern worldwide and in our region,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the most recent data shows that:
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        (B) in 2016, in the Asia-Pacific, 5.1 million people were living with HIV, the largest population outside Africa, and 270 000 people became newly infected, representing 15 per cent of all new infections, and

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) HIV infection rates are highest among certain populations, including sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgender people, prisoners, and men who have sex with men – the discrimination and stigma faced by these populations often prohibit them from accessing HIV prevention and treatment services,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) Australia is one of the few countries that advocates for HIV treatment and prevention and rights for these populations,

       <p class="italic">
        (vi) Australia also plays an important role in the fight against HIV in the Asia-Pacific and is committed to the 90-90-90 treatment targets and the Sustainable Development Goal (

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) Australia has a long bipartisan history of supporting the fight against HIV in our Indo-Pacific region – over the past decade successive Australian Governments have provided over one billion dollars to support HIV-specific programs through the aid program,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) access to quality health care services for HIV treatment is a challenge in PNG, where budget, population growth, urbanisation, and remoteness constrain service delivery,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) Australia is committed to strengthening PNG’s HIV prevention and treatment activities and has invested in HIV interventions working to reduce sexually transmitted infections and HIV, and increase access to HIV prevention and treatment,

        (vii) Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, healthy lives and wellbeing for all, includes target 3.3, to end the HIV epidemic by 2030 – to achieve this target we need to continue our strong support for action against HIV in our region.
