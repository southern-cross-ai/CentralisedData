        Transport services are available to frail older people and younger people with disabilities, and their carers, through the current Home and Community Care (HACC) program. Assistance is provided with transportation either directly (for example, in a vehicle provided or driven by an agency worker or volunteer) or indirectly (taxi vouchers).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 2 August 2011, the Commonwealth Government, in partnership with states and territories, signed the National Health Reform Agreement (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHRA" rel="nofollow">
         NHRA
        </a>
        ). The NHRA cements the commitments made by all governments at the 13 February Council of Commonwealth Governments' meeting, to work together to reform the health system to ensure its future sustainability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the NHRA the Commonwealth assumed full funding and policy responsibility for basic community care maintenance and support services for older people from 1 July 2011 and will assume operational responsibility from 1 July 2012 in all states and territories except Victoria and

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These changes are part of broader aged care reforms which will include consideration of future arrangements for community transport under HACC to ensure the creation of a nationally consistent, integrated and coordinated aged care system. Proposals in the Productivity Commission's report, Caring for Older Australians, which was released on 8 August 2011, may also inform future reforms to HACC services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 18 March 2011, the Commonwealth Government launched the National Disability Strategy which outlines a 10-year national policy framework to improve the lives of people with disability, promote participation, and create a more inclusive society. The Strategy will guide public policy across governments and aims to bring about change in all mainstream services and programs as well as community infrastructure. A key policy direction under the Strategy involves the creation of 'a public, private and community transport system that is accessible for the whole community'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 3
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Commonwealth Government in consultation with the states/territories and other stakeholders should establish a national transport research body suitable to be a national centre for detailed research into world's best practice public transport and active transport.

        As a national transport research body, the Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics (BITRE) is conducting research on public transport issues as part of its research program.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 4
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Commonwealth funding for public transport should only occur in the context of overall funding for infrastructure projects that meet a strict merit-based criteria. These include an objective assessment of the broader community and economic benefits and the degree to which the sponsoring state government has adopted an integrated, inter-modal, best-practice approach to transport planning and management. The Commonwealth can only make such decisions in the context of broader judgments regarding all competing infrastructure projects that have national significance.

        The Commonwealth Government has made infrastructure investment a key national priority, and has initiated and implemented a strategic approach to national infrastructure development.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Acknowledging the vital function of Infrastructure Australia, the Government provided an additional $36 million in the 2011-12 Budget to enhance its role in planning and advising governments and the community on infrastructure investment opportunities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Infrastructure Australia's mandate has also been expanded to include the production of an enhanced priority list to identify projects through top-down analysis of nationally significant infrastructure needs, only considering projects that exceed $100 million, are flagship, or demonstrate unique national interest characteristics.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Part of Infrastructure Australia's development of a long term integrated approach to infrastructure investment will be to develop a national public transport strategy. This proposed strategy will be aimed at improving service standards through better use of existing infrastructure and investment in new infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government should investigate options for tax incentives for public transport including estimating their likely effects on people's travel behaviour.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 4 and 5 October 2011, the Government held a Tax Forum to continue the tax reform debate and discuss ways to build on the Government's substantial tax reform agenda. The forum focussed on the broad sweep of topics in the Tax Review, with sessions discussing personal tax, transfer payments, business tax, state taxes, environmental and social taxes, and tax system governance.

        Recommendation 7

       <p class="italic">
        The Government should amend the car fringe benefits tax (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FBT" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agree.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the 2011-2012 Budget the Government announced a measure to remove the unintended tax incentive for people to drive more than they need to in order to obtain a larger tax concession, by reforming the statutory formula method for valuing car fringe benefits (implements Recommendation 9(b) of the Review of Australia's Future Tax System).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When an employer makes a car available to an employee for private use, a car fringe benefit will generally arise and be subject to FBT. Car fringe benefits are currently valued under either the operating cost method or the statutory formula method.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the operating cost method, the taxable value of the benefit is based on the cost of owning and operating the car, reduced by the portion which relates to the business use of the vehicle. Employers are required to substantiate the business use of the vehicle by maintaining a log book for a specified period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The statutory formula method is designed to provide employers with a low compliance cost alternative to the operating cost method, eliminating the need to maintain a vehicle log book. It removes the need to explicitly distinguish between the business and private use of a vehicle.

       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 8
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In relation to FBT of cars by the statutory formula method – the Government should state the purpose of making the tax concessionary (noting that whether the tax should be concessionary, and whether there should be a statutory formula for the sake of easy compliance, are different questions); the Government should investigate and report on what the likely effects on consumer behaviour would be if the concessionary aspect of car FBT was reduced or removed.

        As discussed in the current Recommendation 4, the Commonwealth Government has made a significant funding commitment towards the development of priority national infrastructure projects through the Nation Building Program and through the advice provided by Infrastructure Australia. The Commonwealth Government has invested unprecedented amounts into public transport projects through the Building Australia Fund and Nation Building Program. This includes more than $7 billion investment in new funding for the planning, development and construction of nine rail projects in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and the
