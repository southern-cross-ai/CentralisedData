        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. On 1 July, EnergyAustralia's electricity prices for the average household in

         s of the major energy retailers to ensure that they put in place policies and change their practices to ensure there is downward pressure on electricity prices for Australian consumers. The Turnbull government is reining in the cost of poles and wires. We're putting more gas into the system and implementing the Finkel review recommendations, all of which are designed to put downward pressure on energy prices, particularly electricity prices, and to secure, very importantly, the reliability of supply so that people in Queensland—where you and I come from, Senator Ketter—don't find themselves in the state that people in

         We know that in some states, in particular the Labor states, electricity prices have increased by up to 20 per cent. That is why the federal government is moving in to take action. Unlike the

           Senator Ketter, I'll have to disagree, because your question said, 'why then is the government', and I think the Attorney-General has explained why the government has removed the rebate. If the Attorney-General does not want to go any further, that's up to the Attorney-General, but I think he has been directly relevant to your question.

              . The Prime Minister's answer to increasing power prices is to summon energy executives to a meeting. Given that the Prime Minister's chat with gas exporters resulted in no change to energy prices, why is the Prime Minister pursuing yet another talkfest instead of taking real action to address the cost of energy?

               's approach to energy policy is not based on engineering, not based on pragmatism and not based on the needs on the needs of consumers; it's based on ideology. And perhaps that's the reason, Senator Ketter, why in

                  I don't think, Senator Ketter, you would have asked that question if you had remembered that, during the Labor government, the federal Labor government of Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard and Mr Rudd, electricity prices increased in Australia by 101 per cent in six years. Senator Ketter, far from policy paralysis, the government has already adopted all bar one of the Finkel report recommendations, and that last recommendation is under consideration.
