        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Johnston. Minister, with today being the anniversary of the tragic events of 11 September 2001, could you advise the Senate of the actions that the government and law enforcement agencies have taken to increase Australia’s security against the threat of possible terrorist attacks?

         I thank Senator Fierravanti-Wells for her question and acknowledge her longstanding interest in matters of national security. Today marks the sixth anniversary of the tragic events of 11 September in New York City, in the United States of America. The tragic events that unfolded on that fateful day are etched in everybody’s memory. Too many innocent lives were lost—nearly 3,000—as a result of the hijacking of a number of aircraft and their being flown into buildings, into the ground or into the Pentagon. For my part—and I know I speak on behalf of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         ns—when I take off from an airport in Canberra, Melbourne or Sydney with a plane-load of fuel, not a moment goes by that I do not consider the people who were on those aircraft back on 11 September 2001. Those aircraft were turned into bombs.

         The Australian government rightly, thoroughly and diligently responded to the challenges of that act of terrorism and the subsequent acts of terrorism around the world. By 2010, this government will have spent $10.4 billion on the implementation of domestic and regional security measures to help keep Australians safe from the scourge of terrorism. These measures include increasing and improving the capabilities of our intelligence agencies, particularly

          ASIO

         . I have been to ASIO in my ministerial capacity and seen their capabilities, which fill me with great confidence. Money has been spent on boosting Australia’s civil aviation security at airports and on engineering. In respect of maritime security, the installation of X-ray machines into parcel-handling companies such as FedEx,

        <p>
         Our special forces, our

         , our Customs agents, ASIO and the

         have been enhanced. Currently there are 28 actions before the courts of our country in respect of terrorism. Those matters have not been undertaken by the Commonwealth alone. The $10.4 billion is part of a cooperative partnership with the law enforcement agencies of the states—so everything we do we impart to the states. Indeed, numerous exercises have been held where Australian Federal Police, Customs officers and other law enforcement agencies have worked cooperatively with law enforcement agencies in the states to ensure that there are measures and responses which can be undertaken in the face of these sorts of terrorist attacks. This year the Attorney-General announced $35.7 million to fund important national security and counterterrorism measures. My time is running out, and I want to pay tribute to all of those people involved in counterterrorism in Australia. I want to mark this day and say that we will never forget what happened on that day, September 11. Every time we catch a plane back to Perth I know my colleagues from Western Australia think of what happened then and are vigilant, as most Australians must be.
