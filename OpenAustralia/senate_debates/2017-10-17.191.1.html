        As a servant of the people of Queensland and Australia, I love being out with the people and listening. I want to continue a summary of my recent trip to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York" rel="nofollow">
         Cape York
        </a>
        and to name some of the other people who we met. We got as far as York Downs—in the previous adjournment speech—where we met Sally and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Witherspoon" rel="nofollow">
         John Witherspoon
        </a>
        , who both have extensive information from across Cape York. Sally has a very long history of deep involvement with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Flying Doctor Service
        </a>
        . It is essential up there, as I'll show you in a minute. They have also had some challenges with the banks and a very strong understanding of Cape York, and I felt immediately at home with a cuppa and some bickies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next day John came with us, all day, to the towns of Weipa and Mapoon. He explained some of his plans for the future, including reigniting live cattle exports. He was joined that day by Ross Benstead. We appreciated his many connections on the cape, the many insights he shared with us, his time and passion for Cape York and his support for the people up there and for us.
       </p>
       <p>
        We went the next day to Mapoon, where Peter Guivarra, the deputy mayor, did not hold back his punches. He shared his story and the history of Mapoon, and how his ancestors had been moved from near Lawn Hill Gorge up to Weipa then on to Mapoon. He shared the dislocation and the pain of that, yet there was strength in that. At the same meeting at Mapoon—and we appreciate the council at Mapoon having a meeting and a lovely little lunch with us—we were introduced to Dave, the administrator there, who strongly supports Montessori and is doing whatever he can to make sure that Montessori education flourishes on the cape. We also met
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Chris Hancock who shared insights, including on the rangers program. Then we were back to Musgrave Station where we met up with John, Mary and the locals. The next day we went to Coen and saw a mixed group—Western, Aboriginal, and everything in between. There were Jodi Hamilton, Barbara, Yvonne, Mary and Rachel at the pub, the Coen Exchange Hotel, or, as it's more colloquially known up there, the 'sex change hotel'. We saw their openness, courage and passion for their kids, the communities and the cape, and for restoring fairness. We also met up again with Amy, Louise and Barry, the publicans at the sex change hotel.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next day we went to Pormpuraaw—one of the highlights for me. We met with Edward Natera, the chief executive there. We appreciated his openness, frankness and candid behaviour—as he said, 'No kiss-arse talk' from him—and bluntness. We also met with Paul Jakubowski, whose leadership and passion are essential for the arts community there, which has exhibitions in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        , Houston and Switzerland. Then I met with Sid Bruce. What a wonderful time I had there, with his open sharing about his culture. He's a wonderful artist who is dedicated to future generations. With Sid, you could just feel his understanding and love of culture, dance and language. He is down to earth; he looked me in the eye and just said what he thought and felt. And then there was Ganthi Kuppusamy, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of an organisation up there, who came over and introduced herself. I thank her for her sharing. There was also Grace Morris, a young lady with openness, caring and passion, who takes admirable care of the arts centre and the graduates of high school programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next day we got lost, in the middle of Cape York. My thanks to Amy at Drumduff Station whose helpfulness, directions, smile and care helped us out. At the other end of that, we met with Thomas and Tomaz, who went well out of their way to help us. There were Harold and Jeans in Laura, and the electrical contractors at Dunbar Station. Getting lost in the middle of Cape York on a road that was poorly signed just shows how fragile life can be up there.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the people of Moura—which is not in Cape York but was on the trip that preceded the trip to Cape York—Maureen, the councillor; Brooke, who gave us a very good introduction; and Brad, who gave us an introduction to a bull stud. I want to acknowledge Senator Ian Macdonald and Mr Warren Entsch, from the House of Representatives, for their immediate support and open welcome when I came back from Cape York.
