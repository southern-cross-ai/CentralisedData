        My question without notice is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. In view of the revelations from Dr Alison Bleaney and Sydney scientist Marcus Scammell that eucalyptus nitens might be turning catchments of water in Tasmania into pesticide factories, when did the minister for forests, Mr Burke, first become aware of that toxicity and what action did he or will he take? Can the minister inform the Senate as to the amount of taxpayers’ money which has gone into the genetic modification program which has led to the eucalyptus nitens producing the added flow-off of toxin?

         In respect of whether the minister, Mr Burke, is aware or not, I do not know. I will have to take that on notice because there is no reference in the brief provided to me by the minister. I will take that part of the question on notice. I can provide Senator Brown with some material that is relevant to the range of questions he asks. I am advised that there is no evidence to date that naturally-occurring toxins from eucalypt species have been identified as a problem in drinking water supplies in Australia. Also, the Australian government has endorsed the Australian drinking water guidelines to ensure the safety of drinking water supplies. These guidelines, developed as part of the National Water Quality Management Strategy, undergo periodic review, and a review is underway at the present time. That review is being overseen by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">

          Medical Research Council

         ’s Water Quality Advisory Committee, and advice on new and revised guidance is provided to a number of ministerial councils for endorsement, including to the Environment Protection and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heritage_Council" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , which Minister Garrett chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
         These reviews are intended to ensure that guidance on chemicals and other substances of concern that may be present in drinking water is regularly updated, and that new issues or threats to water quality are addressed quickly and efficiently. The minister, Mr Garrett, has asked his department to work with colleagues from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health_and_Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
          National Health and Medical Research Council

         to look into the matter of whether or not naturally occurring toxins from eucalypt species should be treated as an issue of concern in drinking water supplies. I will also take on notice the question about the funding matter.

Does the minister understand the difference between a flow-off from a natural ancient forest and the flow-off from a human induced and built plantation, and will the minister concede that flow-off from genetically altered and enhanced plantations cannot be described as natural?

              I would not ask Mr Grech. On this occasion, Senator Abetz has been extraordinarily helpful. He does remind me of the history of the debate on the plantations in Tasmania.

I am being very honest and frank in the face of not having a brief, and am taking on notice those areas where I have indicated I will come back to you with an answer.
