        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Laws" rel="nofollow">
         John Laws
        </a>
        program on 8 February that she would not spend taxpayers’ money to duplicate an existing broadband service? Didn’t the minister promise that she would only provide a service where one was not otherwise available? Is the minister aware that coverage maps of her new network and the existing Telstra wireless network clearly show that the new network duplicates the existing network? Why is the minister spending up to $1 billion to duplicate an existing service? Isn’t that a clear breach of the minister’s promise in February?

         Thank you to Senator Wortley for the question. Unfortunately, the premise of the question is entirely wrong, because there is no duplication, which is the same coverage right over the entire network. Of course there is not. With what is being provided with the OPEL proposal, in fact, duplication of any areas at all has been minimised—

         <p>
          It has been minimised because you cannot push out to 99 per cent of the population without having some minimal duplication of coverage. Duplication, to my way of thinking, is where you have a blanket network over another blanket network. That is certainly not what has been provided. In fact, duplication has been completely minimised. Any kind of coverage where there are already existing services has been minimised—backhaul, for instance, has been leased. Where there are existing towers or existing infrastructure, those, to the extent possible, are being used.
         </p>
         <p>
          The other important part of the proposal is that it has a degree of commercial leverage, and the government has been very careful to ensure that that portion of taxpayers’ money is to be used in underserved areas where these services are not already available. The commercial part of the proposal is being used to provide whatever coverage on a competitive basis that the operators choose to roll out.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have been very interested to hear some of the very unsubstantiated and uninformed comment from the Labor Party about the government’s far-reaching plan to provide fast broadband to 99 per cent of the population. I again repeat my clear challenge to Senator Wortley, to Senator Conroy and to all of those over the other side who have a totally unformulated, uncosted proposal—a totally flimsy proposal.

            My challenge is for the Labor Party to provide the costings, coverage maps and technical detail about their broadband proposal for the full scrutiny of the Australian people. If the Labor Party cannot or do not produce any support for their plan, alarm bells should be ringing.

              In fact, I can tell the Senate that it has been 89 days since the Labor Party put out their so-called broadband plan. There has been nothing more that has been provided for public scrutiny other than a press release. So I say to the Labor Party that if they think they can spend almost $5 billion of taxpayers’ money—

Can the minister now guarantee that none of the wireless base stations or backhaul funded by Broadband Connect will be used to duplicate

                   I distinctly heard Senator Wortley accuse the government of subsidising Telstra’s 3G network. The only subsidy that I can recall that we have provided in relation to 3G has been in fact the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDMA" rel="nofollow">
                    CDMA
                   </a>
                   towers that have been used in the deployment of the earlier technology. I cannot recall the figure; I think it is something like $150 million that Telstra has received as part of the CDMA rollout, but we certainly have not subsidised the 3G rollout and we have certainly not subsidised any commercial rollout under the OPEL network. The only deployment of the government funding has been to underserved areas.
