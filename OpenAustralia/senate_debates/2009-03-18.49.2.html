       <p>
        I can now provide some additional information to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        in relation to the question he asked of me. I am advised that the Australian government has made extensive representations to the Croatian government on the importance we place on the Croatian police pursuing a comprehensive and effective investigation into the Britt Lapthorne matter. The Australian Ambassador to Croatia continues to liaise with the Croatian authorities as required. The Australian government retains a strong interest in this case.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also indicate to Senator Fielding that the Croatian police have confirmed that their investigations continue as a criminal case. In addition, consular staff from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        continue to provide extensive consular assistance to the Lapthorne family and have negotiated with the Croatian police to provide regular reports to the Lapthorne family on the status of their investigations.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        provides these reports immediately to the Lapthorne family when received from the Croatian police. DFAT also provided assistance to the Lapthorne family during their return visit to Croatia in December of last year, including making arrangements for the family to meet with the Croatian authorities and providing a Croatian-speaking staff member to assist the family while in Dubrovnik.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was asked more generally about the government’s handling of the case, and I suppose I can say to Senator Fielding—through you, Mr Deputy President—that the government is satisfied that from the time consular officers were advised Ms Lapthorne was missing they did everything they possibly could to assist Croatian authorities to locate her. I think I should probably conclude my additional comments by indicating that it is important to underline that the Australian government does not have extraterritorial authority to conduct independent investigations in foreign countries. We must rely on the cooperation of local law enforcement agencies in these areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        There may be some elements of Senator Fielding’s question that require further briefing, and I will undertake to provide that level of detail to Senator Fielding, but I did also undertake to provide some information as soon as I could and I wanted to do that at the conclusion of this question time.
