         The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) African Underground Mining Services Ltd (AUMS) is not an Australian business but is an Australian-owned joint venture incorporated in Ghana. The EFIC
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         $15 million facility relates to AUMS's operations in Ghana and Mali.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The effective signing date of the Ghana loan contract is 8 April 2010 and the effective signing date of the Mali loan contract is 13 September 2010.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) EFIC assessed this transaction under its Environment Policy. As required under the Policy EFIC assessed the activity of our client using the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFC" rel="nofollow">
          IFC
         </a>
         Performance Standards as the benchmark.

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) EFIC provided a loan of $US15 million to AUMS, a Ghanaian joint venture company, owned by two Australian companies. The purpose of the loan was to allow AUMS to purchase mining machinery manufactured in Australia for use in contract mining services provided by the Ghanaian joint venture to its clients in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa" rel="nofollow">
          West Africa

         . Those clients included Newmont Ghana Gold Limited which operates and owns Ahafo Gold Mine.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) EFIC's assessment included a review of publicly available information (at the time of assessment) on its client's customer, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited and its Ahafo Gold Mine Project. That information indicated that the project was assessed and funded by the commercial arm of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          World Bank
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Finance_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
          International Finance Corporation
         </a>
         (IFC), and that the IFC financing of the project was subject to the mine operator meeting stringent environment and social standards. The IFC also has ongoing monitoring and reporting in place, including assessments by independent consultants. Since the financing was approved by the IFC, the project has publicly reported on its management of environmental and social issues. EFIC's review provided adequate assurance that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Bank_Group" rel="nofollow">
          World Bank Group
         </a>
         policies and guidelines had been met at the time of that review.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) EFIC cannot comment on these issues specifically as they are related to the operator and owner of the Ahafo gold mine, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited, and EFIC has no relationship with that company.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) EFIC is aware from news reports of payment by Newmont Ghana Gold Limited of an unspecified amount as compensation for an accidental overflow at the Ahafo Gold Mine.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         EFIC cannot comment specifically on this issue as it is the responsibility of the operator and owner of the Ahafo Gold Mine, Newmont Ghana Gold Limited. EFIC has no relationship with that company.
