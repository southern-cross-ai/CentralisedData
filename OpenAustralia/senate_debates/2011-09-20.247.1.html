        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams" rel="nofollow">

        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        . The win was Stosur's first grand slam win and the first by an Australian woman in 31 years. It is not since former world No. 1
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evonne_Goolagong_Cawley" rel="nofollow">
         Evonne Goolagong Cawley

        was successful at Wimbledon in 1980 that an Australian woman has risen to the level that Samantha has now risen to.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an extraordinarily hard-fought and supremely well-deserved win for Ms Stosur. She now follows in the footsteps of not just Ms Goolagong Cawley but former world No.1 tennis player
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Margaret Court
        </a>
        . Mrs Court won a record 24 grand slam titles over the course of her career, was just the second woman to win all four titles in the same year and is still considered as one of the greatest, if not the greatest, female tennis players of all time. The fact that Mrs Court lives in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and is married to a former president of the Liberal Party does not go astray in Liberal Party circles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Court welcomed Ms Stosur's win and phoned her in New York to congratulate her. Ms Goolagong Cawley said of the breakthrough win that it would give Ms Stosur a great deal of confidence going into her next few tournaments. Ms Stosur's win has been a long time in the making. She has overcome serious physical hurdles, as well as psychological ones, and has proven herself to be a champion in every sense of the word.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 27-year-old Queenslander began tennis lessons when she was just eight and, after joining the

        </a>
        doubles with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Raymond" rel="nofollow">
         Lisa Raymond
        </a>
        and the mixed doubles at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Open" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Draper" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Draper
        </a>
        in 2005. The following year Stosur reached the fourth round of the Australian Open and became world No. 1 in the doubles.
       </p>
       <p>
        After a long struggle with worsening fatigue, Stosur was diagnosed with Lyme disease in 2007. Her return to tennis in the following year is testament to her work ethic, her fitness, her courage, her persistence and her strength of character. These same characteristics helped Stosur in her win against Serena Williams in New York. In the face of what some have said was an ungracious opponent and on the anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks, Stosur kept her head, kept her cool, maintained her composure and won her first grand slam title in but two sets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although her grace, strength, on-court movement and craftsmanship last week made the US Open win look as though it was always hers, Stosur's rise to the top of the game has not been a quick one. Nor has it been a glamorous one. It has, however, been a very important one.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the future female grand slam champions who are all lacing their shoes and picking up their racquets to go to lessons on Saturday mornings, for the future female Olympians who are only just now mastering their basic swimming strokes, for the future Australian Diamonds netballers who are racing home from school to practise putting up shots in the backyard and for all those little girls and young women who are just having a go, Stosur is, without a doubt, an inspiration. She can be held up as an example of what you can do with quiet hard work and sheer dedication to your craft.
       </p>
       <p>
        Samantha Stosur has earned the respect of her peers: male and female, overseas and in Australia, past and present. She is a positive role model, too, for 15-year-old Ashleigh Barty, winner of the Wimbledon junior title this year. She will also inspire up-and-coming players

        It is vitally important, as we see rates of obesity rising in our communities, as we learn that the current crop of children may well be outlived by their parents, as we watch girls as young as eight years of age struggle with self-esteem issues and eating disorders and as we watch our girls idolise women in highly sexually charged music videos, or models, or pageant queens or other women whose worth is judged on their looks, that we encourage them to turn to women of substance and good character to model themselves on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of these women can be found on our tennis courts and netball courts, in our gymnastics arenas and swimming poolsâ€”women like Bianca Giteau, also 27. Bianca was born in Dowerin and called

        team. Up until June this year, the St Mary's Anglican Girls School football team had had just two goals kicked against it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sport is integral to life for so many Australians, whether that means playing for a social team on a weeknight, ferrying children to and from training sessions during the week, playing pennant tennis or golf on a weekday morning, cheering on a niece or nephew at their footy match on the weekend or going to watch a game of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        . As women's sport continues to battle for greater television and radio coverage, for greater recognition in the broader community and for a greater share of sponsorships and the benefits that come with them, it is vitally important that we as parliamentarians and representatives of our electorates continue to recognise and promote female sportspeople for their dedication and their talent and as positive, healthy and constructive role models for our girls and young women to look to. There is obviously a relationship between the coverage women's sport receives in the media, the level of sponsorship it gets and participation levels among young women, who will inevitably gain enthusiasm for their sport from seeing high-achieving women in the field represented in the media.
       </p>
       <p>
        I once again congratulate Samantha Stosur on her breakthrough win in the US Open and for the tenacity, quiet endeavour and strength she has displayed in working to become world class in her profession. It is reported that in 1997 as a 13-year-old Stosur told her parents that she would not go to school until she had watched every point of Patrick Rafter's first US Open win. I have no doubt that there are many young women who watched Samantha's win with the same degree of intensity and interest, and I am sure that they will derive the same level of inspiration from her win as she did from his. Hopefully, Samantha's win will further raise the profile of women's tennis and women's sport more generally in Australia.
