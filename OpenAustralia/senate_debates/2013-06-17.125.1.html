         I thank Senator Thorp for her question. By June 2021,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         Co. fibre will be available to 12.2 million Australian homes and businesses. The rollout of the NBN is continuing its ramp-up phase with new premises being added every week. Just last week we switched on the first 2,500 premises in Darwin, as well as additional premises in Aspley and Townsville in Queensland. Construction will be commenced or completed to a total of 4.8 million homes and businesses by June 2016. That includes all of the 200,000 premises in Tasmania, which will be the first state where fibre construction will be completed by the end of 2015. The only threat to the rollout is those opposite, who plan to stop the rollout of NBN Co. fibre. The member for Wentworth has said that he will honour existing contracts, but that will not save the rollout in Tasmania. The Hobart
         <i>
          Mercury
         </i>
         reported on 5 April that Tasmanians face the prospect of two-speed broadband.The member for Wentworth has been quoted as saying:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         â€¦ areas still without the national broadband network will be provided with a lower cost version, using existing copper wires between homes and exchanges.
        </p>
        <p>
         Everybody in Australia should understand that even if you are on a three-year plan like Tasmania, your fibre is not guaranteed.

           Co. fibre to the premise will be provided to every town with over 1,000 premises, as well as to those with over 500 premises which have available fibre backhaul. Mr Turnbull and his colleagues continue to mislead the Australian public about their plans for regional Australia. This month, Mr Turnbull told ABC Radio in Victoria that under the coalition plan many country towns with less than 1,000 premises will get a fixed line broadband service. Mr Turnbull's policy states that the number of premises covered by fixed wireless and satellite is exactly the same as Labor's. There are no additional towns to receive a fixed line broadband under their plan. Mr Turnbull is once again misleading the Australian public.

             The coalition attempt to hide the deficiencies of their own policies by misleading the Australian public. They work on the basis that, if you are going to tell a lie, you should tell a big one. That is their strategy. The member for Cowper recently claimed that
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
              NBN
             </a>
             Co. is running $10 billion over budget. The member for Moncrieff has written to constituents claiming that the coalition plan will cost $60 billion less. Let me give you the truth about the coalition plan. The coalition plan is to borrow $29 billion. Senator Joyce must have missed that shadow cabinet. The dog must have eaten his homework that day. You are borrowing $29 billion for your NBN; what are we borrowing? Thirty billion dollars. Wow! Extravagance on the Labor side, but $29 billion worth of borrowing is okay.
