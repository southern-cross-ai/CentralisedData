         I thank Senator Hogg for the question. I know he has a great interest in Indigenous health. The government is committed to tackling the serious challenges in Indigenous health, and we are dedicated to closing the gap in life expectancy between Indigenous and non-

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         This morning the government made important announcements in this area—down payments on our commitment to closing the gap. We will invest $14.5 million in tackling high rates of smoking in Indigenous communities. Smoking is a leading cause of chronic disease which contributes to Indigenous people’s low life expectancy, so we know that smoking poses a serious challenge. In fact, half of Indigenous people aged 18 years and above are current smokers—that is more than double the smoking rate of the non-Indigenous population. In Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people tobacco smoking is the No. 1 risk factor for chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. In 2003 smoking was responsible for one-fifth of the deaths amongst Indigenous Australians and 12 per cent of the burden of illness.
        </p>
        <p>
         Clearly, action is required. The government’s initiatives will tackle the serious challenges in three ways. Firstly, we will support research into Indigenous tobacco control in partnership with research organisations such as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_Research_Centre" rel="nofollow">
          Cooperative Research Centre
         </a>
         for Aboriginal Health. This initiative will help build the evidence base around what is helping Indigenous people to quit smoking. Secondly, the initiative will trial a range of innovative community interventions, including targeting culturally appropriate communication activities. Thirdly, the initiative will offer smoking cessation training to staff working in Indigenous health.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will also invest $19 million in a national Indigenous health workforce training plan. It is designed to get more Indigenous people into the health workforce. Improving health services and increasing life expectancy of Indigenous people requires support for a strong Indigenous health workforce and the encouragement of more Indigenous people to take up careers as health professionals. Our health workforce training plan initiative will support the Australian Indigenous Doctors Association to expand its work of mentoring and networking young Indigenous doctors, and support the work of the Congress of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nurses, helping them to expand their network of mentoring Indigenous nurses, and encouraging Indigenous students to join the Indigenous health workforce by supporting the Aboriginal community-controlled health sector. It will also assist by providing additional training opportunities to Aboriginal health workers and support for the establishment of a national Aboriginal health workers association.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, one of the key areas is to support the Leaders in Indigenous Medical Education Network to ensure that Indigenous health is expanded into the curriculum in medical and allied health and nursing schools. These initiatives build on the $260 million commitment to Indigenous early childhood to improve maternal and children’s services. We have already announced our commitment to the innovative nurse home visiting program which has been shown to have a huge impact on the life chance of young children. This morning the government also signed a statement of intent committing us to practical measures to close the appalling 17-year gap in life expectancy. I hope all senators in the chamber recognise the dire need to address Indigenous health and will support the government initiative to take these important steps forward.
