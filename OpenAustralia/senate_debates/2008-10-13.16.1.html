        My question is to Senator Faulkner, apparently filling in for the never-present Senator Wong, representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Does the minister recall that at question time on 20 March this year I asked the environment minister if the federal government was going to prosecute the Queensland government for breach of

        essential to save the critically endangered lungfish? Does the minister recall that the then minister refused to answer the question? Is the minister aware that, because the federal government has abrogated its duty to take court action, an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
         NGO
        </a>
        has been forced to take civil action in the Federal Court to enforce Commonwealth government environmental conditions? When will the federal government discharge its duty and uphold the conditions imposed on the Queensland government to save these endangered species—or is the current federal Labor government not prepared to take on its Queensland Labor government mates?

I can also indicate, through you, to Senator Macdonald that, in the information that has been provided to me by the office of the minister for the environment, I do not actually have a brief on that particular matter. My understanding, of course, was that this was not the

All I can do in this circumstance is ask Mr Garrett to provide me with information in response to the issues that you have raised. I will certainly do that as a matter of urgency and, at the earliest opportunity, I will provide that to you.

            , is an environmental and planning disaster and refuses approval? How many more Labor MPs will have to defect before the Labor Party actually reverses its anti-environmental approach to government? When will the federal minister show some courage and refuse the application by the Queensland government for approval to construct the Traveston Crossing Dam, which has the same sort of environmental problems that the
