         I thank Senator Paterson for his question. It is a fact that Australia and Australians simply cannot afford the lawlessness which we continue to see in the building and construction sector. It is the third-largest industry in Australia, and we must do everything we can to ensure that it continues to prosper and grow.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Across Australia
         </a>
         there are approximately one million Australians who are employed in this vital industry, the building and construction sector. But for them to do their jobs effectively, we as policy makers need to ensure that their work environment is a cooperative and productive one.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is a fact borne out by Federal Court decision after Federal Court decision that when you go to work in the building and construction industry it would appear that the rule of law does not apply. Why is it that when any other Australian goes to work on a daily basis they have to comply with the rule of law that applies in their workplace, and if they do not they know that there are consequences for doing that? There are approximately 300,000 small businesses in this vital industry. They need a system. They need policy makers in this place to ensure that they have a system that is free from bullying and standover tactics that they are currently subjected to.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am also concerned that the

          CFMEU
         </a>
         's toxic culture is turning away females from this industry. It is a fact that women make up just 11 per cent of construction industry workers—a percentage that has declined over the last 30 years.

                  . In addition to that, we have recently witnessed a video showing how the CFMEU are buying up the Labor Party and demanding outcomes for themselves. To quote a senior CFMEU official who appeared in the video, who said:

                 <p>
                  The CFMEU has a hold over the Labor Party and that is to the detriment of the building and construction industry in Australia.

                     As I said, the construction industry in Australia is our third largest employer. Over a million Australians rely on this vital industry each and every day for the job. The fact of the matter is: if there is a problem in the construction industry, it is a problem that affects all Australians. If you look at the rate of industrial action in the construction sector, it is currently nine times higher than the average across all other industries. That fact costs our entire economy. It is estimated that important infrastructure, such as schools, roads and hospitals, cost taxpayers up to 30 per cent more because of the number of working days lost through industrial action at building sites. There is a clear problem, and as policy makers we need to address it.
