        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. I refer to the letter from big business to senators advocating for the Turnbull government's $65 billion tax cut for big business. Can the minister confirm that less than eight per cent of the

         Firstly, I thought that was a very important intervention by some of the most senior business leaders and some of the biggest employers around Australia. The Labor Party doesn't seem to care about jobs. We on this side of the parliament care about jobs. We understand that some of our biggest employers in Australia started as small businesses. Take Qantas, for example. Qantas started with three employees in Longreach, in regional Queensland, and today employs 30,000 people and is engaged in a fiercely competitive industry globally. It is an iconic Australian brand. With your decision to oppose business tax cuts, you are deliberately putting this business at an additional competitive disadvantage.

           The ignorant Senator Watt says that they pay no tax. They made $3 billion worth of losses, and you don't pay tax when you make a loss. What Labor doesn't understand is that investment decisions today are based on your expectations of future opportunity to make a profit.

              is one of the signatories to the letter. Alan Jones and his management team have been able to turn the situation around at Qantas, and they are now profitable again—and, of course, they will pay tax once the accumulated losses of the past have been paid down. But, if we put them at a competitive disadvantage, it will directly impact on the job security of 30,000 Qantas employees and directly impact on the opportunities for the 3,000 small- and medium-size businesses that supply goods and services to Qantas. It would also directly impact on the job security of the many Australians who work for the 3,000 businesses that supply those goods and service to Qantas. Qantas are one of our champion businesses, and you want to make it harder for them to be successful. You want to put the job security of employees in businesses such as Qantas at risk. That is the implication of your decision to stand in the way of big tax cuts.

                        The reason that company tax cuts are important for the future success of even businesses that are making a loss today or which did so yesterday is that businesses will make investment decisions on their expectations of future profitability. They will assess their future opportunity to make a profit. They will consider the future opportunity of after-tax profits, and they will make investment decisions today on that basis. They will make decisions today on whether or not they will expand their business, which could go to whether they will hire more Australians. As they make decisions to hire more Australians, they put more competitive pressure on wages—and that is how wages go up. These are basic fundamentals.

                             There will be if you pass the tax cuts in full. Additional investment is contingent on the Senate passing our business tax cuts in full. If the Senate passes the business tax cuts in full, there will be more investment into Australia, which will generate more jobs and drive stronger wages growth. I can absolutely guarantee that. Do you know what else I can guarantee? If we continue to put businesses at a competitive disadvantage, particularly bigger businesses, there will be less investment, fewer jobs and lower wages. When there are fewer jobs, the unemployment queues will increase and there will be less competition for workers; and when there's less competition for workers, business only has to pay less to secure their services. We want business to have to pay more to secure their services.
