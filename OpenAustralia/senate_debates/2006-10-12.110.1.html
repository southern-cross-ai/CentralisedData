        My question is to Senator Campbell, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. I refer the minister to his decision to block the establishment of a crocodile safari hunting industry in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        and the refusal to allow export licences. Is the minister aware of the reaction to his decision by his colleague the member for Solomon, who said the minister was ‘acting like some sort of itinerant drunk full of Dutch courage’? Is the minister aware of another description attributed to a Liberal Party insider, who described the minister as ‘almost barmy’? They said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I’m expecting we’ll soon have to send in the rescue team to bring him back to civilisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Could the minister indicate whether he has been invited on a crocodile tour with Mr Tollner and, given that Mr Tollner said the minister’s decision was completely wrong, can he indicate whether he has any plans to review this decision?

         Mr Tollner is a very vigorous advocate for the interests of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         as he sees them. As we know on both sides of politics, we can have friendly fire. People can call each other daleks; people can call me whatever they want—it goes with the territory. Senator Conroy and Senator Carr and I have pretty thick hides—not as thick as a crocodile’s, but we can put up with the odd sling and arrow. Mr Tollner has very strong views on this issue. I know that a number of people in the Northern Territory do.
        </p>
        <p>
         What I did was to maintain existing Australian government policy, which is to give the Northern Territory government a permit to cull crocodiles, using professional park rangers and so forth. They do have a problem with crocodiles because of the very bad management of crocodiles back in the sixties and seventies, with uncontrolled hunting. They have got very serious problems up there and culling is part of the solution. Their proposal was to have amateur people come in. I made a decision that that was not in the best interests of wildlife management in Australia. Many people passionately supported my decision; many others did not.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am glad to say—although it did not get any coverage—that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         ’s spokesman on the environment assured me that I had the Australian Labor Party’s full support for my decision, and I welcome that. Often you do not get bipartisanship on these things. I believe I made the right decision in the interests of Australia’s wildlife. I am very proud of that decision and I have no plans to review it.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Is the minister aware of the growing disquiet in the industry in the

           Northern Territory

          and in the government about this decision? Haven’t his own colleagues described him as ‘a complete and utter dill’, if I can remember Mr Tollner’s words on radio last week, and further advised others to ignore him? Does the minister think that his decision and the impact on the crocodile safari hunting industry has damaged his ambition to be Treasurer, as was highlighted in this week’s

            ’s position was to support my decision. I suggest that Mr Albanese should talk to Senator Crossin. She is sending very mixed signals about the Australian Labor Party’s support for what I regard as a very sound environmental decision. They are all over the place on the environment, so it is not surprising to me that Senator Crossin should contradict her environment spokesman on this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our position is clear. I know that Mr Tollner does not like it, but I have a lot of respect for him as a very effective member of the parliament who stands up for the Territory’s interests—clearly not something that Senator Crossin is that good at at this stage.
