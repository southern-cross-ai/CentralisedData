        My question is to Senator Campbell, the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Will the minister outline to the Senate the significant contribution made by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">

        ? Further, is the minister aware of any commemorative activities that are occurring to acknowledge these contributions?

         Thank you to Senator Payne for what is a very important question for many thousands of Australians. Tomorrow marks the 40th anniversary of one of the most important and defining engagements of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
          Vietnam War
         </a>
         —the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
          Battle of Long Tan
         </a>
         . During this battle, Australian forces performed with magnificent valour and very much against the odds. Nothing can attest to this more than the fact that many of their former enemies now admit that it was a major victory. Sadly, 18 Australians died in the Battle of Long Tan. They were part of a group of some 520 Australians from the Army, Navy and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Air Force
         </a>
         who lost their lives in the Vietnam War. Tomorrow we will stop to remember not just the people who died at Long Tan but those who died in the Vietnam conflict more broadly. It should also be remembered tomorrow that seven civilians lost their lives during that conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
         Tomorrow, as we stop and remember the sacrifices made in Vietnam and at Long Tan in particular, we should also remember that many veterans have died in the years since then and many others carry deep physical and emotional scars of their wartime service. We should also thank and be thankful for the families around Australia and the many loved ones of the veterans who have given them so much well-needed and important support in that time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today is also a day when we should record—on behalf of the government, at least—an apology to those veterans and their families for the way they were treated when they returned from the Vietnam War. These people served their country. They served it well. They did their job and many of them died in the course of doing that job, and the way they were treated on their return is a great scar on Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government has committed $4½ million to a range of activities right across Australia tomorrow. Tonight in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
          Great Hall
         </a>
         , the Prime Minister will host a reception, which I know many are looking forward to, and they will be very welcome in

          Parliament House
         </a>
         . Tomorrow morning there will be a stand-to ceremony at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
          Australian War Memorial
         </a>
         followed by a further ceremony at the Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial, a little down

          Anzac Parade
         </a>
         , which will honour all Vietnam veterans. Some of the events occurring around Australia tomorrow include ceremonies in Brisbane, culminating in a ceremony during the afternoon conducted by 6RAR at the Enoggera military base specifically to commemorate the Battle of Long Tan.
