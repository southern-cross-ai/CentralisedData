       <p class="italic">
        In October we were forecasting just under 300,000 premises passed; we are now forecasting almost exactly the target of 286,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        Will the minister inform the Senate of the latest advice he has received from NBN Co. regarding the number of brownfields premises to be passed by fibre and able to be connected by 30 June this year? Has the minister received any information that differs from Mr Quigley's latest forecast of 286,000 premises?

         I am aware of a variety of claims from Senator Birmingham and the member for Wentworth that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         Co. are misrepresenting network rollout figures by changing their definitions, all of those sorts of things. These claims are wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Quigley gave a presentation—I think it was last Friday at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Chamber_of_Commerce" rel="nofollow">
          American Chamber of Commerce
         </a>
         —at which he put up on the screen exactly the same graph which he had tabled at both the last estimates and the one before. For those who are trying to play this game of claiming that the rollout is behind, I simply go back to one very simple point. In February-March last year, the NBN Co. said that they would be able to complete construction in 758,000 homes. Mr Turnbull went on television and said, 'That would be extraordinary. You would have to admire them greatly if they were to achieve that.' By the end of the year, when we produced the December outcome, the NBN Co. had exceeded its construction targets. Did those opposite take the opportunity to live up to their word?

           NBN

          Co. regarding the number of premises to be passed and whether he has received any information which differs from Mr Quigley's latest forecast of 286,000 premises. The minister has not gone anywhere near answering the question about the most recent advice he has received from NBN Co. as the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the

                As Senator Birmingham knows, we debated this long and hard at Senate estimates and Mr Quigley explained the concept of a ramp-up. He provided a graph which shows that we are actually meeting our construction targets. The next publication will be of the March figures. We will then be able to judge how we are going in meeting our targets. But even the Liberal-National Party candidate for Lilley turned up just last week in Aspley to support and welcome the turning on of the first Brisbane customers of the
