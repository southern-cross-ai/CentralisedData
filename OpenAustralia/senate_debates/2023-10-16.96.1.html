        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. Before the last election, the Prime Minister stated emphatically:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I don't think, I know that Labor's Powering Australia plan will cut power prices …
       </p>
       <p>
        And Labor promised a $275 cut not once but on 97 occasions. However, recent figures released by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Market_Operator" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Energy Market Operator
        </a>
        reveal that energy bills have risen by over 20 per cent in the past 12 months, with a record number of households and businesses claiming hardship assistance. Was the Prime Minister lying or just reckless when he solemnly pledged to cut power prices for Australian households?

          Thank you very much for the question. I would like to begin the answer by acknowledging, and reminding people of, the energy crisis that we inherited on coming into government. In fact, I remember Minister Bowen having to leave the swearing-in ceremony at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House" rel="nofollow">
           Government House
          </a>
          to make sure that the lights stayed on across the country because of the mess that we inherited from those opposite who, remember, hid the power price increase. They hid the advice that they received about the increase in electricity prices before the election.

            The former minister hid the increases in energy prices before the election, because he didn't want that to come out. But, when what we had inherited became clear, we started, on day one, going around and fixing the mess that we inherited, including by delivering on our commitments that were included in the Powering Australia plan, which Senator Hughes outlined in her question. So, yes, we are delivering on that, but we are also dealing with what we inherited with the war in Ukraine and the mess that we inherited from those opposite. The modelling that was done in the Powering Australia plan was done in 2019 to reflect the situation in 2025—from memory. We are dealing with right here, right now, with the circumstances that we inherited. The reality is that renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy and that, if you put more investment and get more renewable energy into the grid, it will moderate the increases in electricity prices. That is a fact, and that is accepted by everybody except those opposite in this place, which is exactly why we inherited the mess we did when we came to government, because you had your head in the sand for a decade.

              According to evidence given at the Senate's cost-of-living inquiry,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EnergyAustralia" rel="nofollow">
               EnergyAustralia
              </a>
              is now dealing with three times the number of inquiries concerning energy bill relief that it had during the pandemic, while 45,000 customers are now accessing the company's hardship program. Why has the Prime Minister been so distracted by dividing the country that he's allowing this cost-of-living crisis to cause so much hurt to Australian families?

              <p>
               Again, I can't take a question seriously from a party that opposed the energy bill relief plan. That is the money that was supported by this parliament to ensure that we could take some of the pressure off those bills. That is the single purpose of one of those questions that was put to this chamber. And you voted against it. How can you vote against households getting hundreds of dollars of relief off their winter bills and then complain about increasing costs when you voted against them getting any help? It doesn't make any sense.
              </p>
              <p>
               Australians realise that they've got a government that acknowledges that prices are high in a range of areas. We are dealing with it with our 10-point plan that goes to a number of areas to support households and families who are doing it tough. Energy bills is one of those areas, and you voted against it.
