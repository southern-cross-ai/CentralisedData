        My question is to Senator Carr, the Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, representing the Minister for Education. Can the minister inform the Senate what the government is doing to renew and extend Australia’s school infrastructure? In particular, can the minister update the Senate on the progress of the

         I thank Senator Forshaw for his question. At least he is seeking information, concerned as he is about ensuring the prosperity of this nation in these difficult times.

         , I repeat for those senators who clearly are not interested in this, is the single biggest boost to Australian schools in the nation’s history. This is a $14.7 billion initiative to provide new facilities and to refurbish facilities. It will help equip each and every Australian school to meet the demands of the 21st century. The centrepiece of this program is the $12.4 billion
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Schools" rel="nofollow">
          Primary Schools
         </a>
         for the 21st Century program. It is building and renewing large-scale infrastructure in all eligible Australian primary schools, especially in special schools and in kindergarten to year 12 schools, including libraries, halls and indoor sporting centres.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first two rounds of this program will deliver $9.1 billion to 5,215 schools in every state and territory, and we are yet to hear from the coalition as to whether or not they support this expenditure. This program will support some 6,983 projects. It will help to sustain jobs and it will help to sustain businesses in every community across Australia. What do the coalition say about this? Do they support it or don’t they? Of course, this is round 1 of the funding. Two-thirds of this program’s funding to date has gone to government schools, one-fifth has gone to Catholic schools and 13 per cent has gone to independent schools. Contrary to some ill-informed media commentary—

          program, has a significant number of components and involves a huge investment. Minister, if I can then take that up, I would like to ask you a question in respect of one component of that—that being the National School Pride program. I ask: could the minister update the Senate on the rollout of that national pride program and how it is going? What is the scope of the program and how many schools does it involve?

             I thank Senator Forshaw for his question. I think first of all I should say that, contrary to some ill-informed senators relying on ill-informed media comments, there will be no money allocated to projects in schools which are due to close or to amalgamate. What you have here is the government allocating $1.26 billion to 13,176 projects in 9,490 schools around the country under rounds 1 and 2 of the National Schools Pride program. That is 9½ thousand schools—not a few dozen or a few hundred but 9½ thousand schools. We see a whingeing, do nothing attitude from those opposite. Of course they will never have the courage to actually—

                 Last month’s budget included some $3.1 billion in new funding for research and innovation over four years. Much of that money will be spent on Australian science, especially through the $1.1 billion Super Science Initiative. We also recognise that progress in building long-term scientific capacity must actually begin in the schools, and that is why this component of

                 is so important. It will make $1 billion available to build around 500 new science laboratories and language training centres in schools that can demonstrate that need. There has to be a capacity to complete construction by 30 June 2010. It will give young Australians the skills they require to compete and prosper in a high-tech global economy.
