         Thank you, Senator Williams, for your question, and I acknowledge your strong interest and passion in the resources sector, particularly the way it supports jobs in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . The resources sector is an absolute cornerstone of our economy. On the latest figures, I would like to report it's now six per cent of Australia's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         , around $200 billion a year in export revenue, and, most importantly, employment for 235,000 people. In your home state of New South Wales, approximately 48,000 jobs are supported directly, with 22,000 of those being in the very important coal industry. In
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         , 10,000 people are directly employed in mining, and, as a result, regional businesses across regional Queensland continue to grow strongly. In the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         , it is $2.75 billion worth of our economy, and, as I said, more importantly, that translates to 5,700 jobs. That's about 12 per cent of the entire GDP of the Northern Territory.
        </p>
        <p>
         We welcome significant improvements in metallurgical and thermal coal prices. The average metallurgical prices in August were about double what they were the same time last year. Thermal coal prices were about 60 per cent higher than they were the same time last year. That's because government is backing the resources industries and the jobs that they provide. We're encouraging, at every opportunity, further exploration, further investment, further development, because we know that those investments will ensure that others will invest in the jobs we so desperately need. It will also, so importantly, ensure that we put downward pressure on power prices for those who need that leadership most.

            We are a country of vast resources. That's why we are backing coal as an essential source of power for the long-term future, especially high-efficiency, low-emissions technology. The reality is that we should all agree that we need thermal power to ensure households and businesses across Australia can (a) survive and (b) thrive.
           </p>
           <p>
            We're also encouraging states and territories to open up gas supplies and to encourage the exploration of gas reserves. This is a very important part of what our nation needs to keep downward pressure on power prices. We have got an abundance of high-quality coal resources, and we should be utilising those resources for the benefit of our communities. Our households and our businesses are being crippled by rising energy costs, and we need to be absolutely supporting these sectors so they can deliver the jobs that regional Australia requires.

                     I agree, Senator Wong. Senator Scullion, I would ask you to withdraw that. I remind all senators to refer to members of the other place, and indeed colleagues, by their correct titles.

                      In October, 2016 Labor voted down a motion in favour of shutting down coal-fired power stations. Sorry, Senator Williams, your home state will be impacted if Liddell goes, and they are certainly supporting that process. Labor has said they want to force the closure of power stations. They have committed to a 50 per cent renewable energy target. They have said it can only be done by shutting down coal. You have got to come clean with the Australian people about which power stations you are going to close, which workers you are going to sack, and release to the Australian people the real cost of your reckless policies on the Australian economy.
