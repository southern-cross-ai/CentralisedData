        I rise to make a contribution about an event that occurred in Sydney on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Sunday" rel="nofollow">
         Easter Sunday
        </a>
        earlier this year, where I was privileged to join the leadership of the Irish National Association at Waverley cemetery to give the 2022
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dwyer" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Oration, which is essentially about the contribution of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Irish Australian
        </a>
        s to this great nation and the colourful history that binds our two nations together. My oration traversed the tableau of the Irish struggle for justice and independence, and the 1798 memorial itself is a reminder of the 1798 Wexford uprising. A man by the name of Michael Dwyer, along with a number of other political prisoners, ended up in Australia. Upon his death, Dwyer was buried not far from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Station" rel="nofollow">
         Central Station
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        A hundred years later a large number of his Irish descendants and members of the Irish community in Sydney decided that they would re-inter his remains at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waverley_Cemetery" rel="nofollow">
         Waverley Cemetery
        </a>
        . The 1798 Memorial in Waverley Cemetery is a remarkable marble edifice dedicated to the efforts of those 'rebels', as they were called at the time, but 'patriots' as they are called retrospectively by those who seek a united Ireland. A hundred thousand people actually gathered along the streets from Central Station in Sydney all the way out to Waverley Cemetery, where he was re-interred. Ten thousand people walked from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary's Cathedral
        </a>
        , as a testament of hope and power to what one brave person in search of democracy, in a particular context in time, can engender. It was an amazing experience and a true honour as an Australian, but the daughter of Irish immigrants, to be at that Easter celebration. It's not surprising it happens at Easter, which is a time of significant memorials in Ireland about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Rising" rel="nofollow">
         Easter Rising
        </a>
        of 1916.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, 2022, is actually a hundred years since the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and I was particularly delighted to discuss the proud history of female members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Dail" rel="nofollow">
         Irish Dail
        </a>
        . They contributed to the debate regarding the 1922 Treaty, and each of them—all of the women in that first Dail—rejected the treaty because they thought it would plunge Ireland into further turmoil. It is very interesting to look—a hundred years down the track—and see in the papers in Ireland at the moment a lot of discussion about what a united Ireland for this century might look like. So the struggle continues.
       </p>

        In 1922,

        I'd also like to remind everybody that the Australian Irish connection has been very significant in Australian politics.

       <p>
        I thank the Senate for the opportunity to put this important occasion on the record. To share histories of other countries is very instructive for us as citizens of this great country as we make our way forward to develop a stronger, more robust and more reflective democracy. Struggle is part of the journey, and we honour the struggle of those who've gone before us in the pursuit of democracy.
