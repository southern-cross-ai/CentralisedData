        On 26 November, Senator Ludlam asked me a question about the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network and the national broadband network. I seek leave to incorporate the response in

       <p class="italic">
        On 26 October 2008, Senator Ludlam asked me a question on notice regarding the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network (ACCAN).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Specifically the Senator asked:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “Can the minister tell us the status of the new consumer protection body, the Australian Communications Consumer Action Network, in particular what date it will be established, who is on it and what role this network will play in the deliberations on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        tender?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … My question was specifically on what role this network will be playing as the tender process unfolds. Further to that, given that the operator of the network will, in effect, have control over a natural monopoly and that Telstra has indicated that it wants an 18 per cent return on investment, which according to some commentators could raise broadband prices by 50 per cent per month for users, what measures will be taken to protect consumers from price-gouging, particularly in regional areas?”
       </p>

        I undertook to provide the requested information.

         RFP

         Digital Economy

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Several consumer organisations responded to the Government’s public invitation for submissions on the NBN, including the Australian Telecommunications Users’ Group and Telecommunications Disability Consumer Representation (TEDICORE, a project of the Australian Federation of Disability Organisations), and a number of organisations which have representation on the founding board of ACCAN such as the Internet Society of Australia and the Consumers’ Telecommunications Network. As detailed in the NBN RFP (clause 10.6.2), the Panel of Experts will be able to have regard to the regulatory submissions in its evaluation of proposals.

        Clause 1.3 of the RFP clearly sets out the Commonwealth’s 18 objectives to establish a national broadband network that, amongst other things:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         enables uniform retail prices on a national basis;
        </li>
        <li>
         continues to promote the long-term interests of end-users;
        </li>
        <li>
         facilitates competition through open access arrangements that ensure equivalence of price and non-price terms and conditions, and provide scope for access seekers to differentiate their product offerings;
        </li>
        <li>
         enables low access prices that reflect underlying costs while allowing Proponents to earn a rate of return on their investment commensurate with the risk of the project;
        </li>
        <li>
         provides benefits to consumers by providing choice to run applications, use services and connect devices at affordable prices;
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Clauses 1.5.10 - 1.5.23 of the RFP provide guidance in relation services, competition and open access, including the long-term interests of end-users and pricing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In particular, clause 1.5.12 states:

       <dl>
        <dt>
        </dt>
        <dd>
         Proponents should outline how consumers will be able to run applications, use services and connect devices at affordable prices. Proponents should outline the type of retail services that could be offered, for both business and residential consumers.

          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         expects that consumers will enjoy affordable retail prices for NBN services, but also notes that services need to be priced so they are economically viable.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        As indicated in clause 10.3.2, Proposals will be assessed by the Panel of Experts against the evaluation criteria specified in the RFP to identify the Proposal or Proposals that represent the best value for money. The evaluation against criterion 1 will involve an assessment of the extent to which a Proposal meets the Commonwealth’s objectives for the NBN process as set out in clause 1.3.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As indicated in clause 10.1.3 of the RFP, the value for money assessment of Proposals includes the overall costs and benefits of the Proposal (including long-term costs and benefits) to the Australian community as a whole.

         The ACCC will provide the Panel with ongoing advice on Proposals, including advice on issues such as wholesale access services and prices, access arrangements, proposed legislative or regulatory changes and the likely impact of Proposals on pricing, competition and the long-term interests of end-users in the communications sector.
        </dd>

       <p class="italic">
        Clause 10.4.2 of the RFP further states that the ACCC will provide a written report to the Panel. Clause 10.4.3 states that the Panel will consider the advice provided by the ACCC as part of its assessment process.

       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 of the RFP describes the information that Proponents should provide in their Proposals. The information provided by Proponents will be used in the evaluation of their Proposals.

Proponents should outline the type of retail services that could be offered, for both business and residential consumers. The Commonwealth expects that consumers will enjoy affordable retail prices for NBN services, but also notes that services need to be priced so they are economically viable.

       <p class="italic">
        1.5.13      The Government will need to be assured that existing retail customers will experience no or minimal disruption to their services, and also that the migration of wholesale customers will not be subject to anti-competitive delays or processing timetables. Proponents should ensure that equivalent (or superior) services to those that are currently available can be offered to all existing customers.

        1.5.14      As noted above, the NBN will be a central platform for the Australian communications sector. The Government considers that the long-term interests of end-users should continue to be promoted. The Government is therefore determined to ensure that appropriate open access arrangements are in place to promote competition and ensure efficient investment. In this context it will be important to ensure that access is provided on equivalent price and non-price terms and conditions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.5.15      Proponents should clearly specify the wholesale access services they are proposing to offer in accordance with the details requested in Schedule 2. For example, Proponents should include details such as the proposed locations of Points of Interconnection, technical arrangements for service providers that acquire wholesale services and (where relevant) the availability of backhaul capacity to and from Points of Interconnection. In setting out these details, Proponents should keep in mind the Government’s objective of providing scope for access seekers to differentiate their product offerings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.5.16      Open access arrangements should apply to wholesale services to be provided over the NBN, including upgrades of services, as specified in the contract for the NBN. In accordance with section 1.4 of Schedule 2, Proponents should submit their proposed arrangements for ensuring open access to the NBN, including measures or models to ensure that access is provided on equivalent price and non-price terms and conditions. If a Proponent proposes to supply both wholesale and retail services it should demonstrate what structural measures or models it proposes be put in place and maintained to prevent inappropriate self-preferential treatment and ensure that effective open access is achieved on the terms required by the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.5.17      Proponents should outline how their proposed access prices have been determined with reference to the underlying costs of providing services and demonstrate that the underlying costs are incurred on an efficient basis. Access prices should be set as low as possible, to ensure the best outcome for consumers, while allowing Proponents to earn a rate of return on their investment commensurate with the risk of the project. Proponents should explain the basis on which they have derived the cost of capital, including how investment risks have been calculated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.5.18      As requested in Schedule 2, Proponents should describe how arrangements will provide scope for access seekers to differentiate their services by allowing the customisation of technical parameters (including but not limited to speeds, quality of service, latency, jitter, contention ratios and interleaving).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.5.19      Proponents should also describe how access services will allow access seekers to offer enhanced applications such as multicast, virtual private networks, high definition video-conferencing, peer to peer content delivery and IPTV if desired.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.5.20      If Proponents are proposing to roll-out new network infrastructure in regions where competing networks already exist, including in some cases existing

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTTP" rel="nofollow">
         FTTP
        </a>
        networks, they should indicate this as requested in Schedule 2. The Commonwealth expects that there will not be economically inefficient duplication of existing FTTN or FTTP infrastructure. Proponents are also encouraged to consider interconnecting with existing FTTN or FTTP roll-outs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.5.21      Where Proponents intend to use infrastructure owned by third parties they should indicate the type of access they will require and what arrangements have been reached, or would need to be reached, to ensure it is granted on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to it. Proponents should indicate their pricing assumptions for access to third party infrastructure, as requested in Schedule 2.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.5.22      Proponents should identify the parts of the network that are commercially viable in their own right and those parts that would not otherwise be commercially viable without financial support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1.5.23      If a Proponent considers that mechanisms are required to facilitate the Government’s objective of enabling uniform retail prices and the delivery of services to premises within the

         NBA

        footprint, it should clearly set out the nature of this mechanism. For example, if Proponents are proposing cross-subsidy arrangements within access prices to enable uniform retail prices, they should clearly identify the extent of any cross-subsidization, as well as other relevant details (see Schedule 2). If a Proponent proposes another type of mechanism to enable uniform retail prices, it should set out details about the nature of its proposed mechanism and other relevant details (see Schedule 2).
