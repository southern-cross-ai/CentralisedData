       <p>
        The AIDS pandemic, caused by the spread of the HIV infection, has been one of the most destructive diseases in human history. The statistics are alarming. According to the 2012
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNAIDS" rel="nofollow">
         UNAIDS
        </a>
        worldwide statistics, over 60 million people have been infected with HIV since 1981. There are currently 35.3 million people living with HIV/AIDS. Over 25 million people have died from the disease. The most alarming statistics are in sub-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saharan_Africa" rel="nofollow">

        website indicates that last year there were 1,253 new cases of HIV diagnosed in Australia. That is a 10 per cent increase in diagnoses from the previous year. Equally concerning is the prevalence of HIV-AIDS and AIDS in our region. The 2012 UNAIDS report,

        , speaking on World AIDS Day, launched AIDS 2014, a major global health conference to be held in Melbourne next year with 14,000 delegates from 200 countries. She warned against discrimination towards victims of the disease, drawing parallels between the plight of sufferers and her own struggle for democracy in Myanmar.

       <p>
        It is critically important that the fight against HIV-AIDS in Australia and globally remains a policy priority. I acknowledge the work so many are doing here in Australia and overseas to meet this challenge and I know that this is a sentiment that is shared by all senators.
