        There has been some discussion, I understand, in relation to Senator Siewertâs amendment. I can foreshadow that if it is in the same wording as we understand it to be then it will be acceptable to the governmentâI mean the opposition. The government can speak for itself. This select committee is a very important one and the terms of reference outline why that is so. Firstly, the select committee, which is to be known as the Select Committee on Remote Indigenous Communities is to inquire into and report on the effectiveness of Australian government policies following the Northern Territory emergency response specifically on the state of health, welfare, education, and law and order in remote Indigenous communities. The select committee will also be looking at the impact of state and territory government policies on the wellbeing of remote Indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is indeed a very important part of public policy in this country today. Other aspects of the terms of reference deal with the employment and enterprise opportunities in remote Indigenous communities and the health, welfare, education and security of children in remote Indigenous communitiesâand that is perhaps the most important of all. Under this reference, the committee would report to the Senate on 30 September 2008, 30 March 2009, 30 September 2009, 30 March 2010 and 30 September 2010. What we have are rolling reports. This is in the model of a standing select committee which will have the purview of a very import part of Australian public policy dealing with remote and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that we have these ongoing reports, and of course there has been much debate about the intervention in the Territory. This committee will continually monitor and benchmark outcomes in such things as law and order, health, school attendance, community development and employment. It will also compare conditions in communities covered by the intervention in the Northern Territory with adjacent communities not under intervention and communities in other jurisdictions. As I say, it will provide reports to the Senate on an ongoing basis and that, I believe, will be of great assistance not only to the government but also to the Senate and the other place in dealing with legislation and measures in relation to the intervention.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a select committee which will have its hands full. It will be busy. The extent of the issue is such that it does need that length of time that I have mentioned to deal with this. It also demonstrates a commitment that the intervention in the Northern Territory is not a one-off situation but an ongoing situation which is designed to achieve a better outcome for Indigenous people in the Northern Territory. Senator Scullion had given notice of this motion as a result of his longstanding interest in this area and of course, as a senator for the Northern Territory, he knows this area only too well. The details of the select committee are in the terms of reference, and I commend the reference to the Senate.

        <p>
         I have circulated an amendment to this motion which seeks to expand the motion slightly to ensure that the committee addresses regional as well as remote Indigenous communities. In fact, the Greens would have preferred to have seen this issue referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, as that is the committee that has been extremely involved in looking at issues affecting Indigenous communities. We do, however, think that an ongoing inquiry such as this is very important, because we do agree that this is going to have ongoing implications for Aboriginal communities. We want to ensure the long-term sustainability of interventions also deals with Indigenous disadvantage.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is no secret that the Greens have been critical of the nature of intervention, although the Greens are very supportive of federal government involvement and a significant increase in expenditure on addressing disadvantage. Actually looking at the impact of the intervention, the effectiveness of the policies, and the impact of state and territory government policies is also very important. We think it is broad enough to ensure that it goes beyond the existing emergency response to look at all the other issues that relate to the health, welfare, education and the security of children in regional and remote Indigenous communities. So although we think it should have been referred to the community affairs committee, we think that this is the next best option and we will be supporting referring it to a select committee. I would also like to signal that we will be supporting Senator Bartlettâs amendment. I move the Greens amendment to the motion in the terms circulated in the chamber yesterday:

          I support the Greens amendment, which seeks to expand the focus of the committee to regional and remote Indigenous communities rather than just remote Indigenous communities. I think it is important to be able to do that.

           The Democrats

          in general support the proposal of having a substantial committee inquiry into this very important issue. Given that I have spoken for a number of years now in this chamber about the need to give a much greater and concerted focus and priority to Indigenous issues across the political spectrum, it would only be reasonable for us to support the proposal to do just that. But the hypocrisy we are seeing from the coalition again has to be noted. After three years of preventing a single Senate select committee being established, we now have a fourth Senate select committee being set up in the space of a couple of weeks. As I said a few minutes ago in regard to the Selection of Bills Committee report, the hypocrisy of the coalition putting in place a comprehensive Senate committee inquiry stretching out over 2Â½ yearsâit is proposed the committee make its final report in September 2010âinto an intervention that this Senate was given one day to examine is unbelievable. I know we are meant to all smile wryly and go, âOh well, thatâs politics,â but I just find that too hard, frankly. The gall is beyond beliefâeven for politicians. That is very different from agreeing withâ

              I can see why Senator Kemp cannot see the difference between supporting a proposal and supporting a proposal whilst recognising that it is dripping with hypocrisy. It is not surprising Senator Kemp cannot differentiate those two things, because he has shown that he is incapable of recognising gall and rampant hypocrisy throughout his career. It is no surprise that he cannot see it now, but it is overwhelming to anybody who has the opportunity to look at this objectively. We have an opportunity here to examine this issue and look at the impacts of the interventionâand, I might say, Indigenous issues more broadly. That opportunity is welcomed and I do hope the Senate engages with it constructively.

                Yes, I am supporting it. It is very observant of you, Senator Kemp! It is amazing: it is good that you have finally followed a debate well enough to realise that when I say, âI support something,â then, yes, I support it. I appreciate that when you stand up and say, âI support something,â you usually have half of your brain looking for the excuse to back out of what you have just said, because you are used to saying one thing and doing another. As my record shows in this chamber, when I say I support something, I support it. I appreciate that is a strange concept for you, Senator Kempâwho is, I might say,

                from somewhere far removed from his actual seat. But, again, following proper process and having respect for the Senate is not something I have expected from Senator Kemp for a long period of time. The simple fact is that the intent of what is being done here is welcomed.

                   It does need to be put on the record, though, the disparity between the actions of the coalition when they were in government in preventing inquiries, including into the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                    Northern Territory
                   </a>
                   intervention, and what they are doing here. I called for a proper examination of the issues when the Liberals were in government. It is sad that it took them until they got into opposition to actually allow proper scrutiny, but now that we have the opportunity for proper scrutiny, it is something that should be welcomed.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It should be stated that this does not just concern the Northern Territory intervention and its effectiveness; it also concerns the impact of state and territory government policiesâwhich also need to be thoroughly examinedâthe health, welfare, education and security of children in remote and regional Indigenous communities across the board and employment and enterprise opportunities.

                   I do not have any particular objection to a Senate committee going for 2Â½ years. Senator Sherry would know; he was, I think, part of the Senate
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Select_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                    Select Committee
                   </a>
                   on Superannuation that went for about three or four parliaments. The Senate Select Committee on
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
                    Animal Welfare
                   </a>
                   back in the 1980s and early 1990s also went for about six or seven years. So a committee going for a prolonged period of time is not necessarily a bad idea ifâand this is the key issue and I do hope the Senate committee is able to achieve itâthe committee operates constructively with a genuine attempt being made to leave the politics out of it, to take the point scoring out of it, to stop the ideological arm wrestling, to stop the using of Indigenous people as political footballs and to actually look at the issues. That is part of the reason why I have foreshadowed my amendment.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The other thing we have seen with this proposal, as with every other select committee that the coalition have now suddenly seen a need to set up, is that they are taking the chair for themselves. It may well be that the best person for the role of committee chair is one of the coalition members, but I think we really need to be looking at the principle of the best person getting the job. In my view, and this is the reason behind my foreshadowed amendment, once the members of the committee are known, the committee shouldâand it could be an early test of its ability to work in a non-partisan wayâdetermine for itself who should be the chair, and then the deputy chair would be from a different party from that of the chair. I can say this now as I clearly have no self-interest in this as this committee will obviously not feature any Democrat, but it will have a person from the crossbenches. I expect this would be a Green, but that is still to be determined.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Depending on who those people are, it is quite possible that the best chair for that committee could be a Green or a government person. The select committee should not be set up specificallyâ

                     No, it will not. You are right, Senator Kemp. You have indeed listened to me once again. As I said, I will not be here and neither will you.

                     suggest that your not being part of this prolonged inquiry is a massive chance for this committee to actually operate in a constructive way, because your record, particularly on using Indigenous people for opportunities to score cheap political points and smear people, is one that is clearly on the record in this chamber. And you are doing it once again right now. Thank you for being true to form and proving my point. It also demonstrates that instantly giving the chair of the committee to a coalition senator, regardless of who it is, is not necessarily the best way to guarantee that the committee can do its job effectively.

                    <p>
                     I welcome the fact that the Senate will decide to have a comprehensive examination of regional and remote Indigenous communities. I very much urge whoever serves on the committee to do all they can to make it a constructive, non-partisan series of inquiries and reports over the 2Â½ years for which it will be operational. We do need to remember why it is that we are doing this. We are doing it to try to improve the situation for

                     </a>
                     ns. We are not doing this, I hope, to try to provide a rolling opportunity for political point scoring and ideological wedge making in regard to the Indigenous affairs policy debate. Unfortunately, we are still seeing that from time to time in this chamber and we are still seeing it from time to time from some in the mainstream media. Indigenous peoples deserve far better than that.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     If there is one area where all of us in all political parties have failed comprehensively across the board decade after decade, it is in our approach to

                     </a>
                     . This inquiry and the committee itself will be a big test of whether we have managed to evolve beyond that and whether we are mature enough to do our jobs responsibly. I hope whoever serves on the committee is able to do that. One way of improving the chances of it doing that is to pick the best person for the job of chairâit is a bit of a novel concept, I supposeârather than just handing it automatically to a coalition member.

                        I do remember it. Senator Kemp, you are not going to be here from 1 July. Go and have a cup of coffee. You are being totally disruptive. People want to get away for Easter. You will not be here after 1 July so, in the nicest possible terms, please stop disrupting the chamber so that we can get on with business.

                        The terms of reference for the proposed committee are clearly a grab bag of issues encompassed by the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                         Northern Territory
                        </a>
                        emergency response. In relation to the Northern Territory, it is too early to establish such a committee when the government has committed to establishing an independent and transparent review to operate from the 12-month mark. It is expected that the review will report by the end of September 2008.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The review of the Northern Territory emergency response will provide an independent assessment of the effectiveness of each of the measures that comprise the emergency response. In relation to the other terms of reference, the matters to be addressed are extraordinarily wide and it is inevitable that the committee will cover so much ground it will fail to come up with sensible advice and policy recommendations.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The suggestion that the Commonwealth parliament should assess the impact of state and territory government policies, whilst perhaps well intentioned, will inevitably get bogged down in claim and counterclaim. The Australian government, in contrast to the previous government, is committed to strong evidence based policy formulation in relation to Indigenous disadvantage. The government has committed to closing the gap in relation to key social indicators of Indigenous disadvantage: halving the gap in life expectancy within a generation, halving the gap in mortality rates between Indigenous and non-Indigenous children under five within a decade and halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievement within a decade.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We are committed to open and transparent policy formulation processes which assess progress objectively. Already the

                         Overcoming Indigenous disadvantage
                        </i>
                        reports are making real progress in providing a robust and independent framework for assessing progress in addressing Indigenous disadvantage, including in remote Australia. It is not clear to us on this side of the Senate that the proposed committee will add value in terms of developing appropriate policy responses.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        In relation to the Senate committee system, we already have an appropriate set of committees. There is no reason why the existing community affairs committee ought not be asked to inquire into any specific issues arising in remote Australia. All this proposal will do is establish yet another select committee, the fourth, which will trawl for media stories and opportunities to be negative. The real need is for the Senate and its committees to focus on developing policy solutions for the very real needs of remote Indigenous communities. To do that would require a much greater focus than is evident in the motion before us today. It will require the identification of particular issues and terms of reference to provide a road map of the sorts of issues that the committee will examine. This motion from the Liberal opposition has just been cobbled together at the last minute.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        The proposal before the Senate is an abuse of the Senate processes. It is attempting to lock in for the next 2Â½ years a committee structure which is designed to frustrate the legitimate right of the next Senate coming in after 1 July to structure its own approach to addressing these issues.
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">
                         The Liberal
                        </a>
                        opposition should be taking on board the Prime Ministerâs visionary offer of bipartisanship in the Indigenous affairs area, and commit to working within the committee structure that they themselves established. The current opposition when in government established the existing committee structure of the Senate. Because it no longer suits them, because they now find themselves in opposition, they are creating select committee after select committee. That is what they are doing. It is an abuse of the Senate process.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Senator Bartlettâs foreshadowed amendment to the motion makes senseâbut it is essentially a second-best outcome given the fundamental flaws in the motion from Senator Scullion. We call on senators opposite to reconsider this motion. It is setting a precedent for the future for the creation of select committees. Oh! The lights have gone out. Has the microphone gone out? That is probably more important. We have the thumbs up; the sound system is working. Fortunately, I can still read in the dark. We call on members opposite to reconsider this motion. It is poorly conceived, it will be poorly executed and will only serve to detract from the potential role of contributing positively to addressing Indigenous disadvantage and closing the gap. Therefore the Labor government will be opposing the creation of this committee.

The opposition believes that Senator Bartlettâs amendment is flawed because if the decision by the committee for a chairman cannot be reached then it has to come back here to be determined in this chamber. It is our view that that would delay the very good work of this committee and that furthermoreâ

                          Those opposite might think that overseeing a matter as important as this is to Indigenous affairs is not important and that that good work can be delayed, but we in the coalition do not believe that. We also believe that there is a precedent with prior select committeesâwhere the committee elect a chairman from amongst the opposition membersâand that is exactly what is proposed. It is normal Senate convention that those who propose a Senate select committee have the chair of the committee. That is the normal convention. Those are the reasons the coalition will not support Senator Bartlettâs amendment, and we believe that it is important that the committee be able to appoint a chairman from its members as quickly as possible and get on with what is very important work.

It has been stated that convention is that the opposition have the chair of the select committee; that is not correct. There have been a number of select committees. The very last select committee that was established before the clampdown in 2005 was chaired by Senator Allison from the crossbench.

                             Thank you, but that is still incorrect. The superannuation committee sat over a long period of time and it was not just the person or the party that came up with the idea that said, âWeâre taking the chair, thank you.â The superannuation committee chair varied, and there were chairs from both parties; it was not necessarily matched with who was in government or opposition. It appeared to meâperhaps I was being naiveâthat they picked the best person for the job. Senator Watson was the chair of that committee for some time because he was recognised as being extremely capable.
