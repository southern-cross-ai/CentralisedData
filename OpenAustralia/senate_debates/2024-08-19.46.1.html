        A couple of weeks ago my colleague Senator Anne Ruston came to Tasmania, and together she and I visited the Complete Care Pharmacy in

        . I wanted to share in the chamber today the inspiring story of Kristina Fox and Julie Sorrentino, the visionary owners of this pharmacy. These two incredible women have dedicated their time and resources to create a patient-first business model. I have been around many pharmacies in my home state of Tasmania over the last few years, and this is the first time I've seen this kind of model in action, and it was truly incredible to see.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kristina revamped the pharmacy with cutting-edge design and technology that features a robotic dispensing system, five specially designed consulting rooms and a triage prescription software that she developed herself, which in effect means that, when potential clients or patients come into the pharmacy, they can easily be triaged to get a consultation with a pharmacist. This pharmacy's commitment to community care shines through in an impressive range of services tailored to the needs of patients. To ensure the exceptional delivery of these services, their team includes skilled professionals such as nurse practitioners, lactation consultants, a diabetes educator and a continence nurse advisor, and there are also registered

        providers. They've embraced change and shifted the focus from purely dispensing medications to providing broader healthcare services.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it's really important to recognise that multidisciplinary care isn't limited just to general practitioners, but it involves various healthcare providers working together. Complete Care Pharmacy serves as an absolutely stellar example of how all of our pharmacies can take a proactive role in teamwork, emphasising that pharmacists are crucial to the overall healthcare system.
