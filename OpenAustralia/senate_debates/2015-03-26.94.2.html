           The government will not be supporting this motion. This is a politically driven motion moved by those who are fundamentally opposed to the government's offshore processing policies. The allegations referred to in this motion have been extensively investigated independently by Mr Philip Moss, the former Integrity Commissioner and former head of the Australian Commission for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement" rel="nofollow">
            Law Enforcement
           </a>
           and Integrity. The Moss inquiry was a comprehensive investigation which drew information from a wide range of stakeholders, including Serco and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Federal Police
           </a>
           . The department has accepted all of Mr Moss's in 19 recommendations and has only just commenced implementing its responses. The department will continue to have discussions with the government of Nauru on the best way forward to implement the investigation's recommendations.

             by leave—In principle, I supported the previous motion before the chamber today. Transparency and investigation are paramount, particularly when the target is the treatment of vulnerable people, women and children. However, I am concerned that this motion is too soon, in light of the fact that I have read the Moss review that was handed down only last Friday. I acknowledge the fact that the terms of reference may have been narrow, but I am impressed with the integrity of Mr Moss and the veracity of his findings. This motion called for a report within three months, and I believe that is unrealistic. If, in three months' time, the government's response to the Moss review has been inadequate, I will support the motion if it is put again.
