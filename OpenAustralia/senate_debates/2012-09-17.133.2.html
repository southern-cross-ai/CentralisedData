         The answer to the honourable senator’s question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) In order to comply with competitive neutrality principles.

          ANSTO
         </a>
         imports Iodine-123 and Gallium-67. The unreliability of the National Medical Cyclotron (

          NMC
         </a>
         ) in the period leading up to its closure in 2009 meant that imports were periodically required even before that date. The implementation of a reliable importation strategy has improved the reliability of supply to hospitals and patients.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) No.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) I-123 mIBG comes in two doses, depending on the specific procedure being undertaken. The price for 200MBq is $1045 and the price for 400MBq is $1984. Questions regarding rates of Medicare reimbursement should be raised with the

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) ANSTO’s pricing complies with competitive neutrality principles, which include a requirement of an adequate rate of return.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) This is a clinical question that should be discussed with a

         (10) ANSTO’s pricing complies with competitive neutrality principles.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (11) Iodine-131 (not iodine-133) is used for the treatment of thyroid cancer. It comes in a variety of forms and doses, depending on the specific procedure being undertaken. Prices range from $505 to $870 per dose.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (12) As noted in the response to part (10), the price for I-131 (not I-133) ranges from $505 to $870 per dose. Questions regarding rates of Medicare reimbursement should be raised with the Department of Health and Ageing.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (13) I-131 mIBG is only produced as needed for the treatment of particular patients under the TGA Special Access Scheme. Each production run in the

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (14) Yes, the price of Samarium 153 (Sm) Lexidronam produced at ANSTO is $3,255. Questions regarding rates of Medicare reimbursement should be raised with the Department of Health and Ageing.
