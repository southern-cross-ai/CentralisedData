        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. In the only visible alteration made by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Fisheries and Forestry to its 2009 import risk analysis, the department updated the scientific name of the bacteria causing zebra chip disease using an article entitled 'Tuber transmission of
        <i>
         Candidatus Liberibacter solanacearum
        </i>
        and its association with zebra chip on potato in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ', which was published in the 2011 peer-reviewed

        </i>
        Can the minister explain why the department did not also mention that, in contradiction to advice given by

         DAFF

        , the entire basis of this article was that potato tubers can transmit the zebra chip disease between potatoes without the aid of tomato-potato psyllid?

         I thank Senator Madigan for his ongoing interest in potatoes. I am advised that the draft review has taken into account the publication referred to by Senator Madigan. It is not correct to say that the issues raised are not referenced. The Gillard government takes biosecurity seriously and has invested heavily in the development and implementation of import policies that are risk based, informed by the best available science.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAFF" rel="nofollow">

         did release a draft report for the review of import conditions for fresh potatoes for processing from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         on 3 July. The draft report was released for a 60-day public consultation period. Twenty-seven submissions were received and a Senate inquiry has been initiated on the issue, and is due to report on 21 November. If there is any credible scientific evidence that the report has not properly canvassed or that would support tougher conditions of import than are proposed in the draft report, it does need to be brought to the attention of the Australian government Director of Quarantine.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised, though, in respect of the article that you mentioned, that it has been referenced in some of the 27 submissions provided to the department in response to the public comment period. All evidence submitted will be considered by the scientific review team. The department does have an obligation to properly consider any credible evidence supporting stronger conditions of importation. It is an area where I know there is considerable contention.

           I thank Senator Madigan for his first supplementary question. I understand Senator Madigan this morning attended a briefing with departmental officials. I cannot speak on behalf of them but had he directly asked the officials this question I have no doubt they would have answered in the affirmative. For my part, I can say that the Gillard government is committed to an open and transparent process of review of the information that informs biosecurity policy. That is why the report was put out for a 60-day consultation periodâ€”so that stakeholders could be advised. I understand that senators and members who attended the briefing earlier today were advised that the department is in the process of considering the 27 submissions on the draft review of provisions for importing potatoes from

            , I have a second supplementary question. Minister, in light of the fact that the department's draft importation advice is that shipping containers can be aired in transit and on receiving wharves with open doors or vents, can you advise on what basis the department concludes that a flying insect such as tomato-potato psyllid will not be inclined to or capable of escaping a container that had previously been sealed?

             I thank Senator Madigan for his second supplementary question. I am advised that the draft condition for the import would require potatoes to be in bags and/or covered on arrival, as the department officials advised at the members and senators briefing. Draft conditions of import would also ensure that all potatoes and all potato waste would be under quarantine management until leaving a factory cooked and frozen in a plastic bag. That quarantine management covers transport from the port to processing facility under a quarantine seal, delivery to a quarantine approved premises and then waste disposal in a quarantine approved manner. Notwithstanding these strict conditions of import, no decision will be made to import potatoes from
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
              New Zealand
             </a>
             under any circumstance before the contestable science based policy review is finalised. It is important to note that Australia has imported 13,000 tonnes of tomatoes.
