        <p>
         Senator Cameron, I am sure you are aware that Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria have prepared a substantial document going through, on a clause-by-clause basis, what they say will be the impact on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
          CFA
         </a>
         of the proposed clauses. So there is that document. I believe it would have been part of the Senate committee's documents. The committee would have already seen that document.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can take you through some of the clauses that have been raised as being of particular concern to Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria. For example, clause 21 sets out the extensive consensus based consultation process required under the agreement. The clause's operation means that in conjunction with, for example, clause 41 all current CFA policies will be reviewed and only remade through a process where union consensus is required. In terms of evidence given in particular to the recent Senate committee that inquired into the bill, volunteers questioned why the proposed agreement's consultation term gives the union a veto power over changes under the agreement, including policies directly relevant to volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will take you through a number of other clauses shortly, but I will just take a step back. The first question one needs to ask is: what is an enterprise agreement and to whom does an enterprise agreement apply? I am sure you would be aware, Senator Cameron, that an enterprise agreement is an agreement that deals with the terms and conditions of the employees to which the enterprise agreement is relevant. Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria have obviously raised concerns about the impact of clauses in the agreement on the volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will take you now to clause 44. Clause 44 sets out a minimum staffing level of four paid firefighters on appliances and prohibits cross-crewing of any appliance unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Volunteers have raised the concern that this clause specifically discriminates against them by providing that minimum crewing is undertaken by paid firefighters and that a United Firefighters Union veto can be exercised over cross-crewing arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to another example of a clause about which concerns have been raised, I will take you to clause 35. Clause 35 of the proposed agreement sets out that all employees covered by the agreement shall only report to operational employees under this agreement at the rank of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCO" rel="nofollow">
          DCO
         </a>
         or CO when responding to fire alarms or incidents under the agreement except in certain circumstances as defined by clause 35. Volunteers have raised concerned that this creates a fundamental change to incident control and management. They believe that transfer of control can affect and disrupt the tempo and effectiveness of the firefight and they believe that they will lose their authority at an incident.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other clauses which Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria have raised concerns in relation to include: clause 15.1, dealing with brigade support programs; clause 16, dealing with volunteer support programs; clause 60, which mandates peer support will only be drawn from paid firefighters; and something as simple as schedule 20, which will prescribe that volunteer firefighters and paid firefighters wear different items of clothing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Cameron, they are some of the clauses which have been raised in the evidence given to the Senate committee hearing. As I said, a document was prepared by Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria which did a clause-by-clause analysis of the agreement.

           Senator Cameron, as you would be well aware, this dispute has now been ongoing for a number of years. There have been numerous iterations of the agreement and, certainly up until a few months ago, the specific clause that you are referring to was one that did require seven paid firefighters to be on the ground. A change was made to that clause because it was of such concern to the volunteers—so it was an admission by the United Firefighters Union that there were concerns with the clause. Concerns still do remain with the clause, I might add. The clause has been refined so that the clause now refers to seven paid firefighters needing to be 'dispatched' to the fire operations before the paid firefighters can commence the firefighting operations. But certainly, in numerous iterations of the agreement, the clauses you articulated were included in that agreement. It was only when it was absolutely acknowledged that this clause was a problem that the language was changed to 'dispatched'.

            Senator Cash, when you made the statement, they was not the terms of the agreement, were they? The terms of the agreement clearly provided for 'dispatched'. So your position was wrong, and was designed to inflame distrust and mistrust. My question to you was: why did you make the statement in the first place? Simply saying that you read the agreement I do not think is good enough, because this was a political position that you adopted that was clearly wrong. If you cannot be trusted to have a look at the right agreement, how can you be trusted on any of the other issues that you are raising here when you are asking the Senate to support this bill?

             Senator Cameron, as I stated to you, it was not until the parties agreed that there was a lot of concern in relation to the clause as it had been written—which was that seven paid firefighters needed to be 'on the ground'—that it was a clear acknowledgement of the concerns that had been raised. But Senator Cameron, I would put to you that when you have a chief officer resign, when you have a minister from the left wing of the Labor Party stand aside because she cannot support the assault that the Andrews government is currently undertaking on the tens of thousands of fantastic men and women in Victoria who put their lives on the line, quite literally, so that Victorians can be safe, and when you have an entire board sacked by the Andrews government because they have the audacity to stand up and speak out—I think that speaks for itself, in relation to the political nature of this particular incident.

              Minister, instead of the rhetoric, I would like to get you back to why you made this statement. Deputy President Roe made his final recommendation on this issue on 1 June 2016, and dealt with that issue, and it was on 22 August that you decided to go out there and actually do a written commentary on this agreement that was out of date—so it was clearly designed to inflame distrust and mistrust between the firefighters, both the paid firefighters—the career firefighters—and the volunteer firefighters. And while you are on your feet in relation to this issue, Minister, the firefighters have explained the reason why they want seven paid firefighters to be deployed in certain circumstances. Have you looked why that deployment was to take place—the reasons why there was an agreement between the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
               CFA
              </a>
              and the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFU" rel="nofollow">
               UFU
              </a>
              on that deployment? It was basically about ensuring that if a firefighter goes into dangerous situation, there is enough back-up support there for that firefighter to be rescued if he or she ends up in trouble. Were you aware of that reasoning?

              <p>
               Senator Cameron, if I could just of course raise with you that the clause that is currently in the agreement—'dispatched' as opposed to 'must be at the fire ground'—that is still of great concern to the VFBV. What it basically means is that paid firefighters cannot assist volunteers until at least seven paid firefighters have been dispatched. Senator Cameron, I understand you have been to the hearings. You would have heard the evidence given that, in relation to the paid firefighters and the volunteer firefighters, there are approximately—as you know—60,000 volunteer firefighters and approximately 800 operational paid firefighters. The paid firefighters are specifically, under the Victorian
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
                CFA
               </a>
               legislation, there to assist the volunteer firefighters. That is how the Victorian situation is set up.
              </p>
              <p>
               In relation to the clause, as it currently stands, there are still grave concerns highlighted by the VFBV.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
                If I
               </a>
               could take you to them, clause 43.2.7 and 77.5 of the proposed CFA enterprise agreement require that a minimum of seven professional firefighters are dispatched to fireground incidents before commencement of safe firefighting operations. So what do the volunteers—the men and women who for decades now have put their lives on the line to ensure that the communities in Victoria are safe—say the meaning of that, potentially, is? It means that volunteers can themselves begin fighting a fire. They can get to the fireground. If the fire is there, they can begin fighting the fire. But, in relation to paid firefighters, what will now occur is that paid firefighters cannot join them until seven paid firefighters are dispatched.
              </p>
              <p>
               In terms of the practical effect of this clause on the ground, when you are in a situation of potential complete catastrophe, where a fire is burning, where you have a protocol that has been put in place, the practical impacts, as advised by Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria, are:
              </p>
              <ul>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              </ul>
              <ul>
              </ul>
              <p>
               So, Senator Cameron, yes, you want to make political points. Yes, you do not want to stand up and side with some of the magnificent men and women who are sitting here today in the gallery watching these proceedings. They do not know what the calls they get tomorrow will be, but I am quite sure, Senator Cameron, that you and I would not want to receive those calls in a million years. The calls they get are the calls which say: 'Can you please get out there. There is an emergency, and we need you on the ground. Drop everything. Drop your day job and get out there and risk your life.' They have concerns with the practical impact of this clause.

               Yes, Senator Cameron, you are right. The United Firefighters Union have put forward evidence in terms of why they say this particular clause is necessary. But the volunteers, who are the people on the ground every other day of the week, have serious concerns with that clause and the fact that, ultimately, it may compromise the firefighting operation on the ground.

                Minister, as you know, summer is around the corner. You have been going to a great deal of trouble for months now driving what is really a very divisive approach to emergency services. It is something that I find deeply troubling. I agree with you that our volunteers here are magnificent men and women, but so are our firefighters. Paid firefighters, like our volunteers, put their lives on the line. I find the language that you have been using deeply disturbing, and it further underlines how political what you are driving here is. The primary goal here is not public safety.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think what is really necessary, now that we can get into the detail here, is that you point out the specific clauses in the agreement that are detrimental to volunteers. Can you name the clauses and what parts of the clauses are detrimental to volunteers. We need to get past the general statements and the rhetoric that there are some good people who fight fires—the implication being that there are some bad people who fight fires—and actually deal with public safety. You need to identify the actual clauses and where they are detrimental to volunteers.

                <p>
                 Senator Rhiannon, I understand that you may have left the chamber for a very short period of time. But during that short period of time that was the exact question that Senator Cameron asked me. I took Senator Cameron through some of the clauses that are of concern or have been highlighted as being of concern to the volunteers. I also highlighted to Senator Cameron that Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria had done a comprehensive analysis of the proposed enterprise agreement and had gone through each clause, on a clause-by-clause basis, to highlight where they believe there was going to be a clause of concern.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If you like, I am more than happy to take you through the answer that I gave to Senator Cameron, if that would assist you. In particular, there are a number of clauses that are of particular concern and have been raised as being of concern for some months now—in fact, for some time—and they were certainly raised by the Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria at the Senate hearing, which I understand you may have attended.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Again, I will not go through them in detail, because I think I have really put that on the record for Senator Cameron, but of concern were: clause 21, in relation to the extensive, consensus-based consultation process required under the agreement; clause 41, in which current
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
                  CFA
                 </a>
                 policies will be reviewed and only remade through a process where union consensus is required; clause 44, in terms of the minimum staffing levels, in particular, the prohibition on cross crewing of any appliances, unless agreed by parties; clause 35, which sets out that all employees covered by the agreement shall only report to operational employees under the agreement or at the rank of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCO" rel="nofollow">
                  DCO
                 </a>
                 or CO when responding to fire alarms or incidents under this agreement, except in certain cases as defined by the clause. Just very briefly, other clauses which have been raised as of concern: clause 15.1, dealing with brigade support programs; clause 16, dealing with volunteer support programs; clause 60, which mandates that peer support will only be drawn from paid firefighters.
                </p>
                <p>
                 One of the other clauses—I think it is almost a great shame that it has to be raised as a clause of concern to the volunteer firefighters—is set out in schedule 20 to the proposed agreement, and it proposes that the volunteer firefighters and the paid firefighters will now have to wear different uniforms, so they are identified differently. So, to anyone in this chamber who stands up and says there is nothing divisive about this agreement, I would say that that clause alone—whereby you want to now specifically identify who is a paid firefighter and who is a volunteer firefighter and deliberately put a wedge between them—is enough in itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Rhiannon, you may also be interested in this, and I am happy to read it out to the Senate: it is a letter dated 30 June 2016 from Peter Rau,

                 Board. It was written to the Hon.
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Merlino" rel="nofollow">
                  James Merlino
                 </a>
                 MP, the relevant minister. Mr Rau goes through in detail the impact that he says a number of these clauses have had on his own organisation and why it is dangerous for them to be carried on into the proposed agreement with the CFA. What he says is this:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 I write to you as Chief Officer of the Metropolitan Fire and Emergency Services Board (
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFB" rel="nofollow">
                  MFB
                 </a>
                 ).
                </p>
                <p>
                 He goes on to talk about the agreement, and says:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 … I wish to raise with you my serious concerns regarding the negotiations with the United Firefighters Union (
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFU" rel="nofollow">
                  UFU
                 </a>
                 ).
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 I am aware of the terms of the enterprise agreement that the UFU has proposed to the CFA … in the context of its current bargaining. It is my understanding that the UFU expects any agreement negotiated with the CFA to be substantially reflected in the terms of a new agreement to apply to the MFB.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He then goes on to talk about the bargaining period:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 Throughout this bargaining period which commenced in April 2013, the MFB's position has been that its own current agreement seriously impedes the delivery of effective fire prevention and suppression services in Victoria. The fundamental concern relates to the requirements under the current agreement that the Chief Officer must consult and reach agreement with the UFU in relation to operational matters.
                </p>
                <p>
                 So the issues that have been raised by those in the CFA dispute are the issues that Mr Rau is talking about here. He continues:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 I am concerned that, far from improving the already very troubling position that exists under our current agreement, the proposed CFA provisions would further hinder my ability as Chief Officer to effectively fulfil my statutory responsibilities as you and the community expect.
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 As the Chief Officer, I have to respond quickly and decisively to emergency situations. I am also required to make strategic decisions to prepare for emergency situations. As the head of operations I need to make decisions unimpeded by provisions within an industrial instrument requiring agreement from a third party …
                </p>
                <p>
                 Which is exactly what we see happening here. Mr Rau continues:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 The proposed CFA agreement would, if applied to the MFB, create even greater concerns.
                </p>
                <p>
                 He then goes on to say:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 I wish to draw your attention to some examples under the current MFB enterprise agreement that have led to—
                </p>
                <p>
                 what he terms—
                </p>
                <p>
                 unacceptable situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Rhiannon, these are some of them:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 For over two years, the MFB was unable to deploy new advanced appliances because the UFU refused to agree to their deployment. This came to a head during a week-long heatwave when I needed these appliances to be deployed to meet the MFB's responsibilities …
                </p>
                <p>
                 He needed the appliances to be deployed to meet the MFB's responsibilities, and he could not get consensus from the union. He continues:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 In this instance I had a direct request for support from
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ambulance_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
                  Ambulance Victoria
                 </a>
                 … Over a two day period consultation occurred with the union…
                </p>
                <p>
                 Over a two-day period, in an emergency situation, consultation occurred with the union to resolve the matter. This is an emergency situation where someone needs to make a decision there and then. But because of a consultation clause in the agreement they are emasculated—they are unable to make a decision. But it gets worse. He then goes on to say:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 Due to the inability to reach agreement we sought the assistance of the Fair Work Commission (
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FWC" rel="nofollow">
                  FWC
                 </a>
                 ) and as such, in the middle of the heatwave, two Deputy Chief Officers spent a further afternoon and evening at the FWC seeking a resolution to release these appliances into operations the following day, distracting us from critical operational activities.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Rhiannon, it goes on and it goes on and it goes on. His conclusion is:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 The current Enterprise Agreement and its power of veto over my statutory responsibilities is unworkable and undermines community safety.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Senator Rhiannon, these are real life examples of what can occur when you utilise an enterprise agreement for purposes for which it was not intended. These are real life examples of where safety has been potentially put at risk because of the clauses that have been raised by the volunteer firefighters as being of concern.

                   Chief Officer

                  </a>
                  , in relation to this very issue. Anyone listening should understand that what the minister has just gone through is the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFB" rel="nofollow">
                   MFB
                  </a>
                  . It is not the CFA. This is an issue that the MFB chief fire officer is raising, not the CFA. We are not talking about the MFB, but it again suits the minister to get into that approach of trying to mislead people about the issues. Anyone who was not aware of the details would think, 'Oh, that's a good point!' But the point is: this is not the MFB. We are talking about the CFA. They are two entirely different organisations.

                  (CFA) are both Victorian fire services, but are governed by different pieces of legislation. The powers of the CFA Chief Officer (CO) and the MFB Chief Officer are expressed differently. Furthermore, CFA and MFB are culturally distinct organisations, in part because of CFA's founding as a volunteer organisation with a large jurisdiction.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  Due to the differences between CFA and MFB, I do not think that issues faced by MFB under its enterprise agreement can be extrapolated to CFA's experience.

                  ) is not an effective mechanism to resolve disputes. As I stated in my evidence before the Committee, it has not been the experience of the CFA that I or the officers under my control have been 'locked away' at the FWC, attempting to resolve a dispute whilst we are in an emergency situation. Further, the CFA has negotiated a joint statement of intent with the UFU which, among other things, records the parties' intention to resolve disputes as quickly and efficiently as practicable …

                 <p class="italic">
                  (d) Mr Rau referred to the recommendation of Judge Lewis in relation to the clause 47 of the CFA Enterprise Bargaining Agreement 2002 dealing with "Uniforms and Equipment". The CFA consults with volunteer and career firefighters on uniform and personal protective equipment. Firefighting is a dangerous activity. The uniforms and equipment that firefighters wear and use is of critical importance. Decisions about these matters must be made carefully, with significant deliberation and research and with a process to take into account the views of those most directly affected—firefighters, whether they be career staff or volunteers.

                 <p class="italic">
                  (e) Mr Rau identified his need, as CO, to be able to immediately direct the deployment or relocation of resources as particularly important in the current evolving security and threat environment. I do not believe that, as CO, I would be prevented from deploying resources during an emergency event, which includes an emerging security threat.

                 <p>
                  Every point that Mr Rau raised, the chief officer, Mr Steven Warrington, says is not a problem for the CFA. So the arguments that the minister has put up do not hold any water. It is another example of this minister and this government trying to demonise the firefighters who are paid by the CFA. It is another example of this minister and this government trying to gain political advantage by arguing for division between the CFA volunteers and the paid firefighters, and the CFA Chief Officer has demolished every argument that the minister has put forward.

                 <p>
                  In relation to what she has just put to the Senate, anyone listening would think there is a problem with this agreement. The chief officer has constantly and continually said that this agreement will not take away from his power to look after the Victorian community. That is the bottom line, Minister. You are well aware of it. You certainly should not be continuing the propaganda—and that is all it was—that you peddled during the election campaign. You continue to peddle it here to try to diminish the rights of career firefighters, who, as anyone would argue, are as brave, courageous and committed to the Victorian public as any volunteer firefighter. In fact, in every station where they work together, they work together well, they deploy effectively together and they understand the issues faced by each other in relation to dealing with emergency situations. Minister, you should stop the propaganda and start dealing with the facts.

                 <p>
                  Just before the break I went through the correspondence from the chief officer, Mr Stephen Warrington, in response to the MFB chief officer, Mr Peter Rau, which clearly indicated that the chief officer of the CFA did not see any problems in the CFA that Mr Peter Rau—I think he is the former chief officer—claimed he had experienced. So I put that proposition on the record.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Senator Cash, I now want to turn to two other issues that you raised in your response to Senator Rhiannon. You spoke about cross-crewing. I am advised that the cross-crewing has nothing to do with whether volunteers cross-crew. Cross-crewing is about career firefighters being designated to two different trucks on station where each truck should be separately crewed. So it is a safety issue for the firefighters to deal with this. Again, Senator Cash, I will draw your attention to the fact that this agreement is not about volunteers; it is about firefighters who are employed by the CFA. It is the career firefighters. So this has nothing to do with the volunteers. There is no ban on volunteers cross-crewing. If you look at some of the evidence that we had from those volunteers who work with the career firefighters on a regular basis, they actually say that this is not a problem. So this will not affect volunteer firefighters. I want your views on that.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On peer support, again you would have to read the agreement in the context that the agreement is about career firefighters. It is about the paid employees. The career firefighters—the paid employees—have issues about peer support. When you talk about peer support in this document you are not talking about peer support for the volunteers; you are talking about peer support for the firefighters who are career firefighters. This is, I am advised, highly personal. It is about personnel getting peer support after traumatic incidents. As you would be aware, many of the career firefighters attend traumatic incidents and the career firefighters have set up in this agreement a proposition where their counselling—where their peer support—will be done by their peers. Can you just clarify your position on this in the context of you saying this is a problem for volunteer firefighters? Because the agreement is clear: this is an agreement between the paid firefighters and the CFA, and both the cross-crewing and the peer support is simply about the paid firefighters.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The third area is about different uniforms. The agreement says that volunteers and careers need to be separately identified so that the incident controller can immediately identify their skills and qualifications. I want to know whether there is a problem with that. Why would there be a problem with being able to identify by looking at someone's uniform what skills and training they have had? Every career firefighter, I am advised, is fully trained for all seven roles on the fireground. Volunteers may or may not be fully trained for those seven roles. Many volunteers do not have breathing apparatus training or competency in that area. So it is vital, I am advised, that the incident controller can make instant decisions on the fireground and that different identifiers will do that. They can have the same uniform, it is just that there will be an identifier on the uniform. Are you aware of these issues, Minister?

                   Thank you to Senator Cameron for this series of questions. In the first instance, in addressing the claims made by Senator Cameron that the enterprise agreement is only in relation to the employees or the terms and conditions of employment for those employees to whom it applies: Senator Cameron, that is what this whole dispute is actually about. You would be well aware that an enterprise agreement, which is an agreement that is made under the Fair Work Act, provides or should provide the terms and conditions of employment for those employees to whom it applies. The issue that has been confronting the volunteers in the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
                    CFA
                   </a>
                   for some time now is that what is proposed by this enterprise agreement is that it is actually going to expand the reach of the agreement into volunteer arrangements, certainly beyond what is contemplated by the Fair Work Act.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I have articulated a number of the concerns that the volunteers have in relation to the agreement. In relation to the necessary minimum staffing levels at clause 44, the volunteers have raised concerns about this clause, which prevents cross-crewing of fire trucks by volunteers and paid firefighters unless agreed with the union, and, further than that, about clause 44.14, which requires four professional career firefighters on all appliances. If you go back to what we were discussing prior to—

                       As I said, if you go back to what we were talking about prior to the dinner break in relation to the letter that was written to the Hon.
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Merlino" rel="nofollow">

                       </a>
                       , one of the fundamental concerns that have been raised by the volunteers is in relation to the consultation clauses as proposed by the agreement. You look at the actual examples that are given in relation to the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFB" rel="nofollow">
                        MFB
                       </a>
                       in terms of their agreement, which contains similar clauses. And what has actually happened? You are talking about a direct impact in relation to the ability of someone to make a decision there and then on the ground because a clause in an agreement states that that decision cannot be made without consulting with the union.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In terms of schedule 20 and the list of station wear, uniform et cetera, the volunteers question why the proposed agreement requires union agreement on what uniforms volunteers wear. Why would you need to consult the union about what the volunteers must wear? It requires that paid firefighter unions must be significantly visually distinguishable and will only be made available to paid firefighters. Again, this is a genuine concern raised by the volunteers. Why should the volunteers have to consult with the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFU" rel="nofollow">
                        UFU
                       </a>
                       in relation to the uniforms that the volunteers wear?
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       In relation to clause 16, the volunteer support programs, again the volunteers question why the proposed agreement gives the union power over volunteer support programs. Again, if you go back to the basic fundamentals of what an enterprise agreement is, an enterprise agreement provides for terms and conditions of employment for those employees to whom it applies. In that case, you are right: it is the paid firefighters. But this whole dispute is about expanding the reach of the enterprise agreement into volunteer arrangements, affecting approximately 60,000 fantastic men and women across Victoria who, as we all know, literally risk their lives to ensure that the community in Victoria is safe, and that reach is being expanded beyond what is contemplated by the Fair Work Act.

                       But, Senator Cameron, if you do not want to listen to anything that I say—and that is fair enough; I do not have an issue with that—perhaps we need to go through again what the former

We all know what happened: when you do not like what a board is saying, you sack it, and that is exactly what the Victorian Labor government did.

                          As I said, Senator Cameron, they are very, very serious statements to make. But what I think I am even more alarmed by is evidence given to the Senate committee that, because of this dispute, a number of volunteer firefighters on the border of Victoria and

                          are now seeking to transfer their membership into New South Wales. Senator Cameron, you may not have concerns with this agreement, and that is fine. If your concerns are therefore not realised, then what we are doing here today will have no impact at all on the enterprise agreement. But the volunteers have raised significant concerns over a number of years now. The letter from the

                           I did ask some serious questions and the minister has gone nowhere near them. I did ask whether she understood that the cross-crewing would not affect volunteers because cross-crewing was about a specific issue in the agreement between the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
                            CFA
                           </a>
                           and employees—it was about an employees issue—and that has no implications for the CFA volunteers. I asked the minister for her view about the peer support clause because it deals with firefighters having their peers—that is, other paid firefighters—dealing with traumatic incidents and giving them peer support. The third question was in relation to uniforms. It is clear that the point firefighters have made is that it was raised at the royal commission into bushfires that there were communication problems and there had to be changes. One of the changes that has been agreed between the CFA and the paid firefighters is that they will be able to identify the training that paid firefighters have. No-one is saying in the agreement that the volunteers have to have the same identification. I am not a trained firefighter but it would seem sensible to me that if you are in a serious situation, an emergency situation, you are able to understand whether your colleague has been trained in breathing apparatus and at what level they have been trained to deal with an issue. I would have thought that was common sense, and that is one of the issues that the royal commission has raised.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           So it is clear that these do matters do not affect firefighters. You can assert that it affects firefighters, which has been happening ever since we have been here, but assertions are not proof. You cannot simply come in and assert that this is the position. The problem is that Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria has made lots of assertions with not a lot of substance. The problem we have here is that we have a government that have not deemed it appropriate to look at the facts of the issue. They have not deemed it appropriate to read the clauses and examine how they operate. They have simply adopted the same position of asserting an expansionary mode for the agreement without any factual evidence.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           Another issue that was raised in the minister's response—which, again, did not go to any of the issues that I asked her to deal with; and I do not suppose we will get many answers tonight—was about the agreement being unlawful in relation to the Equal Opportunity Act. Minister, I am sure you are aware that that issue was dealt with, so maybe I should ask you whether the agreement does breach the Equal Opportunity Act. I am sure you understand that this is not something that can happen under either the Fair Work Act or the state act.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           In your speech, Minister, when you were winding up your second reading debate, you spoke about a hostile union takeover and the handing of control to the
                           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFU" rel="nofollow">
                            UFU
                           </a>
                           . Minister, could you go back to the questions I have asked you and try to address them without rhetoric? Perhaps you could actually address them on the basis of what the meaning of the agreement is, rather than simply assert that it is an expansionary clause when it is nothing of the kind? Could you also take up the issue about the handing of control to the UFU? I would like you to look at the Fair Work Act 2009, section 27, which outlines a number of state laws that are not excluded by section 27 of the act. You would be aware that section 27 excludes a number of state laws and this does not. One of the laws is in 1AB of the Fair Work Act, in section 27: the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 of Victoria. It does not matter what you put in an agreement, you cannot exclude equal opportunity. Minister, I am sure you are aware of that, but you continue to perpetrate the falsehood that equal opportunities will be excluded. You cannot do it. This is fearmongering. It is fearmongering in relation to equal opportunities and it has nothing to do with any hostile union takeover. So to start, Minister, if you do not mind, try to answer the questions I asked and maybe deal with the issue of the Fair Work Act 2009, section 27, and the clear position that, no matter what an enterprise agreement says, it cannot exclude the

                           You are a lawyer, Minister. You know these things, but you come here and you just assert falsehoods about this agreement. You assert issues that are not true. You argue an expansionary proposition when it is not true. So, Minister, how about actually dealing with the issues that are being asked here tonight instead of the rhetoric that you run? How about dealing with the issues of cross-crewing and actually accepting that it is not about volunteers? How about dealing with the issue of peer support and accepting that it is a proper and sensible thing to have in an agreement when firefighters are in such a dangerous occupation with traumatic incidents, some of them on a daily basis? And how about accepting the reality of the uniform proposition—that it is not about telling the volunteers how they would be dressed when they go to fight a fire? It is just not true. The

                           position is just not correct. How about dealing with those four issues, Minister, instead of giving us another rhetorical flourish that just does not go to the questions that we are asking? You have a responsibility to actually deal with the questions and not just take every assertion that has been made by the volunteers or every assertion that has been made by the former chief executive, who had no credibility in her evidence to the inquiry. Actually deal with the issues that are before us.

                            Senator Cameron, I think it is going to be a very long evening. You and I are going to ultimately have to agree to disagree on probably everything that you have just stated. In relation to examples of clauses constraining

                            decision-making, I take you to the majority report of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. Of course, you sat on the inquiry. Attachment 6 at appendix 3 outlines, once again, a number of clauses where concerns are raised.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            I go back to basics. Again, Senator Cameron, you need to look at why the issue has arisen and what a very small amendment will do to ensure the issue is resolved. I go back to: what is an enterprise agreement? An enterprise agreement is an agreement which governs the terms and conditions of employees that are covered by that agreement. There is no dispute in relation to that. The volunteer firefighters have always said that, in relation to the pay and conditions of the paid firefighters, they have no issue at all. There are, however, clauses in the agreement which do seek to expand the reach of the agreement beyond the employees, the paid firefighters, to which the agreement applies, to basically volunteer arrangements, and that of course is beyond what is contemplated by the Fair Work Act.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            What you have here is a state government that is utilising federal legislation to override its obligations under its own state act—the CFA Act. All this amendment does—it is a very simple amendment—is amend the definition of an unlawful term to include an objectionable emergency management term. In relation to the terms in the agreement which the volunteers have concerns with, if they are found by the Fair Work Commission—because it is ultimately the Fair Work Commission that is the umpire in this case—to be objectionable management terms, the Fair Work Commission is unable to approve the agreement whilst those terms remain in the agreement.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                            Senator Cameron, I am happy to go through with you again the clauses that are of concern to the volunteers. As I said, you sat on the committee and you have seen the majority report in relation to examples of clauses constraining CFA decision making. We have gone through the letter to

We would not be here if concerns had not been raised. Even one of your own ministers, Jane Garrett—she is not one of our ministers, one of your own ministers in Victoria, from the left, amazingly—could not condone what was going on. She stood aside.

Then, quite literally, the Andrew's government took action against them. If the agreement only deals with terms and conditions of the employees to which the agreement applies, as I said, the volunteer firefighters have no issue with that. But this is an example of an agreement that is extending the reach of clauses in the agreement to the volunteers, and that is where the issues arise.

                               Minister, senators have asked you tonight some very specific questions, asking you to provide details about what the clauses are that are detrimental to volunteers, and you keep giving the same answer—it is getting quite insulting actually—where you rely on telling us what an enterprise bargaining agreement is. It is just extraordinary that a minister is relying on such a simplistic way to avoid answering the question.

                               You have stated also within this, and Senator Cameron has commented on this and I have said previously that it is deeply insulting—you keep running this line, and are really pushing this wedge. You are the one pushing the wedge that you have some firefighters who are good, implying that there are some firefighters that are not good. That is so deeply damaging. At a time when we need to be rebuilding trust you are further damaging here tonight every time you get up and speak.

                               You are cherry picking quotes from documents where you can pick out pieces that you think back up your argument. Then what we are hearing from you when you get on to talking about the enterprise bargaining agreement is that it is about expanding the reach of the union into volunteer arrangements. And then you give us again that rave that you are just so fond of, making out that volunteers are so much better than the other firefighters. It is so damaging.

                                     I am happy to acknowledge all of the interjections. Minister, there are some very simple, straightforward questions here. The Fair Work Commissioner, Julius Roe, stated in his final recommendations on the
                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EB" rel="nofollow">

                                     A:
                                    </p>
                                    <p class="italic">
                                     The role of volunteers in fighting bushfires and maintaining community safety and delivering high quality services to the public in remote and regional areas and in integrated stations is not altered by this Agreement.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Minister, there it is: 'not altered by this Agreement'. It negates everything you have said. This is from the Fair Work Commissioner, Julius Roe. You, yourself, have just said to us that the Fair Work Commission is' 'the umpire'. So you need to answer this question, because if you cannot acknowledge that Julius Roe has said that it actually negates all the arguments that you have been trying to pull out of a hat by cherry picking quotes from different documents that are barely relevant to the debate that we are having here. If you cannot do that are you really then saying that you know better than a Fair Work Commissioner, or that you disagree with the Fair Work Commissioner—somebody that you have just told us is 'the umpire' in all this?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Also, we need to have some details. You have had questions from different senators tonight asking for clear details about the clauses. It is not good enough just to get up there and rattle off your usual comments. We are in committee. You should be identifying the clauses, quoting the bit that supports your argument and then explaining why it does. But you have failed time and time again. But here are some more opportunities.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     There are these allegations around clothing and equipment. What we do know is that the
                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFU" rel="nofollow">
                                      UFU
                                     </a>
                                     , the union, will be allowed consultation on these issues. There are dispute resolution offices if the parties do not agree. And what we also know is that time and time again benefits won by the UFU flow on to volunteers. So minister, do you acknowledge that is how the current system works? That it works in a cooperative way where you are seeing the benefits flow on—or are you going to still run the hard line that you are running about clothing?
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Then there are these other allegations, that the career and volunteer crews cannot share trucks. Are you really going to continue that dishonest line? Volunteers and paid staff can share trucks. They do share trucks and they will continue to share trucks. We know that. We know that happens.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     Then there is the allegation that paid staff can only report to paid staff. Again, that has been dealt with many times in this debate. Are you still going to run that line? Are you still going to deny the truth that volunteers can continue to be incident controllers, as occurs at present? The agreement clearly allows staff to report to incident controllers who are volunteers. Are you going to continue to deny that? This is where I again remind you, Minister—you have sat in this place long enough; you know what is supposed to happen in the committee stage—that this is the opportunity for senators to question ministers about the details of a bill. That is what you are failing to do.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     And then there is one other area that you need to come in on because you paid a lot of attention to this tonight—that is, this issue of appliances and making out all these supposedly shocking things that the union has done in not allowing various appliances to be used. There is this allegation that no new appliances can be used without UFU approval. But you must know that the truth is that the process for volunteer procurement, including appliances, remains unchanged. That is why I will go back to the quote, because this is where you need to start your answer, Minister. This would be a way of short-circuiting it, if you could be truthful about what the Fair Work Commissioner Julius Roe has said. This is in his final recommendations on the

                                      So, Senator Rhiannon, perhaps before you made the comments that you made tonight, going in to back the United Firefighters Union—as you have every right to do, but at the expense of men and women sitting in the gallery tonight who have, for decades, put their lives on the line for the people of Victoria—you could have been honest and disclosed the relationship the Australian Greens has with Peter Marshall and the United Firefighters Union.

                                      In relation to your comments on Commissioner Roe: throughout May 2016 Fair Work Commissioner Roe, who himself is a former Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union official, conducted a conciliation with the
                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
                                       CFA
                                      </a>
                                      and the union over the proposed enterprise agreement. CFA volunteers tried to be represented at these proceedings so that they could put their concerns on record—one might think that is completely reasonable given the nature of their concerns—however, Commissioner Roe determined that the volunteers did not have sufficient standing to be heard. At the end of these proceedings, Commissioner Roe issued a non-binding recommendation—non-binding, Senator Rhiannon—in which he expressed the view that the proposed agreement would only apply to paid professional firefighters and that it would not apply to volunteer firefighters or affect their role. Again, Senator Rhiannon, I reiterate: this was a non-binding recommendation.
                                     </p>
                                     <p>
                                      You may be aware, Senator Rhiannon, that the former CFA board—they of course were the CFA board that stood up, articulated the concerns that they had with the clauses in the agreement—rejected the recommendation put forward by Commissioner Roe because it had no impact on and did not override the many specific clauses in the agreement that they had concerns with. The clauses that were of concern to the then CFA board, the CFA board that was sacked for articulating its concerns, are still in the agreement being proposed by the CFA—the CFA that is now there at the behest of

                                      , the government's CFA—and the United Firefighters Union, with which, as you know, the Greens have a very, very strong relationship.

                                      You also mentioned, I think, clause 83.4, which went to the uniforms et cetera. Again, the concerns that the volunteers have is that the CFA and the United Firefighters Union must agree on all aspects of the following: at clause 83.4.1, 'articles of clothing'; at clause 83.4.2, 'equipment, including personal protective equipment'; and then it goes on to 'technology', 'station wear' and 'appliances'. Again, the very simple question is: why? Why does the agreement dictate that the CFA, who is responsible for the volunteers, has to come to an agreement with the union in relation to, for example, these items?

                                      Senator Rhiannon, just like Senator Cameron and me, we are going to have to agree to disagree in relation to the impact of these clauses on the agreement. But one thing you said that I will pick up is that you talked about a wedge between the paid firefighters and the volunteer firefighters. The CFA Act in Victoria specifically provides that the volunteer firefighters are supported by the paid firefighters. Senator Rhiannon, I have not come across any volunteer firefighters who have an issue with paid firefighters. I can assure you that no volunteers have an issue with paid firefighters. They have no issues at all about the pay that the firefighters will be getting under the agreement. They want to continue, as they have done for decades, to work alongside the paid firefighters, to work in tandem and in a constructive manner with them. The only people putting a wedge, and a deliberate wedge, between the paid firefighters and the volunteer firefighters are Daniel Andrews, the

You talk about disclosing one's background, but you do not come in here and tell us about your work with Freehills and how you pursued construction unions, which is not a dissimilar approach to what you are showing now. Again, your double standards show time and time again. You cannot get away from that very clear statement from Commissioner Julius Roe in his final recommendations in the

You were giving full backing to the Fair Work Commission until you were caught out with some very clear statements that do not suit your line of argument. It is, again, your inability to answer the question because, if you are answering the question, you are either agreeing with the very clear statements coming from the Fair Work Commission or you are acknowledging that you are wrong, so I guess it is not surprising that you come up with the slippery language. But, to move on, Minister, can you guarantee that no police service and no ambulance service will be affected by this bill?

                                        Senator Rhiannon, I can advise that police forces, ambulance services and hospitals, because hospitals have been raised, are not covered by the amendments and we have, as a government, no intention of covering them. Such bodies do not fall within the meaning of 'designated emergency management bodies' as set out in section 195A(4)(a)(i) of the amended Fair Work Act. Why? It is because they are neither firefighting nor state emergency services bodies. It also needs to be understood, in relation to the question that you have posed, that they would also need a precursor to basically come anywhere near falling within what this change to the Fair Work Act would do. The body that you are referring to would actually need to be covered by the Fair Work Act. The first precondition is the body needs to be covered by the Fair Work Act. The majority of states have not referred their workplace relations powers for the public sector, and, on that basis, they do not apply. As I said, the government has no intention of covering them.

                                         Senator Cash, I do not mean to smear you, but I would prefer to use some facts. You are aware of a 4½-hour briefing that your staff gave to us going through the amendment, line item by line item. Not once though did I hear any of your staff mention the fact that the

                                         . The core issue, as I see it—and I would like your comments on this in a minute—is that the state government have abandoned statutory responsibility and, in the words of the minister in Victoria, they are using the new EA as a vehicle for implementing some of the royal commission's findings and recommendations. That was startling, but it was backed up on 28 September by

                                         , in response to my questions. He reiterated that he sees the failure of the CFA to do its job as necessitating and justifying a 400-page EA that would take over the management of the CFA.

                                         First of all, I would like to know if you are aware of those two statements and claims justifying a 400-page EA taking over the management because the CFA has not been able to fulfil its responsibilities. Secondly, as a manager and executive in a heavy industry—underground coalmining—I am aware that safety depends very much on a very clear chain of command, with well-defined accountability. By bringing the UFU into the management of that chain of command, surely this dilutes the responsibilities and muddies the accountability.

                                          Thank you, Senator Roberts, for those comments and for those questions. Certainly I am aware of the evidence in relation to

                                          and the Victorian state government. I think you hit the nail on the head. What the Victorian state government are doing quite deliberately—and this is the reason we are proposing the amendment to the Fair Work Act—is utilising the Fair Work Act, and in this regard it is the agreement-making power, to circumvent their obligation under their own act, the
                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Fire_Authority" rel="nofollow">

                                          Act, which specifically sets up the

                                          . It is not and never was the intention of the Fair Work Act to allow a state government to deliberately abrogate and undermine its own obligations under a state act. So very much what this amendment does—as you have articulated—is ensure that the state government itself has to comply with its own state legislation. We are very much here today because of what the Victorian government is doing.

                                          In relation to your comments on safety, this is one of the very serious concerns which the volunteer firefighters have been raising for some time now. Again, I go back to the letter that was written by Peter Rau, the

He as the chief officer is required to make strategic decisions to prepare for emergency situations. Anything that compromises that ability—you are right—does have the potential to impact upon safety. So you raise and articulate very clearly a number of the concerns that have been raised by the volunteer firefighters but also by the

                                            Senator Cameron, I cannot comment on what Ms Nolan may or may not have done. I understand she appeared before the Senate committee and I am assuming that you would have had the opportunity to question her in relation to that.
                                           </p>

                                            But one of the issues that has been raised is the ability of the VFBV to provide a submission to the Fair Work Commission. It was not able to in this case. That is why part of what we are doing here today will ensure that going forward volunteer bodies are able to provide submissions in cases like this.

                                             I suppose the issue that this raises is the fundamental position put forward by the government that one of the reasons they needed to have changes to the act was to have the volunteers have access to the commission. I think everyone here knows—most would that have known me for some time—that I have had a long relationship with Commissioner Roe. He was the president of the
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">

                                             , and I was the national secretary. There is no secret to that around the place. But I just want to indicate that Commissioner Roe is highly respected—a highly respected commissioner, both by unions and by employers—and that he has a reputation second to none in the commission.

                                            <p>
                                             What Commissioner Roe was faced with was the
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">

                                             —which basically comprised four volunteers and the board—Ms Nolan, who is supposedly the hero of the volunteers, writing to the commission and saying to the commission: 'Don't allow the volunteers to have a voice'. Now this is a fundamental issue—an absolutely fundamental issue. If Commissioner Roe had been advised by the CFA that they had no objection to the VFBV having a voice, then all the hullabaloo—all the nonsense that we have now—may not have been an issue. Because Commissioner Roe could have determined under the act that the VFBV could have had standing, and accepted that standing, and the fundamental basis of this bill would have fallen apart. But here we are now told that the chief executive of the CFA denied in writing any agreement for the VFBV to have access to the commission. I would ask crossbenchers to think about this carefully, because what you are being asked to do is to put in rights of standing for the VFBV that the hero of the VFBV—the hero of the coalition—Ms Lucinda Nolan, denied them during the dispute. What is going on here? Well, I do know some things that are going on and they are not nice. They are not good.

                                             Minister, you did not answer many of my questions—you have not answered any of them. But in relation to this fundamental point, do you agree that if the CFA had not denied the VFBV standing—well, it was the commissioner that denied standing, but they objected to the standing—and that if the commissioner had provided standing on the basis that the employer had agreed to standing, that could have meant that this bill would have been null and void, and not necessary?

                                              In relation to the question of giving volunteers the right to make submissions, personally, the only question that I would ask is: what is wrong with allowing standing to volunteers to be able to make representations? In terms of this particular case,
                                              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">

                                              volunteers tried to be represented at the Fair Work Commission in May so they could put their concerns on the record. But Commissioner Roe determined that the volunteers did not have sufficient standing to be heard. We need to ensure that volunteer firefighters can have a say and present their views and concerns to the Fair Work Commission about any clauses in an enterprise agreement which could potentially impact on volunteers. As you know, Senator Cameron, volunteers are a significant stakeholder impacted by the CFA agreement. In terms of the figures that we have been talking about earlier this evening, there are around 800 paid firefighters employed by the Victorian CFA and nearly 60,000 volunteers, of which approximately 35,000 are operational firefighters. These amendments will give organisations representing volunteers the right to make submissions to the Fair Work Commission about enterprise agreements covering certain emergency service bodies that could affect the volunteers that they represent.

                                              In terms of what the Fair Work Commission then does, that is a matter for the Fair Work Commission. But certainly, we believe that volunteers should have the right to make submissions. And as I said to you, Senator Cameron, the question I would ask is: what is wrong with allowing them standing?

                                               Thanks; normally in this process the questions are from us to the minister. But given that the minister has steadfastly denied any opportunity to give an answer to any question, let me just tell you what the problems are. Firstly, it removes from the commission an important discretion to hear or not from intervenors, and it limits the capacity of the commission to regulate its own proceedings. That has been a longstanding position that has meant that even the minister herself can have standing, but only in very limited circumstances. That is the first point.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The second point is that it would require the commission and bargaining representatives to address submissions regardless of their merit and proper interest. Now, VFBV might think they have issues they want to take up, but there might be no merit in them. I do not see a lot of merit in a lot of issues they raise. But that is not up to me. That should be up to the commission. That is what the commission has always done. It has always had the right to make sure that it can properly test the merit and the proper interest. That has gone under this proposal—gone.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The third point is that the limitation on the scope of the submissions is illusory in circumstances where the commission and bargaining representatives would need to address and assess any submission, if only for the purpose of determining whether or not the matter before the commission could affect the volunteers. This is going to another aspect of the bill. We have not even reached the bill yet, but we will get there, I promise you. We will get there. But this is one of the issues about 'could affect'. So what the commission will have to do is make a determination: could this affect the volunteers? The minister does not have the right to go and put that proposition to the commission. No-one else has the right to put it to the commission. But the VFBV has under this bill.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Now, I have to say to you that the VFBV do not come here as angels with halos around the heads. They do not come here like that—far from it. The submissions to the inquiry were clearly biased. The submissions to the inquiry were clearly about power and control for the VFBV, so do not think that it is a one-sided argument here. But what the government has done, for political purposes, is look at the numbers—and you hear the numbers all the time—and gone: 'Oh. Sixty thousand volunteers against 800 firefighters. Let's get the votes of 60,000 volunteers.' That is what this was about.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The VFBV do not come here with clean hands. To give them standing when they were in collusion with the old board of the
                                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">

                                               to diminish the union's capacity to bargain on behalf of its members, when they were in collusion with the old board of the CFA to destroy bargaining rights in the CFA—well, do not think that you have a bunch of angels sitting up in the bleachers this evening. All care but no responsibility; all good but no bad. It is not like that. Life is not like that. We know exactly what the VFBV are about. Some of the stuff that the VFBV put out during that election campaign was disgraceful, and it was designed to drive a wedge between the volunteers and the paid firefighters. So that is another reason why we should be very careful about this bill.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               The fourth area is the rights that are being proposed extend to all stages and aspects of the enterprise bargaining process. So the VFBV can come in at any stage of the bargaining and seek intervention before the commission. It provides for a stranger to the bargaining process to intrude in the bargaining between the industrial parties. That does not happen anywhere else in the country. It just does not happen. The argument that it should happen, because they could not get standing, is bizarre, now that we know that the hero of the CFA, Ms Lucinda Nolan, opposed their application for standing before Commissioner Roe. If that had not happened and Ms Nolan had come in and argued that they should have standing, Commissioner Roe, as an honest and unbiased commissioner, may have made a different decision. But now we have bills in front of us based on an argument that the VFBV were denied standing, when we now find out that the CFA were opposed to that standing being given and actually put it in writing. So that is another reason.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               Another reason is that it accords a private association greater rights of submission than is accorded even to the minister or state ministers. So you have this group of volunteers with more rights than a minister of the Crown. Now they might all be up there with little halos above their heads, but we know that is not the reality. But, even if they did, it is not right that they should be given these special privileges available to no-one else in the country—not even the minister.

                                              <p>
                                               The other reason we should not agree with this is that it invites delay, disputation and complexity to the whole enterprise bargaining process. The bargaining representatives are supposed and intended by the act under section 171(a) to be simple, flexible and fair. The act determines that it should be simple, flexible and fair. I put it to the Senate that this is not simple. Even though, again, Minister Cash asserts certain things, it does not make them right. They are not simple; they are not flexible, and they are certainly not fair.

                                               So, this revelation that Ms Lucinda Nolan, in writing, rejected the volunteers' application for standing is quite bizarre, because we have heard the minister tonight almost beatify Ms Nolan. And here we have the proposition that the whole basis of the act, of this bill that is before us, could have been fixed up if Ms Nolan had actually said to the commission, 'We agree, there should be some standing,' and outlined some reasons for the standing. But, no, she argued against that standing.

                                               Minister, you asked me the question. I have given you seven reasons why we should not do that. I can keep going on; I can give you more. I am happy to answer all your questions on this stupidity we have before us—this political bill that is not about looking after Victorians leading up to a firefighting season, and that has nothing to do with getting proper relationships between the volunteers and the paid firefighters. Minister, this is about the coalition's fundamental hatred of the trade union movement. You are prepared to use volunteers and you are prepared to use firefighters, who put their lives on the line when they go out on the job, as punching bags in your hatred for the trade union movement in this country. These are valid reasons why this bill should not go ahead.
                                              </p>
                                              <p>
                                               I hope that any senator who had previously made their mind up about this will now take on board that this could have been resolved simply and easily if the CFA had said, 'We want to do what this bill says should happen, and the VFBV should have its standing in that hearing.' It beggars belief that this is where we are and we have just found this out now. Minister, you asked the questions. There are the answers I am prepared to give you, but I ask you to now address each one of those seven points that I have raised as to why they should not get standing.

                                                Yet again, Senator Cameron, I think I am going to wildly disappoint you when I say that I am going to disagree with basically what you have said. I do think it is disappointing that you resort to smearing people and going off on the tangent of saying that the volunteers and this side of the chamber hate unions, because you know that is not the case. You know that the
                                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">

                                                , and in particular the volunteers, have worked alongside the paid firefighters for decades now. They take no issue at all with the pay that the paid firefighters are going to receive—no issue at all. But they do take issue with the fact that—as they have articulated—there are some clauses in this agreement which would seek to bring the volunteers into the agreement. That is what they take issue with. They do not hate unions at all, but they do not like the fact that under this agreement a union is trying to bring them into this agreement.
                                               </p>

                                                Senator Cameron, you asked the Senate—and I am certainly not going to verbal you, because you would be the first to jump up and tell me that I am—if it is unprecedented to give standing to volunteers in terms of being able to make a submission to the commission. The answer to that question, as I think you know, is no. Given your extensive history of being active within the industrial relations sphere, you would know that any person can seek leave to make submissions to the Fair Work Commission. You would also know that, in addition, the Commonwealth and state and territory ministers can make submissions, as of right, before a full bench of the Fair Work Commission and where it is in the public interest to do so. Therefore, you would also know that the Fair Work Act also enables other third parties to apply to the Fair Work Commission for orders to suspend or to terminate protected industrial action in certain circumstances. What this amendment does is merely an extension of the ability of the Fair Work Commission to hear from a broad range of interested parties.
                                               </p>
                                               <p>
                                                Clearly you do have an issue with volunteers being able to articulate their concerns, but on this side of the chamber we believe that we must give volunteers the ability to make submissions in order to protect volunteers from parties seeking to use the Fair Work Act to limit the management of firefighting and state emergency service organisations. In relation to the claim that basically any volunteer organisation will be able to make a submission and this will just tie up the commission's time et cetera, the bill does not give volunteers an unfettered right to interfere in the employer-employee relationship.

Senator McKenzie has been around long enough to know now that she can sit anywhere she likes in the chamber during the committee process, but if she wants to intervene then she should go to her own seat. That is clearly in the standing orders. I am a bit sick and tired of Senator McKenzie waltzing in here and intervening from a seat that she is not entitled to be in. She should go to her own seat and then she can intervene as much as she likes. It will add to the show.

                                                     As I was saying, the bill provides for a limited right of a body corporate that has a history of representing certain emergency service volunteers to make submissions on matters that are already before the Fair Work Commission and that arise under the enterprise agreement or workplace determination parts of the Fair Work Act, provided the matter affects, or could affect, the volunteers of a designated emergency management body. So, we have been quite specific and drafted a very narrow provision in relation to the ability of volunteers to make submissions.

                                                     The submissions themselves can be made orally or in writing. The conduct of proceedings is obviously governed by the Fair Work Act and is a matter for the Fair Work Commission, and this will not be changed by the bill. Obviously, the weight given to particular submissions is also a matter for the Fair Work Commission.

In terms of those two cases, the limitation prevents the Commonwealth from making laws that restrict or impair the states' capacity to function as governments. The amendments that are proposed by this bill will ensure that federal laws—the Fair Work Act in this case—are not misused to defeat state law obligations, and in this case the particular act is the

It prevents a state government from using a federal law to undermine its own legislation. Thank you for raising that, because there does appear to have been some misunderstanding by some parties in relation to that.

My question to the minister is: given what Professor Stewart says—whether you agree or disagree with him, he is an eminent scholar in this field—how does the government respond to that sort of concern from Professor Stewart? How, does the government say, are the provisions in this bill going to help, rather than hinder, the resolution of this dispute?

The bill provides much-needed clarity for the parties to the agreement and for the Fair Work Commission when it is looking at the agreement. The bill itself makes clear that designated emergency management terms—and, as you would be aware, they are defined terms within the bill—are unlawful terms that cannot be included in an enterprise agreement. The bill also makes clear that a recognised volunteer body has a right to be heard by the Fair Work Commission in relation to agreements that affect it. These clarifications will provide much-needed certainty to help ensure that the agreement is determined as swiftly as possible.

That is separate to what our bill is going to do. Our bill will determine what clauses can be included in an enterprise agreement that is approved under the federal Fair Work Act and ensure that recognised volunteer bodies affected by the bill will be heard on such an agreement. So in terms of our proposal, the government's proposed amendments go directly to the issue.

I want to go to the words of subclause 195A(1)(c) of the bill. The bill sets out what is and what is not an objectionable emergency management term. I would like to clarify one thing from the minister on this definition: in particular, the words in subclause 195A(1)(c) of the bill, which states:
                                                                </p>

                                                                 Can the minister please advise what sort of practical impact will the terms 'recognise', 'value', 'respect' and 'promote' have when deciding whether a term is an objectionable emergency management term? How does the government foresee that this will actually apply in practice? Putting a lawyer's cap on, it seems that this is something that may lead to some litigation. That is not unusual with a new piece of legislation; there is nothing wrong with that in itself, but I am just trying to understand what the government foresees as the scope of the words 'recognise', 'value', 'respect' and 'promote'.

Volunteer bodies that will be able to make submissions under the bill are limited to those that are a body corporate and have a history of representing the volunteers—then you go to the defined term in the act—of a designated emergency management body. In addition, the volunteer body will only be able to make submissions where there is a matter before the Fair Work Commission, a party to that matter has volunteers and the matter on which the volunteer body makes submissions does affect or could affect that volunteer body. The first precondition that needs to be met is that you need to be a body covered by the Fair Work Act and it needs to be an enterprise agreement under the Fair Work Act.

I am assuming you are saying that we would add additional bodies. I am assuming that is what you are going to. As I have made clear—I think it was in response to you or Senator Cameron—the government has no intention of bringing in any other bodies and therefore will not be making any regulations.
                                                                         </p>

But I again go to the fact that the government has no intention of making regulations.

Are you aware that the CFA Act does not provide any veto power to the VFBV and that, in terms of the volunteers, the act at section 6G(b)— the section you are talking about—'requires that the Authority recognise, value, respect and promote the contribution of volunteer officers and members to the well-being and safety of the community'? This is in the Volunteer Charter, and the Volunteer Charter has no legal standing. The Volunteer Charter is simply a statement that has been made within the act but has no standing in terms of legally binding the state government.
                                                                          </p>

I think the Victorian state government were smart enough not to get themselves in a position where they would be legally bound by a volunteer organisation, and you lift aspects of this Volunteer Charter in the act, with no legal standing, and give it legal standing in the Fair Work Act. Why would you do that? What would possess you to actually try to get the commission to be dealing with issues of 'recognise, value, respect and promote'? What guidance is there for a commissioner or even a judge to be able to deal with what is just a feel-good statement, basically, in the Victorian Volunteer Charter? How can you then have any legal binding to this, and what are the legal implications of a commissioner having to try to deal with this? How would a commissioner actually make a decision that an agreement does not 'recognise, value, respect and promote' the contribution of a volunteer officer? How does that work?

In terms of the issue that you have raised, Senator Cameron, you will note that, in the particular clause of the agreement in terms of the definition of an objectionable emergency management term, it refers to a number of preconditions. But, in relation to precondition (c), if you go, in more general terms, to section 6H of the

You are a lawyer, you are a senator, but I am just a humble fitter and machinist who happened to be a union official for some time, and I know that 'have regard' has no power. So what does 'have regard' mean? It has no legal standing. It places no binding legal obligations on the state government. So maybe you can explain why you would say that section 6H is the argument to underpin this bill, because it has got me a bit bemused.

How can it possibly be padded out to 400 pages of terms and conditions of employment when, simply, it really includes managerial responsibilities as the Victorian government and the UFU admit. Isn't the core point here that a lazy state government will not face up to its statutory responsibility and is willing to further weaken this vital service provider by substituting the

In terms of what you are going to, the amendment that we are putting forward sets out what an objectionable management term is and why this will not be able to be in place in an enterprise agreement. It says that an enterprise agreement that covers a designated emergency body cannot include an objectionable emergency management term—that is, a term that has, or is likely to have, the effect of restricting or limiting the body’s ability engage or deploy its volunteers; provide support or equipment to those volunteers; manage its relationship with, or work with, any recognised emergency management body in relation to those volunteers; otherwise manage its operations in relation to those volunteers; or requiring the body to consult, or reach agreement with, any other person or body before taking action for the purposes of any of the above; or requiring or permitting the body to act other than in accordance with a law of a state or territory, so far as the law confers or imposes on the body a power, function or duty that affects or could affect its volunteers.

It goes directly to what Senator Roberts has articulated each time he stands up, and that is very much the managerial responsibility. That is the whole point of these amendments—to ensure that the CFA Act, under which the CFA manages its volunteers, is not compromised by what they are trying to do in utilising the Fair Work Act.

You moved immediately to the bill and just verbatim read parts of the bill, but that is not really answering my question, and that was: where does this agreement undermine the Country Fire Authority Act? The minister in Victoria does not think it does; the chief executive of the Country Fire Authority does not think it does; the chair of the board does not think that is the proposition; and the chief fire officer has said clearly that his powers are not undermined by the agreement. We have a position where the underlying basis of why you want this bill seems to change in every answer. When you were out there with the rhetoric during the election campaign, it was about the safety of Victorians. We have not heard you mention the safety of Victorians once tonight, because you know that the chief fire officer in Victoria has clearly outlined that his powers and his capacity to deal with an emergency situation are not undermined.

I put to you that, in legal terms, the charter is a best endeavours approach. It has no legal binding on the state government. No-one has argued that point to the committee. I have not heard that being argued here tonight, and yet here we have a best endeavours clause, a clause that has no legal binding on the state government. It is being used as an argument to bind the participants in a bargaining process under the Fair Work Act and, in the process of doing that, put certain limitations on the Fair Work Commission in terms of how it can determine, under the current act, the validity or otherwise of an agreement. The government has form in this area. Whenever it wants to try to diminish union bargaining powers in this country, it brings in a bill, loads it up with rhetoric, misrepresents the facts, puts forward a flawed bill and hopes that they con the senators in this place that there is a valid reason for the bill.

It is a big jump to take a statement of commitment and principles and then turn it into a bill and have this place seek to turn that into an act based on the flawed arguments, or the lack of arguments mainly, that we have had tonight from the minister. The minister fully understands the implications of this, because the minister is about continuing the process that has been undertaken by conservative governments for years: to attack workers' rights to collectively bargain. That is what this is fundamentally about. It is not about the volunteers; it is not about people who may be affected by fires. It is about an opportunity taken during an election campaign, when the Prime Minister was flailing around looking for issues, in a weakened position day by day as the election wore on, and moving to the holy old chestnut of union bashing. That is the genesis of this bill. As we are aware, given evidence that came before the inquiry, the

I have not gone to Professor Stewart's arguments yet. I will get there before the end of the night. Minister, how do you expect a commissioner or a court to analyse whether an agreement restricts or limits a body's ability to recognise, value, respect or promote the contribution of its volunteers?
                                                                                         </p>
                                                                                         <p>
                                                                                          How does a commissioner deal with this issue of recognition? These are vague issues that are about commitments and principles. They are not about legally-based law. They are not about a bill. They are not about an act. They are about commitments of principles with no legal binding. And yet, if this bill becomes an act you are about to impose an obligation on an industrial commissioner to actually be able to determine whether a clause in an agreement recognises values and respects and promotes the contribution of volunteer officers. How does a commissioner do that?

They will make their determination after reviewing all of the evidence from the parties, as they would do on any other issue. And given, as you have clearly articulated, the very wide experience of the commissioners, I do not see this as being an issue.

Can you also advise us what your definition of 'terms and conditions' is when you are talking about firefighters? What are 'terms and conditions'? I think you argue, as have the volunteer firefighters and the VFBV argued, that firefighters should have access to wages and conditions. Why can a worker in the manufacturing industry bargain in their agreement for safety gear? Why can cleaners bargain for safety gear in their agreement? Why can workers in the oil industry bargain for equipment to protect their safety, and yet you cannot do it if you are a firefighter? Can you explain that?

In relation to the consultation term, the bill does not prevent enterprise agreements from including a consultation term that is developed to meet the particular needs of an emergency services body. An employer that is covered by the bill and its employees will still be able to bargain about and include appropriately tailored consultation arrangements in their enterprise agreement.

Firstly, could you tell me what the length is of a typical and effective enterprise agreement across Australia? I know that will be a very broad answer. Secondly, could a typical EA be more effective at 20 pages? Thirdly, could it be that more than 20 pages introduces possibly superfluous clauses, and what would 400 pages in an EA indicate?

Streamlining and simplicity normally get us where we need to go. Yet again you have rightly articulated in relation to the agreement that it is page, after page, after page, after page, which has caused serious confusion amongst people.
                                                                                              </p>

The volunteer firefighters have no issue at all in relation to what the paid employees are negotiating—in particular, in relation to their pay. It is when there is overreach of the agreement and it brings in the volunteers and their ability to manage their organisation that the concerns are then raised. Certainly, in relation to streamlining, I would agree with your comments.

The volunteer charter does not affect any of the powers of the chief officer. The proposition that you would bring the volunteer charter or aspects of the volunteer charter into a bill before the federal parliament again is a significant problem, I believe, in terms of the commission being able to understand what it is supposed to do when it is dealing with an objectionable emergency management term. So I do not think you have gone anywhere near answering effectively the concerns that the Senate would have.
                                                                                               </p>

The evidence before the committee was clear that this bill is easily challengeable on constitutional grounds, even though you argue that you have had it checked. That has happened before, and we have seen the outcome of that. Can you advise me: how do you see workers—that is what paid firefighters are, they are workers in the state of Victoria? Why are they being treated differently to other workers around the country, who you have just conceded can bargain in relation to their safety equipment? Why can a firefighter not bargain with their employer? Why can a firefighter not make sure that the equipment that they are using is good equipment, effective equipment and equipment that will not put their lives in danger?

What our bill does is introduce a new objectionable term. It is in relation to the Fair Work Act being used for purposes that it should not be used for. The workers, as you put it—and I assume you mean paid firefighters, because it is the paid firefighters who are obviously covered by the agreement; the employees—can continue to bargain. Nothing is changed by the bill.

In my experience, when I graduated from university I worked for three years as an underground coalface miner so that I could gain some valuable experience. I have worked through to executive levels in the mining industry, and I have also worked in voluntary organisations as a volunteer. It seems to me that whether paid or voluntary, volunteers receive their reward, like paid employees, from diligent and effective service. That is weakened, is it not, and diluted and in places sabotaged by intervention of a third and irrelevant party pushing its own agenda—separate, in this case, from the

They were obviously raised by volunteer after volunteer after volunteer, in particular at the Senate hearings but certainly also over a number of months now in relation to this agreement. You are right, and that is why we have this bill before the Senate. An enterprise agreement should not be able to include terms that undermine the capacity of volunteer emergency service bodies to properly manage their volunteer operations. That is the purpose of this bill.
