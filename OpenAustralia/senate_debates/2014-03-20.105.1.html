        My question is to Senator Ronaldson, representing the Minister for Industry. In June 2013 the European Union applied antidumping duties to solar panels manufactured in China, following the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        's application of similar duties in March last year. Australia has yet to apply any duties to these arguably dumped panels, although an application from Tindo Solar, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , has recently been lodged with the Anti-Dumping Commission. Does the minister acknowledge that Australia is lagging behind other nations in imposing such duties because the commission cannot investigate dumping claims until they have received an application and that the application process can be both lengthy and prohibitively expensive for manufacturers, especially small and medium enterprises? Does the minister also acknowledge that providing additional resources and funding could help shorten the application time and therefore put Australia at the forefront of these matters and protect Australian manufacturing jobs?

Only in exceptional circumstances can the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry initiate an application. I can inform the Senate that currently there is no antidumping investigation regarding solar panels—

                  I will just finish off my previous answer, Senator Xenophon. Following that evaluation, I will refer that to the government and we will consider the options available for making sure

                  In relation to your supplementary question, as you noted, the International Trade Remedies Advisor was established as a pilot project. The AiG is currently funded to continue delivering the pilot project until 30 June 2014. The

                  is currently conducting an evaluation of the pilot process to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of the advisory service. The department is due to report the findings of the evaluation to the Minister for Industry in the near future. As I said earlier, following that evaluation the government will consider the options available for making sure small and medium businesses have appropriate assistance in accessing Australia's antidumping system.

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. I understand that the advisory service is required to provide support both to Australian companies applying for duties and to importers challenging such applications. Will the minister commit to providing additional funding so that the service is not forced to deal with this clear conflict of interest?

                    As I indicated in my last answer, the International Trade Remedies Advisor pilot project is currently being evaluated. After considering the evaluation, the government will announce any appropriate changes to the assistance available to help small and medium businesses access Australia's antidumping system.
