           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Scholes" rel="nofollow">
            Gordon Scholes
           </a>
           AO, a former member of the House of Representatives for the division of Corio, Speaker of the House in the Whitlam government and Minister for Defence and Minister for Territories in the Hawke government; places on record its gratitude for his service to the parliament and the nation; and extends its deepest sympathies to his family in their bereavement.
          </p>
          <p>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hon" rel="nofollow">
            The Hon
           </a>
           . Gordon Scholes AO was a man of many talents and vocations: a train driver, fireman, heavyweight boxing champion, parliamentarian, Speaker, cabinet minister, family man—an impressive list stretching from the railways of Victoria through to the halls of Parliament House and the cabinet table. And, in each of those roles and throughout his entire life, Gordon served his family, his community and his country with distinction.
          </p>
          <p>
           Born on 7 June 1931 to Thomas and Mary Scholes, much of Gordon's childhood was spent following his family as they moved from place to place. Before entering the political arena, Gordon found success in an entirely different arena, though perhaps not so different at all. He was so good at boxing that in 1949 he became the Victorian amateur heavyweight boxing champion. By day he worked as a railwayman for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Railways" rel="nofollow">
            Victorian Railways
           </a>
           from 1949 until 1967 and also served his community as a fireman and fire engine driver from 1955. Clearly, in the early years of his career he took on the two dream jobs of many boys, I'm sure, across Australia at the time—certainly during my childhood across Belgium at the time, train driver and fire engine driver sound like the sorts of jobs that any boy aspires to while growing up.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some might say that politics was an unlikely path for Gordon. As one family member would later note, at the time he married his loving wife, Della Robinson, in late July 1957, life on the federal political circuit seemed a world away. However, having settled in Geelong in the 1950s, Gordon joined the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           in 1955 and went on to serve in a range of positions, including as president of the Labor Party's Geelong branch between 1962 and 1964 and as president of the Geelong Trades Hall college from 1965 to 1966. His foray into formal elected office began in earnest with his election as a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Geelong" rel="nofollow">
            City of Geelong
           </a>
           councillor in 1965, a post that he held until the year of his election to the federal parliament.
          </p>
          <p>
           Gordon was at first unsuccessful when contesting the seat of Corio. However, when long-time Liberal incumbent, Sir Hubert Opperman
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBE" rel="nofollow">
            OBE
           </a>
           , retired from politics a year or so later, Gordon recontested the seat, this time successfully, in the July 1967 by-election. He would go on to retain the seat at 10 subsequent elections—sometimes comfortably, at other times decidedly less so, including by a razor-thin but still winning margin of just 20 votes after the December 1975 election.
          </p>
          <p>
           In his first speech, Gordon showed a keen interest in policy, touching on issues that ranged from defence industry to social services. Commendably, he spoke passionately in favour of the needs of Australia's First World War veterans, many of whom were reaching the end of their lives at the time he entered the parliament. He also displayed his keen local focus, advocating for rail infrastructure that would benefit his local electorate. It is a credit to the person and the good character of Gordon Scholes that he also took the time in his first speech to acknowledge his predecessor, commending his many years of service, just as he set about his own work for the people of Corio. Appointed as Deputy Speaker in February 1973, he served diligently in that role and was thrust quite literally into the hot seat during one of the most tumultuous periods in our nation's political history, becoming
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives" rel="nofollow">
            Speaker of the House of Representatives
           </a>
           in February 1975 and remaining in that role until the defeat of the Whitlam government.
          </p>
          <p>
           Notably, he did not allow those turbulent years in Canberra to distract him from his local community. He played a key role in establishing
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deakin_University" rel="nofollow">
            Deakin University
           </a>
           in 1974, an achievement that many point to as one of his most significant contributions to the city. As well as serving initially as Manager of Opposition Business in the House, Gordon became Labor's defence spokesperson during the ensuing opposition years and took on a vast portfolio faced with significant technological and political transitions in the years following the end of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
            Vietnam War
           </a>
           . Ever locally minded, he was also acutely aware that the government's aircraft factories, which had played an important role in the nation's defence industry until that point, were nestled within his own electorate.
          </p>
          <p>
           When Labor next formed government under then Prime Minister Bob Hawke, he retained his portfolio and ascended to what would be his most significant job in government, serving as Minister for Defence from the Hawke government's election in 1983 through to December 1984. At the time
           <i>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Canberra_Times" rel="nofollow">
             The Canberra Times
            </a>
           </i>
           involved his sporting past with a clever 1983 headline declaring 'Ex-boxer retains his sure-footedness in a tricky portfolio'.
          </p>
          <p>
           Gordon also served as minister leading the newly formed Department of Territories, remaining in that role until he departed the ministry in July 1987. In the years that followed he remained active within the walls of parliament and outside them, working diligently for his constituents and serving as
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Chairman" rel="nofollow">
            Deputy Chairman
           </a>
           of Committees from May 1990 through to his retirement. Choosing to retire just prior to the 1993 federal election, Gordon's final speech, made a quarter of a century after his first, made clear that over 25 years of Canberra life had not dimmed his earthy and practical approach to politics. The same man who began his parliamentary career with a focus on policy and pragmatism ended it in the same way, calling on the parliament of the day to better meet the expectations of the public and more effectively serve a changing Australia. Having been appointed as an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Officer of the Order of Australia
           </a>
           in 1993 in recognition of his lengthy service to the Australian community, he was honoured further, a decade after his retirement, with the receipt of a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_Medal" rel="nofollow">
            Centenary Medal
           </a>
           in 2003. A keen stamp-collector in his later years, he was also appointed as an honorary member of the Geelong Philatelic Society.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ultimately, it was Gordon's family that was his rock through it all. Though politics may not have been on the horizon at the time of their marriage, Gordon's wife, Dell, was a constant source of support through his parliamentary career and the 55 years of marriage that they shared before her passing. Indeed, in his valedictory speech he noted just how essential his family's support had been and expressed a depth of gratitude that I'm sure many of us in this chamber would sincerely empathise with.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is to Gordon's two daughters, Kerry and Anne, and his two grandchildren, Monica and Jed, that on behalf of the Australian government and the Australian Senate I extend my sincerest condolences on the passing of a good and humble man whose service to this parliament and our nation, shaped and coloured by a busy life well lived, will not be forgotten.

            , who passed away in December 2018 at the age of 87. At the outset, I convey the opposition's condolences to relatives and friends of Mr Scholes. I particularly acknowledge in the gallery his daughters, Anne and Kerry, who have travelled to be with us here today—proud daughters of a great Labor man and a wonderful Labor parliamentarian.

             Gordon Scholes
            </a>
            served for 2½ decades in the Australian parliament, a period which coincided with a period of enormous economic and social change, and in many ways he came to symbolise that transition. Like
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Chifley" rel="nofollow">
             Ben Chifley
            </a>
            , he entered the parliament after a career driving trains and left the parliament having held some of the highest offices in the land. Gordon Scholes was the member for Corio in the House of Representatives from 1967 until his retirement in February 1993. Although he had contested the seat against the renowned cyclist Sir Hubert Opperman in 1966, he didn't win the seat until Oppy, as he was known, was appointed as the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
             High Commissioner
            </a>
            to Malta in early 1967. His campaign was strongly supported by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
             Gough Whitlam
            </a>
            , and the win by Mr Scholes on the back of a swing of more than 11 per cent was seen by many as the beginning of the way back for Labor after the disastrous split.
           </p>
           <p>
            From his election until his retirement, his principle policy focus was the welfare of working-class people, who had to battle to sustain a reasonable standard of living, and this was evident in his first speech. Unlike the contemporary practice, where first speeches are often replete with noble sentiment and high aspiration, first speeches at that time addressed the more practical legislative issues of the day, yet Mr Scholes found a place in his speech on the 1967 budget—delivered, of course, in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
             Old Parliament House
            </a>
            —to advance his view that a primary role of the parliament was to legislate the social services that protect the nation's standard of living and to restore the economic and political liberties of the nation's
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Peoples" rel="nofollow">
             First Peoples
            </a>
            . He was an early advocate Aboriginal rights. In his final speech—delivered in this house—Gordon Scholes again addressed the need for parliament to improve the processes that enable it to deliver on its primary function, legislation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gordon Scholes became
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives" rel="nofollow">
             Speaker of the House of Representatives
            </a>
            in February 1975, guiding the House through the tumultuous events of November 1975 and standing down from the position in February 1976. He was also Minister for Defence in the first Hawke ministry from March 1983 until December 1984 and Minister for Territories until 1987. It was from that office that he laid the building blocks of self-government for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Capital Territory
            </a>
            . A man of integrity, humanity and humility, Mr Scholes filled each of these roles with a quiet, purposeful dignity, and although he had left the federal parliamentary Labor Party caucus almost a decade before I took my place in the Senate, his reputation was his legacy, and I am proud, as are others on this side, to belong to a great Labor tradition of which he was such a loyal and hardworking member.
           </p>
           <p>
            Gordon Scholes was born into the

             Great Depression
            </a>
            , the global economic disaster that affected virtually every family in this country, and his family was no exception. His father, grandfather and great-grandfather all worked for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Railways" rel="nofollow">
             Victorian Railways
            </a>
            : his father as a ganger and his antecedents as station masters. Being a ganger meant his father was always on the move, and this led to Mr Scholes spending long periods of his childhood living with uncles, aunts and other family members. His disrupted family life and uneven educational opportunities meant that by the end of 1939 he had undergone little more than two years education but at five different schools. He then attended a number of Catholic schools, including St Ambrose's in Brunswick, which had the distinction of including

            By the time he had finished school at age 15 he had attended some 16 schools, but he wasn't awarded the merit certificate, as it was then called, on the completion of grade 8 because he had not attended each of the previous two years continuously. He had spent several months in the children's hospital in Melbourne. Mr Scholes was determined that the same disruption would not affect his own family. He and his wife, Dell, worked together to ensure that their daughters, Kerry and Anne, enjoyed the stability, the lack of which he lamented.

            After a short stint at the Daylesford Technical High School, he took his first job at the woollen mills. And his final exposure to the education system formally was the Ballarat School of Mines in 1948, where he did a night course in fitting and turning. But the railways were in his blood. It wasn't long before he joined the Victorian Railways to become, first of all, a locomotive fireman, shovelling some 40 tonnes of coal into the steam locomotives between Melbourne and Wodonga and finally earning his drivers ticket to achieve his childhood ambition to stand on the footplate as the driver of the

            . He had been active in the AFULE, the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Employees, the world's oldest railway union, founded in 1861. Moving to Geelong in the late 1950s, he joined the local branch and then, as an AFULE member, became a delegate to the Geelong Trades Hall Council. He was vice-president from 1964 and President from 1965 to 1967.

            His path to federal politics began in the early 1960s with a local issue—the survival of a kindergarten. Even though they hadn't funded it, the local council, controlled by the conservatives, at the time decided to close it down anyway. They ignored the pleas of the local community, but they hadn't reckoned with Gordon Scholes. They reversed their decision, he was elected to council and, two years later to the day, he was elected as the federal member for Corio.

            The parliamentary career of Gordon Scholes was one of dogged determination; a determination to represent his electors and to anchor, to the best of his ability, a stable and progressive Labor government. That became increasingly trickier as 1975 unfolded, though his steady hand on the tiller of the Speakership certainly protected the dignity and proper functioning of the House of Representatives. The terrible events of 11 November 1975 have been recorded many times and I don't propose to rehearse them today; suffice to say Mr Scholes could never bring himself to forgive the profound discourtesy shown by the then Governor-General,

            , to the parliament. Kerr pointedly refused to meet the Speaker when Mr Scholes called on him to inform him that the person whom he had appointed behind the back of the elected Prime Minister had lost the confidence of the House and, hence, had no right to advise an election. He was kept waiting for over an hour, during which time the writs were issued.

            In the first Hawke government, Mr Scholes was a diligent and hardworking minister, serious to the point of diffidence. His proudest achievement, in many ways, was to have persuaded Whitlam to establish

            or Swinburne. I also am advised that, in his life after politics, he was an avid stamp collector and a recognised expert on what are known as 'Australian colonial covers' and what are known as 'half lengths', which those who have his interest and knowledge of the philatelic world will know is impressive. It's a kind of historical echo which, in his understated way, Mr Scholes particularly enjoyed. Following his retirement, he remained active in our party, mentoring a number of aspiring politicians at both the state and the federal level. Of course, he was a devoted family man, showering his family with the love, affection and stability that may have been absent for some of his own peripatetic childhood.

            Gordon Scholes was an honourable man. He had an abiding care for people, especially those who were down on their luck. He knew what hardship was like and he worked tirelessly for the betterment of working people and their families.

            summed up his career succinctly when he said, on the last sitting day of 1992, that Mr Scholes had acquitted himself 'with great dignity, thoughtfully and carefully'. Dignity, thoughtfulness and care make a fine epitaph for a fine man. I again express our sympathy to his family and friends.
