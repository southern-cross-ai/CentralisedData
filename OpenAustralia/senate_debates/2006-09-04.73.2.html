       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Regulations should be enacted as soon as possible to require persons applying to enrol or change their enrolment details, to verify their identity and address to the AEC by:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         showing or producing an acceptable identification document and a proof of address document to the AEC or a person who can attest a claim for enrolment; or
        </li>
        <li>
         where such proof of identity documents cannot be provided, by supplying written references given by any two persons on the electoral roll who can confirm the enrolee’s identity and by supplying a proof of address document:
        </li>
        <li>
         persons supplying references must have known the enrolee for at least one month and must show their own acceptable identification document or supply their drivers licence numbers to the AEC; and

        <li>
         enrolees should have the choice of providing the required documents in person to the AEC, or a person who can attest a claim for enrolment, or by posting or faxing the required documents or certified copies to the AEC with the enrolment form to which they relate; and
        </li>
        <li>
         where certified copies of acceptable documents are posted or faxed to the AEC, they must be certified by the enrolee to be true copies and witnessed by an elector enrolled on the electoral roll.

         Royal Assent

       <p class="italic">
        The proof of identification requirement for electoral enrolment will be such that persons enrolling to vote or updating their enrolment must provide either:

        Response

       <p class="italic">
        Supported in part. The Electoral Integrity Act provides for the rolls to close at 8.00 pm on the day the writs are issued for new enrolments and re-enrolments. However, there will be two exceptions to this:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         17 year olds who are not on the roll and who will turn 18 between the day the writ is issued and polling day; and
        </li>
        <li>
         persons who are not on the roll and will be granted citizenship between the issue of the writ and polling day.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        For these two groups, the date for the close of rolls will be 8.00 pm three working days after the issue of the writ.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Persons who are currently enrolled will be able to update their details during the three day period. Persons who are not on the roll will not be added to the roll between 8.00 pm on the day of the issue of the writ and polling day.

        The Committee recommends:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Section 155 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act should be amended to provide for the date and time of the closing of the rolls as soon as possible within the life of the 41st Parliament;

        </li>
        <li>

       <p class="italic">
        Supported. The Electoral Integrity Act provides for the amendment of section 155 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 (Commonwealth Electoral Act).
