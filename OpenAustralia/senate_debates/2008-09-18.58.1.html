        My question is to Senator Conroy, representing the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        . Is the minister considering the master plan for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_International_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Canberra International Airport
        </a>
        , including the proposal that it be a second Sydney airport and a national freight hub with 24-hour operations? I ask the minister: will he guarantee the people of Canberra and adjacent areas a good night’s sleep by ensuring there will be a curfew at Canberra airport from 11 pm to 6 am, as there is in Sydney and indeed in Essendon and Adelaide?

         thank Senator Brown for that question and also thank him, as it is not my direct portfolio, for advising the minister’s office. The response that we have received is that the government recognises concerns about the negative effects of aircraft noise and its impacts on everyday life. The government supports appropriate measures to minimise the impact of aircraft noise on communities. At present there are established noise abatement zones in the geographical areas surrounding Canberra airport. The zones have been established for a number of years and the government does not currently have plans to change the existing arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand details of these zones are publicly available on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Airservices Australia
         </a>
         ’s website, and I would note that with current traffic and noise levels the government believes there is not sufficient evidence to support calls for a curfew being imposed at Canberra airport. Consideration of any future curfews for all federally leased airports will take place through the current work on the national aviation policy statement. Of course, the government is considering global best practice aircraft noise mitigation initiatives in the development of this statement.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that and I ask: in the reverse of that answer, is the government considering a master plan for Canberra airport to be a national freight hub operating 24 hours a day? When will the government make its decision on that proposal?

           Thank you again, Senator Brown. This is all the information that I have from the minister at this stage. I am happy to come back to you as quickly as is possible with any further information to assist you with your supplementary question.
