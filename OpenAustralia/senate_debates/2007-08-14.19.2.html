          Mr President

         , may I, as the first government senator to speak during question time, also congratulate you. We are in fact, of course, very pleased to have you in the chair. Thank you to Senator Forshaw for the question, which is a very important one and relates to uranium exports. The government will consider whether to enter into negotiations with, in particular, India on a bilateral safeguards agreement which would enable uranium exports to India. We would only supply uranium if effective, legally binding safeguards were in place, pursuant to a safeguards agreement with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">
          International Atomic Energy Agency
         </a>
         and a bilateral safeguards agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia welcomes the conclusion of the United States-India negotiations on the text of a bilateral civil nuclear agreement. That will enable India to be brought more fully into the nonproliferation mainstream through the separation of its civil and military nuclear facilities and the expanded application of the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. The government has a very strong record of demonstrated achievement on nuclear nonproliferation. Dr Switkowski, in his recent report, states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia has the most stringent requirements for the supply of uranium ...
        </p>
        <p>
         He also states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         An increase in the volume of Australian uranium exports would not increase the risk of proliferation of nuclear weapons.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia played a very prominent role in negotiating the additional protocol on strengthened
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAEA" rel="nofollow">
          IAEA

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WMD" rel="nofollow">
          WMD
         </a>
         related trade, as an active participant in the proliferation security initiative. Australia has worked for effective
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNSC" rel="nofollow">
          UNSC
         </a>
         resolutions on the Iran nuclear programs, and has fully implemented resulting sanctions. From 2005 to July this year, there have been coordinated international efforts to promote entry into force of the comprehensive test ban treaty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has been at the forefront of efforts to push for negotiation of a fissile material cut-off treaty to ban production of fissile material for nuclear weapons. Australia is also working to strengthen controls on the spread of sensitive nuclear technologies, including through the active membership of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_Suppliers_Group" rel="nofollow">
          Nuclear Suppliers Group
         </a>
         . Australia is continuing its close engagement with regional countries on nuclear and other WMD counterproliferation issues. Australia is also the founding partner of the Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism. When you look at the efforts and the initiatives that Australia has taken, I do not think it could be sensibly said that Australia has not adopted very strong policies to halt the spread of nuclear weapons and to strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation regime.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I note that at no stage did the minister actually address herself to the fundamental question, which was: would the government continue to oppose uranium sales? The supplementary question I have is: does the minister agree that any sale of uranium to India while it continues to refuse to sign the nonproliferation treaty will fundamentally undermine the effectiveness of the treaty?

           No, I do not agree with that. As I was saying in the earlier part of my answer, in relation to potential uranium exports to India, India will be brought more fully into the nonproliferation mainstream through the separation of its civil and military nuclear facilities and the expanded application of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Atomic_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           safeguards. India will be in a greater position to increase its use of nuclear power to pursue economic development and assist in the fight against global climate change. The strengthening, as we know is the case, of the relationship between the United States in India ultimately assists us. It is likely that Australia would support a
