        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to last week's MYEFO, rushed in immediately ahead of advice that the minerals resource rent tax would deliver zero revenue to government coffers in its first three months of operation. Will the minister advise the Senate who in the business community was consulted by the government when deciding to change company tax payments from quarterly to monthly from January 2014 and on what basis the minister and the Treasurer concluded that such a change would not result in an added financial burden for affected companies?

         I thought I had answered this question previously, but that may not be the case. This was a budget decision. I have made clear that obviously, as a budget decision, it was not the subject of consultation prior to its announcement. What we have done is ensure that the implementation is staged. My recollection—I do not have the MYEFO document here—is that we will stage it in tranches depending on the turnover, for large businesses from memory from January 2014, as there is an annual staging of entry into the new system depending on company turnover. So I make two points to the senator: no additional tax is being levied. And, if I may make a political point, the only people who are advocating a company tax increase are those opposite with the levy that is proposed by Mr Abbott to be imposed on companies. The point is that there is no additional taxation levied; it is simply a change in the timing of remittance of that taxation. There are obviously implementation issues which will need to be resolved and worked through with the business community, which is why the government has put in place a lengthy lead time for the consultation process.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, did the government or its Treasury officials consult with members of its business tax reform group on this proposal, given that the group was already in place and actively working with the government on tax reform? If they were not consulted, why were they not consulted?

           I have already indicated that this was a budget decision. That decision was made, as most budget decisions are—and some of my colleagues may confirm this—on the basis that they are announced on the day of the budget or of the budget update. I can get further information on the Business Tax Working Group process. But, as you know, that was dealing with a different issue. Despite the shadow Treasurer's attempts for a few days to say otherwise—I think he has now backed off because he realised it was unreasonable—despite the fact that there was an assertion that this meant more tax, it is not the case; it is simply a change in the way the tax is paid. Again, it is the Liberal Party—

              , I ask a further supplementary question. I thank the minister for the explanation that the tax group was not consulted. Minister, is it any wonder that the business and indeed the wider community now have lost total confidence in this government when, as you say, it failed to consult its own business tax reform group on such an important change in tax collection procedures while at the same time it set ground rules to ensure it was bound to fail on measures to negotiate reduced company taxes in Australia?

                  . Those opposite are now up in arms about the fact that there is a monthly instalment when in fact that was the design of the tax which they were very proud to have introduced. There are a number of

                  countries which make instalments on a monthly basis. Those are set out in the MYEFO. We have a three-year process of reform to implement this measure. There will be many consultations throughout that time.
