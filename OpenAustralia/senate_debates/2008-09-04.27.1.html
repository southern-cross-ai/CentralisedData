        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present report no. 93 of the committee, treaties tabled on 12 March and 14 May 2008, and move:

       <p class="moved">

        of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as

         CITES
        </a>
        , provides for international cooperation to protect and conserve species of fauna and flora from over-exploitation due to international trade.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        considered amendments to Appendices I and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        of CITES, which will alter the level of control imposed upon trade in a number of species that are either endangered or at risk of becoming endangered. The Committee was particularly interested in the implications of these amendments for Australian sawfish species, which are now afforded protection under this Convention for the first time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee has raised a number of concerns in its report about the process adopted in relation to the listing of this species. In particular, the Committee has recommended that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        review its policies relating to the assessment of applications to trade in CITES listed species to provide for a more formalised process of independent scientific assessment and a greater degree of public consultation. It has also recommended that policies relating to the composition of Australian delegations to CITES negotiations be reconsidered to minimise conflicts of interest. We have done so because the Committee is concerned about the inclusion of parties with an obvious commercial interest in the outcome of negotiations on an Australian delegation. In the case of Cairns Marine, it has given rise to perceptions of conflict of interest, and the Committee would like the Government to have a look at this issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee is particularly concerned that trade in a critically endangered species internationally is permitted at all and has recommended ongoing monitoring and assessment of the impact of trade in freshwater sawfish by the Australian Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The International Tropical Timber Agreement 2006 succeeds similar agreements dating back to 1983. Its objective is to promote the expansion and diversification of international trade in tropical timber from sustainably managed and legally harvested forests. Sixty countries are members of the International Tropical Timber Organisation, established by the agreement, representing around 80 percent of the world’s tropical timbers and 90 percent of the global timber trade.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This agreement is consistent with Australia’s sustainable forest management and overseas aid objectives, including the reduction of illegal logging, mitigation of and adaptation to climate change and assisting developing countries to reduce poverty and achieve sustainable development. While the Committee recognises the importance of international cooperation to promote sustainable management and address illegal logging, it does question the extent to which this agreement will actually contribute to reducing the devastating deforestation occurring in some countries.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The world’s tropical rainforests are under great pressure. Clearing and logging, substantial parts of it illegal or unsupervised, are causing substantial losses to our rainforests, at the very time when the emerging science about global warming tells us we need them most. We need to protect our rainforests, which are the lungs of the plants. They are essential carbon sinks, they attract rain and keep our planet cool and moist, and they provide essential habitat for countless species of birds, plants, animals and other wildlife. Given their environmental significance, the Committee has recommended that the consultation process undertaken for any future agreement on sustainable trade in tropical timber specifically includes consultation with environmental groups.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Protocol Amending the Agreement between Australia and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         South Africa
        </a>
        for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with respect to taxes on income will alter Australia’s existing agreement with South Africa to meet Australia’s most favoured nation obligations with South Africa, promote closer economic cooperation between the two countries, and upgrade the framework through which the tax administrations of Australia and South Africa can prevent international fiscal evasion. The amendments are expected to reduce barriers to bilateral trade and investment. Reduced withholding tax rates on dividends, interest and royalties will also provide benefits to Australian businesses obtaining business loans and intellectual property from South Africa.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee also considered a Category 3 treaty, Amendment to the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk. Category 3 treaties are identifiably minor treaty actions, which do not impact significantly upon the national interest. The Committee resolved not to hold a formal inquiry in relation to this treaty.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee supports all four agreements and has recommended that binding treaty action be taken.
