           As the opposition knows, the government is working through a cabinet process in relation to the Voice referendum, including in relation to the wording for the proposed constitutional alteration. The Referendum Working Group is providing the cabinet with advice as part of that process, and so is the Solicitor-General. Consistent with the longstanding practice followed by all governments, cabinet deliberations should be able to be conducted in secrecy so as to preserve the freedom of deliberation of that body. It would harm the public interest to undermine the confidentiality of the cabinet process by producing the document sought by Senator Cash or by producing legal advice.

            The question is that general business notice of motion No. 189, standing in the name of Senator Cash, be agreed to.
