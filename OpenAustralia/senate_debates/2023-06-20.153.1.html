       <p>
        This parliamentary amendment removes schedule 7 of the bill. Schedule 7 proposed to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to update the list of specifically listed deductible gift recipients. In order to ensure expedited passage of the measure to update the list of specifically listed deductible gift recipients, schedule 7 to the bill was reintroduced as schedule 1 to the Treasury Laws Amendment (2022 Measures No. 5) Bill 2022. As a result, schedule 7 no longer needs to be progressed as part of this bill.

               I move opposition amendment (1) on sheets 1858:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               (1) Schedule 2, page 32 (line 1) to page 35 (line 23), to be opposed.
              </p>
              <p>
               As I foreshadowed in my contribution to the second reading debate, this amendment excises the section which deals with the taxation treatment of digital currencies. It does that on the basis that there is a separate process underway through the Board of Taxation and this would introduce unnecessary regulatory risk in a very sensitive area. It will also do it on the basis that it won't be removing any consumer protections or, indeed, driving any new innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Of course, the Treasury itself could not even explain whether there would be a quantifiable gain or loss to revenue. So I think it's a reasonable amendment for the Senate to consider in light of the evidence from industry that this is not a concept that they support at this point in time because it has been cherrypicked out of a broader reform agenda which should be, frankly, a higher priority for the government, because I think all of us want the government to be promoting new investment, new ideas and new competition, and we also want our governments to be protecting consumers as far as possible. So we think it's an appropriate and proportionate amendment to this bill, on the basis that we'll come back and provide a set of regulations and laws for digital assets as part of a comprehensive agenda rather than something that's being cherrypicked out of nowhere.

                  We will be opposing this. Schedule 2 will provide taxpayers with clarity following El Salvador's decision to adopt bitcoin as legal tender from September 2021, which created uncertainty about the tax status of bitcoin in Australia. Schedule 2 should not be removed. It seeks to maintain the status quo in the taxation of transactions involving digital currency. Repealing schedule 2 would pose a revenue risk, as ongoing uncertainty could see taxpayers in similar situations adopting different tax treatments, with some deliberately choosing the most favourable interpretation.

                   This is one of those ones where I have to put the question in the affirmative. Even though the government are opposing what Senator Bragg wants, they will be voting yes and the opposition are voting no.

                     Because the measure is to keep the tax treatment the same, it is difficult to cost. I think we did go through this at estimates, so there is no update to what was coveredâ€”or it might have been another committee, but it's certainly been discussed.

                      The point here, then, is that this measure is designed to be an integrity measure, but the Treasury have no idea what revenue is at stake here. Is that right?

                       Senator Bragg is right about it being an integrity measure, so that is the point of this amendment. I am advised that that decision by El Salvador has created uncertainty about the tax status of bitcoin in Australia and specifically whether it can be considered a foreign currency for tax purposes. This uncertainty could affect a large number of taxpayers. Over one million Australians are expected to report on crypto assets in their 2022-23 tax returns, and bitcoin is the most popular crypto asset in Australia.

                         The digital currency space is constantly evolving. We are confident that the legislation is broad enough to capture the digital currency it needs to. However, having a regulation-making power allows us to quickly deal with unforeseen circumstancesâ€”for example, if a country adopts digital currency that may not be captured by the proposed definition. The policy for the legislation is clear: digital currencies are not foreign currency for tax purposes.

                               Yes, sure. My understanding, and I'll be corrected if I'm wrong, is that we believe the legislation is broad enough to capture the digital currency it needs. However, in the event that there is a similar situation to the one that has arisen, which has led to this amendment, then the regulation power would allow us to deal with that. It is, in a sense, an unforeseen circumstance that is yet to occur.

                                  The government will be opposing this. The amendment would remove the requirement that training must be delivered by a registered provider to be eligible for the bonus deduction, and small business could claim a 20 per cent bonus deduction for expenditure on training delivered by a non-registered provider up to a maximum bonus deduction. The bonus deduction for expenditure on training delivered by registered training providers would remain uncapped. The Skills and Training Boost introduces the bonus 20 per cent tax deduction to support small business with annual turnover of less than $50 million to train and upskill employees using registered training providers. The registration requirement is an important safeguard that supports the quality and integrity of the training provider. It ensures that training that is eligible for the Skills and Training Boost is delivered by providers that are regulated and meet rigorous government standards. This approach is consistent with that proposed by the former government.

                                     4, before the Senate. I would like to talk about the amount of time that small business will have to make use of the Skills and Training Boost and the Technology Investment Boost. These are great measures for small businesses to help them digitise to drive genuine productivity among small businesses, but they have two weeks to make use of this funding. We're told that it will be backdated to March and small businesses can keep their receipts and claim it, but every small business we in my office have talked to has had no idea about this scheme. It seems that it won't have much effect, and, potentially, the only people to benefit from this will be the government's bottom line, given that there was money budgeted for it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     This amendment seeks to ensure that small businesses do have a year to digitise and claim some of that back on tax. This is incredibly important for our small businesses who are seeking to become more efficient, to increase productivity, and indeed we hear a lot about productivity from both sides of politics at the moment. I thank the former government for their work on this, targeting small businesses and ensuring that they are being supported in digitising and getting their systems up to speed. We know that a lot of small businesses are still doing it tough coming out of COVID. They are under pressure, so this amendment seeks to ensure that they do have 12 months to be able to use this measure.
                                    </p>

                                     Minister, I understand that the original cost of this measure was $1 billion. However, I had it recosted by the Parliamentary Budget Office, and the revised costing came in at $600 million. I'm wondering whether the government has recosted this measure over the course of the financial year.

                                      My understanding is it hasn't been recosted. I think your question is about whether the existing measure has been recosted, and I think the answer to that is no.

                                        ator GALLAGHER (â€”) (): In answer to your question, the government will not be supporting it. I think it is important to acknowledge that the Technology Investment Boost as it stands is backdated to 29 March 2022, which does mean that any eligible expenditure from that date will count when tax returns are lodged from 1 July. There are a range of other small-business measures acknowledging the importance of small business across our economy, which have been introduced in the latest budget, including the Small Business Energy Incentive, cash flow through the $20,000 instant asset write-off, the Cyber Wardens program and an industry growth plan that will help small businesses to innovate, adopt, and adapt to digital technology specifically, and that is in the order of $393.4 million in addition to this measure.

                                         POCOCK () (): Given that I haven't been able to find a small business in Canberra that has been aware of this measure, I was wondering if the government had created a strategy to actually inform small businesses of it. Given that most small-business owners are flat out at the best of times, was there a strategy developed? Which stakeholders were engaged in that strategy to actually inform small businesses that there was this incentive to drive productivity?

                                           Minister, how is it driving productivity to give small businesses two weeks of this being validâ€”being passed by parliamentâ€”and then saying, 'It's backdated to March, so, if you did happen to spend something, you can claim it back'? You're simply rewarding people who have done something, rather than actually incentivising small businesses to digitise and to spend money on things like cybersecurity.

                                            I've gone through the additional measures that we have put in place, and I would say that this was a measure that we picked up from the former government in their March budget of, I think, last year. At the time that this was reintroduced post the commencement of this parliament, we didn't have the support to get

Ideally this bill would have passed the parliament earlier than now, but the reality is that most businesses, when they're doing their taxâ€”and most businesses I deal withâ€”are used to dealing with, essentially, claiming for expenditure that has occurred over the previous financial year. I don't think that is unusual. But I am not stepping away from the fact that, ideally, this measure would have passed through the TLAB earlier if we'd had the support.

We are always looking at what happens in specific programs and how we can support small business. That's the work that Minister Collins does. She will continue to do that and to consult with small business, which is why we have the instant asset write-off, the industry growth plan about digital technology, the Cyber Wardens programâ€”again, at the request of COSBOAâ€”and the small business energy incentives. These are all measures that have been sought, and argued for, by small business.

                                               Just to follow-up on that, Senator, there is a $400 million saving here that the government will probably pick up due to the way that this has come through parliament. Can the government commit to actually investing that in small businesses and ensuring that we are driving productivity? We've seen the

                                                I'm not sure where your $400 million of savings comes from. We won't know the impact of this measure until all those tax returns are put through, because it's essentially revenue forgone. It's not a funded budget measure in the sense of appropriating cash for it. You've got a costing from the

                                                . I haven't seen it, but I don't think there's any understanding or expectation that there is a $400 million underspend. We won't know that for some time. And I remind senators that those other measures that we have put in place are designed for small business and are implemented through this budget as well, in addition to this measure. This is over and above.

                                                 at $600 million. You've said $650 million, so it seems like there will be $350 million to $400 million left that could go to small businesses. I'd argue that it should go there, given the importance of small businesses to our economy.

The explanatory memorandum clarifies that this is an $11 billion allocation of funding with an additional $1 billion going to the Department of

The legislation removes requirements for the government to legislate additional funding for the CEFC, allowing them to create additional accounts within the CEFC simply by general appropriations. The coalition has concerns about this schedule. There are billions in spending for transmission projects that have not been recommended by the energy operator and a hidden $1 billion fund for the

                                                      The government will be opposing this amendment. The Treasury laws amendment bill is crucial, and this amendment is crucial to providing additional capital to the CEFC to implement our Rewiring the Nation fund. Accelerating the uptake of cheaper, cleaner and more reliable electricity helps us to lower energy bills and reduce our emissions. That's why we are investing in critical transmission projects across Australia through the Rewiring the Nation fund.

                                                      The CEFC has been highly successful in bringing forward clean energy investment over the past 10 years, despite attempts to abolish the organisation. Over that period, the CEFC has invested with a lifetime transaction value of $42.8 billion, with $11.7 billion of lifetime commitments achieving leverage of $2.62 for every dollar invested. The CEFC needs the additional capital in this bill to invest in the first round of Rewiring the Nation investments that are coming to a financial close in the coming months, and the transmission is critical to the energy transformation. It will enable more renewables and storage to be connected to the grid, driving down energy prices. Rewiring the Nation will provide that $20 billion in low-cost finance to upgrade, expand and modernise our grids. It will lower the cost of new transmission projects and accelerate delivery, and we are working to co-invest with state and territory governments in these projects. Individual investment decisions will be made by the CEFC in accordance with its statutory independence and its Investment Mandate.
