               to provide a fibre connection to their premises. On the mainland of Australia the response to the NBN has been even more enthusiastic. Construction has already commenced in the mainland first-release sites. In Townsville 57 per cent of premises have asked for a connection, in Minnamurra-

               it is 74 per cent, in Willunga it is 84 per cent and in Armidale, in the electorate of New England, 87 per cent of premises have asked for an NBN fibre connection. Services will go live in these areas in the middle of next year. There is no doubt that this shows a strong hunger in the community for the high-speed fibre broadband services that the NBN offers. The Leader of the Opposition and those opposite need to explain to the people in regional towns like Willunga and Armidale why they do not deserve to have a world-leading broadband service. You have to explain why these people do not deserve a world-class broadband service.

                        Yes, I have seen some media reports that the opposition has come up with yet another broadband plan. That would be their 20th in 15 years. They privatised Telstra as a vertically integrated monopoly. Now they claim to support the structural separation of Telstra, but they have no plan to deliver it. They want to consign Australians to an indefinite future using the same old copper network, and they will not explain how they are going to deliver their 12 megabits to everyone on the copper network. They think Australians deserve a second rate broadband service, like those residents in Willunga, like those residents in Armidale, like those residents in Townsville. They have to explain to them why they cannot have a world-class network.
