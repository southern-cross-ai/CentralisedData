        My question is to Senator Arbib, the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery and Minister for Employment Participation. Can the minister inform the Senate how the government’s nation-building economic stimulus is building productive capacity in the economy? In particular, how is the stimulus helping apprentices and providing opportunities for training in key growth areas of our economy? How will this increased capacity assist the development of large-scale natural resources projects in

        </a>
        ? What would be the effect of stopping the stimulus or delaying it over 15 years, as proposed by the opposition through Senator Eggleston?

         I thank Senator Feeney for that question. As has been outlined by Treasury, the stimulus is supporting 210,000 jobs. Without it unemployment would be far worse. We know that winding back the stimulus would lead to another 100,000 Australians—

           Withdrawing the stimulus would see something like 100,000 Australians lose their jobs.

                    Three of those rail lines have already been completed. The federal government are spending more in 12 months than the coalition government spent in 12 years. The stimulus package is investing in 14 major road projects, and five are underway. It is a doubling of the roads budget. This is how the government are fighting the global recession. This is how the government are supporting jobs. This is how the government are preparing for the future. Those Liberal and National party senators on the other side can scream and shout, but we know they could not care less about infrastructure.

It was a resource centre worked on by 40 local contractors—90 per cent of those contractors came from the local community. It was a project that supported jobs on the Sunshine Coast, not just jobs but much needed school infrastructure. At the opening, Katie O’Sullivan, the captain of Yandina State School, said—

                         I thank the minister for his answer, and I have a second supplementary question. What is the government doing to support productive capacity in the economy to assist with the number of large-scale natural resource projects? In particular, can the minister inform the Senate of the status of the National Resource Sector Employment Taskforce? How will that task force assist Australia in developing productive capacity for the significant investment in these projects in northern Australia over the next five to 10 years?

                          and mining projects that will be getting underway over the coming years. In all, the government believes that there is something like 80 major projects in the pipeline over the next decade, which could create up to 70,000 construction jobs for Australians. We want to ensure that we maximise the local employment opportunities for Australians. That is why the government has established the natural resource sector task force. I was very happy to meet yesterday with the task force for the first time, and also with
