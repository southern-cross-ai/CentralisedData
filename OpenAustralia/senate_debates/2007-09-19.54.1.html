        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing

        , Senator Ellison. My question concerns petrol sniffing and the eight-point plan for the rollout of non-sniffable Opal fuel in the Central Desert region. Can the minister tell us how successfully Opal fuel is being taken up by providers within the region identified in the eight-point plan and if measures are in place to enforce retailer compliance? Is the minister aware of reports that three roadhouses within the identified region are still stocking sniffable fuel, including

         This is an important issue in relation to the health care of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         . We announced, in the 2006-07 budget, funding for the rollout of Opal non-sniffable fuel. As I recall it, the sum was around $20 million, and we announced further funding for it, in the additional estimates, of another $11 million plus. That amount was also to allow for access to treatment services.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am advised that the rollout of Opal has been an important contributing factor in reducing the prevalence of petrol sniffing in remote communities across Australia. Senator Siewert has inquired about the rollout, and I can say that, as of 1 July 2007, there are 104 sites across Australia supplying Opal unleaded fuel. This includes 72 communities, 29 service stations and roadhouses and three pastoral properties. A survey conducted by the Ngampa Health Council in October 2006 reported an 80 per cent reduction in the number of petrol sniffers in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APY" rel="nofollow">
          APY
         </a>
         lands since 2004, and that same body conducted a six-month follow-up survey in May this year. This identified a further reduction of more than 50 per cent since October last year, which is a very good result indeed. With the exception of two communities, no petrol sniffing was reported in the APY lands for the period of October 2006 to May 2007. Anecdotal evidence suggests that petrol sniffing is no longer regarded as an attractive expression of adolescent peer group experimentation or ‘acting out’, as it is referred to. That is a great deal of progress. There is still more work to be done, and I can say that just over $4 million was allocated in the recent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         emergency response to address petrol sniffing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Siewert mentioned, in the other part of her question, the take-up by three roadhouses. I am not aware of the situation in relation to those particular roadhouses. I will take that up with the minister and advise the Senate. What I can say to the Senate is that there has been a great deal of success in rolling this out and that, from independent reviews, it would appear that there has been a significant reduction in petrol sniffing, which is indeed very good news in relation to the health of Indigenous communities and, particularly, of young Indigenous people. It is something that we have committed a good deal of funding to. We will continue to work on it. I acknowledge Senator Siewert’s interest in it. It is something which we should all be interested in. It is something of great importance in the Indigenous health sector. I will have a look at those three roadhouses and get back to the Senate.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I appreciate the minister’s undertaking. I would like to also know whether the minister would be concerned if the reports are correct and that, in fact, sniffable fuel is available at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ti_Tree" rel="nofollow">
           Ti Tree
          </a>
          , in particular, which is just near
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tennant_Creek" rel="nofollow">
           Tennant Creek
          </a>
          . As I understand it, it is planned to roll out non-sniffable fuels into Tennant Creek. Will the availability of sniffable fuel undermine that rollout in Tennant Creek? Secondly, has the government investigated a reported outbreak of petrol sniffing among young people in Ti Tree earlier this year?

           Again, that is something I do not have detail on as to the particular community, but I would say that the government’s position is quite clear. We want to see this taken up. We want to see the Opal fuel used, and that is why we are expending all this money. So certainly I will follow that up and advise the Senate accordingly.
