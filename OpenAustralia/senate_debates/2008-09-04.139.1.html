        I would like to bring to the Senate’s attention today an event which I believe to be a very important advance for the international cause of people with disabilities. Many senators will know that I have a deep and abiding interest in the problems and the issues facing people with a disability and that I have a daughter with Down syndrome. Earlier today in

        , Minnesota, the Republican vice-presidential candidate,

        , addressed her party’s national convention.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are quite a few issues on which I believe that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_Palin" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and I might disagree, but not about the importance of greatly improving our focus on disability issues and greatly improving our treatment of people with a disability. Governor Palin recently became the mother of a son with Down syndrome. I think it is fantastic that a major party in the United States has nominated a female on its presidential ticket and that it is a great bonus for those in the disability community that she has already put the issues of disability right up front on her political and policy agenda
       </p>
       <p>
        The very first pledge that Governor Palin made in her nomination speech today was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the families of special-needs children all across this country, I have a message: For years, you sought to make America a more welcoming place for your sons and daughters. I pledge to you that if we are elected, you will have a friend and advocate in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House" rel="nofollow">
         White House
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure that this short but important statement made at the very beginning of such a significant speech gave heart to millions of Americans that finally their cause is being championed. It is becoming increasingly common for social causes of all varieties to recruit high-profile people to raise awareness about their particular issue. People with Down syndrome and the disability community in general are lucky to have found such a new champion as Governor Palin. I believe that Governor Palin’s love for her son and her support for the cause have the potential to raise the profile of disability issues internationally, and for that I would like to thank her.
