        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. During the 2016 election the Prime Minister promised he would deliver 'stable government'. Since the election we have seen coalition backbenchers publicly dictate the Turnbull government's position on superannuation, backpacker tax policy, the banking royal commission and section 18C of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">

        . Is this the kind of stable government Mr Turnbull had in mind?

         Senator Moore, I understand that, coming from the political culture from which you come, the idea that there might be a discussion about policy issues is asserted by you as evidence of instability. Rather, coming from the political tradition from which those on my side of the chamber come—

           we are unafraid of a debate—in fact, we welcome it. We welcome the perspectives of all members of our team. Every last one of them has something to contribute. But a government is judged by the results it achieves. It is judged by the results, and the results are in on this government: record economic growth; a three-year record low unemployment—

                 I believe I was being insulted, but I could not hear the answer. I refer to the Senate vote on the disallowance of regulations banning the importation of the Adler A110 shotgun, in which not one National senator voted in support of the Prime Minister's position.

                    , I rise on a point of order on relevance and also on the conduct of the Attorney-General. For 30 seconds he has been addressing Senator Moore directly, which is not proper, and he has not dealt with the question.

                      I will first of all remind all senators to keep the noise down, especially senators on my left at present. Secondly, on the point of order, Senator Cameron, one part of your point of order was correct—the Attorney-General should direct his remarks to me and not to Senator Moore. On the second point, in relation to relevance, the minister was relevant. In fact, he started addressing the question quite directly. Attorney-General, you are in order, and please address your remarks to the chair, as all senators should.

                       . I will do so. Through you, Mr President, to Senator Moore: the National Firearms Agreement is something that is very, very important. It is supported by state and territory governments of both political persuasions—and it is supported by the Commonwealth government, because we believe that there should be appropriate controls of firearms, and we have delivered on that. Senator Moore, once again, judge a government by its results. On the issues that you raised, the results are in.

                         ; I cannot wait. Contrary to the Prime Minister's commitments, the Deputy Prime Minister has refused to back away from his statement that the 450 gigalitres due under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan did not have a 'hope in Hades' of being delivered. Is this the kind of stable government or results based government Mr Turnbull had in mind?

                           Mr President
                          </a>
                          , the government is committed to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. Senator Moore, I could not pretend to explain the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to you with the eloquence with which Senator Canavan has explained it on several occasions this week. But I can assure you, Senator Moore, that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and all members of the government are strongly in support of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          As you know, Senator, the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is based on an approach to water management that delivers three objectives: a healthy basin that supports productive industries; confident communities; and a resilient environment. It is the objective of this government and the outcome to which we are working, in collaboration with the states, to achieve all three of those outcomes.
