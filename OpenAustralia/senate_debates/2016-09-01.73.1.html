           I refer to the minister, who said: 'I hadn't actually seen the program last night. I was on my way home. I was having dinner, so I didn't. We didn't watch it.' Did the minister not consider he should have prioritised watching the report over having dinner or getting a member of his staff to actually watch the program during the course of the day or at the time it was on?

            I did have a strategy. I went to dinner. I came home. I am not sure if you have heard of iview, Senator, but I was able to watch it on iview when I returned home. It is disappointing that, after asking the ABC to provide me with a forward copy so I could see this before it actually showed, they were not able to provide me one. I was particularly disappointed to hear a reflection that somehow that circumstance was changed to the fact that perhaps I was actually offered to see it and I was not able to see it. I was very disappointed in that. But I had a plan, and I think it was important. It was important. I went as soon as it was available to me. I was able to see it that night, and I was able to reflect on those matters the following day.

               On the term 'piqued my interest': I was referring to the media reports at the end of 2015. What did pique my interest, Senator Conroy, was the
               <i>

               that showed a terrible culture of brutality to our youngest and most vulnerable. I can tell you that the comparison with what was in the media at the end of 2015 and what was in those reports at the end of 2015 was a huge gap. That is exactly what my reflection was on, and I stand to it.
