        I have some further information in response to a question asked yesterday by Senator Milne. I am advised that the government considered a number of options for the delivery of elite level classical musical training. On 31 October 2008, following Minister Garrett’s announcement of 22 October that the Australian government would no longer provide funding to the ANAM from 2009, he met with representatives from the University of Melbourne to discuss the future delivery of this important training in Australia. I am advised that, specifically, neither Minister Garrett nor his department had any discussions with any representative of the University of Melbourne regarding the withdrawal of funding from the ANAM prior to his announcement on 22 October. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIMP" rel="nofollow">
         AIMP
        </a>
        model is the only model that fully meets all of the government’s objectives consistent with the two independent reviews of the ANAM. I am advised that continuity of training for ANAM 2009 students was at the forefront of Minister Garrett’s mind and that the University of Melbourne has agreed to facilitate appropriate transitional arrangements for students.

        I am further advised that this proposal is not a new idea.

         The University

        of Melbourne has been discussing the idea of bringing together its affiliated music training organisations since late 2005 as a controlled entity of the University of Melbourne. Representatives from ANAM’s management team were involved in these discussions. In February 2006, ANAM management wrote to the University of Melbourne indicating their interest in being involved in the new Melbourne conservatorium project, subject to the resolution of issues surrounding autonomy and independence. In March 2006, a feasibility study for the proposed new conservatorium of music for Melbourne was tabled and included a recommendation for the faculty of music, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCA" rel="nofollow">
         VCA
        </a>
        and the ANAM to develop explicit plans for fruitful collaboration in a shared facility. In June 2006, the ANAM advised that it wished to be involved in the planning stages of the new Melbourne conservatorium proposal. In June 2007, the ANAM executive discussed the new Melbourne conservatorium proposal and advised the then minister, Senator Brandis, that it did not wish to pursue the new model.
