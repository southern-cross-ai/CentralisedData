        My question is to Senator Wong, the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Efficiency" rel="nofollow">
         Energy Efficiency
        </a>
        . Has the minister estimated the increased costs associated with running hospitals, schools, courts, police and libraries and road maintenance of a carbon tax; and can the minister advise the Senate what the cost of a 10 per cent increase in electricity prices in the first year of the carbon tax is for these essential services?

         There are a number of areas that the senator has mentioned. First, in relation to schools, as the senator would know, the Commonwealth government's contribution to schools funding is indexed, so as costs rise funding to schools is increased. This index­ation is changed annually, after consideration of movements in data that underpin what is known as the AGSRC. I am sure Senator Evans could explain that to you: it is the average government school—

                 As I was saying, that gives you the average government school's recurrent costs. This means that cost impacts resulting from the introduction of the carbon price will be captured in this indexation and schools will automatically receive increased funding over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In relation to health services, the Treasury modelling estimates the average price impact on health services to be around 0.3 per cent. This group in the modelling would include hospital and medical services, optical and dental services and pharmaceuticals. To the extent there is any increase in costs due to the carbon price, current and future funding arrangements will automatically ensure that public hospitals continue to be properly funded. Public hospital funding in the National Healthcare Agreement is indexed at over 7 per cent in each year of the forward estimates. In addition, when we move to the new healthcare agreements the government has struck with the states and territories, the Commonwealth has committed to pay 50 per cent of the growth in hospital costs. I trust this assists the senator.

Any increased costs that flow from the intro­duction of the carbon price will result in increased funding through these indexation factors under the SPPs.

                      , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the minister clearly cannot guarantee comp­ensation and in the light of the fact there will be a 10 per cent increase in electricity prices in just the first year of the carbon tax, can the minister explain how hospitals, schools, courts, police, libraries and road maintenance will be able to deal with the multimillion dollar impact on their costs? Will the minister advise us whether there will simply have to be—

                        I have to say I thought I provided a very detailed answer in response to the questions about the way in which indexation works. I would have hoped that the senator would understand how indexation works. That really deals with the issue he has raised.

                        The senator asked about public hospitals. I can say that we will not do what the Leader of the Opposition did when he was health minister, which was to cut $1 billion from Australia's public hospitals. They come in here professing concern on issues such as health and education, but what they really think is demonstrated by what they did when they were in government. The character of the Leader of the Opposition is demonstrated by what he did as health minister, which was to cut $1 billion out of Australia's public hospitals. That is the legacy of the Leader of the Opposition and it took a Labor govern­ment to fix it. Those are the facts, Senator.
