         I thank Senator Back for his question. Indeed a strong and productive relationship with Indonesia is critical to Australia's national security. We are neighbours in what is a very dynamic region and we are also friends. It was my pleasure to host my counterpart, Indonesian Defence Minister Ryamizard Ryacudu, in Sydney last Thursday for the annual Indonesia-Australia defence ministers meeting. These sorts of dialogues enable the sharing of perspectives on important strategic issues and a focus on the more practical details of defence-to-defence matters and the coordination of our practical cooperation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Minister Ryamizard and I discussed our many shared security and strategic interests, including a commitment to combating terrorism, to maritime security and to promoting peace and stability in our region. We discussed regional security dynamics and the importance of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
          ASEAN
         </a>
         security frameworks to build regional trust, transparency and cooperation. We also reinforced our support for and endorsed the recently signed
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Declaration" rel="nofollow">
          Joint Declaration
         </a>
         on Maritime Cooperation, and it was indeed a very productive discussion.
        </p>
        <p>
         As with all friendships, from time to time, they do face challenges, as our two nations faced earlier this year with the temporary suspension of defence cooperation. However, it was with a spirit of cooperation that Indonesia and Australia were able to work together to resolve the temporary suspension, with the Prime Minister and President Widodo confirming the full restoration of defence cooperation, training exchanges and activities on 26 February at what was a very productive meeting at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_House" rel="nofollow">
          Admiralty House
         </a>
         . This particularly demonstrates the strength and resilience of our relationship and the friendship of our leaders.
        </p>
        <p>
         With Minister Ryamizard, I am absolutely committed to building the Australia-Indonesia defence relationship and I know that through the course of 2017, whether it is the Shangri-La Dialogue or the ASEAN Defence Ministers' Meeting-Plus, we will be able to pursue our shared interests even further.

            between 2017 and 2020. Indonesia has a proud history of peacekeeping operations, as does Australia. and officials from both countries are working on what would be a very practical program of activities that progress our shared peacekeeping priorities, including programs that promote the

               This is a key aspect of the Defence white paper, particularly in terms of extending Defence's international engagement. We seek to deepen bilateral defence cooperation with Indonesia in five particular areas: counterterrorism, maritime security, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, peacekeeping as I have mentioned, and also intelligence. Minister Ryamizard and I also agreed last week that Australia and Indonesia would reinvigorate our cooperation and engagement in the field of defence science and technology. I think there is enormous potential to build the depth and resilience of our bilateral relationship in that particular area. In fact Australia's Chief Defence Scientist, Dr Alex Zelinsky, met with the head of the Indonesian Defence Ministry Research and Development Agency, Dr Anne Kusmayati, last November. During that meeting, Dr Kusmayati and Dr Zelinsky identified several areas for potential cooperation, and we look forward to welcoming her to Australia in 2017.
