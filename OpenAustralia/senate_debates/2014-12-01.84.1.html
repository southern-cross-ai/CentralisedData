         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government is investing $22.5 million over four years for prevention programs to help address increasing rates of sexually transmissible infections and blood borne viruses, including HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C. People with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STI" rel="nofollow">
          STI
         </a>
         s are at least two to five times more likely than uninfected people to acquire HIV.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2012, there were more than 230,000 Australians living with a chronic hepatitis C infection, predominantly through sharing needles. More than 207,000 have hepatitis B. These diseases are preventable. That is why it is critical the government strengthen our efforts to support health service providers and tailor our safe sex and prevention messages so that they actually connect with the people most at risk. The program targets priority populations, including gay and bisexual men, Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people, culturally and linguistically diverse Australians, young people, people in rural and regional areas and people who inject drugs.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government's program comprises $7.2 million to reduce high rates of STIs among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander priority populations, particularly in regional and remote settings; $1 million for point-of-care demonstration testing projects to increase the HIV testing rate by offering tests which provide rapid results; $5.1 million for needle and syringe programs, particularly in rural and regional areas; and $4.6 million to increase uptake of testing and treatment for hepatitis B among priority populations. Australia has been a leader in minimising the spread of these infections, and the new investment will build on this work.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
            HIV
           </a>
           has become easier and more accessible under changes being made by the Australian government. A restriction preventing the manufacture and sale of HIV home self-tests has been removed, and dispensing arrangements for HIV therapies are to be changed. This would enable Australians to test themselves for HIV in their own homes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Companies can now apply to the TGA for approval to supply their test kits. The kits, if they meet Australia's rigorous standards and are approved, will be able to be sold direct to consumers. Home self-testing provides an additional testing option that complements current options and allows people living with HIV to learn their HIV status and seek appropriate treatment and support. Early diagnosis of HIV is critical to supporting Australians living with the condition to get the treatment they need sooner and to stop its spread.
