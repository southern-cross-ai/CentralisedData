        </a>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are two Additional Estimates Bills this year: Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Additional Estimates Bills seek appropriation authority from Parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        , in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last Budget.  The total additional appropriation being sought through Additional Estimates Bills 3 and 4 this year is a little over $2.3 billion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Turning to Appropriation Bill (No. 3), the total appropriation being sought this year is $1.36 billion. This proposed appropriation arises from changes in the estimates of program expenditure, due to variations in the timing of payments and forecast increases in program take-up, reclassifications and from policy decisions taken by the Government since the last Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I now outline the major appropriations proposed in the Bill.
       </p>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the Attorney-General’s Department will be provided with $17.6 million to reimburse State and Territory Legal Aid Commissioners for providing legal assistance in national security, people smuggling and drug related matters. This funding will be made available through the Expensive Commonwealth Criminal Cases Fund.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        will provide the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations with $14.3 million to support the operation of the Education Services for Overseas Students Assurance Fund which provides compensation to international students in the event of an education provider closure. Students will be given a refund of any course fees that cannot be recovered from education providers if they are unable to be placed in a suitable alternative course. This funding will supplement provider contributions and ensure the Fund is able to meet its obligations, and will only be drawn down if required.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will be provided with $10.1 million to introduce the Fair Entitlements Guarantee to protect employee entitlements when an employer enters liquidation. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee will replace the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme and extend current entitlements to include redundancy pay, up to a maximum of four weeks for each year of service. The new Guarantee will apply to all Australian workers other than company directors and their close associates. This funding is in addition to the $458.6 million currently available to the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme over four years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will also provide the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations with an additional $14.6 million to double the capacity of the Connecting People with Jobs Relocation Assistance Pilot program up to 4,000 places. A primary focus of the program will be to assist eligible unemployed Australians to relocate to Queensland to take up employment opportunities in flood affected areas. This funding will provide incentives for the unemployed to move to areas which offer greater employment opportunities and to stick with their new job.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is providing $22.4 million to assist Tasmanian forestry contractors and employees respond to the challenges facing the Tasmanian native forest industry.  The

        , Fisheries and Forestry will receive $14.6 million in appropriation Bill 3 to provide exit assistance in the form of grants to eligible contracting businesses as well as assistance to help ensure that employees receive their full entitlements.  The balance of the funding is being met from other sources.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Finance and Deregulation will be provided with $11 million to support an increase in the number of Ministerial, Opposition,

        The Australian Sports Commission will be provided with $21.6 million to continue the Active After-School Communities program until December 2011.

        An additional $19.1 million will be provided for the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to enable the Authority to fulfil its statutory obligations and meet community expectations regarding the development and ongoing implementation of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. The increase in funding is matched by a reduction in administered funding for the Sustainable Rural Water Use and Infrastructure program within the Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities.

        premium free dispensing incentive payment. Under this scheme eligible pharmacists receive an indexed incentive payment, currently $1.56, for each substitutable PBS item dispensed where a premium does not apply. Substitutable PBS items are those that are interchangeable at patient level. The adjustment to the estimates for this program takes account of additional categories of eligible prescriptions and allows for higher levels of growth in the use of substitutable prescriptions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The appropriations that I have outlined so far are proposed to meet additional funding requirements that have arisen since the last Budget. There is a further category of requirement for additional appropriation, referred to as a ‘reclassification of appropriation’, that are also proposed in Appropriation Bill (No.3).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amounts need to be re-appropriated to align the purpose of the proposed spending with the correct appropriation type. The additional appropriations are fully offset by savings against the original appropriations and thus do not lead to additional expenditure.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I now outline the material reclassifications proposed in Bill 3:

         will be provided with $45.6 million as departmental funding in 2010-11 to provide sufficient funding to meet expected departmental expenditure arising for the closure of the Home Insulation Program and the delivery of the Home Insulation Safety Plan.
        </li>
        <li>
         AusAID will be provided with $85.9 million as departmental funding in 2010-11 and will spend $85.9 million less in administered funding. This reflects the reclassification of expenditure under AusAID’s new expense classification framework.
        </li>

        The remaining amounts that appear in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) relate to estimates variations, minor reclassifications and other minor measures.

        In addition, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations will be provided with $48.3 million, which represents a re-appropriation of amounts from last financial year, for the Non-Government schools component of the Trade Training Centres program. Delays in the pre-construction and construction phases have resulted in delays in program payments to 2010-11.

        The Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government will receive an additional $100 million as part of the Government’s partnership with local government.  The funding will contribute to improving community infrastructure in all of the nation’s councils and shires, including; libraries, community centres, and sports grounds and facilities. This is the third round of the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program and brings total funding for the program to more than $1.1 billion since November 2008.

        In addition, the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government will be provided with $30 million, which is a re-appropriation from 2009-10, to meet project commitments under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. This funding is re-appropriated because there was insufficient time after Government endorsement of projects for recipients to progress their projects prior to 30 June 2010 and claim payments.

         bill
        </a>
        to amend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Corporations Act
        </a>
        2001 (Corporations Act) and the Payment System (Regulation) Act 1998.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        By way of background information, the Corporations Legislation Amendment (Financial Services Modernisation) Act 2009, which commenced on 6 May 2010, inserted a new Chapter into the Corporations Act – Chapter 5D – that created a new national uniform regime for regulating trustee companies.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A trustee company provides a wide range of wealth management services including estate planning, administering deceased estates, managing the financial affairs of persons unable to look after their own interests, and administering charitable trusts and foundations. There are currently 11 licensed private trustee companies in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the commencement of the new national regime, the Government has received representations from the industry, in particular the representative association – the Trustee Corporations Association of Australia - and the State and Territory Governments indicating that a number of amendments are required to increase market efficiency by ensuring restructuring of company groups which operated under the State and Territory based regulatory framework.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill demonstrates this Government’s understanding of the ongoing requirement to consult stakeholders on new and old regulatory regimes to ensure that policy objectives and outcomes are being met; to continually review and improve these regulatory regimes where appropriate so that all relevant parties are aware of their public policy obligations and requirements; and to confirm that the Government’s intended social and economic benefits are being delivered to the community. In other words, to check that the well being of the Australian society is being enhanced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This bill contains a number of measures to improve the operation of Chapter 5D of the Corporations Act. The bill provides for voluntary transfers of trustee business between entities. Prior to the commencement of Chapter 5D, many corporate groups operated multiple subsidiaries in order to comply with the former State and Territory regimes. The industry is now seeking a feasible and cost-effective process for consolidating the business of these subsidiaries into one Commonwealth licensed entity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The bill provides for “compulsory” transfers of trustee company business from a failing licensed trustee company to a State or Territory public trustee. Currently, Chapter 5D of the Corporations Act precludes the transfer of trustee company business from a licence-cancelled company to a State or Territory public trustee because the public trustees are not licensed trustee companies. It is appropriate and important for the purpose of protecting the assets and stakeholders of failing or demonstrably non compliant licensed trustee companies to rectify this situation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At present, there is no formal procedure under which a prospective licensee applies to the Government to be listed as a licensed trustee corporation. This contrasts with the former State based system where most jurisdictions published administrative (rather than legislative) criteria for applicants. This bill provides such a process.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To preserve the integrity of the new regime in Chapter 5D and to prevent misrepresentations to the public, the Bill provides that an entity is prohibited from holding itself out as a ‘licensed trustee company’ unless it holds an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFSL" rel="nofollow">
         AFSL
        </a>
        with a trustee company authorisation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, the Bill would also amend the Payment System (Regulation) Act 1998 to protect participants in the automatic teller machine (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATM" rel="nofollow">
         ATM
        </a>
        ) system from prosecution under the Competition and Consumer Act 2010.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This amendment is necessary because the
