        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. I refer the minister to comments made last week by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_King" rel="nofollow">
         Catherine King
        </a>
        , when she said the actions of Qatari security forces to detain women at Hamad International Airport and undertake invasive body searches was 'a factor' in the government's rejection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar_Airways" rel="nofollow">
         Qatar Airways
        </a>
        . The government has been in office for more than 15 months. Minister, what actions and on what dates, prior to Minister King making the Qatar Airways decision on 10 July 2023, did you raise with representatives of the Qatar government the Australian government's concerns with respect to the incident at Hamad International Airport and the treatment of Australian women?

         I first say that the mistreatment of female passengers was a terrible incident. I think we all would agree with that. I think all Australians were shocked by the events. I also say, as I have said publicly, that we appreciate the State of Qatar's efforts following the incident to investigate, apologise and ensure it's never repeated, including establishing the task force to review airport procedures and protocols. I acknowledge the work Senator Payne engaged in in relation to that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was briefed on this matter following the election. I tasked officials, including our ambassador to Doha, to continue to engage with Qatari authorities in support of requests made by the women. That has been done on numerous occasions. I can confirm that I have also raised these matters with my Qatari counterpart.
        </p>
        <p>
         We hope that there will be full implementation of the task force recommendations. We continue to engage with this issue in support of the women concerned in a manner that is appropriate and we will make appropriate representations to the Qatari authorities.

           I refer to the comments by the Prime Minister in question time on 4 September:

           can add more seats into Australia today—right now.
          </p>

           …   …   …
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           They are certainly welcome to do so, and they can fly as many flights as they like into Adelaide, into the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
            Gold Coast

           , into Avalon, into Hobart and into Canberra …
          </p>
          <p>
           Minister, if the government considers the actions of Qatari authorities in 2020 are a valid factor for denying additional flights to major airports, why have the Prime Minister and the transport minister called for Qatar to provide more flights to regional airports? Is flying through Doha safe or isn't it?

            (—) (): At the risk of being a little pedantic, you asked me the primary question as the foreign minister and just now you asked me a question in relation to the Prime Minister and the transport minister's portfolios. I hope that, on the issue of the treatment of Australian women and the work by both sides of politics in government to try to resolve or find a way forward in relation to this matter, it would be a matter above partisan politics. The Prime Minister's statement I think speaks for itself.

              Minister, don't the inconsistencies in Labor's policies and explanations demonstrate that the transport minister and the government are cynically using the incident at Hamad International Airport to distract the public from Labor's protection of Qantas from competition and as a consequence are imposing higher airfares on Australians?
