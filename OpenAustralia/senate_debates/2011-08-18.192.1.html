         CrimTrac is committed to workplace diversity principles, and employs strategies and actions to further the Commonwealth Disability Strategy within the Agency. In July 2010, CrimTrac successfully piloted an employment program for engaging people with disability.

         partnered with a Commonwealth Disability Employment Service Provider to design and offer an appropriate position to specifically engage a person with disability. This position was initially offered as a non-ongoing opportunity. However, as this arrangement has seen the effective integration of this employee into CrimTrac’s workforce as a valued and productive team member, this appointment has been converted to an ongoing employment arrangement. CrimTrac anticipates a long and mutually beneficial employment relationship. As part of engaging this employee, CrimTrac undertook a number of activities including:

         CrimTrac’s website complies with accessibility standards for the disabled and collects staff workplace diversity information including information on disabilities. The Agency ensures that employment policies and procedures comply with workplace diversity principles and the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1992. The principle of reasonable adjustment is applied across all recruitment and staffing processes, and CrimTrac encourages applicants to request any required alternate arrangements. In addition, procedures are in place to ensure managers receive appropriate support and advice in meeting their obligations to applicants with disabilities.
