        My question is to the Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro. Is the minister aware that two other facilities operated by the provider at Elizabeth House Private Nursing Home also failed to meet care standards in visits by the agency this year, including Plumpton Villa, which failed 22 out of 44 care standards? Didn’t the report on Plumpton Villa find that there were insufficient qualified staff and that at times the assessment team itself was unable to locate any staff? Over the three days of the visit, didn’t the assessment team hear a resident moaning in pain and observe a high number of skin tears amongst residents? Does the minister recall defending his decision not to impose a sanction on this facility because ‘it was getting its act together’? Can the minister explain why frail residents suffering substandard care had to wait while the provider was given time to get its act together?

         There is one thing that I will not allow to happen in this chamber as far as I am concerned: I will not be verballed. If people doubt what I am about to repeat, they should read the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         . Senator McLucas asked me why I failed to impose sanctions. Senator McLucas, if she in any way wishes to be treated as a serious shadow minister for ageing, would understand and would be able to clearly state to this place that I do not impose sanctions. It is not within the province of the minister’s ability or jurisdictional capacity to impose sanctions on an aged-care facility. I will take Senator McLucas through Ageing 101. Once an inspection is undertaken—

            I wish to thank Senator McLucas for quoting, although
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            is quite correct in his ruling that it is not a relevant point of order. That quote that she has just read from has in no way substantiated the major point in her question that I refused to impose a sanction. Ageing 101 should tell Senator McLucas, if she cares to read the textbook, that in fact it is the accreditation agency that conducts the inspections and then, always with the best interests of the people who are aged and frail within a facility, will make the decision.
           </p>
           <p>
            So what Senator McLucas is again doing is seeking to verbal me and verbal the government and, through you, Mr President, seeking to again scare the living daylights out of the elderly, aged and frail within our facilities. She is trying to create an impression that the aged-care sector, which every night looks after over 160,000 aged and frail Australians, is somehow in a crisis. I have always said in this place and outside that no system is perfect.

                   , I invite senators opposite to keep on asking me the questions, because this government is proud of its record within aged care in Australia. As I suggested to Senator McLucas in answer to her previous question, if it were not for the Howard government, there would not have been a compliance commission and there would not have an accreditation agency. Funding for the aged-care sector would not be at a record level of just under $8 billion. What does this government have to do in terms of looking after the interests of aged and frail Australians to just get one modicum of recognition from Senator McLucas? Just one modicum of recognition—

                    , I have a point of order on the question of relevance. The minister was asked a direct question about the failure of this nursing home in 22 of the 44 care standards. He has failed to address the question which went to him as to why he has not taken action.

                          I am raising with you a separate point of order, which is the critique you made about people raising legitimate points of order. We have the ability to do that. It is your role to rule on them. But it is not unreasonable for senators to raise the question of relevance when the minister has made no attempt in four minutes to actually address the question. I am concerned by the suggestion by you that we somehow should restrict our capacity to raise points of order.

                             , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that many of the problems identified at Plumpton Villa were clearly long running, some dating back to when the facility was accredited in September 2005? Why has this facility been given a further eight months to get its act together with no threat of any sanction in the meantime? Should residents in this facility have to wait that long to get the quality care they deserve?
