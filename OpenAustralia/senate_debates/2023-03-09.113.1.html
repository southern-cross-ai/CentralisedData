        My question is for Minister Watt, representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. The federal government and Safe Work have been on notice about the deadly health impacts posed by manufactured stone since at least 2019, when the matter was canvassed extensively in a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        parliamentary inquiry and by the press. We know too many workers are dying slow, painful deaths from silicosis. Recognising that it took us too long to act on James Hardie, why does Safe Work still say that high-silica manufactured stone can be used safely and still refuse to support a ban on this deadly product?

         Thank you, Senator Shoebridge. I know this is an issue you've had a longstanding interest in, as have many of us who've been concerned about worker safety, particularly in the construction industry where this applies most. I agree with you, Senator Shoebridge, that this is something that should have been dealt with a long, long time ago. A lot of people have been on notice that this is a problem and is a very serious health risk. I've heard it referred to as the asbestosis of this generation, and that is certainly what it looks like. And that's exactly why our government is taking action to finally fix this once and for all.
        </p>
        <p>
         As you would probably be aware, Senator Shoebridge, in late February—28 February this year—Minister Burke, as the responsible minister, met with work health and safety ministers to consider Safe Work Australia's decision regulation impact statement to better manage the risks of silica dust within the workplace. At that meeting, ministers unanimously agreed to a national approach to dealing with the spike in silicosis and silica related diseases in workers from harmful exposure of respirable crystalline silica. Ministers agreed to a range of reforms as a priority, based on recommendations from Safe Work Australia. These recommendation included the delivery of national awareness and behaviour-change initiatives, stronger regulation of high-risk crystalline silica processes for all materials across all industries and further analysis and consultation by Safe Work on a prohibition on the use of engineered stone under the model workplace health and safety laws, including consideration of a licensing scheme for legacy and nonprohibited projects to be completed within six months.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ministers also noted the Commonwealth's intent to explore an importation ban on engineered stone and its effects. Minister Burke's department is now working with states and territories and other stakeholders as part of the scoping work. We recognise the need to act quickly, and ministers will meet again to discuss silicosis as soon as practicable after Safe Work completes its work.

           Minister, the main provider of manufactured stone in Australia, Caesarstone, is a foreign corporation with no significant assets in the country and since September 2020 has been unable to get insurance coverage for silicosis related claims in Australia, while it's also facing dozens and dozens of claims from sick and dying Australian workers. What guarantee do you give to workers who become sick after working with this product that they will not be left high and dry if Caesarstone exits the market?

            As I said, a range of issues concerning silicosis and the threat that it poses to workers in the construction industry, including those who have unfortunately contracted silicosis, are exactly the issues that Minister Burke is dealing with at the moment. I understand that you're seeking an assurance or some information about what will happen to workers who become sick, if Caesarstone were to exit the market. I'm not briefed on that precise matter but I'm happy to provide you with some information about that.

              I note the statements about taking action and to some extent that's positive. But the best estimates we're hearing from the minister is this could be six to 12 months before a ban is put in place. What do you say to the families of those workers who are getting sick now, waiting for a ban to finally happen and being told, again, we're going to the beat of safe work, it's too hard to do it now and that industry controls are sufficient?

              <p>
               I don't think that anyone, or certainly no-one within our government, is saying that the current controls are sufficient. That's exactly why Minister Burke is leading this work nationally involving all state and territory ministers. It is not just unfortunate but a grave dereliction of duty from the former government to have been in power for nearly 10 years, while this information was publicly available, and done nothing about it. Within the first 12 months of our government we are actually taking action.
              </p>
              <p>
               What I say to the families of those workers who are getting sick now is that they do now have a government in the Albanese Labor government who takes these issues seriously and is actually taking action.
