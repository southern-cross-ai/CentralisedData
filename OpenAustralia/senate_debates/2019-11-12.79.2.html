        My question is to the Minister for Sport, Senator Colbeck. Prior to the election, Sport Australia
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Palmer" rel="nofollow">
         Kate Palmer
        </a>
        , twice stated that Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie" rel="nofollow">
         McKenzie
        </a>
        , as sports minister, had only awarded Community Sports Infrastructure grants to projects recommended by Sport Australia. Then, only three days before the election, Ms Palmer changed her position, stating, 'Some projects from the eligible pool of applicants that were preferred by the minister were approved by her.' How many times did Senator McKenzie approve taxpayer money, for her personally preferred projects, against the recommendation of Sport Australia?

             The government invested $102.5 million in the Community Sports Infrastructure grant program and delivered 648 projects, building better sporting facilities for healthier and stronger communities by promoting physical activity and social connection. These grants are enabling people from right across the country to get more active, more often. Projects include upgrades to female change room facilities, lighting upgrades for local sporting clubs and surface upgrades to ensure a safer sporting environment.
            </p>
            <p>
             Over 2,050 applications totalling nearly $400 million were made to the program, which has seen 224 projects funded as part of round 1, 232 projects funded as part of round 2—

Each application was individually assessed using criteria including community participation, community need and project design and delivery. Recommendations were then provided to the Minister for Sport, who was the grant delegate for final decision and approval.

                   , I do have a further supplementary question. Over three rounds of this program, 684 successful applications have been awarded funding, according to the Sport Australia website. How many of the 684 successful applicants were personally selected by Senator

                   against the advice of Sport Australia, and on what basis were those decisions made?

                    , as the then minister, was the delegate responsible for approving every project. That was her role. That was her responsibility. Minister McKenzie was responsible for approving every single project, each one of which met the guidelines of the program. It's really quite simple. There were over 2,000 applications totalling nearly $400 million. The program was very, very popular, to the extent that we ran three rounds of the program before the election. Minister McKenzie, as the responsible delegate, made the decisions on which projects were approved.

                      , I do have one. In evidence before Senate estimates it was revealed that 618 recommended applications were rejected by Senator
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McKenzie" rel="nofollow">

                      . How many of the 618 eligible grassroots projects would have received local funding if Senator McKenzie had not intervened and hand-picked her favourites?

                          I think, with respect, you're going to how the minister is answering the question. There is an opportunity for debating that after question time, but by talking about the approval process, which may or may not meet with your approval or wish, I think he is, however, being directly relevant.
