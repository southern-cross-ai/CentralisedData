        My question is to Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Minister for Sport. I refer to a statement made by the Minister for Sport on the
        <i>

        program on Sunday that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... this Government’s made over 100 election commitments to upgrade local community club facilities ...
       </p>
       <p>
        My question is: what is the total cost of these commitments, and will the minister table a full list of these commitments, broken down by electorate, and any press releases relating to each of these

Senator Bernardi, I know you approached me in the chamber the other day, indicating you would like some details on these programs. I actually got my office to ring your office just before question time, because I had only just found the email. I asked you to ring my office, but you sent an email. I did not find it until this morning, because it is on the public email system.

             I am just explaining I do not have the information he requested. But, to be frank, that would be a question that should be put on notice in any event. It requires a great deal of detail. He has asked for details on about 100 different projects to be tabled. It is clearly a question that is designed more as a question on notice than as one for question time, but I am happy to try and get the information as quickly as possible for Senator Bernardi. But, as I say, it is normally one that would be put on notice and responded to, given the sort of research and information required. It is not normal for ministers to be asked to table large numbers of documents. It is a question on notice. But I will try and be helpful. I apologise that we miscommunicated, because Senator Bernardi did make the attempt to ensure I had some warning so I could respond to him on this question. So I apologise for the mix-up in that regard but, as I say, I think it is probably best dealt with by the question being put on notice. But I will take it on notice now in that sense and as soon as I get the information together I will get it to Senator Bernardi.

              , I ask a supplementary question. Will the minister confirm whether the additional funding commitments announced by the Minister for Sport will require cuts from any other programs? Specifically, will the minister guarantee that funding for the Active After-School Communities program will not be affected to make way for what I would regard as blatant pork-barrelling?

               I was overwhelmed by the gall in that supplementary. To be lectured by the Liberal Party about rorts, given the history of the regional rorts program and the Auditor-General’s findings on the corruption of that program to further political ends, is just amazing. Senator Bernardi, I will take your question on notice, but decisions about funding of programs will be made in the budget in the normal way and they will be announced in the normal way. But for the Liberal Party to talk about rorting of programs is quite breathtaking, given your record in government.
