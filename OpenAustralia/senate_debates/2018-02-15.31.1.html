        Reasons for referral/principal issues for consideration:

       <p class="italic">
        On the 22nd of June 2017 an almost identical Bill was referred to Committee but most submissions were from the Refugee Industry or individual refugees.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe many Australians were unaware of the Government's Bill and the opportunity to make a submission. My Private Senator's Bill only differs from the earlier Government's Bill is the length of time required to be on a permanent visa before applying for Citizenship.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposal contained in this Bill is very important. I believe Senators should be given the opportunity to hear from a wider group of Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I will publicize the opportunity to make a submission if the Bill is accepted for referral.
