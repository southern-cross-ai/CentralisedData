        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer the Attorney-General to the email from Mr Gregory Burton to Commissioner Heydon which has been released which forwards an email which has as its subject matter '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_Party_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Liberal Party of Australia
        </a>
        , New South Wales Division, Lawyers Branch and Legal Policy Branch', in relation of course to the Barwick address. Can the Attorney-General advise when he or his office first became aware that Commissioner Heydon was invited to address this Liberal Party fundraiser, and when and how did the Attorney or his office become aware that the commissioner had accepted the invitation?

         I became aware on Thursday morning. I instituted an inquiry. My office had become aware some months earlier and apologised on my behalf because I had already, at the time that my office received the date-claimer notice, accepted another event, which was in the diary.

           The first I became aware of the matter was, as I have said, on Thursday morning. I have this morning seen the emails produced by the commissioner. The one to which you are referring was 12 Juneâ€”is that right?

               I am not aware that there were any communications from my department, but I will check. I am not aware that there were any communications from my office to the commissioner, but, as I said in answer to your earlier question, an apology was sent as a matter of routine when the save-the-date email was received earlier in the year. It is a matter of public record that, on Thursday morning, I rang the commissioner when I first became aware that he had been scheduled to give the

               lecture. I rang him because I was concerned about that, but it was a very brief conversation because the commissioner said to me, 'You don't need to go on, because I have already this morning indicated that I will not be proceeding with the commitment.'
