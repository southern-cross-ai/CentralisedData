        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to the article by Ms Niki Savva in today's Australian, which reveals the internal chaos and confusion around the Prime Minister's office briefing of the media on the $7
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

Can the minister further confirm that the Prime Minister called him the next morning before the minister's radio interview to say that nothing had changed and that the briefings from the

Can the minister confirm that Liberal MP, Mr Ken Wyatt, was greeted with 'a spontaneous round of applause' in the government party room after complaining about the rude and arrogant attitude of the Prime Minister's office towards government MPs? Can the minister advise whether any of the Senate backbench join in this round of applause?

             Mr Wyatt, the member for Hasluck, is an excellent member, does a wonderful job for his electorate and is always willing to speak his mind. In relation to the particular party room to which the senator refers, I did not happen to be there, but I have just checked with some colleagues behind me who confirm that Mr Wyatt did not say such words.

                Senator Wong, I really do not assistance on the point of order. Senator Bernardi, I think today of all days we will allow some irony, which has found its way into many questions over the year. I will say, Senator Wong, and I was going to say it before Senator Bernardi's point of order that the final supplementary is really stretching the limit of being related to the primary question. I will allow the minister to answer the parts he wishes to answer.

                 The problem for the senator is that the way she said 'Merry Christmas' absolutely exposed her insincerity. It also shows that when she said to Mr Rudd, 'You've got my full support,' her sincerity was just as great.
