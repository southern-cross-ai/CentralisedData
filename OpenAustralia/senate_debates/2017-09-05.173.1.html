         CMS

        (a) ensuring adequate controls are in place to effectively manage taxi and car hire for those unable to use the Defence travel card; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) investigating the high use of specific individual taxis, multiple expensive taxi fares and 'small hours' travel. The results of this investigation should be made publicly available on the Defence website.

       <p class="italic">
        Government response
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agree
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        a) Defence agrees with the ANAO recommendation and has enhanced the forensic data analytics program. Additionally The Defence Audit and Fraud Division are conducting further audits.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Defence has introduced personalised
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLEX" rel="nofollow">
         FLEX
        </a>
        eTICKETS as a means of travel for staff who are under 18 years of age. Defence officials that do not have a DTC for taxi use can utilise FLEXeTICKETS in exceptional circumstances. Policy (Defence Finance Instruction Policy Management Instruction No. 2016-17/005) on issuing FLEXeTICKETs has been issued. FLEXeTICKETs can only be approved by Group Chief Finance Officers in writing prior to use and are a single use card with a limited monetary value for taxi travel.

Defence agrees that the results of the forensics data analytics findings be made publicly available in relevant Defence publications however details will be limited to aggregated information such as frequency and cost but not include members details. The investigations of fraudulent matters are reported appropriately.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 5
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Department of Defence be more transparent in reporting disciplinary action taken against individuals found to have committed credit card fraud, whether steps taken are administrative or judicial in nature. This should include publishing the outcomes of disciplinary or criminal action on the Defence website and in service newspapers.
       </p>

        Agree in Principle

         Australian Government Solicitor
        </a>
        on possible approaches and will also engage across government more broadly to seek a consistent approach to this issue, as far as possible. Defence will also examine the most effective means of publishing reports of criminal convictions and disciplinary/administrative outcomes for credit card fraud cases arising within Defence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Defence Military Justice system has open hearings which the public can attend including the press. The list of significant cases of fraud is reported to the Minister for Defence. The results of all convictions by higher disciplinary Service Tribunals are reported in the Service newspapers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Recommendation 6
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee recommends that the Department of Defence evaluate its current training, education and information programs in relation to the use of credit and other transaction cards to ensure compliance with the performance standards set by the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Act 2013.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        Agree

       <p class="italic">
        Since the initial community engagements, based on community feedback and reflections on lessons learnt, Defence has modified the delivery method to incorporate both presentations as well as one-on-one discussions with subject matter experts. This, as well as greater involvement from relevant state and federal agencies including the

        Defence will continue to work with the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet's PFAS Taskforce to establish consistent engagement approaches in line with a whole-of-Government response to PFAS Contamination.
