        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the 76th report of the committee,
        <i>
         Treaties tabled on 28 March and 10 May 2006
        </i>
        . I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Report 76 contains the findings and binding treaty action recommendations of the committee’s review of six treaty actions tabled in parliament on 28 March and 10 May 2006. The committee found all the treaties to be in the interests of Australia. I will comment on all of the treaties reviewed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Indonesia
        </a>
        for cooperation in scientific research and technological development is a result of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade’s report of May 2005 titled
        <i>
         Near neighbours—good neighbours: an inquiry into Australia’s relationship with Indonesia
        </i>
        . This treaty and the less than treaty status collaboration in science and innovation, research and technology agreement offer the potential to expand and promote the Australia-Indonesia relationship, to enhance knowledge and to increase scientific and personal links in a mutually beneficial way. The treaty does this by providing the basis for activities performed and funded by a range of Australian science agencies and their Indonesian equivalents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agreement between the government of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Namibia" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Namibia
        </a>
        and the governments of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_War_Graves_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth War Graves Commission
        </a>
        provides for the maintenance of 426 war graves of members of the Commonwealth armed forces in Namibia. In addition, the agreement formalises the work already undertaken by the commission in Namibia. While there are no Australians among the identified Commonwealth graves, Australia is a founding member of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and recognises the important role the commission undertakes in remembrance of the Commonwealth war dead through its contribution to the commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agreement on social security between the government of Australia and the government of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Norway" rel="nofollow">
         Kingdom of Norway
        </a>
        provides for enhanced access to certain Australian and Norwegian social security benefits and greater portability of these benefits between countries. The agreement includes the age pension, the disability support pension for people who are severely disabled and the avoidance of double coverage for superannuation. Norway will reciprocate with the age pension, the disability pension and pensions for survivors. This treaty is the 16th such agreement that Australia has made with other countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agreement between the government of Australia and the government of the United States of America on cooperation in science and technology for homeland/domestic security matters establishes a framework to encourage, develop and facilitate bilateral cooperative activities in science and technology. The agreement strengthens Australia’s longstanding relationship with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        in the area of science and technology and enables Australian scientists and counter-terrorism agencies to benefit from collaborative research activities. Under the agreement, such activities would include development of threat and vulnerability analyses, staff exchange, prototype development and any events which have implications for domestic security, such as extreme weather conditions and pandemics.
       </p>
       <p>
        The International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IDEA" rel="nofollow">
         IDEA
        </a>
        , statutes, as amended at the extraordinary council meeting of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_IDEA" rel="nofollow">
         International IDEA
        </a>
        on 24 January 2006, improve the governance arrangements of the organisation. Established in 1995, International IDEA consists of 24 party states and is tasked with developing and strengthening democracy globally.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee heard that the 2003 amendments to International IDEA were not tabled in parliament. This did not provide an opportunity for the committee to be aware of the amendments and so review them. The committee heard that the 2003 amendments were made in preparation for International IDEA gaining observer status with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations General Assembly
        </a>
        . The 2003 amendments prohibited associate members and observers of International IDEA from voting or participating in the council’s decision making. The committee expects any future amendment to the current treaty action to be tabled in parliament as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         International Organisation
        </a>
        for Migration has for 55 years, since its establishment, been involved in meeting the ever-growing operational challenges of migration management, advancing the international understanding of migration issues, encouraging social and economic development through migration, and upholding the dignity and wellbeing of migrants everywhere. The amendments to the constitution of the International Organisation for Migration will streamline organisational processes and further strengthen the organisation’s responsiveness and service efficiency. I commend the report to the Senate.
