        My question is to the minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator McKenzie. I refer to the government's decision to cut more than $300,000 from Foodbank, an important community group that provides food to more than 710,000 Australians, including farmers struggling through the drought.
       </p>
       <p>
        The

        said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We're baffled and disappointed by this mid-drought, pre-Christmas cut to Foodbank. Farmers are important contributors to Foodbank, and 40 per cent of people assisted are in the bush. Please rethink this.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the minister agree with the National Farmers' Federation?

         , for your thoughtful question, and it's great to have a question related to agriculture and food production from the Labor Party, so keep them coming. I do usually agree with the

           Notwithstanding his intention to discuss, this morning Prime Minister Morrison refused to commit to reinstate the more than $300,000 cut from Foodbank. Given that 40 per cent of people assisted by Foodbank are in the bush, what representations has the Deputy Prime Minister made to ensure funding is reinstated?

            has made with respect to this. When we look at those in need in the regions, it is our government that is backing their capacity to get a job and that is backing the industries that underpin economic growth in the regions—that's agriculture and mining. So we are doing everything we can to ensure that the millions of Australians who don't live in our capital cities are supported, not just in terms of meeting their daily needs through things like—

                   , thank you for that very good advice. I shall adhere to it in the future. As I stated, the Prime Minister has announced that he will be speaking with the Department of Social Services' minister and seeking whether there's a need to review this decision. Absolutely, we stand to support those families and communities who are doing it tough at this time.

Senator Cameron's interjection, that they've never had it so good in the bush—what an atrocious statement. Is there some way that he might—

I didn't hear it, so I can't say whether it happened. If it was as you are saying, there is nothing unparliamentary contained in that either.

                                Senator Wong, I'll happily correct the record if I'm wrong, but he was being interrupted while he was raising a point of order and while I was speaking, while interjections were being made. No-one should be speaking while another is, least of all the person in the chair. I let senators raise a point of order. If they do something inappropriate, that will be called out. I cannot attest to an interjection I did not hear. Whether or not it happened, I made that ruling accordingly. I now call Senator McGrath.
