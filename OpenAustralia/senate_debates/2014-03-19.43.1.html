        My question is to Senator Abetz, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the decision to stand aside the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Sinodinos. When did the Prime Minister become aware that, as a director of Australian Water Holdings, Senator Sinodinos stood to gain a personal benefit of $10 million to $20 million if the company was awarded a contract for a public-private partnership by the

           As I understand the situation, all these events occurred prior to Senator Sinodinos becoming a senator and a minister and—listen carefully—before Mr Abbott became Prime Minister. If we want to trawl through everybody's history and what the Prime Minister may or may not have known about somebody well before or some time in the past, this person's—

             My point of order is direct relevance. The question was quite clear: when did the Prime Minister become aware of certain issues. If we could have an answer to that, if you could direct the minister to answer the question—

               simply say to those opposite that, if there are any friendships, any relationships, between honourable senators in this place and members in the House of Representatives, why don't you get the people over there to ask the question of the Prime Minister, because he might actually be able to tell you what was or was not in his mind.

                    , I rise on a point of order. It is relevance: the question is about the Prime Minister's state of awareness of this issue associated with the donations from AWH to the Liberal Party. If the senator cannot answer—if he is not aware—I accept that he may wish to take it on notice, but we are simply asking: when did the Prime Minister become aware of the facts as outlined by Senator Carr?

                      . What Senator Wong has not understood throughout this whole matter is that, at the moment, there are a whole range of assertions being made—assertions that
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
                       ICAC
                      </a>
                      are testing by hearing evidence from a range of people. And I am sure, in her former life, Senator Wong would have known that sometimes a case sounds very strong until the other side is heard. What I would simply say to her is: take a deep breath, and allow ICAC to undertake its task. And we will then see where the cards fall.
