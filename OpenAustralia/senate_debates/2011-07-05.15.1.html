           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           . I am very pleased to take the opportunity to respond to the senator about why it is important for us to price carbon and why we must reduce pollution. The government plans to ensure we do this in a way that very much recognises Labor values.
          </p>
          <p>
           As the Prime Minister has said, on Sunday the government will announce the full details of the carbon-pricing package. The government is pursuing a market mechanism for putting a price on pollution because this is the most effective way to reduce pollution. As we have approached the path of designing this package and the challenge of tackling climate change, as always we are guided by our Labor values of fairness and equity. That is why we have been working to ensure that in this package nine out of 10 households—some seven million households—get assistance through tax cuts or increases to payments or a combination of both. The vast majority of these households will not pay an additional cent as a result of pricing carbon. In addition, as we have made clear, we will put in place a buffer for three million low-income households of 20 per cent. We have made commitments to pensioners and to self-funded retirees who hold Commonwealth healthcare cards that they will also get assistance.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a big reform, but it is a necessary reform. It is important we price pollution so we can reduce it, it is important we price pollution so we can drive investment in clean energy and it is important we price pollution to recognise our responsibility for future generations.

             This is a major economic reform, an economic reform that will transform our economy, and like previous reforms those on this side will approach it in a fiscally responsible manner. We know of course that is not reflected in the policies of the other side. We know that the direct action plan promulgated by those opposite is, as Mr Turnbull says, a recipe for fiscal recklessness.

             Senator Joyce, that is what Mr Turnbull describes your policy as. As Mr Abbott himself admitted on
             <i>
              7.30
             </i>
             last night, the coalition's plan will be a hit on the budget. It will cost some $30 billion funded out of the budget, funded out of higher taxes—$720 per household in this country. That is the fiscally reckless plan promulgated by the opposition.

                There is very little support for the opposition's alternative plan. In fact, even within the opposition there is very little support for this alternative plan. We heard Senator Joyce himself making it very clear publicly that the opposition's plan would be ineffective. Unlike the government's policy, which has been supported by many leading economists—and I note a price on carbon was supported by, amongst others, former Liberal leader

                   used to believe in market mechanisms, but that legacy has long gone. The reason for it is clear: Mr Abbott will always put politics over policy; pragmatism over policy every time.

                     As the Prime Minister made clear in the announcement last night, the full details of the carbon price package will be announced this coming Sunday. What is really interesting is the clamour from the other side for detail because we know they have no interest in the detail of this debate whatsoever. They have no interest in good policy. They have no interest in sound economics. They have no interest in tackling climate change. They are interested only in trying to play politics with this issue.

But now what we see is the coalition led by a man who will always put pragmatism and politics over good policy and over what is important for Australia's future. No-one watching

                       last night could be in any doubt about what sort of leader Mr Abbott is: politics first and never the national interest—always the politics first. I would say this: in years to come—in five or 10 or 15 years time—people will judge those on that side of the chamber very harshly by the lack of responsibility they showed when it came to this important issue of tackling climate change.

                        , I ask a supplementary question. Given that the government have been working on their carbon tax for many months, why are the government trying to avoid parliamentary scrutiny by refusing to announce the details of their carbon tax until after the parliament has risen for the winter recess? Will the government recall the parliament for the announcement and to subject the carbon tax to the appropriate scrutiny rather than trying to bully the commercial networks to broadcast the Prime Minister's carbon tax statements?

                         I am sure the parliament will have plenty of opportunity to scrutinise the legislation which underpins the package, just as the parliament had an extraordinary amount of time to scrutinise the government's previous attempt to put a price on pollution. I would remind those opposite that I think that we had had at last count—and I could be wrong, but this is my recollection—some 17 parliamentary inquiries of one sort or another looking at pricing pollution. In addition, our legislation was presented to this chamber no fewer than three times. That was after—

                           . The three times the legislation was presented were after public consultation processes on a green paper, a white paper and draft legislation. You know what, Mr President? For those like Senator Abetz, who cannot countenance taking action, such scrutiny never made one iota of difference.

                            , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that the government has decided to keep the Australian people in the dark until after the parliament has risen, will the minister assure the Senate that Sunday's statement will contain all the details people need to know, all the exemptions, all the inclusions and all the exclusions and that Sunday's announcement will be the complete and final package?
