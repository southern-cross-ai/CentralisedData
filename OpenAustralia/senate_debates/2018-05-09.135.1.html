        had been subjected to a massacre by one country or another every 10-15 years, since the 11th century and until the Holocaust in Germany. Okay?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But why was this happening?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ...the reason for the hatred of the Jews is not their religion but their function in society. That is a different issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So the Jewish question, which was prevalent in all European countries, the anti-Jewish (sentiment) was not because of their religion, but because of their function in society, which had to do with usury, banks, and so on.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You may or may not know this, in 1933, one month after Hitler's rise to power, there was an agreement between the German Ministry of Economics and the Jewish Anglo-Palestinian Bank in Jerusalem. They agreed that any

         German Jew
        </a>
        who wants to emigrate to Palestine could have his movable and immovable property transferred to Palestine.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Did Hitler love the Jews to such a degree? Any Jew who wanted to emigrate to Palestine was entitled to receive all his property, both moveable and immoveable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... So their narrative about coming to this country because of their longing for Zion, or whatever - we're tired of hearing this. The truth is that this is a colonialist enterprise, aimed at planting a foreign body in this region...",

           On 4 May Foreign Minister Bishop condemned the comments by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_National_Authority" rel="nofollow">
            Palestinian National Authority
           </a>
           , saying they were deeply regrettable and anti-Semitic, going against historical facts. Similar condemnation also came from a number of foreign ministers. President Abbas reportedly later apologised, saying:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … we condemn anti-Semitism in all its forms and confirm our commitment to the 2-state solution and to live side by side in peace and security.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australia's support of a two-state solution is consistent.
