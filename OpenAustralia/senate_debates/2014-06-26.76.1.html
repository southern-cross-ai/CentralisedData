         I will just recap where we are up to. Yesterday, Senator Xenophon asked a series of questions around the impact of this legislation and the impact of the amendments which repeal the re-registration process. He was particularly focused on the impact of pesticides and chemicals on bees, given the concerns around hive loss and bee decline, which we do not have a lot of numbers around. I have a series of questions around some of the chemicals that are banned in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
          EU
         </a>
         and other places around the world and claims that Senator Colbeck made yesterday in the debate that, in fact, they had not been banned. So I will just flag that I have got some questions there.

         This amendment seeks to address some of the concerns that we have with the repeal of the re-registration. I will just describe what the amendment does and go through it in a bit more detail. We believe that there is no doubt that some agricultural and veterinary chemicals have damaged human and environmental health—and I do not think anybody in this place has argued that that is not the case—and that they continue to pose risks both to human health and to environmental health. Risk management, we believe, should be at the core of any registration program, and those chemicals that pose unacceptable and unmanageable risks should not be permitted in Australia. We want the approach to risk taken by the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, commonly known as the APVMA, to reflect contemporary science in toxicology and regulatory approaches and reflect approaches that happen in other countries. We are concerned that this is currently not the case.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday I went through in a bit more detail how some of the chemicals and pesticides that are currently on the register have been grandfathered. Despite claims to the contrary, they have not been adequately assessed and, if they were assessed a significant period of time ago, some of that information has now been lost. There is absolutely no doubt that we have chemicals and pesticides currently in use in Australia that do pose unmanageable risk. There is also no doubt that the current more ad hoc approach that is taken means that assessment of agricultural and veterinary chemicals and pesticides has been taking a significantly long period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our argument is that not only does that long period of time mean that those chemicals are being used in the environment, continuing to affect human health and the environment, but the length of time and doubt that has passed over the continued use of these pesticides and chemicals ties up resources of farmers. It means that farmers and industry are not encouraged to look for other alternatives to management. That may be area wide management, which we are talking about with fenthion, and in that process you may not just be looking for one solution. Without the re-registration scheme and its associated regulations, there is still too much discretion being given to the APVMA to determine undue hazard to the safety of people and the environment. Without a suitable framework in which to operate, this poses further risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendment that I have moved here is in fact no substitute for a proper re-registration scheme, but it will add to the criteria for reassessment; it will operate to ensure that there are some clear and transparent criteria for the APVMA in its decision making about whether it should go ahead and reassess.
        </p>

         Progress reported.
