         Thanks, Senator Henderson. I was actually asked about this matter on Sky News myself yesterday morning, and the point I made there was that everyone, no matter whether they're a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         of a large Australian company or a senator or any member of the public, is entitled to feel safe in their own home. As I think one of our ministers—and certainly Minister Rowland—commented last week, it's simply unacceptable for anyone to present a risk to a human being in their own home, as would appear to have occurred in Perth last week.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
          The ABC
         </a>
         managing director has made statements that he is investigating this matter. I think it would be a good idea for us to reserve judgement until we see the results of that investigation, but I have seen the photos that Senator Henderson refers to and, as I said yesterday, I think they're very worrying. I know that Minister Rowland has already sought information from the ABC about what has occurred here. Of course, the ABC does have editorial independence, and that does need to be respected, but I think all of us would be concerned if we learned that a film crew from any media outlet was involved in any way in an activity that is intimidating and goes way beyond what should be acceptable in public debate.

            As I say, I suggest that we should wait and reserve judgement until that investigation is complete, but, as I said yesterday, I think that the image that has surfaced is very worrying. Minister Rowland, I know, is taking this matter seriously and has sought information from the ABC as is appropriate. We are very interested in hearing the outcome of that investigation.

However, could you please clarify: has the minister had a response as yet? If not, is that acceptable to the minister?

               I'm aware that the ABC has confirmed that a television crew was present to film the activities of this activist group for an upcoming report, but the ABC has said that they had no prior knowledge of the nature of behaviour that would occur. But the minister, I know, takes this matter very seriously, and that's why she has sought further information from the ABC on this matter.

                  I've already said, Senator Henderson, a couple of times now that the minister has sought information from the ABC. I understand she has also spoken with the ABC chair, who provided reassurance that the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_TV" rel="nofollow">
                   ABC TV
                  </a>
                  crew had no prior knowledge of the nature of the behaviour that would occur. But, clearly, with the image that surfaced yesterday morning, there are some further questions to be answered by ABC management, and that's why the minister's office has sought further information. I think we need to recognise that this image only came to light yesterday and it's being handled seriously.

                     Well, that's the first I've heard of a proposal from the opposition to establish such a Senate inquiry. I'm not sure whether that's been canvassed with anyone else within government ranks. Ordinarily, what one would do when proposing a Senate inquiry is come and have a chat to people rather than use a question in question time to announce that intention. We know that's not the purpose of the question. I've already said, a couple of times now, that this matter is being investigated by ABC management. I think the appropriate thing to do, given their editorial independence, something that former coalition governments haven't well understood—I knew that would get a rise.

                           suggest to Senator Henderson, and all members of the opposition, that I think the appropriate way to handle this is to see what the outcome of the ABC investigation is, rather than leap to judgement, set up a Senate inquiry and get the culture war running again, which would apparently be behind the senator's question.
