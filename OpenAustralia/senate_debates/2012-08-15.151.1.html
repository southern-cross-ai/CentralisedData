        'There was no way I could've afforded my own place. I had no bond, no rental history, no credit history, no hope.' That was a quote I heard last week, which was Homeless Persons Week, and tonight I would like to acknowledge the excellent work of all those people and organisations in our community who work very hard to assist people like the person who made that quoteâ€”people who are without a place to call home and who are in desperate need of hope. Many of those organisations are helping the federal government implement its plans to reduce homelessness, which is a priority policy objective for the Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2008, the government has committed almost $5 billion in new funding to provide support services and programs to assist people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless This funding includes the $1.1 billion National Partnership Agreement on Homelessness, which has seen over 180 new or expanded services established across the country. The Gillard government believes that all Australians should have a safe and secure home and, for this reason, we have invested over $20 billion to make housing more affordable. Through our $6 billion social housing investment we have plans to build more than 20,000 new social housing homes, of which 18,000 are already completed.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we know, there are many reasons why people become homeless. It can start from family issues and conflict, domestic violence, relationship breakdowns, substance abuse, mental illness, financial hardship, unemployment and disengagement and sexual abuse. Whatever the reason for homelessness, there are organisations in our community that, like the government, are committed to finding solutions to this problem. A

        organisation is doing some very innovative things to help homeless people rebuild their lives in Adelaide and

         Common Ground
        </a>
        Limited is a not-for-profit housing company that provides accommodation for homeless persons, people at risk of becoming homeless and low-income earners.
       </p>
       <p>
        The model of housing and funding that Common Ground pursues is a novel type in this country. Common Ground works with government and the private sector to purchase and renovate suitable property in central Adelaide, as well as in Port Augusta, to boost the availability of long-term, affordable rental housing options for low-income earners and those who are homeless or who are at risk of it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Launched in 2006 as an initiative of the South Australian Labor government and local business leaders, Common Ground Adelaide provides a stable home with support services, understanding and opportunities so that individuals can become self-sufficient and achieve independence in all aspects of their lives. While the Common Ground concept was conceived under a Labor government, I note with pleasure that the current chairman of its board is Mr Alexander Downer, the former member for Mayo for the Liberal Party and, of course, a former minister in the Howard government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I visited Common Grounds' developments in the former Sands and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacDougall" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_CBD" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Here, in a building that had been disused for some time, Common Ground has developed a residential complex. People live in self-contained apartments, sharing the communal spaces as well as the office space for support services, workshops and training activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        In touring the 52 rental unit facility at Light Square with other MPs and the deputy chair of the board, Mary Patetsos, I saw for myself how bringing together a mix of people, including those who have been long-term rough sleepers and those on low incomes, in a residential complex really does improve lives. For some of the residents, Common Ground is their first real address in their adult life. By bringing stability to their lives with high-quality shelter, warmth and basic needs, Common Ground provides that vital step for homeless people to help them achieve a positive life change. Other community organisations and, importantly, private companies have supported the concept. They contribute with cash donations, in-kind support or pro bono services. On site is a medical and dental clinic staffed by medical students and professionals from nearby universities. The major community sponsor of the project is Santos, a fine South Australian company. Without that private sector support, the project would not be able to flourish. Many other private sector organisations also contribute.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of the 142 residents that have been assisted by Common Ground Adelaide since 2008, there are some remarkable success stories, with many accounts of formerly homeless people becoming independent and ready to seize the opportunities that their new living arrangements have provided them with. One of the best stories I heard on my visit was about a young woman who grew up in a low socioeconomic area in a dysfunctional home. She left home at 16 and spent many years living with addiction, violence and no stability. Since entering Common Ground, she has overcome her battle with drugs and alcohol and, most impressively, she has unleashed her obvious intelligence, enrolled in university and has achieved exceptional results in her medical studies. She is now studying towards her PhD so she can become a doctor and work in developing countries. Another story was that of an Indigenous man who was chronically homeless. Since finding stable accommodation and support services at Common Ground, he has completed a university degree, he has been offered employment, and he has also discovered a talent for art. Many of his works are exhibited at Common Ground.
       </p>
       <p>
        An interesting aspect of the Common Ground model is that the accommodation provided there is actually a home, not just transitional accommodation on the way to somewhere else. Subject to complying with conditions, the people who live here can stay as long as they want to or need to. It is their decision when and if they leave. The staff of Common Ground noted that some of the residents would probably remain for many years, perhaps forever, in their accommodation. Some might stay for a few years, some for a few months. The needs of individuals are different and the Common Ground model acknowledges and accommodates that.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was interesting to hear that it is often women residents of Common Ground who make the decision to move on to other housing arrangements so that another woman can have the opportunity for stable housing that Common Ground provides. Another interesting fact we heard on our tour is the pride that formerly homeless people take in maintaining their units. Often they maintain their units in better condition than the regular renters who lived in the same complex.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the challenges for Common Ground is to expand housing opportunities for familiesâ€”women with children, for example. The Light Square and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Franklin Street
        </a>
        sites are not suitable for people with children, and Common Ground is looking for other places to redevelop in conjunction with governments and private contributions. It was also noted that the configuration of the Light Square site is not comfortable for some women, especially those who are or have been victims of domestic violence and for whom a safe and secure house is a priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was heartening to see how Common Ground, which does much with little and which struggles to secure private funding and donations, is always looking ahead, planning new types of accommodation and arrangements to suit different needs. On my visit to Common Ground, I could see that the organisation has done a great job in providing stable, affordable housing in safety and comfort to homeless people. The independence and personal development programs they offer assist residents on their pathways to independent and successful lifestyles. Projects like Common Ground do indeed offer people hope. I would like to conclude with another quote that I heard last week:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Doing things, attempting things, taking a risk. I wouldn't have done that if I hadn't been here.
