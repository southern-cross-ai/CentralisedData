        My question is to the Minister for Finance, representing the Treasurer, Senator Cormann. I refer to the Treasurer's latest thought bubble involving young Australians accessing their superannuation to purchase a home. Does the finance minister stand by his previous statement of 'Pumping more money into the housing market by letting people access their superannuation savings more freely will not bring down the cost of housing;'?

         My views were very clearly put on the record towards the end of last year. The government has not actually put any proposal on the table to let people have access to their superannuation to buy their first home. However, we do know who has put a proposal like that on the table before, none other than former Labor Prime Minister Paul Keating, who in 1993 said that we should let people have access to their superannuation to buy their first home.

            No, it was not 15 per cent in 1993. Senator Carr was already in the Senate at the time so he will be able to confirm what I am saying. He is trying not to look at me because he knows that I am telling the truth. He knows that it was none other than former Prime Minister Paul Keating who said that we should let people have access to their superannuation to buy their first home.
           </p>
           <p>
            The truth is that all the Treasurer has said and all the Prime Minister has said in the context of proposals being put together was 'let's have a conversation about it'. We should have lots of conversations. But what we should have a conversation about is? How we can fix the mess that the Labor Party left behind? How we can get spending growth back on a more sustainable foundation? How we can get the budget back under control so that we can put Australia a stronger foundation for the future, protect our living standards, build a stronger more prosperous economy, create more jobs and ensure that everybody has the best possible opportunity to get ahead?
           </p>
           <p>
            The Labor Party coming in here and playing politics again does not actually add anything to the debate. What the Labor Party should do is engage seriously in the conversation about the future of our country.

             , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to comments by the Prime Minister who has described accessing superannuation to purchase a home as 'a perfectly good and respectable idea'. I also refer to comments by the alternative Prime Minister, the Minister for Communications, who said it was, 'a thoroughly bad idea'. Who is correct, Prime Minister Abbott or Minister Turnbull?

              There are a lot of good people from across Australia who have put that idea to us. The Prime Minister is very respectful of good people across Australia putting forward ideas. The government does not just dismiss any idea that is put forward in an arrogant fashion like the Labor Party appears to do.
             </p>
             <p>
              We have a Prime Minister with a thoroughly bipartisan spirit. He did not want Mr Keating to feel bad about the fact that this is an idea that he has put forward in the past. I would have thought that the Labor Party would be grateful for the bipartisan spirit with which our Prime Minister—

But the question was about the inconsistency—or the contradiction—between the alternative Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull, who said this was a thoroughly bad idea, and the Prime Minister, who says this is a perfectly good idea. That was the question and I would ask the minister to be directly relevant to the question.

                    , because we on this side of the chamber thought that Bill Shorten was the alternative Prime Minister. But, of course, Senator Wong has different ideas!

                            To divert money into housing at any stage during the build-up in superannuation savings is not consistent with having a good retirement income system.
                           </p>
                           <p>

                             Mr Murray is a fine man. And do you know what? When you are having a national conversation you actually want to hear a diversity of views. We have people from the Labor side who think it is a good idea to let people have access to their super to access their first home, as we have people on the coalition side—indeed, I think that Senator Canavan has pursued similar proposals in the past. And also Senator Xenophon, indeed—and I see him nodding, not from his chair. There is a whole range of people who have put a range of diverse views. But the government is actually very keen to engage with all the good people across Australia. We are not here dismissing views that are right from the top.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             My personal views are well known. I have put them on the record in the past. There is no government proposal on the table, but I see that the Labor Party is very uncomfortable about having a national conversation about anything. It is time that the Labor Party actually started focusing on public policy.
                            </p>
