        I wish to provide further information to the chamber in response to Senator Lambie's question.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        published a story this morning detailing the bastardisation to which I believe Senator Lambie refers. Defence was made aware on 22 October of the existence of the video to which I believe Senator Lambie refers and immediately urged the individual's lawyers, Operational Legal Australia, to refer the matter to the civilian authorities. Defence has now also referred the matter to the Joint Military Police Unit for review. Defence has not seen the footage nor been provided with a copy of the video. Defence is working to identify those who are pictured in this morning's ABC report. It is not appropriate for me to comment further on individual matters, as I'm sure the chamber would appreciate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me reiterate the observations I made in relation to Senator Lambie's first question. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        is well known and highly respected around the world for its exemplary standards and its insistence on them, and I thank those members of the ADF—the many, many women and men of the ADF—for their past and ongoing service to our country. A unifying set of defence values and behaviour sets the benchmark for what defence expects of its people in the workplace. All defence personnel are expected to behave in accordance with the defence values and behaviours. Defence does not tolerate unacceptable behaviour and takes action when unacceptable behaviour occurs, in accordance with the department's unacceptable-behaviour policy. A soldier's service has recently been terminated as a result of sending inappropriate images to his colleagues. Importantly, these instances are few. The vast majority of our personnel are a credit to the Australian Defence Force and to the nation. Defence has extensive awareness programs and support services in place to educate and assist all personnel. This includes training officers and ADF cadets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government is very proud of our Defence Force. Our ADF has been responsive and able and available to assist our Australian communities through some of the most difficult times this year and last year. They have been here for us through support and recovery through bushfires and floods. They've protected our communities as we deal with COVID-19 impacts, and we thank them for their service.
