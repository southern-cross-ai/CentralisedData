         I can certainly guarantee we will take the more considered and sensible approach choice than some of the moderates, such as Senator Birmingham, who used to support sensible policy in this area and are now lined up behind a bloke who thinks climate change is ‘absolute crap’, which were his words.

                    As I said, we are a Labor government and as the Prime Minister has said we will apply Labor values to this policy area as we do to all policy areas. We are conscious of the range of difficult policy decisions, including the ones Senator Birmingham references, that will have to be made, which is why the government are working sensibly and methodically through the multiparty committee to deal with a whole range of issues. They include coverage, they include the price level and they include what sort of assistance should be provided and how that transition should occur, and we will continue to do that work.

                     , I ask a supplementary question. Given the minister provided no guarantee, will she ensure that the Greens, and Senator Milne in particular, do not get their way and that no Australian export or trade exposed industry will be left significantly worse off, jeopardising billions in exports and thousands of jobs?

                      We are working through the development of this policy through the multiparty committee. That involves not just the Greens but, as you know, other members of the crossbench. It would be better on this issue, which is important to the future of the nation, if the opposition were prepared to deal constructively with it but we are very clear that under their this leader, Mr Abbott, there will be no constructive engagement.

                               Senator Brown, I do not believe that you have a point of order but I will go away and look at the question. If there is a need to come back to the chamber at a later stage I will. I am just giving you my early advice. Senator Birmingham, start again.

                                . Given the Prime Minister has been so happy and cavalier in breaking her promises to the Australian people and Australian industry about having a carbon tax just to keep the Greens happy, how can they trust these people, who keep claiming to be a Labor government, not to let the Greens get their way and decimate Australia’s export and trade exposed industries?

                                  Senator Brown, I will look at both questions and if I feel the need to come back to the chamber, as I said to you, I will. I will allow the question to stand at this stage and I ask Senator Wong to respond to that part of the question which she has representational responsibility for.

                                   I think Senator Birmingham’s question is in fact a re-run of the first or the second question, which I responded to. Again I say: these are part of the range of complex decisions that have to be made to put this reform in place. We will work through those issues with industry, with other stakeholders and, through the multiparty committee, with other members of this parliament. But, because it is in the national interest to do so, we will do so. It is regrettable that we are faced not with constructive dialogue with the opposition, or engagement, but with the sort of fearmongering that is implicit, or explicit, in your question and an opposition which simply is looking to what it believes is short-term political interest, not the long-term interests of the nation.
