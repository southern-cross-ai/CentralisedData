        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Yesterday, the minister boasted that the government had already adopted all bar one of the Finkel report recommendations. Given the one recommendation not agreed is the single most important recommendation—the establishment of a clean energy target—when will the government finally make a decision?

         process—the Finkel review, the government has adopted 49 of the 50 recommendations of the Finkel report. Senator Bilyk, I must say I entirely disagree with your view that the only recommendation that matters is the one which is currently under consideration. I don't agree with that at all.
        </p>
        <p>
         If you read the Finkel report, if you read the recommendations, you will understand, Senator Bilyk, that they represent a comprehensive strategy to attack the twin issues of energy affordability and energy reliability. These are the issues that matter most to the Australian people, Senator Bilyk—reliability and affordability. In approaching the Finkel report, and in approaching the appropriate policy choices and policy responses to this problem, this government will be guided by pragmatism. We will be guided by engineering; we will be guided by the facts. One thing that we will not be guided by, Senator Bilyk, is ideology. It is because your side of politics was guided by ideology in its approach to energy policy that, during the period of the Labor government, electricity prices rose by 101 per cent over six years. Because your side of politics, Senator Bilyk, was guided by ideology not engineering, in the state of

         the Weatherill Labor government cannot even keep the lights on. The Turnbull government is determined to ensure that power in Australia is affordable and that supply is reliable. And that will shape our response.

            With all due respect, I think it reflects the difference between the opposition's attitude to policymaking and the government's attitude to policymaking—that you seem to regard the careful consideration of an important recommendation as policy paralysis. Far from being policy paralysis, Senator Bilyk, we are very carefully considering the one outstanding recommendation of the Finkel report. In particular, the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Mr Frydenberg, are carefully considering that recommendation. In the near future, they will be bringing a recommendation to the government.

              Isn't it clear that the government is so divided and the Prime Minister so weak that the only thing the Prime Minister can do on energy prices is to have a cup of tea with those profiting from increased prices?

                   As I was saying, we are interested in getting the policy right and, as is evident from both the question and the asinine interjections of some of those opposite like Senator Watts, they are only interested in playing political games. As I said in answer to Senator Bilyk's first supplementary question, we are considering very carefully the one outstanding recommendation of the Finkel report that is under consideration, and the relevant minister, Mr Frydenberg, in collaboration with the Prime Minister, will be bringing a recommendation to the government in the near future. But, in the meantime, as is evident from the important meeting happening in this building today, the government is active on other fronts.
