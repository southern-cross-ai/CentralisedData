         I thank Senator Grogan for her question. On 14 October, every Australian will have a once-in-a-generation chance to bring our country together and to change it for the better, to vote for recognition and listening so we can get better results. You see, Aboriginal and

         Australians want the same things for their children as everyone else does. They want them to be healthy. They want them to do well at school. They want them to get a good job. They want them to have the best opportunities they can. And that is what we're all saying yes to.
        </p>

         The call for the Voice did not come from politicians in this chamber. It came directly from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people after years of work and discussions across the country. Nearly 250 Aboriginal and

         , leaders and elders endorsed the Uluru Statement from the Heart in 2017, and it says, 'We invite you to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future.' This is a modest ask of recognition of this land's

         in the Constitution through a Voice to the Parliament, a voice to help practical progress in health, education, employment and housing to make sure governments make better decisions and spend money wisely. All this is needed because of the challenges facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people: a life expectancy eight years shorter than that for non-

         , children almost twice as likely to die before their first birthday, a suicide rate twice as high, and fewer opportunities for education and training.
        </p>
        <p>
         Governments of both political persuasions with good intentions have spent billions trying to deal with these issues, but we have not achieved lasting improvement.

           Thank you, Minister. There are some alarming facts in there that we should all be deeply mindful of. Can the minister please explain to the Senate why this referendum is on constitutional recognition through a Voice to Parliament rather than on recognition alone?

            people is for a referendum for constitutional recognition through a Voice to Parliament. Now Mr Dutton is out there talking about his referendum. He's out there saying he supports a referendum, just not this referendum. He supports a voice but just not this voice. It's really clear yet again: we see Mr Dutton playing political games because his political strategy, tried and true, is to try to build himself up by tearing everything else down.

                    I'll just refresh: can the minister please inform the Senate how consultation has guided the proposal for the Voice and why that is so important?

                     The idea of constitutional recognition through a voice began with Aboriginal and

                     people themselves, but it's clear that Mr Dutton isn't listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We'd invite him to speak to people like Sean Gordon, the Liberals for Yes spokesperson, who recently said:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     For politicians to go out and propose something … alternate to what Indigenous people asked for … speaks to our disempowerment as Indigenous people …
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     But it isn't surprising that Mr Dutton didn't consult the overwhelming majority of

                     </a>
                     people; in fact, it doesn't appear that Mr Dutton is even consulting his colleagues. Mr Pitt said today that no proposal for another referendum has been put to the party room. And Senator Nampijinpa Price and Mr Littleproud are not prepared to say they were consulted. So the question is: who is Mr Dutton—
