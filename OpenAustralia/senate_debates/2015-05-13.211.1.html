        Pursuant to order and at the request of the chairs of the respective committees, I present the report of the Environment and Communications References Committee on environmental biosecurity, together with the
        <i>
         Hansard

        record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be printed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to table this report into invasive species as the chair of the Environment and Communications Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to thank all those who took the time to write a submission.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee received almost 100 submissions from organisations, government bodies, experts and interested individuals across the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge those who took time out of their schedules to appear before the committee hearings in Perth, Sydney, Hobart and Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        And of course I have to recognise the great work of the Environment and Communications Committee secretariat under the very capable guidance of secretary Christine McDonald.
       </p>
       <p>
        The team has done an excellent job, yet again.
       </p>
       <p>
        Biosecurity in Australia is facing a number of challenges, not least of which is the increasing cross-border movements of people, cargo and mail.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these pathways present a risk that an environmental or agricultural pest could breach our borders.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time, climate change is changing the geographic range that invasive species can thrive in.
       </p>
       <p>
        And of course staff cuts at government agencies and reduction in research funding are also hitting hard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Environmental biosecurity faces extra challenges because it does not have the same range of stakeholders to contribute financially to biosecurity efforts as industry biosecurity does.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also faces greater difficulties in detection, and, because it functions across a much broader range of species and ecosystems, the task becomes even more complex.
       </p>
       <p>
        The inquiry had broad terms of reference to consider the effectiveness of Australia's arrangements to prevent the entry and establishment of invasive species likely to harm Australia's natural environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee considered how well Australia has responded to recent incursions from exotic organisms.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also looked at how prepared Australia might be for future incursions by considering how well we identify risks, determine priorities and undertake contingency planning.
       </p>
       <p>
        This took in analysis of surveillance, compliance monitoring, enforcement and reporting activities, along with the institutional arrangements for environmental biosecurity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee heard from a number of witnesses about the shortcomings of the current arrangements, and the best way forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the basis of this, it put forward 26 recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think this provides a great framework from which to proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first recommendation was that the newly legislated Inspector-General of Biosecurity undertake a systematic review to determine how well environmental biosecurity concerns are addressed within the broader biosecurity framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee also made a number of recommendations to improve arrangements between the federal and state and territory governments under the National Environmental Biosecurity Response Agreement, or NEBRA.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also recognise that there are difficulties in assessing the success or otherwise of our current efforts due to a lack of meaningful performance indicators.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result, a number of recommendations focus on developing meaningful methodologies to measure progress, an audit of the implementation of Australia's Biodiversity Conservation Strategy.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also suggested reviews of funding allocations processes in order to minimise delays for time-sensitive work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another area of potential improvement is that of reporting, and the committee recommends the creation of a national priority list of pests and diseases of concern.
       </p>
       <p>
        One issue that was reported by many submitters to the inquiry was a decline in the level of scientific expertise and a reduction in research funding to address environmental biosecurity in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result, the committee recommended that the Department of Industry and Science look at these issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        This would include a strategy to address the decline in expertise, a review to prioritise our research needs, which would include specific investigation of our capacity to examine the effects of climate change on invasive species.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a similar vein, the committee recommended that the Commonwealth establish a taxonomic identification service that calls on existing expertise to be used in a more efficient and coordinated manner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another area of concern that some submitters raised was the great risk posed by internet retailers that sell plants and seeds into the country that breach our import requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        In response to this the committee recommended that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        needs to undertake enforcement activities and work with these businesses to ensure that appropriate warnings are displayed before purchase.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to specific threats, the committee recommended that measures in the Tramp Ant Threat Abatement Plan are fully implemented.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also called on the Department of Agriculture to review its cargo surveillance measures in order to increase detection rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another recommendations looked at the horticultural industries and called for standardised labelling, weed identification, and sales tracking protocols.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also recognised the risk of privately owned birds escaping and put in a recommendation to strengthen regulations around private aviculture imports.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along similar lines, the committee found it would be useful to do some work on identifying the pathways by which exotic birds are entering the country and develop a national database of seized exotic wildlife.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were also recommendations for a national mandatory biofouling management regime and more regular ship inspections targeted in biofouling.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the marine area, the committee recommended improved border surveillance for freshwater fish imports and the implementation of the on-arrival fish health monitoring program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final recommendation in the report called for a national framework for managing biosecurity in the unique environment of Australia's islands.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
