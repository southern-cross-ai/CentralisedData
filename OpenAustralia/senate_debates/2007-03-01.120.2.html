 The

         ANZUS Treaty
        </a>
        , underpinned by shared values, remains vital to Australian security.

 The alliance has proven to be adaptable and relevant, and has provided the foundation of our defence and security relationship since 1951.

 The continued utility of ANZUS was demonstrated by its invocation in the days following the terrorist attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001.

 The capacity of Australia and the United States to respond to evolving contemporary threats is underscored by Australia’s ongoing cooperation in military operations in our immediate region and beyond.

 The breadth of the relationship was demonstrated when US and Australian militaries united to respond to humanitarian disasters, such as the 2004
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Indian Ocean
        </a>
        tsunami and severe earthquakes in Pakistan in 2005.

 The high levels of trust and common purpose manifest in all of these endeavours are firmly based in the shared values which underpin the alliance.

         Recommendation 2
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee acknowledges that the free passage of information on the internet is likely to ensure that threat techniques faced by western forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are transmitted to disaffected groups in our region, meaning future regional conflicts may become increasingly violent and lethal. The Committee recommends that force structure decisions must therefore be based on the provision of the best possible protection for Australian Defence personnel.

        agrees that Australian Defence personnel should be provided with the best possible protection, based on the principle that force protection should be optimised in accordance with operational requirements, without compromising other functions or elements of capability.

 This will often involve, inter alia, preparedness, doctrine, tactics and rules of engagement in addition to force structure decisions on major platforms or systems.

 These decisions will assess the current and future risk posed by a full range of conventional and non-conventional threats, rather than focusing solely on specific techniques used presently by threat groups in Iraq and Afghanistan.

       <p class="italic">
        The Howard Government remains strongly committed to Australia’s Antarctic programme. It recognises the significance to Australia of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty" rel="nofollow">
         Antarctic Treaty
        </a>
        system and the importance of our contribution to it.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        values Australia’s leadership in Antarctic science and in Antarctic environmental protection initiatives.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Consistent with this commitment, the Government welcomed the inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital
        </a>
        and External Territories into the adequacy of funding for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Antarctic_Division" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Antarctic Division
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Environment_and_Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Department of the Environment and Water Resources
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes that the Joint Standing Committee reviewed the Department’s annual reports, obtained briefings from the Australian Antarctic Division and conducted public hearings between March and June 2004.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government thanks the Joint Standing Committee for its report Antarctica:

 Australia’s Pristine Frontier:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report" rel="nofollow">
         Report
        </a>
        on the adequacy of funding for Australia’s Antarctic Program. The Government appreciates the considerable efforts of the Committee members and all others who assisted in development of the report’s recommendations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the heavy resources demands placed on the Australian Antarctic Division’s logistical, research and environmental activities because of the remoteness of those activities and the difficult climate. In addition, there are increasing costs associated with compliance with environmental standards and with occupational health and safety management in an inherently hostile and sensitive environment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government remains committed to an effective and collaborative Antarctic Science programme, and encourages thorough examination of opportunities for international cooperation in Antarctic research and logistic support. Consistent with this commitment, in May 2005 the Government made a four-year $46.3 million funding boost to make possible an inter-continental Airlink between Hobart and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casey_Station" rel="nofollow">
         Casey Station
        </a>
        . This is the largest single increase in spending for the Antarctic programme for over two decades.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Direct access to Antarctica by a fast and safe Airlink is no longer a dream.

 This initiative will significantly modernise the Australian Antarctic Division’s capacity to support activities in Antarctica. In addition, it will give Australia an Antarctic presence consistent with our national interest and with the Government’s long term commitment to our continuing leadership in the region.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is confident that the provision of these additional resources will enable the Australian Antarctic Division to:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         ensure that Australia continues to play an active and leading role in Antarctic science research;
        </li>
        <li>
         build on its collaborative partnerships with other Antarctic nations, and to significantly enhance the public profile of Australia’s Antarctic science programme; and.
        </li>
        <li>
         fulfil its legislative environmental and cultural heritage obligations.

         The Committee recommends that the Australian Government makes funding available in the 2005-06 financial year to enable a scoping study to be conducted to determine the need for a new dedicated marine research vessel to advance marine science in general and, the Australian Government’s goals for Australia’s Antarctic programme.

         Southern Ocean
        </a>
        in support of the Australian Government’s goals for Antarctica. It also understands the less-than-ideal situation inherent in the multi-purpose nature of Australia’s existing Antarctic research voyages.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Antarctic Division of the Department of the Environment and Water Resources will be commencing a new tender process for the provision of shipping services for the 2007/08 financial year. As part of the budget process tied to this tender the Australian Antarctic Division will review its operational requirements in light of the impending introduction of the intercontinental airlink between Hobart and Casey Station and the impact that this will have on the type of shipping service required to meet the needs of the Australian Antarctic programme. The Government recognises the importance of maintaining a viable and world class capability to undertake marine science in the Southern Ocean and this will be addressed as part of this process.
       </p>

        Accepted, with publication options to be considered at a later date.  The Government acknowledges the importance of assessing the relative effectiveness of NTRBs in meeting their statutory obligations and is working on developing and improving a range of comparative assessment data.  There are, however, significant complexities associated with establishing key performance indicators on which to base relevant data.  NTRBs’ operating environments differ widely, for example, with respect to: the extent to which native title may have been extinguished or connection maintained in the NTRB’s area; levels of future act activity within the NTRB’s area; the degree of intra-indigenous disputation within the NTRB’s area; and the policies of State and Territory governments towards resolving native title matters.  Comparative assessments based solely on uniform key performance indicators - such as claims or future act matters finalised - would therefore be of limited assistance in determining an NTRB’s relative effectiveness.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of the existing funding and reporting framework, OIPC has therefore concentrated on developing mechanisms for comparing NTRBs’ success in completing activities nominated in their operational plans.  To make these comparisons more meaningful, OIPC will encourage NTRBs to adopt more uniform activity descriptors where appropriate, while remaining sensitive to the need for NTRBs to plan their workloads in response to local circumstances.  This process will be assisted by performance enhancement activities which target common NTRB needs and will lead to more uniform ways of working.  These activities are discussed in more detail in the response to Recommendation 8. The Government will also consider other ways in which more objective comparisons between NTRBs might be facilitated.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the complexities outlined above, the Government would be hesitant to publish annual comparative data on the relative effectiveness of NTRBs at this stage. It will however give further consideration to this possibility as funding and reporting frameworks are refined.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not accepted.  The Minister is not presently required to consider independent advice in making decisions about NTRB recognition.  Under the proposed reforms, the Minister would make decisions about recognition more frequently than at present but would not be required to consider additional criteria in doing so.  The introduction of re-recognition requirements would not affect the substance of the advice on the relevant criteria provided to the Minister by OIPC.  As at present, the Minister will be required to consider whether an NTRB has satisfactorily performed and would be capable of satisfactorily performing NTRB functions.  OIPC holds substantial amounts of information relevant to these criteria and its staff have practical experience in gauging whether they have been met.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        NTRBs would be able to make submissions to the Minister on re-recognition decisions.  Further, as is presently the case for recognition decisions, NTRBs could seek review of a decision under the Administrative Decisions (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Review" rel="nofollow">
         Judicial Review
        </a>
        ) Act 1977.  The proposed reforms will therefore retain existing procedural safeguards for NTRBs.  At the same time, the re-recognition process will bring more accountability to the native title system as a whole compared with current indefinite recognition arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The current reforms are also designed to improve efficiency in the native title system and the Committee’s recommendation is not compatible with this objective.
