          The Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) was founded in 1982.

            Board of Management
           </a>
           considered that it was time to make a critical appraisal of its progress and achievements so far.
          </li>
          <li>
           In order that such an appraisal should as independent and objective as possible, the Board decided that part of it should consist of an external review.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p class="italic">
          The final report of this review lauded the high standing that ACIAR had already achieved in the field of international agricultural research.

         <ul>
          <li>
           With very few exceptions, this positive reaction was reflected in the views of all who had been associated with ACIAR, whether as participants in collaborative projects or as members of sister institutions.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p class="italic">
          The report made 24 recommendations on future policies and strategies, and since then, the Centre has undergone several reviews.
