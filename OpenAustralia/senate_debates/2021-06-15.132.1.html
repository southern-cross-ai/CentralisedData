        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. The Prime Minister has, for almost two years, refused to answer any questions about his friendship with prominent

         I am surprised that Senator Wong has framed the question in that way. Let me make it very clear, as the Prime Minister has, that he sees
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QA" rel="nofollow">
          QA
         </a>
         non as being a discredited and dangerous fringe group. The Prime Minister has been very clear in his condemnation of the organisation, his rejection of the approaches of it and very clear in relation to the fact that the Prime Minister takes his security advice from the nation's security agencies. The Prime Minister could not have been clearer in that regard. The fact that those opposite may wish to ask questions about the husband of a friend of the Prime Minister's wife is a question for them. The Prime Minister's position in relation to the security advice and briefings he receives and his actions upon those has been clear, as has his condemnation of this organisation.

These are claims that Mr Stewart has made. Why has the Prime Minister not repudiated them?

               I hear some of the interjections from behind me. It is astounding that here we are at 2.52 pm, coming through question timeâ€”the first parliamentary sitting week since the budget weekâ€”and I've sat here all question time and there's not been a single question about the budget or the economy. But, of course, why is that? Why is that from those opposite. It must have something to do with having a good economy.

                      But those opposite won't address the matters that are actually of interest to Australian families: their jobs; the economy; the fact that this side of politics has ensured that we have more jobs and an economy coming back stronger than anywhere else in the world; and the fact that this side of the parliament has made sure that Australians have more in their pockets thanks to our tax cutsâ€”and those opposite won't say whether or not they will support them into the future. That's the contrast. That's the clarity for us. We are working for Australian families.
