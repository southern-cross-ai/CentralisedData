         Social Services
        </a>
        , Senator Fifield. Today we saw reports in the media that there may be opposition within the government's Expenditure Review Committee to continuing to roll out the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        in its current form and in fact some pressure to slow down the rollout. Is the government planning to slow down the NDIS rollout? Where does the minister stand on this particular issue? And where is the pressure to slow down the rollout coming from, if that is correct?

        <p>
         Thank you, Senator Siewert, for your question. Let me make absolutely clear that this government is not looking for ways to slow down the rollout of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         . We are looking for ways to deliver the NDIS to make sure that it is the best that it can be. To put beyond any doubt the intention and determination of this government to roll out the NDIS in full, colleagues need look no further than the budget papers themselves, which see the full appropriation for the NDIS laid out over the forward estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Negotiations for the full rollout of the NDIS are currently underway between me and various jurisdictions. I should make clear, however, that your home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , Senator Siewert, currently has a trial run by the NDIS agency and also a trial run by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         government, and there will be a comparative assessment of that. Western Australia at the moment is using that information to determine how it might proceed. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         , as the first jurisdiction-wide trial, is in effect already on the path to full transition.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am working very hard, negotiating with the other six jurisdictions to roll out the NDIS beyond the existing seven trial sites, but it is important to make clear that this is a collective venture between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. This is not something where the Commonwealth can unilaterally declare, 'We now have an end to negotiations.' Negotiations end, obviously, when both parties agree, and I am working very hard on that front. Any suggestions, as there were, that I am looking to slow down negotiations with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales

               Thank you. Obviously, it would be inappropriate for me to comment directly on any discussions in cabinet or the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet, but I took it that it would be self-evident that the

                  New South Wales

                 and Australian governments. But let me provide the reassurance to you, Senator Siewert, that discussions are going extremely well with New South Wales. In fact, a couple of months ago I signed with Minister Ajaka, in New South Wales, an agreement to see the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                  NDIS
                 </a>
                 roll out beyond the Hunter trial site, in
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                  Western Sydney
                 </a>
                 , for young kids with disability. That will commence very shortly, and that will be the first rollout of the NDIS beyond the existing trial site. But, in relation to the broader issue of the bilateral agreement with New South Wales for transition to the full scheme, discussions are going very well. Things should happen soon. Watch this space.
