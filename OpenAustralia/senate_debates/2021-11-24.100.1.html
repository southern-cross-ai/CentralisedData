        My question is to the Minister representing the Deputy Prime Minister, Senator McKenzie. Can the minister outline how the Liberal and Nationals government's plan is contributing to the economic security of regional and remote Australia by supporting jobs, businesses and investment?

         I thank Senator McDonald for her question. As she knows, from her on-ground experience in Queensland, particularly in the north, regional Australia is experiencing a once-in-a-generation surge in economic growth. This is all while these communities are recovering from the effects of the COVID pandemic, drought and other natural disasters over the recent period. A combination of high commodity prices, strong overseas demand for our agriculture and resources, and good rainfall in most of rural Australia are factors which are contributing to a positive economic outlook, which translates into jobs and a higher standard of living for all Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         But while this economic recovery is good news for the people of rural and regional Australia, this success didn't just come about by accident.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">

         and Nationals government has been investing and delivering in thousands of projects on the ground to help lay the groundwork for our farmers, fishers, foresters, miners and small businessmen and women for the great work they do in the country. We are ensuring that our economy continues to grow, with low interest rates, low taxes and higher and higher employment. We're also experiencing an unprecedented population shift from our congested capital cities to regional areas that has seen a net migration of 45,000 Australians moving to regional towns and cities. This means stronger, more-resilient and more-vibrant regional centres.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government's investment includes a record $110 billion in infrastructure projects, in road and rail, including 1,700 kilometres of inland rail to better connect our regional communities and shift product to capital cities, ports and overseas. We've spent $3.5 billion on building dams, pipelines and weirs so that we use our precious resources more efficiently. And we put $5 billion back into communities for drought resilience. In my own areas of responsibility, too, we as a government have made available $2.5 billion to support those communities impacted by 'black summer'.

            We know that much of Australia's economic output is as a result of the hard work, ingenuity and commitment of the men and women who live and work in remote and regional Australia. Our investments in infrastructure, connectivity and resilience support these communities to prosper not only in the short term but for many years to come. Eight of Australia's top 10 exports are produced in regional, rural and remote areas. Ag exports alone have grown from $306 billion a year when we came to power in 2012 to $476 billion in 2019-20. Australia's resources and energy export industry has grown from $178 billion when we came to power to $310 billion in 2020-21. That represents a 74 per cent increase over this period. Sovereign manufacturing, from food manufacturing to defence manufacturing, are also growing at record levels. Our government economic management and regionalisation strategy is making a significant contribution to our economic growth.

               and his Green eco-warriors, will choose to decimate not only our agriculture and our mining industries but also the ultimate renewable industry: the great Australian forest industry. The timber workers and timber processing workers right across this country have much to fear from the election of the Labor Party, led by Anthony Albanese, as well as

              <p>
               When you talk to the millions of people who live in rural and regional Australia, they say that the greatest risk to the economic recovery to the regions and indeed to the nation is that side of politics, which has no respect for the regions or the industries that underpin our economies.
