        The Albanese Labor government has failed in its most fundamental duty, which is to protect the people of Australia. Over the last month the Albanese Labor government's incompetent handling of and its incompetent response to the High Court decision of NZYQ has led to over 140 hardened criminals being released into the Australian community, and now we are seeing the consequences. Now the people of Australia are reaping the consequences of the incompetence of and bungling by the Albanese Labor government. And you don't need to listen to the words of another politician to understand what's at stake here; all you need to do is have a look at the front pages of newspapers all over this country.

        The Adelaide
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        has 'High farce: released asylum seeker arrested for indecent assault'. The
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        newspaper has 'Human catastrophe: detainee sex charges'. The
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" rel="nofollow">
          Daily Telegraph
         </a>
        </i>
        has 'Freed detainees in alleged assault, drugs charge'. It's across the length and breadth of our country. This is what the Australian newspapers are reporting today. The
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herald_Sun" rel="nofollow">
          Herald Sun
         </a>
        </i>
        in Victoria says, 'Freed to attack: sex predator charged with indecently assaulting woman after release from immigration detention as bungling federal government still in chaos over High Court ruling', with the headline 'How could you let this happen?' That's what the headline says: 'How could you let this happen?' How could the Albanese Labor government let this happen? That is what the people of Australia are asking themselves the length and breadth of this nation. How indeed?
