         The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honorable senator ' s question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         With reference to Australia's involvement in nuclear activities and its nuclear ambition, and the indication by Dr Clarence Hardy, of Nuclear Fuel Australia, that in 2008 his company submitted a 'report on a pre-feasibility study' to set up an enrichment nuclear industry in Australia:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The Government's response to Dr Clarence Hardy's proposal in September 2008 outlined the Government's consistent position that it is not considering a nuclear power industry in Australia, including all stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, including enrichment, other than uranium mining and milling. The response stated "the Government does not support your proposal as it is inconsistent with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         policy."
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) From time to time the Government receives correspondence on matters related to the nuclear fuel cycle. However, the Government's continuing policy is that nuclear power will not be part of Australia's energy portfolio, and does not support the development of a nuclear power industry in Australia, including fuel leasing. In regard to international nuclear waste storage facilities, it has been the policy of successive Australian governments that Australia will not accept the radioactive wastes of other countries. .This policy is given effect through the
         <i>
          Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations
         </i>
         .
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) From time to time the Government receives correspondence and/or representations on matters related to the nuclear fuel cycle. The Government's continuing policy is that nuclear power will not be part of Australia's energy portfolio, and does not support the development of a nuclear industry in Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The content of discussions between the Minister and Secretary Chu remains between the parties.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
