        (a) the Senate notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) as the Prime Minister (Mr Turnbull) stated on 15 November 2010, when in Opposition, that it would beggar belief that a government could be so reckless as to allow such a massive investment to proceed without the publication of a business case, without the ongoing scrutiny of a parliamentary committee and, above all, without a rigorous cost-benefit analysis, and that any major infrastructure project must be subject to a rigorous cost-benefit analysis and if it does not pass a rigorous cost-benefit analysis then it necessarily detracts from Australia's wellbeing,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the resolution of the Senate of 14 October 2015 proposed by a senator from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">
         The Nationals
        </a>
        that noted the importance of significant funding proposals being accompanied by detailed business cases and subject to a full assessment process, including by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia
        </a>
        , if $100 million or more of Commonwealth funding is sought, to ensure value for taxpayers' money;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the announcement on 12 April 2016 by the Prime Minister of an additional $260 million for the Perth Freight Link, bringing the total federal contribution to $1.2 billion for a project with no business case; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) the ongoing deterioration in Western Australia's budget position, with the recent downgrading of Western Australia's Triple A credit rating to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA" rel="nofollow">
         AA
        </a>
        2, the second credit downgrading in 18 months;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) there be laid on the table by the Minister for Finance, no later than 4 pm on Wednesday, 20 April 2016, the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) any correspondence between any minister and/or member of the federal bureaucracy with any minister and/or member of the state bureaucracy on the decision to provide an additional $260 million funding for the Perth Freight Link tunnel and the related public announcement, including any requests or proposals for additional funding from either government, any costings, briefing notes, speaking points, designs, maps, availability and type of tunnelling infrastructure, and related documents;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) any correspondence between the Federal Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann), or any member of the Federal Government and any member of the

         Western Australian Government

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the business case and cost-benefit analysis for the Perth Freight Link Tunnel; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iv) a list of every National Partnership Agreement for infrastructure projects that have received over $100 million in federal funding from the Abbott-Turnbull Federal Government without a published business case and cost-benefit analysis.
