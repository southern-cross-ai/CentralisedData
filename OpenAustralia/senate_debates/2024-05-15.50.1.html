         GST
        </a>
        is a lifeblood for small jurisdictions to be able to deliver essential services, and Tasmania is no exception. In last night's budget, delivered by Treasurer Chalmers—his third opportunity to present what Labor stands for in this country—he failed to do something Tasmanians have been asking for, and that is to exempt from GST calculations the funding being given to Tasmania to build a new waterfront stadium in Hobart. Two hundred and forty million dollars is being provided by the Albanese Labor government to help construct this facility. One thing that has been asked for by the Tasmanian Liberal government, recently re-elected, is that the funding for this stadium be exempt from GST calculations. To date, we've had nothing from this federal Labor government. They've completely thumbed their noses at the people of Tasmania.
       </p>

        Mr Brian Mitchell, the member for Lyons, and Ms Julie Collins, the member for Franklin, who sits at the cabinet table, no less, and who probably turns up to the Expenditure Review Committee, have done nothing to ensure that Tasmania gets its fair share. By contrast, though, this Labor government have been able to secure an exemption from GST calculations for the Logan sports precinct in the electorate of Rankin, which is the seat of the Treasurer. How unusual that that electorate and that state have been able to secure an exemption from GST calculations for something worth a lot more than the stadium in Hobart! In fact, the full expenditure for the Olympics infrastructure in Queensland, $3½ billion, has been exempt from GST calculations—but, for Tasmania, no such love.

        Shame on Labor senators from Tasmania. Shame on Mr Mitchell, the member for Lyons, and Ms Collins, the member for Franklin. Do your job and exempt this funding from GST calculations.
