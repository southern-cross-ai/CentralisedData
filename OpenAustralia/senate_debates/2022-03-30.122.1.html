        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham" rel="nofollow">
         Birmingham
        </a>
        . Yesterday, the Morrison government handed down a budget that makes housing more expensive, locks in tax cuts for the wealthy and funds more coal and gas projects. Minister, as the climate crisis ravages our country, how can you stand by a budget that provides more than $38 billion in handouts to coal, oil and gas corporations but cuts climate spending by 35 per cent?

        <p>
         There was quite a bit in terms of that question, but I will try to deal, first and foremost, specifically with the questions that Senator Cox posed at the end of her commentary there.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's incorrect to assert as she did in relation to climate expenditure. The government's investment in relation to achieving net zero, continuing to drive down emissions from the 20 per cent reduction that Australia has achieved to date and continuing to invest in areas of low-emissions technology is real. In this budget alone, building on top of our previous low-emissions strategies and commitments, there is new funding for microgrids in rural and regional communities, to take them off diesel power generation and to give them both cleaner and cheaper electricity for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         In this budget alone, there is of course the patent box reforms, which I have already referenced, to ensure that clean energy and low-emissions technologies developed in Australia are actually commercialised in Australia. This is to make sure that we seize the advantage. All of this is building on the fact that there is more money for hydrogen in this budget too, for ensuring that the hydrogen hubs our government is seeking to develop and invest in in that industry also support the development of demand for hydrogen, to ensure that all aspects of the supply chain for hydrogen are supported. So this is very strong.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of the claims which Senator Cox has made about subsidies: this is a common refrain from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         . When you dig down, what they're actually talking about are the diesel fuel tax rebates. Those are the subsidies they're talking about. Essentially, they're tax rebates provided to businesses in Australia, to those in the resources sector and to Australian farmers as well. They're tax rebates in relation to their business expenses. That's not an uncommon thing and it's certainly not a subsidy in terms of their operations. These are some of the biggest taxpayers in Australia—some of the biggest contributors to our economy in terms of jobs and revenue—and from that, support for climate action, for example—

           This budget fails to fix the housing crisis. Minister, do you acknowledge there's $13 billion for property investors in the form of negative gearing and capital gains tax concession but no new money for affordable housing in this budget?

            No, I don't acknowledge that because I don't agree with it. There's, in fact, $2 billion extra in this budget for the National Housing Finance and Investment Corporation, $2 billion of additional support to help them with the low-cost financing that NHFIC provides through community housing providers to support social and affordable housing.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is also a budget which we proudly build upon our track record as parties in government of supporting first homeownership. We are proud, from the very foundation of the Liberal and National parties, to have always supported first home ownership. The first home guarantee that our government has introduced is helping tens of thousands of young Australians to get into their first home sooner than would've been the case, to stop rent, to start paying off a house, to have the economic and financial security that comes with owning your own home. We are incredibly proud of that achievement.

              If you're a low- or middle-income earner, this budget gives you a one-off $420 bonus, but under the stage 3 tax cuts a millionaire will get an extra $9,000, not once, not twice, but each and every year. Why is lining the pockets of millionaires more important than helping ordinary Australians with the cost of living?

               Senator Cox, you mentioned stage 3 tax cuts. Of course, they're stage 3 because we've already delivered stage 1 and stage 2. Stage 1 and stage 2 prioritised low- and middle-income Australians first and foremost. I know that if we have a change of government—heaven forbid!—at the next election it won't matter whether you're a low-income Australian or a high-income Australian you will end up paying higher taxes, which is evidenced from the fact that every one of Senator Cox's questions was about putting more tax on some of Australia's biggest income earners, more tax in relation to Australian property owners, more tax in relation to Australian workers. If the Greens have the ability to hold, as they will, the Labor Party—hold them to things in government—then the

                Australian Greens
               </a>
               will be pushing for more taxes on Australian wages, more taxes on Australian housing, more taxes on Australian industry, and they will leave Australia far worse off.

                 ator BIRMINGHAM (—) (): Thank you, Senator Smith, for the question in which you seem to have assumed that there's only one measure in the budget papers relating to regional Australia when in fact there are many measures in the budget papers relating to regional Australia. Yes, there is one measure that is particularly focusing on resource and energy hubs and providing investment in terms of infrastructure and spending in those resource and energy hubs, but there is also support in other ways for regional Australia. Two billion dollars of the regional acceleration program, that Senator McKenzie spoke of before, will help ensure that whether it is across manufacturing or the skills agenda, or exporters from regional
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  South Australia
                 </a>
                 , they will have a greater opportunity in relation to accessing those areas of regional funding.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In relation to the infrastructure spending, I've noticed commentary in non-
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
                  South Australian
                 </a>
                 media, in the
                 <i>
                  Financial Review
                 </i>
                 or elsewhere, suggesting that South Australia is receiving a disproportionate share of infrastructure spending. In fact, up to 17 per cent of new infrastructure commitments are going into South Australia. So you have to be careful when you start trying to pick and choose in those regards, because what we've seen in relation to delivery of the North-South Corridor, investment in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Eastern_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
                  South Eastern Freeway
                 </a>
                 and support for the Horrocks Highway is that in South Australia there is a surge in infrastructure spending and investment supporting
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">
                  SA
                 </a>
                 . Of course, in terms of our government, there is perhaps the most significant impact for South Australia, which is what we have done to turn around defence industry investment. Those opposite, when they were in government, commissioned zero vessels in terms of naval shipbuilding, versus, on this side, 70 vessels as part of a strategy supporting SA and WA.

                         I thank Senator Small for the question. As always, I acknowledge Senator Small as one of those people who employ Australians. He runs a small business, Small's Bar, down in Bunbury in

                          Western Australia
                         </a>
                         . Senator Small, you're on the coalition side of politics, so you understand that small and family businesses are the backbone of the Australian community. They are the heart of our local communities. They employ nearly eight million Australians.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Currently in Australia we have more people in work than ever before. We have more people in work now than we did before COVID-19, and, of course, a lot of that has to do with the growth of small business in this country. Look at how small businesses themselves have embraced the policies that the coalition government put in place throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Employment in small business has grown by around 10 per cent since the beginning of the pandemic. That just shows you how resilient small businesses are in Australia and—in particular in Bunbury in Western Australia, where Senator Small comes from—how resilient small businesses are in rural and regional Australia.

                         What did the government do last night? We backed small and family businesses even further. They were already benefiting from the lowest tax rate in 50 years and record investment incentives under the coalition government. That is a stark contrast to what those on the other side offer. Under those on the other side, they were paying a tax rate of 30 per cent. They are currently paying a tax rate of 25 per cent; that is the lowest tax rate in 50 years. Last night, we invested further. In particular, we have invested a $120 tax deduction that they will get by investing in upskilling their workforce. For every $100 a small business spends on training their employees, they will get a $120 tax deduction back.

                           Minister Cash, in light of that outlining of the achievements of small and family businesses in Australia in doing what they do best—creating jobs, employing Australians and training Australians for future jobs—how does this budget, delivered by the Liberal-National government, ensure that Australia's small and family businesses continue to do what they do best, unimpeded by red tape and with easier access to support from this government that understands their needs?

                            Senator Small understands small business, so he understands in particular that investing in a skilled workforce ensures small businesses are able to prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians. Senator Small also understands how important it is for the government to invest in small businesses so that they can embrace the digital revolution. You saw again last night the coalition government further investing in the capacity and the growth of small business. From budget night, every $100 these small businesses spend on digital technologies like cloud computing—we know how important that is—e-invoicing, cybersecurity and web design will now see them get a $120 tax deduction. That is getting them where we need them to be: in the digital age. We are also focused on cutting as much red tape as we can for small business, because when you cut red tape, small businesses prosper, they grow and they create more jobs for Australians.

                              We've heard a lot from Minister Cash on the strength of Australia's small and family businesses in providing those jobs and taking up the support that they get from this government to support the investment that underpins jobs, but the real question that faces this chamber—and, indeed, that the people of Australia will face very shortly—is: what are the risks to those jobs and economic opportunities if our small and family businesses in this country are not supported by a government that wants to see them prosper and grow?

                               I think it's pretty obvious to us on this side of the chamber what the greatest risk to small and family business is, and that is of course an Albanese Labor government. Why? It's because the closest most of them have ever come to a small business is to proudly close it down. That is unacceptable behaviour. When it comes to taxes, there's only one way that those on the other side go, and that is up. It is in their

                                       My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel, Senator Payne. Yesterday Minister Gee told the House that there was $96 million in the budget to clear up a backlog of veterans compensation claims. Can this minister tell the chamber in which budget paper and on what page that $96 million can be found?

                                          On the weekend, Minister Gee threatened to resign if he did not receive the $96 million in budget. He labelled the 60,000 unprocessed claims within his department a national disgrace. Why does it take a minister speaking out publicly and threatening to quit for Mr Morrison to take responsibility; and where is this $96 million?

                                           This budget has provided an initial $22.8 million which will fund 90 extra staff to address that backlog of unprocessed claims, and it will be followed by a further investment to continue to improve the veteran claims processing system and reduce waiting times.

                                             When asked why it took Minister Gee threatening to resign for his government to provide the necessary funding, Mr Morrison said:
