        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. Following a visit to the Dubbo Aboriginal Medical Service in April this year, I wrote to the minister for health, alerting him to the chronic understaffing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s at the Dubbo Aboriginal Medical Service and the excessive delays that would mean for the vaccine rollout to the Dubbo Indigenous community. Why did the minister for health do nothing to address the issues raised and potentially avert the current outbreak in Dubbo's Indigenous community?

         I thank the senator for her question. Throughout the course of the pandemic, ensuring that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         have access to vaccine has been one of the important elements of the way that we've managed the program. They were in the early stages of having availability of vaccine. Like Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Neill" rel="nofollow">
          O'Neill
         </a>
         , the government is concerned about the vaccination rates in some parts of Australia. With the arising of the outbreak particularly in the region of Dubbo, a number of specific measures have been undertaken to support Australians, particularly in that area, to get vaccinated. There have been five teams of ADF vaccination force go out there to work their way through the community, to make sure that there was availability of vaccination for people in those communities. We're working our way methodically through those communities to ensure that we can get vaccination rates up to support and protect those communities, and we'll continue to do that.

           It is indeed a point of order with regard to relevance. I appreciate that the minister is speaking about the general scheme that has been advanced in the region, but my question was specifically for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMS" rel="nofollow">
            AMS
           </a>
           in Dubbo. It was a very specific question. There was a letter sent. This requires a specific answer. I think the people of Dubbo deserve that.

            , I ask people to make their point without commentary. I take your point of order. It was a specific question, but, as the minister was talking about programs that related to that region—and there is an opportunity after question time to debate the merit of answers—he was being directly relevant, even if not answering in the form that the asker would prefer. I call the minister to continue.

             And we continue to support Indigenous communities around Australia with respect to vaccination. As at 23 August, 193,348 people who identify as Aboriginal and

             had had at least one dose of vaccine—approximately 33 per cent of the eligible population—and over 103,000 had received a second dose. The largest gap in coverage is seen in the 40-to-59 age group. Approximately 75 per cent of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are aged 12 years and over and are eligible for COVID vaccines. We will continue to work cooperatively with

                the government have taken some very specific actions to ensure that vaccination capacity was increased in those regions as it needed to be and as we've done across other parts of the country. We supported Victoria in their surge when they had an outbreak and we supported New South Wales more broadly when they had an outbreak.

                  Perhaps the minister can take that on notice and confirm the eight per cent number. The Morrison-Joyce government promised

                  Australians that they were a priority in the vaccine rollout and would be fully vaccinated by winter. We're now eight days away from spring and COVID-19 is ripping through First Nations communities. Why should Australians believe Mr Morrison will deliver on his new promises when he has failed to deliver on his old promises, leaving First Nations Australians unprotected and at risk?

                   for the question. I completely reject the premise of the question. In fact, Senator O'Neill quite dishonestly didn't declare that Minister Hunt had actually responded to her letter on 27 July to answer the questions—
