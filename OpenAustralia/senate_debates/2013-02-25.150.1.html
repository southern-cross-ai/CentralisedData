         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) No.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

         at the University of Queensland was made by government through a grant from the Education Investment Fund, not ANSTO. As noted in the answer provided to parliamentary question on notice no. 1876, ANSTO's decision to contribute a small part of the total cost of the project was based on the fact that ANSTO will receive access to more than $2 million worth of equipment, which is vital to a range of collaborative research projects.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) ANSTO was not involved in the decision by the University of Queensland to partner with Axiom Pharmaceuticals in relation to the operation of the Centre for Advanced Imaging. The question should therefore be directed to the University of Queensland.
