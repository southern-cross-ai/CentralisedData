        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Payne. Can the minister update the Senate on how the Liberal-National government's sound budget and economic management is guaranteeing essential services that protect Australians online, including what the government is doing to promote an open, free and secure cyberspace?

         I thank Senator Abetz for his question and his interest in these issues. An open, free and secure cyberspace is essential to driving economic growth, to protecting national security and to promoting international stability, but it isn't something that we can take for granted. Ours is a whole-of-government approach. The Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>
         is leading the development of Australia's next cybersecurity strategy, and internationally we're focusing on maximising opportunity and minimising risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         The boundaries of acceptable behaviour in cyberspace are being challenged, whether by states or by cybercriminals. The damage, the disruption, the disinformation caused by malicious cyberactivity is significant and growing.

         , in September, I co-sponsored the Joint Statement on Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace with the United States and the Netherlands. That statement has so far been affirmed by 28 countries. Led by our Ambassador for Cyber Affairs, Toby Feakin, Australia is helping to build the technical, policy, legislative and enforcement capacities of our regional partners as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also have to make every effort to deter those who would seek to misuse cyberspace as a vehicle for repression and control and instability. Our rapidly developing critical technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, are already having profound strategic and foreign policy impacts. Other technologies, such as deepfakes, have the potential to disrupt relations and to undermine public trust and confidence. The government is taking a coordinated strategic approach to ensure Australia continues to benefit from technological advancements. The work we are doing is widely regarded and highly respected around the world. It is something of which we can be very proud and on which the government is very focused.

               I thank Senator Abetz for what is a very important supplementary question. Australia, and a growing number of other states, are cooperating to deter and respond to malicious cyberactivity. Having established a firm foundation of existing international law and norms of responsible state behaviour, the international community also has to ensure that there are consequences for those who engage in unacceptable behaviour in cyberspace. Australia is taking a strong stand against malicious cyberactors. In fact, in cooperation with international partners to ensure the maximum strength of our message, we have previously publicly attributed malicious activity to Russia,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
                North Korea
               </a>
               , China and Iran. We will continue to make our decisions on public attribution of cyberincidents in our national interests and particularly in relation to those with the potential to disrupt global economic growth, national security and international stability.
