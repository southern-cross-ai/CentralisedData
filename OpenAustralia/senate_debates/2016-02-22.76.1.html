         I thank the senator for his question. It is with great pride that I answer my first question in my role as Minister for Regional Development. Senator Williams, like me, is a passionate advocate for people in communities right around rural and regional Australia. This coalition government has committed to investing $50 billion to deliver the infrastructure of the 21st century. We are rebuilding regional Australia after a prolonged period of neglect by those opposite.
        </p>
        <p>
         In
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         alone $15 billion will be invested by the end of the decade. This includes programs like $3.2 billion for Roads to Recovery, $1 billion for the National Stronger Regions Fund, $300 million for Bridges Renewal and $100 million for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_Program" rel="nofollow">
          Black Spot Program
         </a>
         . The National Stronger Regions Fund will invest $1 billion in infrastructure projects to drive economic growth, increase productivity, increase employment and skills and improve partnerships across the Australian regionâ€”something we on this side are very well aware of how necessary that is.
        </p>
        <p>
         Through the first two rounds of the NSRF, 162 projects have been announced, investing over $505 million. In round 2 alone, some 40 projects were announced in New South Wales that will drive economic growth and generate jobs. Over the two rounds, successful projects have included upgrading the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathurst_Airport" rel="nofollow">
          Bathurst Airport
         </a>
         , supporting the expansion of the Dubbo saleyards and replacing the Marine Rescue Tower in Ballina, which I know is so important to the local people. Each of these projects is vital to their community, and I know each project has been welcomed by Senator Williams. Round 3 of the NSRF is now open, and I strongly encourage members to talk to their local communities about making sure they take advantage of this tremendous program.

           The coalition government has delivered $100 million to dramatically improve our mobile phone coverage across regional Australia. There have now been 499 new or upgraded base stations under the rollout of this program, and that will roll out over the next three years. The full rollout from the program will provide 68,600 square kilometres of new hand-held coverage and more than 150,000 square kilometres of new external antenna coverage, providing coverage to some 3,000 mobile black spot locations nominated by members of the public.
          </p>
          <p>
           The senator will be happy to know that the rollout of this program has started well, with both Telstra and Vodafone recently announcing their rollout schedules for the next six months. The Mobile

           me is another example of the focus and hard work this side of the place is putting into regional Australia.

             I think it is important that we do contrast to the previous Labor government when it comes to investment in mobile phone coverage. What did we see from those opposite over nearly seven years? Did we see millions invested in mobile phone technology and upgrades? No. Did we see thousands invested in mobile phone technology? No. What did we see under nearly seven years of those opposite? Not one dollar invested into mobile phone coverageâ€”not one. There is a stark contrast between the other side of this place in the previous Labor government when it comes to developing and investing in regional communities. On this side, we recognise how important it isâ€”indeed, we have committed another $60 million for round 2 of this programâ€”that we deliver mobile phone coverage right across our rural and regional areas where they need it.
