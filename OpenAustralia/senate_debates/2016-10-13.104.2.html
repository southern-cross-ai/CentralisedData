        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to the submissions of the former Solicitor-General Gavan Griffith
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
         QC
        </a>
        to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee. Does the Attorney-General agree with Mr Griffith QC that an independent Solicitor-General protects against the risks of the provision's, in his words, 'dodgy advice'?

           There is no point of order. The Attorney-General has just barely started his answer. He is five seconds into his answer, so I think we can give the Attorney-General a bit more time.

            I read what Dr Griffith had to say and I do not agree with all of it. I am not alone in disagreeing with Dr Griffith, by the way, because another former law officer of the Crown has expressed a different view. He recently said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            … that the Solicitor-General's advice was given a high status within government, higher than advice from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government_Solicitor" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Government Solicitor
            </a>
            or from the private bar. Nevertheless, he would, occasionally, seek another legal opinion. He explained that he might seek another opinion on particularly important political issues:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Or two. Or three. Perhaps I might feel I needed two to outweigh the Solicitor-General's advice, and I would go and get very senior advice. And I've done that. And I would do it again.
           </p>
           <p>
            Do you know which senior law officer recently expressed that opinion? It was Mr
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus" rel="nofollow">
             Mark Dreyfus
            </a>
            . I do not agree with Dr Griffith, but neither, apparently, does Mr Mark Dreyfus in his contribution to Professor Gabrielle Appleby's book
            <i>
             The role of the Solicitor-General
            </i>

                   Mr Dreyfus's views, which on this occasion accord with mine, must have been fresh in his mind since the book which quotes him was only published last month. This is why I find it very difficult to understand how Mr Dreyfus could, without hypocrisy, have attacked me for allegedly doing the very thing that he said he did and would do again.

                      Senator Farrell, you are adorable! You are very, very popular on this side, but I am particularly grateful to you for this question today! It does happen to be the case, Senator Farrell, that on this issue I agree with Mr Dreyfus, although I do not agree with his hypocrisy in attacking me in a press release for taking precisely the same course that he said to Professor Appleby in her recently published book that he did and would do again.

                       about what this Attorney-General is doing. It is a serious issue. It is a quote from a man who was the Solicitor-General for 14 years and much more eminently qualified than the Attorney-General. He ought to respond.
