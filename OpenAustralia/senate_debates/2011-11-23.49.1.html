        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Carr. I refer to the promise made by Prime Minister Gillard, after she politically executed former Prime Minister Rudd, that she was going to find her way on illegal boat arrivals, because the former government had lost its way. Australians have witnessed the 103rd boat arrival since the 2010 election, taking Labor's record under Ms Gillard to 117 illegal boats carrying 6,897 people, compared with 6,552 people under Mr Rudd. Given that, under her government, the Prime Minister has taken border protection from what can only be described as bad to worse, does the minister consider that the Gillard Labor government has in fact found its way when it comes to protecting Australia's borders?

          I thank Senator Cash for her question; it has been a while. I always welcome a question from Senator Cash. The simple fact of life is that there have been 13 boat arrivals since Mr Abbott chose to sabotage the government's program in regard to Malaysia. It is quite clear that those opposite are highly sensitive on this issue. We have had a series of numbers thrown across the chamber but they do not want to hear the facts on this matter which are that there have been 13 boat arrivals since Mr Abbott chose to wreck the government's program in regard to the Malaysian—

We have, of course, 13 boat arrivals since Mr Abbott chose to sabotage the approach that the government had taken in regard to the Malaysian agreement. And you have to take responsibility for that.

                 East Timor
                </a>
                processing centre—my personal favourite—the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
                 Manus Island
                </a>
                policy, the failed Malaysian people-swap policy and the fifth and latest policy of onshore processing. Given the abject failure to date of all of these policies to stop the boats, when does the government intend to find its way and restore the Howard government's policies, which actually worked?

                                There is no point of order. Firstly, I did not hear any comment across the chamber because of the level of noise that is in the chamber. I have said this before. It is very difficult for me to engage in all of that discussion and debate that is going on, quite wrongly according to the standing orders, because to even hear some of it is physically impossible. So I can only rule that there is no point of order at this stage. Senator Carr has 20 seconds remaining to answer the question.
