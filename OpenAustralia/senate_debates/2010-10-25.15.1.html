        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. I refer to the report issued last Friday by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        Reform Council on water-saving infrastructure projects in the Murray-Darling Basin. The report highlights that, of your government’s so-called priority projects for water saving infrastructure, only two of 17 have been completed. To quote the report:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... there were significant delays in the development and approval all other projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        What impact do these delays have on the livelihood of those whose lives are already on hold while the government attempts to sort out yet another mess?

           I am representing another minister, thank you, Senator Brandis. The government is trying to achieve three outcomes: to deliver a healthy river system, to deliver it acknowledging the importance of food protection and to deliver strong regional communities. That was the objective when the Water Act was first introduced, and this government’s determination to reach that objective is there as well. The minister has sought and received legal advice from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government_Solicitor" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Government Solicitor
           </a>
           on the requirements of the Water Act. This advice has helped clarify what the requirements of the act are and how the act plays a role in helping to deliver what is referred to as the triple-bottom-line approach. The minister will table this—

              The minister will table the advice in parliament this afternoon—that is my advice. I am glad he has already tabled it. Let’s acknowledge that the government’s triple-bottom-line approach is what those in opposition once claimed they sought too when they were in government. It is certainly what the member for Wentworth sought and I hope it is what the Leader of the Opposition is willing to help deliver.

                   Reform Council report also states ‘the fact that most projects remain in the development and preapproval stages appears contrary to the need for urgent action’. How does the government justify to these communities its failure to take urgent action?

                      , on the point of order, I think that is Senator Joyce’s fourth contribution today on attempted points of order where nothing has been raised of any substance, other than an attempt by Senator Joyce to somehow prove he is relevant to the Senate and a couple of very poor jokes. Mr President, I think Senator Joyce’s points of order are designed to wilfully delay question time in the Senate. I suggest you rule this one out of order and suggest to Senator Joyce that he might examine his behaviour.

                        The original funding profile reflected early estimates made in advance of the extensive planning required for major infrastructure investment. Many of these infrastructure projects are highly complex—in particular, the state priority projects. It is important that robust business cases are prepared to support the investment of very large sums of public money.

On no view is anything the minister has said in response to the second supplementary question—after he floundered around for the first two questions addressing the wrong report—remotely relevant, let alone directly relevant.
