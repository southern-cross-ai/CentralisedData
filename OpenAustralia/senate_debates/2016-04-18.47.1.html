        My question is to the minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Australians are getting sick of hearing about tax dodgers setting up elaborate schemes to avoid paying their fair share of tax in Australia and elsewhere. British Prime Minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron" rel="nofollow">

        is hosting a first-of-its-kind anticorruption summit in London on 12 May. This is a first opportunity for world leaders to meet to discuss the scams exposed in the 'Panama papers' and to discuss the scourge of multinational tax evasion in general. Will Prime Minister Turnbull be attending this summit and will he 'shirt front' David Cameron over failing to crack down on some of the worst tax havens on the planet—the

         Senator Whish-Wilson, it is a very important issue you have raised. It is a very important issue that is not underestimated, I dare say, by anyone in this chamber. The government expects all taxpayers to pay their fair share of tax, and that applies to multinational companies as well as it applies to domestic companies as well as it applies to any taxpayers. The Prime Minister, in fact, addressed the

        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Whish-Wilson, you should be aware that Australia has some of the strongest tax integrity rules in the world and we are committed to addressing multinational tax avoidance. We have made progress on many of the recommendations of the

            Senator Whish-Wilson, I did think your question went to broader issues than merely whether the Prime Minister would be attending a particular international meeting. As I was saying, Australia has made progress on many of the recommendations of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
             OECD

            G20's final report on the base erosion and profit shifting action plan. We have passed legislation which, I am pleased to say, you and your colleagues from the Greens party supported, but which, to their undying shame, the Labor Party opposed, to crack down on multinationals artificially avoiding a tax liability in Australia. We have doubled penalties for multinationals avoiding tax—

                    You are a banker, Senator Whish-Wilson, so I will share this with you: lawyers and accountants are people, too, just as bankers are people, too. They are all subject to the same laws, including criminal laws dealing with counter-terrorism financing and money laundering.

How can the government justify issuing contracts worth hundreds of millions of dollars to a company so dodgy that they go to such lengths to avoid paying their fair share of tax? Shouldn't it be a government policy that there are no government contracts for tax dodgers?

                      As I said in answer to your primary question, neither the government nor, I daresay, any political party or shade of opinion represented in this chamber, condones international tax avoidance or tax avoidance of any form. The sincerity and the commitment of the government to deal with the problem is to be measured by the steps that we have already taken. I mentioned to you before the final report of the

                      on the base erosion and profit shifting action plan. The government, on the basis of that report and other considerations, has taken strong action against multinational profit shifting by passing laws that introduce a multinational anti-avoidance law, which delivered on a 2015 budget commitment, to ensure that where companies make sales in Australia but book the revenue offshore they will be subject to Australian tax—
