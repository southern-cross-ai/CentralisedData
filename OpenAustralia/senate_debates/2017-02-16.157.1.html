        Background
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 26 November 2015, the Senate referred the following matters to the Senate Economics References Committee (the committee) for inquiry and report:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) The future sustainability of Australia's strategically vital steel industry and its supply chain; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Any other related matters.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On the dissolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives on 9 May 2016 for a general election on 2 July 2016, the parliamentary committees of the 44th Parliament ceased to exist. At that time, the committee's inquiry lapsed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 11 October 2016, the Senate agreed to the committee's recommendation that the inquiry be re-referred in the 45th Parliament and for a final report to be presented by 1 December 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The committee resolved to re-open submissions with a closing date of 17 February 2017. This was notified on the committee's website and additional direct invitations were issued to stakeholders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the time of the tabling of the committee's interim report on 1 December 2016, the committee had received 39 submissions to the inquiry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 1 December 2016, the committee tabled its interim report which included three recommendations.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        During 2016 the Government made significant commitments to help secure the ongoing viability of the Whyalla steelworks and support the wider region. This included:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Building on these commitments, the Government has highlighted further loan support which can be made available to the new owners of Arrium's Whyalla steelworks through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. This loan support will help attract investments for the long-term sustainable operations of the steelworks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government understands the challenges facing Arrium and the wider steel sector, including pressure from low prices impacted by global overcapacity. The Government has recently implemented a range of initiatives that support Australian steel making and the manufacturing sector more broadly. These include:
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to liaise closely with the Administrators as they prepare Arrium's businesses for sale, and will work with the new owners of the Whyalla steelworks to help secure the ongoing viability of its operations.

        The Australian Government welcomes the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration into the Seasonal Worker Programme.
       </p>

        The Government is committed to ensuring that the Seasonal Worker Programme delivers results for all stakeholders and continues to contribute to:

        Under the Seasonal Worker Programme, many thousands of workers from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Island
        </a>
        countries and Timor-Leste have benefited from the opportunity to work in the agriculture and accommodation sectors where employers cannot source enough Australian labour.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The majority of seasonal workers that participate in the programme have a positive experience and are able to remit earnings back home to their families and communities. A study by the World Bank into remittances under the Seasonal Worker Programme pilot in 2011 indicated that a typical seasonal worker earned $12,000-$13,000 in Australia, of which approximately $5,000 was sent back home.

        is currently updating this study.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Seasonal Worker Programme provides a reliable and returning seasonal workforce to employers. Employers sourcing labour under the Seasonal Worker Programme report efficiencies by having access to a productive seasonal workforce with reduced absenteeism and staff turnover.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There have been significant reforms to the Seasonal Worker Programme over the last eighteen months. These include the uncapping of the programme from 1 July 2015 so that demand is driven by employers' need for labour and expanding it to the broader agriculture sector. A trial of the programme in the tourism sector in

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to work with stakeholders to communicate these reforms and build the ongoing success of the Seasonal Worker Programme.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government does not support further reviews of the Working Holiday Maker and Seasonal Worker Programmes by December 2017. A number of comprehensive reviews into these programmes have either been completed or are currently underway.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        A number of domestic and international reviews of the Seasonal Worker Programme will be undertaken during 2017. These reviews will take account of the changes to expand and streamline the Seasonal Worker Programme announced by the Government in June 2015 in

       <p class="italic">
        (1) assess the development impact of the programme on workers, labour sending communities and countries, with a particular focus on gender aspects.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) assess the productivity of seasonal workers and the costs, benefits and other factors impacting on farm profits associated with the Seasonal Worker Programme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) ensure Australian job seekers are not being displaced by the Seasonal Worker Programme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to consider a number of issues and suggestions that emerged during the Working Holiday Maker Tax Review. In addition, in October 2016, the Government established a Migrant Workers' Taskforce, to target those involved in unscrupulous labour hire practices and the exploitation of vulnerable foreign workers.

       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee

        recommends that the Australian Government undertake improved qualitative and quantitative research on full-time, part-time and seasonal labour workforce requirements to better inform Government policy.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Employment collects information from around 12,000 employers across the country each year about their recent recruitment experiences. The

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Expanding the Seasonal Worker Programme Recommendation three:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends the Australian Government consider expanding the Seasonal Worker Programme to include the aged, child, and disability care sectors, which have already been included in the White Paper on Developing Northern Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Seasonal Worker Programme is designed to meet short-term seasonal labour needs of Australian employers in industries that experience seasonal peaks. The skills requirements and lack of seasonal peaks in demand in the aged, child and disability care sector go beyond the parameters of the Seasonal Worker Programme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To address non-seasonal labour needs in Northern Australia, the Government is piloting the potential for workers from specific
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Islands
        </a>
        to work in aged care, as well as other sectors, through the Pacific Microstates–Northern Australia Worker Pilot Programme. This initiative was announced by the Government in June 2015 in
        <i>
         Our North, Our Future: White Paper on Developing Northern Australia
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The pilot will run for five years, allowing up to 250 citizens (around 50 per year) from Kiribati, Nauru and Tuvalu to work for two to three years in Northern Australia. It aims to address labour and skill shortages in Northern Australia and provide workers from Pacific Microstates with better access to employment opportunities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Impact on the Australian labour force Recommendation four:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that attracting, employing and retaining local labour in the broad agriculture sector is vital to ensuring that the industry remains sustainable in the long term. The Seasonal Work Incentives for Jobseekers pilot will provide incentives for young jobseekers to undertake seasonal work in the horticultural industry.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also has a range of initiatives to support young people into employment:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Increased access for women and youth workers Recommendation five:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Australian Government implement the following measures to increase gender equality and provide women greater employment opportunities:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All Memoranda of Understanding with partner countries set out critical success factors for the Seasonal Worker Programme, which state that the arrangements will be effective if opportunities for employment facilitate inclusive participation by women and under-represented groups.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To support this, the Government is working with Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste to improve women's participation in the Seasonal Worker Programme. A key objective of the Labour Mobility Assistance Program ($5.8 million, 2016–2017) is to increase the number of women from Pacific Island Countries and Timor-Leste taking up and benefitting from seasonal work opportunities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Under the Labour Mobility Assistance Program each partner country has negotiated a work plan that includes specific activities to improve gender equity in the Seasonal Worker Programme. For example, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        the Australian funded 'Women in Agriculture Program' will promote the participation of women agricultural workers, and help returning seasonal workers share and apply their new skills to the local industry.
       </p>

        </a>
        Plus released a Sustainability Impact Assessment of the potential economic, social and environmental impacts of trade liberalisation under PACER Plus on the Pacific Islands Forum Countries and made recommendations for mitigating these impacts. The Sustainability Impact Assessment found that PACER Plus will generally improve the livelihoods of Pacific Island populations, contribute to poverty alleviation, and in some instances narrow the gender gap by providing more employment opportunities to women. Australia will provide development assistance to support Forum Island Countries' participation in PACER Plus; this assistance will include resources dedicated to improving women's ability to benefit from trade.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As outlined in the response to Recommendation 3, the Seasonal Worker Programme is designed to meet short-term seasonal labour needs of Australian employers in industries that experience seasonal peaks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government is piloting the potential for workers from specific Pacific Islands to work in aged care, as well as other sectors, through the Pacific Microstates–Northern Australia Worker Pilot Programme.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Microstates Pilot will allow the Government to test an employment pathway for Australia Pacific Technical College health and community services industry graduates. Because these industries are not seasonal in nature, the Seasonal Worker Programme is not suited to employment in these areas.

        notes, 'the requirement to undertake market testing is not overly burdensome' (Section 9.27).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The variation in labour market testing requirements reflects a range of factors, primarily the duration and skill level of employment opportunities and the purpose of the visa programme that an employer is looking to utilise. For example, the community would reasonably expect the labour marketing testing requirements to vary according to whether an employer is seeking one highly skilled individual for up to four years (under a 457 visa) compared to short term, seasonal opportunities for a number of unskilled or lower skilled positions (under a 403 visa for the Seasonal Worker Programme).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In all cases employers' recruitment practices must satisfy Australian equal opportunity, anti- discrimination and workplace relations laws. Vacancies and job advertisements published by Australia businesses cannot discriminate against Australian applicants and should not invite applications from persons holding certain types of temporary visas.

       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Seasonal Worker Programme participants are subject to the same superannuation rules as most other overseas workers on temporary visas, including that they can claim their superannuation after they leave Australia and their visa is cancelled or expires by applying for a Departing Australia Superannuation Payment.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australian Government agencies are working to address barriers to participants claiming their superannuation and improve claim rates. Some of the initiatives include educating seasonal workers and governments on the claims process and encouraging governments from labour sending countries to help seasonal workers complete their application.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government through the Labour Mobility Assistance Programme is currently updating and enhancing information provided to seasonal workers on living and working in Australia. This includes providing improved pre-departure information that is translated to increase understanding by participating governments' labour sending units and seasonal workers.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Treasury, Australian Taxation Office and other Australian Government agencies will continue to identify opportunities to streamline administrative processes for seasonal workers to receive superannuation payments once they have departed Australia.

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is determined to implement the Basin Plan in a way that ensures the economic and social wellbeing of Basin communities, while delivering on the environmental objectives of the Plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In the north, the Northern Basin Review has provided an opportunity to closely examine the impacts of water recovery on Basin communities and explore the most effective way to deliver environmental outcomes. The highly variable nature of the less-regulated northern Basin presents unique challenges and opportunities in water resource management.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Northern Basin Review was enabled under the Basin Plan because at the time it was written, less was known about the northern Basin than the more developed southern connected system. The data generated as part of the Northern Basin Review and the subsequent recommendations made by the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will lead to amendments to the Basin Plan, and guide its implementation. On 22 November 2016 the Northern Basin Review was released together with proposed Basin Plan amendments, including those arising from the Northern Basin Review. Public consultation on the proposed Basin Plan amendments will occur between November 2016 and February 2017. The Government is grateful to the many stakeholders who have engaged in the review.

        ) Adjustment Mechanism provides an opportunity to optimise the economic, social and environmental outcomes in the southern Basin. Supply measures provide the opportunity to deliver environmentally equivalent outcomes without requiring as much water to be recovered from consumptive purposes. Thirty-seven supply measures were agreed to by the Murray–Darling Basin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ministerial_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Ministerial Council
        </a>
        on 22 April 2016. A previous independent stocktake showed that supply measures have the potential to provide an offset of around 508 gigalitres in the southern Basin.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following a request by the Ministerial Council the Basin Plan was amended to provide for a second notification of measures to the SDL adjustment mechanism by 30 June 2017. This additional step will allow for a second tranche of supply measure projects to be considered. Basin state ministers also reiterated their request for Basin state government officials to consider opportunities for a wider range of complementary projects, such as carp control, to provide triple bottom line benefits under the Basin Plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Ministerial Council also agreed to the types of projects that may be considered as efficiency measures under the SDL Adjustment Mechanism. In accordance with the Basin Plan, any efficiency measure projects must have positive or neutral social and economic outcomes.

        Committee majority recommendations
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. The committee recommends that no further reductions in water entitlements occur until the Northern Basin review, and any subsequent assessments, have been completed. The committee recommends that the review should also consider alternative means of water recovery, particularly in the Condamine-Balonne catchment, in order to minimise the economic and social impact of the Plan in the Northern Basin. This would include consideration of the following options:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>

        Agreed.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Murray–Darling Basin Authority has completed its review of the northern Basin. The focus of the review was to improve the evidence base from which decisions about water recovery settings could be confidently made using a triple-bottom line approach — weighing up social, economic and environmental considerations. As a part of the review, the Authority has consulted with various stakeholder groups in the north to seek their views on the implementation of the Basin Plan.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         The Authority
        </a>
        also considered a range of actions in addition to water recovery that could be implemented to reduce the adverse social and economic impacts of the Basin Plan while also providing opportunities for improved water management to enhance the use of environmental water.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of its review, the Authority has proposed that the overall water recovery target in the northern Basin reduce from 390 gigalitres on average to 320 gigaligtres provided there are commitments from Basin state governments to implement a range of measures to improve water management.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources, the Australian Government has established the Northern Basin Programmes Taskforce to investigate how to achieve the remaining water recovery in the northern Basin in ways that minimise the impact on communities. Drawing from key industry and community stakeholder input, the taskforce will provide advice on ways that avoid further water purchase and deliver social and economic benefits to communities. The Taskforce may also make recommendations to assist progress of toolkit measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Taskforce may also make recommendations to assist progress of toolkit measures, including temporary trade of environmental water. Temporary trade of water from one location to another provides protection for water holders to ensure the water reaches its destination. As a toolkit measure, temporary trade is important to ensure environmental water can be delivered at appropriate times to key environmental assets, and will help to meet environmental targets under the proposed 320 gigalitre water recovery target.

        2. The committee recommends that the Murray-Darling Basin Authority, as part of its ongoing social and economic work, undertake and publish a thorough assessment of the estimated and actual social and economic impacts of the implementation of the Plan, including of pursuing the remaining water recovery for the Condamine-Balonne catchment and other similarly distressed areas.

        3. The committee recommends that the MDBA address the existing over-recovery in the Macquarie Valley and other 'terminal' systems such as the Gwydir Valley, with a view to limiting recovery to amounts which address valley-specific environmental needs.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The final recovery amounts required in these rivers will not be settled until the process to amend the Basin Plan is completed. Public consultation on the current proposed Basin Plan amendments, which includes amendments related to the Northern Basin Review recommendations, is taking place between November 2016 and February 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed new local recovery volume in the Macquarie is 55 gigalitres, which is a 10 gigalitres reduction from Basin Plan settings. The results of the northern Basin review show that local environmental needs in the Macquarie can be met with this lower volume.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The proposed local recovery target for the Gwydir Valley is the same as the current Basin Plan settings. The modelling scenario used as the basis for the proposed amendment assumed that the Gwydir would not need to contribute to the shared reduction amount. The opportunity exists for the
