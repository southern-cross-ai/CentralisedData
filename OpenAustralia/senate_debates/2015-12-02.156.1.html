           The government recently announced its reforms to mental health, and that responds to the review of mental health services and programs. With mental health, responsibilities between Commonwealth and state and territory jurisdictions are clearly delineated. This is why we are currently negotiating the fifth national mental health plan with the states and territories. In relation to this motion and people in indefinite detention who have cognitive and psychiatric impairment, this is a matter for state and territory jurisdictions.
