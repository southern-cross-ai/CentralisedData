         What we are doing is trying to provide incentives and opportunities to young Australians to get a home. We are doing that through a series of policies and measures that will give them the opportunity to get ahead. I quoted in answer to your leader, Senator Cameron—had you been listening to the first question asked—what the government's record on job creation has been. It has been a fantastic record: the strongest rate of jobs growth since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
          GFC
         </a>
         . That is a result of this government's policies. Most of the beneficiaries of those new jobs have been younger Australians. That is what we are doing, Senator Cameron—

            Thank you, Senator Cameron. I make this point in relation to your point of order—and probably to previous points of order—and for those to consider when they make future points of order: it is not for me to judge the merit of the minister's answer; it is for me to judge whether the minister is directly relevant to the question. Senator Cameron, your question was, 'Why will the government not heed his advice?' You added a bit more to that, but the prime portion of your question was: 'Why will the government not heed his advice?' The minister has been directly relevant. Whether you like the answer or not, he's been directly relevant, because he's indicating possibly why the government is not heeding his advice. That's the way I have to interpret, and that is the way I will continue to interpret. So I don't want points of order to be where you restate the question. I've been very generous with points of order for a long period of time. I just emphasise that I will judge whether the minister is being directly relevant to the question and not the merit of the answer. Senator Wong, on the point of order.

                 I'm simply making the point to you, Senator Cameron, that when you make the economy more prosperous, as this government has done as a direct result of its policies, when you create more jobs, as this government has done as a result of its policies, when jobs growth is stronger now than it has been at any time since the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
                  GFC
                 </a>
                 almost a decade ago, directly as a result of the government's policies, and when you put more young people in particular into work, into good jobs, into full-time jobs, at better wages, which has happened as a result of this government's policies, then those young people have a greater opportunity to get into the housing market, as they are doing. Nevertheless, Senator Cameron, since you asked me more particularly, let me give you the details of some of the other measures, apart from growing the health of the economy, that the government has also taken to address the issue of housing affordability.

                    I must say, Senator Cameron, given your history and, perhaps, recent events, I am very surprised to hear you invoking the chief executive of a bank as your authority on a question on equity.

Through our Reducing Pressure on Housing Affordability Plan, the government is committing $570 million in spending and new incentives to unlock supply, to encourage more investment in affordable rental housing and to deliver additional homelessness funding. We are providing practical solutions across the entire housing spectrum, from Australians struggling to put a roof over their heads right through to older Australians looking to downsize. Our package will make more homes available—

                         That is the very opposite of the truth, Senator Cameron. If you merely listened to the answer, rather than staring off into space, you might learn something. The package that I've just outlined will make housing more available through collaboration across all levels of government to increase the supply of housing. The plan, which I'm asking you to listen to, Senator Cameron, involves a $1 billion National Housing Infrastructure Facility to build the critical infrastructure needed to bring forward the supply of housing; a new National Housing and Homelessness Agreement with the states and territories to provide funding certainty for homelessness services; and Commonwealth land releases, including the release of 127 hectares of

                         land in Maribyrnong, to open up more land for development. The package will make housing more affordable for Australians through savings incentives.
