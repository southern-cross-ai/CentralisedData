        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Senator Birmingham. The minister continues to rely on Minister Taylor's statement that false travel costs used in official ministerial correspondence to the Sydney lord mayor were obtained from a document—and I quote—'drawn directly from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         City of Sydney
        </a>
        's website'. This is despite the City of Sydney having provided metadata demonstrating that only the correct version of the document was ever made available on its website. When did the minister first become aware that Minister Taylor had used doctored travel costs in official ministerial correspondence?

         I do reject the premise of at least aspects of the question in terms of the use of the word 'doctored'. They were clearly incorrect, as Minister Taylor has acknowledged in his apology to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
          Lord Mayor
         </a>
         of Sydney. They were clearly incorrect, and he has acknowledged that.
        </p>
        <p>
         In terms of awareness of the incidence, I will have to check but I'm pretty sure that I became aware of it when it became a news story, Senator Watt. That would be when my awareness was enlivened. I would have been briefed before appearing either here or at estimates in relation to the handling of the matter, but those briefings would have occurred subsequent to Mr Taylor's public statements on the matter.

            Mr Taylor has made a clear statement in relation to the matter. He has made it publicly. He has made it in the House. I have no reason to doubt his statement in these matters. As you are aware from the extensive questioning we have had in this place, these matters will now no doubt be investigated. What I would note is you now seem to be deciding that you will come in here to try to do the job that you have asked the

              On the point of order, it is not directly relevant to talk about the person asking the question, but the minister immediately prior to that was being directly relevant, because he was talking about an alternative version of events—I think that is the fairest way to describe it—without using any of the pejorative terms, or trying to avoid the pejorative terms, of those asking those questions. He is allowed to outline a different version of events than that assumed by the questioner and still be directly relevant.

               As I said, Mr Taylor has made his statement. That is the statement that I have highlighted to this chamber time and time again, and that is the advice and the information I have as the representing minister to provide to this chamber. But I do note that those opposite called for a police investigation, and yet now they are trying to do it themselves.

                  </i>
                  of my earlier answers. I said that I had been briefed in relation to these matters, and I have so that I can provide the information to the Senate, which, as I have pointed out again and again, is based on the statements Mr Taylor has made and based on, obviously, his discussions in his office, in terms of the background of these matters.

                 <p>
                  The Labor Party have spent pretty much all of this question time engaged in a smear exercise. Can anybody in this place remember a single policy question they have asked during this question time? No! Can anybody in this chamber think of a single question they have asked that relates to issues affecting the lives of everyday Australians? No, not one! Have they asked a single question relating to the creation of another job for an Australian? Not one at all! It is because they have no care in anything but political muckraking.
