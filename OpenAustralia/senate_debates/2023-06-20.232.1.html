        This is a letter that Ireceived from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Campion" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Campion
        </a>
        , the parent of a biological female. He writes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Paul Campion, and I am the father of a beautiful 14-year-old biological female.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fact I have to explain her biology is part of the reason I wish to be heard.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My daughter is facing an uphill battle on two fronts from this onslaught of gender ideology.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The first battle is at high school in Queensland.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the past year, public schools in Queensland have allowed biological boys to declare themselves to be girls, and this gives them the 'right' to enter the change rooms of young biological girls!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My daughter is a champion swimmer at her school and has been subjected to biological boys entering the facilities, with phones, here she and other girls dress and undress.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When my wife and I approached the school administration after our daughter told us what was happening, the school told us there are no boys in the change room, they are girls!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My daughter is not stupid.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She can tell the difference between girls and boys, unlike many of the men and women in this parliament! Especially the Greens.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Those MPs and Senators should be ashamed of themselves; this is the most insane case of the emperor's new clothes the world has ever seen!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is a Marxist ideology disguised as the word woke!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Queensland Government is wearing a trench coat and exposing itself to young women and children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's a disgrace!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The young ladies are not in cubicles; these are the old-style open change rooms with a bench.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These young girls are being denied a safe and secure place to change at school swimming events.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That's just not acceptable.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Queensland government has declared anyone can identify as a woman.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The pathetic Minister for Women, Shannon Fentiman, actually said this: "anyone who identifies as a woman is a woman".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This opens up a whole new set of issues, as any male teacher who decides he is now a woman could potentially enter the change rooms and toilet facilities of girls as young as 12.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My daughter's case is a case in point.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Her basic human rights as an adolescent girl are being denied by the school allowing trans boys into her change room.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She has a right to privacy and safety while changing and using the facilities and so does every other young lady
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Young women and girls have enough to worry about while going through puberty, without having to worry about this child abuse from our own government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The threat, if not physical, is certainly psychological and these young impressionable biological females should not have to deal with the mental health issues and gender dysphoria of the opposite sex.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The second front my daughter faces is in her chosen sport.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Not only is she a champion swimmer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She is also an aspiring tennis player who, if she persists, may be good enough to earn a living from the sport.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However this may not be achievable following the comments made recently by Australian Tennis
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        Craig Tiley, who said he'd like to see trans women compete amongst biological women.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fact that biological men who play tennis as women will dominate and win all the money doesn't make it much of an opportunity for aspiring young biological female tennis players.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As her father I am offended.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        How dare this government abuse young children like they are.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The mental health of these young ladies is being abused and it will only be a matter of time until something more abhorrent happens to them physically thanks to this deranged ideology.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let's stop using the Latin word 'phobia' and use another that is more suitable. This is not 'trans-phobia'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is 'trans fastidium'—fastidium meaning disgust!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Leave my daughter alone.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let her grow into the beautiful young woman she wants to be without the threat of delusional and perverse men intruding on her life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is sinister and those who support this ideology should be ashamed for not standing up for women and children!
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend Mr Campion for writing this letter to me, because this is the feeling of many Australians. I've tried raising this issue in this parliament—and I will raise it again—to call for a Senate inquiry into puberty blockers and everything else. Gender dysphoria needs to be spoken about. We need to debate it. We have to get it out of our schools and protect the young girls and women that we have.
