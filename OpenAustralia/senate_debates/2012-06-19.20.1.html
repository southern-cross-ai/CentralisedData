           Senator Carr, just resume your seat. There are a few people that are a little bit excited this afternoon. We might just wait until they settle down. When there is silence, we will proceed.

            It is a sorry thing that we hear from the knuckle-draggers on the other side of the chamber, who have failed to face up to their responsibilities when it comes to ensuring a just society—because we know that a just society begins with a good education. It is the only way to give every Australian the chance to realise their full potential for themselves and for their country. It is the path to the high-wage, high-skill, high-tech jobs that people are entitled to expect. That is why this Labor government has made education the foundation of a richer, fairer and greener Australia. The schoolkids bonus is one of the steps we are taking along that path.
           </p>
           <p>
            The old education tax refund was a worthy initiative, but less than 20 per cent of eligible households were claiming the benefit in full. It was bypassing the poorest, those most in need. That is why the government has acted on the recommendation of the Henry tax review by replacing the refund with a schoolkids bonus. This is the sort of practical assistance that struggling families need to give their kids a fair go in school and in life. It is a shame that those opposite do not support these practical measures to help people get a good start in life.

              I am aware that this is a matter of some concern to the Leader of the Opposition, because he takes the view that we should deny our kids their bonus; he takes the view that people cannot be trusted to spend this money wisely.

              provides financial information services for families. It is a free and confidential service delivered by professional officers with specialist knowledge of income support systems. Anyone can speak to an officer by phone or set up an appointment to discuss any questions in depth. In the financial year to date, officers have assisted over 164,000 people through these channels. A further 77,000 people have attended over 2,600 public seminars. The Australian people have a clear choice: practical assistance for families or fear and smear from those opposite.

                The schoolkids bonus is simply one measure we are taking to combat the educational divide in this country. Another is the government's major investment in technology for schools. In 2007—Senator Mason would recall this—Labor promised that we would provide enough computers in schools for every senior high school student in the country, and we are delivering on that promise. Education authorities across the country have installed more than 950,000 computers, exceeding the original target of 786,000 computers by the beginning of the current financial year. This is what the National Secondary School Computer Fund means to our kids: it is a guarantee that they will not be left behind. And the opposition have promised to rip it away. The opposition want to drag our kids back to the cave in which they dwell. This is a government that always look to the future, and we urge the opposition to change their—
