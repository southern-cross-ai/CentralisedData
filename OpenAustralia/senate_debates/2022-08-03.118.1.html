        I also have two matters to follow up from question time this week. On 1 August, during question time I undertook to come back and provide further detail to Senator Ruston in relation to questions asked to the Minister for Health. I'm pleased to be able to provide further detail to the Senate now. Labor is committed to supporting patients to navigate the health system, including through nurse telehealth initiatives, particularly for those patients with rare, genetic and complex conditions. We recognise the role of telehealth nurses in assisting patients who are facing enormous life challenges in navigating the web of complex health services. That's why the Albanese government committed to providing $2.47 million to address this through the next budget. The government remains committed to implementing the election commitment to fund a program of supports for patients with rare and complex diseases to better navigate the health system. Minister Butler has directed the

        </a>
        to identify the best way to deliver these services, working directly with a range of organisations supporting people with rare genetic and complex conditions.
       </p>

        Yesterday, during question time, I undertook to come back and provide further detail to Senator Lambie in relation to questions the senator asked to the Assistant Treasurer and the Minister for Financial Services. I'm pleased to provide further detail to Senator Lambie and the chamber now. The government is currently in the process of considering consulting on draft regulations related to superannuation annual members' meeting notices. Superannuation funds are required to provide certain information in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMM" rel="nofollow">
         AMM
        </a>
        notices to members to support them in effectively engaging with trustees during the meeting. The question and answer process during the meeting remains the primary mechanism for members to obtain information from their fund that is directly relevant to their interests. The government's aim is to promote a high level of meaningful transparency for superannuation members by streamlining disclosure requirements for superannuation annual members' meeting notices. Regulations issued by the previous government did not align with the national accounting standards and led to double counting and other misleading information. Under the draft regulations funds will still be required to provide written notice to members that detail fund performance, their outcomes to the period, the total payments they make to industrial bodies, employer or employee, marketing and advocacy. There are no proposed changes to the disclosure of remuneration details.
