        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator McKenzie. Can the minister outline to the Senate how the Turnbull government's record investment in hospitals across Australia is benefiting patients within my home state—and her home state—of Victoria?

         I'm proud to be part of a government that is committed to bringing the budget back into balance, and our track record on economic growth has seen 17 months of jobs growth. It also allows us, as a government, to invest in the services that Australians deserve. We're providing record funding for new medicines and mental health services and a record investment in hospitals in every state and territory.

         contribution to state and territory public hospitals has increased from $13 billion in 2012-13 to a record $22.7 billion in 2020-21—70 per cent over the period.
        </p>
        <p>
         Moving forward beyond 2020, the government has put forward a generous offer to states and territories. We've committed an additional $30 billion for public hospitals, which will provide almost $128 billion over the five years from 2020. Every state would have a record funding amount—in each and every state and territory—meaning more doctors, more nurses and more services.

         and WA have signed the heads of agreement, but unfortunately our home state of Victoria hasn't. Under the new deal, Victorian hospital funding would increase from $24 billion in the five years from 2019-20 to more than $31 billion in 2020-24.

         have been putting politics ahead of patients in our home state, turning their backs on the more than $7 billion in extra funding for Victorian hospitals that is on the table. But, looking at the front page of the

         , they've had other things on their minds. I encourage the Victorian Labor government to follow the leadership of their WA colleagues and sign on to our hospital agreement, which will deliver recording funding support for the people of our home state.

            Our government's long-term national health plan is delivering for all Victorians. We've guaranteed the long-term future of Medicare and the PBS. Bulk-billing rates have increased, and this means Australians are able to access high-quality care without impacting the family budget. We've listed 1,500 new drugs, including life-changing drugs for lung cancer and leukaemia. In relation to private health insurance, we've delivered the most significant reforms in the past decade and the lowest change to premiums in the past 17 years.

            Mark Fitzgibbon as a thought bubble that doesn't make sense. Even the AMA has warned that it could lead to greater out-of-pocket costs for patients. We shouldn't be surprised, I guess, that this is the response to Labor Party policy—that it doesn't make economic sense. Just ask the pensioners and self-funded retirees of Australia.

               and his federal Labor lackeys have been alleging so-called funding cuts to Victorian hospitals. So I had a look at the numbers, and interestingly—please don't let the facts get in the way of your hypocrisy—the only cuts to Victorian public hospital funding have been from the state Labor Party government. It's true. At the Colac Hospital, Commonwealth funding increased by 96½ per cent. State government funding decreased by over 98 per cent. In my home town of Benalla, the Commonwealth government funding increased by 116 per cent, whilst under the Andrews government the state contribution has decreased by 25 per cent. It seems that the million dollars Daniel has been spending trying to keep the Ombudsman report quiet could have been better spent on health services for regional Victorians.
