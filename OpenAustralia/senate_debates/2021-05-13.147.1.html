        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, Senator Reynolds. Queensland is the most decentralised state in Australia and in 2020 had the highest internal migration of any state. Can the minister confirm that in Tuesday night's budget Queensland received the lowest rate of new infrastructure funding, per person, of any state?

         Thank you very much, Senator Watt, for that question. What I can confirm is what the government has done in this budget. There is a $110 billion pipeline of infrastructure projects around the nation over the next 10 years, including in Queensland—for example, $400 million in funding for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway

          Charters Towers

           On relevance: we didn't ask the minister for a list of projects. We've all seen them. The question was specifically about whether Queensland received the lowest rate of new infrastructure funding, per person, of any state.

            Ministers are given two minutes to answer the question. The minister has been going for 40 seconds. I've allowed you to remind the minister of the last part of the question. I note the minister was speaking about matters related to the state of Queensland, which was covered in both parts of your question, but I'm listening carefully. She has 80 seconds remaining to answer. Senator Reynolds.

             I can confirm that this investment in Queensland is actually in addition to the $1.3 billion that was committed in last year's budget. That included projects such as the Coomera Connector, stage 1; the M1,

                In addition to the infrastructure programs, of course, we have the city deals—for example, the City Deal in Townsville—because this government is committed to making our cities more productive. We're investing $381.7 million in the Townsville City Deal. It includes the Haughton pipeline stage 2, the port of Townsville channel upgrades, and the city deal job creation. Far from Queensland being left behind, Queensland, across many government programs and infrastructure projects, is receiving billions of dollars from the federal government, which is creating thousands and thousands of jobs right across Queensland.

With this record of promises not being delivered, why should any Queenslander believe the government's new promises in this year's budget?

                   I will ask senators again, on my right on that occasion, to not interject while questions are being asked.

                   <p>
                    There is a reason in this budget that we have made use-it-or-lose-it provisions—that is, the state governments regularly get allocated money from the federal government and do not spend it as we have agreed. The senator talks about water projects. In this budget the Australian government has committed to an additional $7.5 million towards the Rookwood Weir, half a million dollars towards the second stage of the Warwick recycled water and treatment upgrade, and there are many more. It is one thing for the federal government to allocate the money, but the state government has to deliver it, so I suggest that the question should be better directed towards the Queensland premier.
