        I'm absolutely delighted this afternoon to speak about a wonderful event I attended last Friday, hosted by the Somali Community Association of Queensland Inc. Queensland is truly, absolutely blessed to have its own Somali community, who make such an outstanding contribution to Queensland in every way.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Friday 23 February, the Somali Community Association of Queensland Inc held its annual professional and business networking event. I was absolutely delighted and honoured to be asked to attend. I'd like to congratulate the president, Mr Faysel Ahmed Selat, on a very successful event, and his team and everyone who participated—including those who flew interstate to come and participate in the event.
       </p>
       <p>
        To summarise the quality of this event and how inspired I was by this event, I want to tell you about two wonderful young Queenslanders—two wonderful members of the Queensland Somali community. Kifah Bulhan and her sister Amina Bulhan established the Fivestar Community Care centre. These two young ladies are in their 20s, and they established this wonderful Fivestar Community Care centre. And now they're employing Queenslanders, and pursuing their mission—I'll read their mission:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To make a meaningful difference in our community by providing compassionate and dedicated care to individuals with disabilities. We believe in fostering a nurturing environment where everyone can thrive, and it is this dedication that drives us every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        These two wonderful Australians, Kifah Bulhan and Amina Bulhan, are truly inspiring.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to congratulate everyone who received awards at the evening—and I'm going to run through this list, because I think it's important we put it on the record. Moonlight Family Day Care Services, Australian Halal Development and Accreditation, MasterRemit, Fivestar Community Care—who I've spoken about—and Beloved Care were the businesses who received awards. And I want to mention the individuals who received awards for demonstrating extraordinary dedication in supporting, caring for and inspiring others in the community: Fauzia Mohamed Dakane; Mohamed Bishar Omar; Fardowsa Abdirahman; Abdullahi Garfiiq; Fardowsa Yussuf; Abdi Samow; Ayan Ifiye; Zamzam Abdi; Mohamud Hassan; Amina Abdi; Yash Hanad Kamal; Nasra Aden; and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohamed_Ahmed" rel="nofollow">
         Mohamed Ahmed
        </a>
        . They are absolutely outstanding Australians, and our Somali community in Queensland makes a wonderful contribution to our state and to our country. I say to each and every one of you: it was absolutely inspiring and it was an honour to share the evening with you.
