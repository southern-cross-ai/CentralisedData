              Then I will rejoice in my ability to work without having leave! There have been significant discussions about the proposal that we are moving. Basically, what we are putting forward is that there be both a legislation committee inquiry and a references committee inquiry on the ChAFTA which would work over the next few weeks, with the intent and the commitment that the reports will be completed in time to begin the debate on the ChAFTA bill in this place on 9 November. That is the basis of our amendment. As there is already a references committee inquiry on this issue and people are aware of that and providing submissions to it, this amendment is to ensure the least confusion possible—so that people know that the two committees will be working on the bill. Both those reports will be completed by the agreed time to allow the debate to continue in this place from 9 November.

               In light of the undertaking by the opposition to facilitate consideration of the legislation by 9 November, the government will not proceed with its other amendment circulated in the chamber which was to have the inquiry report by 10 November 2015. We readily take the word of the opposition that their amendment is to facilitate consideration of the legislation commencing 9 November.
