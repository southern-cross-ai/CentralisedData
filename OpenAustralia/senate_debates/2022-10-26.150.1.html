              The government won't be supporting this order for the production of documents. Australia is greatly concerned about ongoing human rights abuses by the Myanmar military regime, including recent reports of civilians killed by military airstrikes in the Kachin state. We will continue to speak clearly and consistently in support of human rights around the world and we will act. Australia has reduced contact with the Myanmar military regime to only essential engagement. While engagement is unavoidable, we take every opportunity to convey Australia's grave concerns about the deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in Myanmar and strongly condemn the actions of the military regime.
