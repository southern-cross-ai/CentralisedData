        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson. I refer to the Abbott government's decision to cut $15 million from legal aid in last year's budget. I also refer to Ms Jane Needham

        , President of the New South Wales Bar Association, who said that, as a result of these cuts:

              I am not aware of these comments. I will go back and have a look at them and see what exactly was said. I do not accept the premise of your question; you will accept that. But I will go back and check it. But this does give me the opportunity to talk about something that did dramatically impact on veterans about three years, and that was the Building Excellence in Support and Training program. This is a program that provides support to veterans right across Australia, and without any—

                  —and the senator asked this question—how you could possibly justify removing $1 million without any notice from the advocacy and welfare services provided to Australia's veterans, which actually stops them getting to the stage where they might need to access legal aid. So, this is pure hypocrisy, and you should apologise to the veterans.

                   , I ask a supplementary question. The Attorney-General has previously claimed that the government's budget cuts would not affect front-line services. Isn't protecting the rights of war veterans to access their lawful entitlements a front-line service?

                    I am advised that the government will provide $1.3 billion over the next four years to support front-line legal services to vulnerable Australians, but I cannot add anything further to my earlier comments that I will go back and look at the comments you are referring to. But, Senator, what you need to understand is that these advocacy and welfare services provided under

                    actually go to organisations right throughout the country. And guess what these organisations do? They actually provide assistance to veterans to help them process their claims and applications and work their way through issues they might have. All you did, Senator, in your government—

                      was take $1 million out without any explanation at all—no explanation at all—and you remove the opportunities for veterans to get the support that they require from their own. This is crocodile tears, this is a very silly question, and you should, quite frankly, next time refuse to ask questions like this.

If you go back and ask the veterans in Tasmania what the outcome was of those dramatically reduced BEST funding arrangements, they will tell you that it has completely decimated the advocacy and welfare services in the state of Tasmania.
