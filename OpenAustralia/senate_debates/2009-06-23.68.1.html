       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 is to provide funding for the operations of the three Parliamentary Departments.

        As part of Operation Sunlight, the Government's reform agenda to improve Budget transparency and accountability, the Parliamentary Departments’ outcome statements have been revised to make them better targeted to improve Budget transparency and accountability. The changes to the outcomes provide greater clarity in terms of the results the Parliamentary Departments are seeking to achieve.

       <p class="italic">
        The total appropriation sought through this Bill is $172.7 million. Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the Schedule to the Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

        I rise to introduce Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2009-2010 which, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010, is one of the principal pieces of legislation underpinning the Government’s Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2009-2010 proposes appropriation for agencies to meet:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         payments direct to local government, and some national partnership payments through the states, the

       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2009-2010 seeks approval for appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund totalling $10.6 billion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The implementation of the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 has important implications for the Commonwealth’s arrangements for payments to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_and_Territories" rel="nofollow">
         States and Territories
        </a>
        and for Appropriation Bill (No. 2).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With the commencement of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
         COAG
        </a>
        ’s federal financial framework reforms on 1 January 2009, most of the annual appropriations for payments to the States and Territories will no longer be proposed in Appropriation Bill (No. 2). Instead, those payments will be made under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) will continue to propose appropriations for payments direct to local government, and payments through the States and Territories for non-government schools that are not paid from the Schools Assistance Act 2008 or the COAG Reform Fund.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Federal Financial Relations Act implements the centralised payments arrangement agreed by COAG and payments to the States and Territories are now contained in one piece of Commonwealth legislation. This streamlining will improve public transparency of these payments and the ability of the Parliament to scrutinise the payment arrangements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Appropriation Bill (No. 2) also contains an important new provision that will provide Parliament with a transparent mechanism to oversee the rate at which amounts committed to the Nation-building Funds and to the COAG Reform Fund are expended.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        intends that payments from the three Nation-building Funds and the COAG Reform Fund will be transparent and subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Accordingly, the Nation-building Funds Act and the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 provide a mechanism to specify maximum limits, called the ‘general drawing rights limits’, on the amounts that can be paid out from each of the four special accounts in a financial year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important to note that Bill 2 will not appropriate amounts to be paid from the various Funds.  The intention of specifying general drawing rights limits is to set maximum limits on the amounts that may be covered by drawing rights issued by the

        1997, for the purposes to which the limits apply.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of the Government’s Operation Sunlight program to increase the transparency of the Budget, Budget Paper No. 4 contains a new table providing details of all special accounts authorised under the Financial Management and Accountability Act. The new table shows, by portfolio and agency, estimated balances and flows for the budget year and for the previous year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, for the first time Budget Paper No. 4 contains separate estimates of receipts that agencies may retain and spend under section 31 of the Financial Management and Accountability Act, or which bodies under the Commonwealth Authorities and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Companies_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Companies Act
        </a>
        may spend in accordance with their enabling legislation. A separate column shows the estimated special account receipts from non-appropriated sources.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This means that Budget Paper No. 4 now contains complete estimates of agency funding identified by each source of appropriation. More detail on these changes is provided in the Introduction to the budget paper.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Agencies’ outcome statements have been revised to make them better targeted to improve Budget transparency and accountability. The changes to outcomes provide greater clarity in terms of the results agencies are seeking to achieve. These improvements do not create new outcomes or change the purposes for which the appropriations are provided. Accordingly, the administered expense appropriations for the revised outcomes are proposed in Bill 1.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Details of the proposed appropriations are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill, the main features of which were outlined in the Budget Speech delivered by my colleague, the Treasurer. I commend the Bill to the Senate.
