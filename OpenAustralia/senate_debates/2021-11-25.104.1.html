        [by video link] My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Colbeck. Two days ago, it was reported that the Andrews Labor government in Victoria has refused to rule out mandating COVID-19 injections for schoolchildren in that state. Does the Morrison government support COVID-19 injections being forced on schoolchildren in Australia—that is, without written parental permission?

         I thank Senator Roberts for his question. All people who have a COVID-19 vaccine are asked to provide consent to the process. That's part of the process by which we've put in place the vaccination program. We ask those receiving the vaccine to provide consent. Of course, in some circumstances, in sensitive sectors and on the basis of medical advice, we have worked with the states to require some members of the workforce to have a vaccine—for example, those in aged care or the health system, some frontline workers and people working in circumstances where the risk of contracting COVID is very strong.
        </p>
        <p>
         But all the way through, we have said, from a national perspective, that as much as possible it should be a voluntary process. I think the Australian people have demonstrated, through their actions, that they want to participate in the vaccination program. We're at over 90 per cent with a first dose and well over 85 per cent with a second dose. Australians have turned up in their droves to get vaccinated.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was looking at the figures this morning. Of those who are currently eligible to take up a booster shot—which is a bit over 500,000 people who, on the basis of their vaccination date, will have reached the six-month period—in excess of 75 per cent have turned up to have a booster shot. The Australian people have overwhelmingly demonstrated their understanding of the importance and value of vaccination, and they're turning up to get vaccinated.

            The Australian government continues to work cooperatively with the states with respect to the vaccine rollout through the forum of the national cabinet. Obviously the states and territories have, within their own realm, some capacities with respect to mandates, and we've seen that play out in some states. But overwhelmingly, from a national perspective, the position of the Australian government has been from the beginning and continues to be that the vaccination program should be a voluntary program. And, as I've indicated to you in the answer to your primary question, Senator—through you,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            —Australians have overwhelmingly demonstrated their desire to be vaccinated, because they know that we have safe vaccines, they know that they work and they know that the vaccines will protect them, their families and their communities, and that's important. I would urge all states to ensure they have a proper approval process—a consent process—for the application of vaccines.

              [by video link] I again thank the minister for his answer. Last week the Prime Minister stated that he did not support governments forcing injection mandates, yet state and territory governments are imposing these mandates on millions of Australian people, to drive injections. What measures has the Morrison government taken to ensure that Australian federal, state and territory governments are not enforcing COVID-19 injection mandates?

               (—) (): As I indicated very early in the answer to the primary question, there is a requirement for Australians to provide consent or, in the circumstances of a minor—a child aged between five and 11, for whom there is not yet an approved vaccine—for consent to be provided. That's the circumstance that I've indicated. I would expect that each state and territory comply with that process, that there is a consent provided, and, if there is a rationale for a medical exemption, that would be taken into account as a part of that process. My experience so far of medical exemptions is that they are very, very small. In the aged-care workforce sector, for example, those who received medical exemptions were about 0.3 per cent. But I would urge all states to ensure that the appropriate consents are obtained when providing vaccines to Australians.
