I think if you are going to call people to order you ought to call the minister to order. The senator was responding to those remarks. After your earlier intervention, I urge you to be even-handed in dealing with those issues.

                      As I was saying before the interjections, not only is Melbourne gearing up for the games but many of Australia’s towns and regions are getting into the spirit as the Queen’s Baton makes its way to the

                      . It is a wonderful tradition and a terrific symbol of Commonwealth unity. In total, some 3,500 people will carry the baton on its journey around Australia before it reaches its final destination at the MCG. The baton will travel through more than 500 Australian communities over 50 days and will be carried more than 21,500 kilometres. I congratulate all those who have taken part in the Queen’s Baton Relay and who have been chosen as community runners. It is the longest and most inclusive relay in history.

                      For those who have an interest in the Commonwealth Games—and most Australians do, I am pleased to say—the 18th Commonwealth Games will bring together some 4,500 athletes from 71 Commonwealth nations and territories. The Australian team will be the largest ever for a Commonwealth Games, with over 420 sportsmen and sportswomen all vying for a spot on the podium. The Australian government is proud to be supporting what will be Victoria’s biggest ever cultural and sporting event.

                      The games will provide us with not only an opportunity to see Australia’s elite sportsmen and sportswomen competing against some of the best athletes in the world but also a chance to showcase Australia’s cultural achievements. Last week, with the state government,

                      On 15 March the MCG will play centre stage to the rest of the world for the Commonwealth Games opening ceremony. Today the public had a sneak preview of what is believed to be the largest temporary stage ever assembled on the MCG. That will certainly attract some interest. This is a very important sporting event. It is important for Australia’s sportsmen and sportswomen. It is important for Australia; it gives us a chance to showcase Australia to the wider world. I am sure that most Australians will take great pleasure in these events, which will start in Melbourne in 16 days time.
