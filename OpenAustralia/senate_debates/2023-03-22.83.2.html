        G () (): I'd like to make some statements about the

        election on Saturday. I think it is a very important opportunity for people across New South Wales to make a judgement for our future which takes into account the recent past. It was only 12 years ago that the Labor Party concluded 16 years in government in New South Wales, where they ran the place into the ground. Anyone who has lived in Sydney or in New South Wales over the past decade knows that the city and the regions have been revitalised and rejuvenated by dynamic leadership, which you've seen. There has been huge construction of roads and transport routes across the state of New South Wales. Sydney is almost unrecognisable as a city to commute around because of the bold leadership that has been undertaken by

        and Dominic Perrottet.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge people across New South Wales to think carefully about our future and think carefully about the investments that have been made in Sydney and across New South Wales not just in roads but also in public spaces and museums. There has been enormous investment in clean energy and child care in the last couple of years across New South Wales, which has set the state up for success in the future. It is a very big choice that the people of New South Wales have on Saturdayâ€”between going back to the dead hand of Labor, with no progress or investment, and the very significant progress that has been seen under the Liberal-National coalition, where Sydney and New South Wales is back to where it should be, which is as the leading jurisdiction in Australia and a city and a state that we can be proud of. I urge people to vote 1 Liberal or National on Saturday across New South Wales.
