                      , I rise on a point of order relating to relevance. The minister is three-quarters of the way through his answer and he has specifically not answered either question with respect to when these politically motivated signs will be removed and whether the electoral acts of the states and territories have been breached. Could you draw him back to those questions, please?

They have nothing, no policies. Where is their education policy? Who would know? Where is their jobs policy? Silence on the other side of the chamber, because they do not have a jobs policy. What do they want to do with the stimulus? They want to stop it; they want to roll it back.

                                    This just shows how out of touch the Liberal Party are on education in schools. Neglect on one side, but obviously they are not visiting any schools, because every school that I visit, every principal I speak to, every teacher I speak to—and let me tell you I am speaking to a lot of them—are supportive of what we are doing under the Building the Education Revolution Program. Let me tell you about one school, Berowra Public School, which I went to over a week ago.
