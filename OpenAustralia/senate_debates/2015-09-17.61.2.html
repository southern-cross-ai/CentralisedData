         It is on the public record that the Prime Minister has asked all cabinet ministers to remain in cabinet until such time as he makes an announcement about a reshuffle which has been occasioned by his ascendancy to the prime ministership. And so, in due course, that announcement will be made. But he has asked all cabinet ministers to retain their positions and as a result I can confirm to the honourable senator that the answer is yes.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Has the Prime Minister asked the Treasurer, the defence minister, the finance minister and the Minister for the Environment to remain in his cabinet—it is a simple proposition here—or have they done the honourable thing, like Mr Dutton has, and offered their resignations?

           See the answer to the above question, which is that we have all been asked to remain in cabinet. The fact that Mr Dutton remains in cabinet I think speaks for itself. It stands to reason that in due course new announcements will be made and then the honourable senator will be relieved of any anxiety he might feel for the wellbeing of cabinet ministers.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the selection of a government Senate leader a matter for the Liberal Party Senate room or the Prime Minister? Is this the minister's last question time as leader and minister?

             <p>
              The situation is that in opposition the Liberal Party room elects its leader in this place, and I had the honour of being elected unopposed as leader. On the Abbott government winning, the Prime Minister made the determination as to who ought be leader in the place and he honoured me by giving me that position.
             </p>
             <p>
              The current Prime Minister has asked me to continue in that role and I have been continuing in that role. What happens next, nobody knows. We will find out in due course. One thing I was taught by my parents was to take one day at a time. It has been an absolute privilege and it continues to be a privilege to be of service to the people of Australia in whatever capacity I might be called upon to serve them.
