        My question comes from Bec Bridson of Buderim, and goes to the minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Nash. November sees Australia one step closer to the use of medical cannabis, with the allocation of licences for growing medical grade cannabis. The federal government has deemed the end product capable of treating ailments such as epilepsy and cancer, and of pain management. But, more broadly, this miracle oil or capsule from whole-plant production is proving beneficial to sufferers of Crohn's disease, Parkinson's,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
         PTSD
        </a>
        , rheumatoid arthritis, autism, dementia, Tourette's, type 2 diabetes, irritable bowel syndrome—the list goes on. My question is: why is the government allowing states, if they choose to introduce medical cannabis, to regulate the trials and patient groups for this urgently needed life-saving drug on a state-by-state basis?

         I thank Senator Hanson for her question and for her obviously very sincere interest in this issue. The reason the states deliver those trials is that it is the responsibility of the states and territories to do that—that is the appropriate mechanism through which they should be delivered. This government has now—I think very responsibly—through the Minister for Health and Aged Care and her leading work provided an opportunity for those people who need to access medicinal cannabis for health purposes to do so.
        </p>
        <p>
         Obviously there needs to be a strict regulatory environment, and this government has put that in place. Once these processes have been concluded, we are going to see people being able to access medicinal cannabis, which they were not able to do before. I have to note that the community drive to ensure that this was put in place was not insignificant, and it came from people across many communities. I know that my colleague here, Senator Ian Macdonald, was one of those involved in the committee process that looked in detail into the benefits and into how this will operate. I think we have the balance right; I think we have landed at a point where we are going to be able to deliver something that will provide health benefits but at the same time maintain that very strict regulatory requirement that is needed to ensure the safety and efficacy of the delivery of this medicine. In relation to the question of delivery through the states and territories, that is the appropriate process.

           Senator Nash, is the government aware that tomorrow Queensland will debate and vote on passing the use of synthetic medical cannabis in lieu of whole-plant cannabis, which health workers claim will be detrimental to patients' wellbeing?

              Senator Nash, can you please give me an example of a controlled drug, either on the PBS scheme or otherwise, that is administered on a state-by-state basis? If not, why doesn't the federal government take full control and make this a federally administered drug?

               I am not aware of the level of detail that is required by that question, so, again, I am very happy to take that on notice for the senator so that I can get her a fulsome answer. What I will say is that right across this country people are very appreciative of the fact that this government has made some sensible, measured decisions about being able to deliver medicinal cannabis for health purposes to support those people who need it—people who are in those circumstances where this has been deemed to be the most appropriate use of medication to assist them.
