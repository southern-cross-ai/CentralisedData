        Before I start my contribution here today, I would like to just take up one point in Senator Rennick's contribution, and that is about teachers. We have a former teacher right here in Senator O'Neill, who is a very good teacher. I also would like to say on behalf of all teachers out there: I'm sure they can, Senator Rennick.

        I want to draw the Senate's attention to the plight of Tasmania when it comes to the attention of this government, the Morrison government, because it has become sadly clear that Tasmanians are being overlooked and left behind by Mr Morrison. There is a litany of broken promises, job opportunities missed and people and businesses doing it tough who have been abandoned and left behind by this Prime Minister. It's become a story of a flood of dollars for mates on the mainland compared with a trickle of cents for those in need in Tasmania. When it came to his own backyard, the Prime Minister, Mr Morrison, had no difficulty in finding the funds needed to build the second airport in Sydney, off the back, mind you—and I know Madam Acting Deputy President Faruqi will know this, as she is from

        —of a dodgy land deal. Mr Morrison has no trouble splashing cash on his mates, but when it comes to investing in or supporting jobs in Tasmania all we get is spin and reannouncements with no substance. In fact, the Liberals have repeatedly dangled projects, like the new bridge across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_River" rel="nofollow">

        , in front of Tasmanians. Yet time and again, budget after budget, they have failed to stump up any substantial investment to actually deliver on their promises. It is all smoke and mirrors.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm glad Senator Duniam is in the chamber, because I know that he knows only too well how this is spot on. It is all about stunts, re-announcements and spin. Promises are left unfilled and opportunities are missed because this government repeatedly leaves Tasmania off the map. It's a speech you should be giving, because you know it's correct, Senator Duniam.

          My apologies, Madam Acting Deputy President. Tasmania is well behind the eight ball in the development of a clean energy hydrogen production and export industry at

          , because this government and this Prime Minister are long on rhetoric and short on actual delivery. They failed to make a commitment towards this important new industry for Northern Tasmania at the last election, and, whilst they like to make supportive noises—as they have done in the past on many projects, they make the noises and talk about support—they have continued to fail when it comes to stumping up any actual investment. This failure has real-world, tangible impacts.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have the potential, with the right investment from the federal government, to create well-paid, secure and decent manufacturing jobs in Northern Tasmania, but this government and this Prime Minister simply aren't interested. When it comes to rorting taxpayers' money and securing dodgy land deals for mates in his own backyard, this Prime Minister can't sign up quickly enough, but, when it comes to actually investing in creating jobs in places like Tasmania, he's nowhere to be seen. Tasmania desperately needs more good and secure jobs and jobs with higher wages. With higher unemployment and lower wages, a greater proportion of people and businesses in Tasmania are reliant on JobKeeper and JobSeeker than the nation as a whole. Yet next month Mr Morrison and this government are proposing to abandon these people and businesses by ending JobKeeper and axing the coronavirus supplement.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government claims it will have something to announce. We've heard that before. This is what the government is saying: the government claims it will have something to announce regarding JobSeeker prior to the end of the supplement. Sadly, the many thousands of Tasmanians who rely on this payment to make ends meet and put food on the table are now used to this government stringing them along until the last possible minute. This is no way to give people the certainty they need to help them secure a job. This is no way to treat people who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves without a job or without enough hours of work because of the impacts of this pandemic. We also know that many tourism, travel, creative and event businesses and workers in these industries are continuing to struggle with international borders set to remain closed for some time and the continuing impact of capacity restrictions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Just this week, the Tourism Export Council released figures showing that domestic travel has replaced less than 20 per cent of the revenue received from international visitors. In fact, 55 per cent of tourism businesses exposed to the international market will not survive until September without some kind of government support. Yet, as it has done to unemployed Australians, the government has failed to communicate with businesses in the tourism industry about any plan.
