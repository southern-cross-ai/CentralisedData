        <i>
         Gay Information Quarterly Journal
        </i>
        (Spring 1982) in which he stated the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "And a new political position is needed for there are significant political struggles at stake. First we have three legal/social questions to win: custody rights for gay men and lesbians; the legal right of paedophiles and their young lovers; and finally the sexual rights of children as a whole...."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "How different then is that gentle, tentative sexuality between parent and child from the love of a paedophile and his/her lover? From all their accounts and from many academic studies (some worse than others) that kind of love, warmth, support and nurture is an important part of the paedophilic relationship. I am not saying that mothering/fathering is paedophilic; but I am saying they are not mutually exclusive..."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "...The current paedophilia debate is then crucial to the political processes of the gay movement: paedophiles need our support, and we need to construct the child/adult sex issue on our terms."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "We need to protect the youthful partners in paedophilia against the legal and social management systems which treats them as delinquents...";
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) condemns:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) any statement that supports any form of legal rights or political freedoms for paedophiles, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) as "vulgar and reprehensible" Professor Dowsett's past statements regarding advocacy for paedophilia and any connection between parenting and sexual/paedophilic "pleasures";
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) acknowledges that an overwhelming number of Australian parents would be concerned about any individual who has made past statements regarding advocacy for paedophilia to continue to be employed at any Australian university;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) calls on Professor Dowsett to publically explain:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) his past statements regarding advocacy for paedophilia, and detail his current beliefs specifically on the question of whether the

        (e) calls on La Trobe University to:

       <p class="italic">
        (ii) publically explain what due diligence has been undertaken—throughout any period of Professor Dowsett's employment at the University—to investigate what risk and/or impact Professor Dowsett's past statements and any current views held consistent with those statements, regarding paedophilia might place on the wellbeing of young students at its institution, and
       </p>

           Issues relating to child protection and child exploitation are serious and draw the rightful condemnation of members of this government. Universities enjoy autonomy to operate and freedom of thought within the regulatory framework. However, as recipients of taxpayer funding, universities must ensure they operate within the law and in accordance with the community's expectations.

              I foreshadow that the opposition will be seeking to split the question on this motion and vote on parts (a) and (b) together and differently on parts (c), (d) and (e). Labor supports the first and second parts of this motion, condemning what Professor Dowsett wrote, in an article published 35 years ago, in support of the rights of paedophiles. However, Labor does not support parts (c), (d) and (e) of this motion, on the basis that to indirectly or directly call for specific actions against an individual, including for employment to be terminated, is not an appropriate use of the protections of parliamentary privilege in this instance, especially as that individual is outside of this parliament.

                 will not support this motion. The motion is simply a rerun of attacks from 2016 against the integrity of a well-respected academic and the institution that employs him. As is so often the case, references from an article published 36 years ago have been removed from their context in order to confect a social outrage.
