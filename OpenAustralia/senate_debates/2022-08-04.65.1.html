        It was just over 10 weeks ago that the people of Australia voted for changeâ€”voted to put the heart and hard work back into government. Just 10 weeks ago, new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese promised that Labor would work hard every day to bring Australians together, to build a better, brighter future for all. And, true to this promise, we have hit the ground running.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here are my top 10 reforms of our first 10 weeks. First, we successfully supported a wage increase for Australia's lowest-paid workers. Second, we wrote to Fair Work for a pay rise for our essential aged-care workers. Third, we passed legislation to help fix aged-care quality and safety. Fourth, we established a Jobs and Skills Summit to deliver good, secure jobs. Fifth, we introduced legislation to tackle the skills crisis. Sixth, we restored our reputation on the world stage. Seventh, we committed to reducing emissions, and today we delivered in the House. Eighth, we introduced legislation for paid family and domestic violence leave. Ninth, we moved to scrap the cashless debit card. Tenth, we took the first steps towards enshrining a First Nations Voice to parliament, and I could not be more proud.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've taken action on jobs and wages. We've rebuilt our global reputation. And we have put respect at the heart of government. And this is just the beginning. So get used to it, on the opposition benches! There is much more to do. In just 10 weeks, we've done what the previous government failed to do in almost 10 years. This is what good government can do. This is what Labor governments always do: we work hard every day for the people of Australia, and we get the job done.
