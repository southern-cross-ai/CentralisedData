        </a>
        . For too long they have had to put up with the stench and disease-threat from a colony of bats that have taken up residence in surrounding trees.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And Mr President we are talking about tens of thousands of bats here, not just a few.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Bubblers and seats have been covered to avoid contamination. Classrooms have had their windows permanently closed, and air conditioning has been installed in some rooms because the windows cannot be opened. Car parks, walkways and disabled accesses are all going to be covered because of the flying foxes. The surrounding residential area has also had to put up with this nightmare.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Federal Government would not agree to the removal of the bats, so the State authorities would not seek a licence for their removal.  The Member for Cowper Luke Hartsuyker took up the cause of the 1100 students and teachers and the nearby residents when the Member for the adjoining electorate of Page Janelle Saffin stood idly by and did absolutely nothing. She did say “Flying foxes have been in Maclean for many years, and the problem is one that is primarily a result of poor state planning.”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Federal Member for Page is also on the record as suggesting the school could be relocated so that the bats may stay.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In other words, hiding behind red tape and placing the interests of the bats ahead of the welfare of the people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was Labor and the bats vs the Maclean community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This legislation, supported by a petition signed by some 4,300 people, will address this disgraceful situation so that the teachers, students and residents of Maclean can be free of this menace and a permanent long term solution can be put in place.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It will stop the bureaucratic merry-go-round by removing the Federal Minister from the process and allow the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Government" rel="nofollow">
         State Government
