         There are so many false premises in that short question, Senator Watt. Might I remind you that what we are talking about is a piece of state legislation that was supported not only by the Liberal-National Party government of

That was what it was about. In any eventâ€”

           The point of order is relevance. The senator was not asked about the history of the Bell litigation. The senator was asked a single question: did the Attorney-General prevent, discourage or inhibit attempts to challenge the WA government's Bell legislation? Can he just answer that question?

                 So, Senator Watt, that is what this was about. Nevertheless, backed by litigation funders who had no interest whatsoever in bringing these proceedings to an early conclusion, that bipartisan legislation was challenged in the High Court by initiating proceedings filed on 27 November 2015. I did not do anything to interfere with those proceedings, because I did not know about them.

                         Of course he is allowed to do that. I am not saying he is not. The primary question, and the question you have just asked, was answered by the Attorney-General when he quoted in the primary question that he did not prevent because he had no knowledge. So I think he has answered that question but I will give the call to the Attorney-General.
