         What a pleasant and professional approach Senator Reynolds brings to her question. Australia has a long and proud history of support for multinational peacekeeping operations. Since 1947, we have provided over 65,000 personnel to more than 50
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         personnel across three UN missions in the

         the United Kingdom Secretary of Defence, the Right Honourable Michael Fallon, convened the UN Peacekeeping Defence Ministerial Meeting in London. It was attended by defence ministers and senior military representatives from over 80 nations, including many from our own region, and the

          US

         Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter. It was an opportunity for the international community to review the progress which was made against pledges given at President Obama's convened peacekeeping summit of 2015 and then to also discuss how UN peacekeeping can be improved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our pledge in 2015 was in particular to provide strategic airlift support for the UN peacekeeping operations. I am pleased to say that since 2015 we have progressed our commitment. We are developing what is known in UN terminology as a 'letter of assistance' that will set out the requirements, the processes for Australian airlift assets to potentially be assigned to UN operations, the speed with which that might happen, the responsive levels and so on. At the conference, I announced that Australia would provide additional funding of over $1.25 million over five years to further enhance UN peace operations for e-learning training and also $90,000 to support the dissemination of UN protection of civilians guidelines and policy.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we outlined in the 2016 defence white paper, Australia is one of the most active supporters of the

           I thank the minister for her response. We have clearly got a lot to be proud of in our ADF and in our peacekeepers. Is the minister also aware of any Australian initiatives that promote the role of women in peacekeeping operations?

              . During the meeting, I was very pleased to moderate the Women, Peace and Security session with my colleagues from Norway, the United Kingdom, Bangladesh and Japan. Australia has been a strong and consistent advocate for the UN's women peace and security agenda and we are very proud to be doing our part to increase the number of women serving in peace and security operations and in supportive inclusive peace processes.

              The Australian national action plan forms the basis of the government's efforts to address the impact of conflict on women and girls and to improve women's participation in preventing violence. Defence is implementing the women, peace and security agenda in corporate planning, in operational activities, in doctrine and in training. Women have commanded Australian contingents to Operation Masurka in the Sinai and

                 </a>
                 commitments, we are also helping to train and educate soldiers and police in our region to contribute to peacekeeping operations. In fact in May of this year, over 100 students from 24 countries participated in our biennial international peacekeeping training exercise known as PIRAP JABIRU which we co-host with Thailand. PIRAP JABIRU enables participants to gain a much deeper understanding of contemporary UN missions and, even more importantly, how we can work more effectively together in those contexts.

                <p>
                 A new range of peacekeeping training initiatives has been developed at the ADF's Defence Peace Operations Training Centre, which include regional e-learning, increased pre-deployment trainingâ€”preparing for the culture and the context to which they are going to be deployedâ€”and a new humanitarian assistance disaster relief seminar as well. Defence is also developing gender adviser training in that context.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We provide significant support for doctrinal development and training for UN peacekeepers. I am proud of our continuing contribution to UN peacekeeping.
