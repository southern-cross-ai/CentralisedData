        I amend the motion, omitting the figure '400,000' in paragraph (e) and substituting the figure '800,000', and seek leave to make a short statement before I ask that the amended motion be taken as a formal motion.

          Thanks, Mr Deputy President. This amendment reflects a phone call that I received only last night from the office of the foreign affairs minister, Senator Bob Carr, and the office indicated that they would support this motion if I changed the figure. The figure of 400,000 was actually ascertained from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
           DFAT
          </a>
          site. When we went to have a look at the actual figure yet again yesterday, we saw that the figure had actually been taken down and when we tried to ascertain the accuracy of the figure they gave us, which was 800,000, we could not do that directly from the DFAT website because there was no figure on it and we could not do it from the minister's website because there was no indication of the figure, as with the smartraveller website. The only document that indicated that there was a figure close to 800,000 was in a speech that the Governor-General made, which I think reflects on the accuracy of the department and the foreign minister himself. I move the motion, as amended:
