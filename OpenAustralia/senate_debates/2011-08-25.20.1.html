                 , on a point of order on your ruling: it does not reverse the substance. The motion as it now stands congratulates Townsville Enterprise on its role reducing the housing supply pressures in Townsville through various means. The substantive part of the amendment is that it congratulates Towns­ville Enterprise Ltd. I want to remove that substantive part by deleting paragraph (b) in its entirety.

                  , on the point of order. I understand what Senator Ian Macdonald is seeking to do. Unfortunately, the challenge Senator Macdonald has is that it would in fact contravene section 92 which says:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  An amendment to a question may not be moved if it is the same in substance—
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  this does not apply—
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  as an amendment already determined to the same question, or would have the effect only of reversing an amendment already made.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  The amendment has been made and carried. The will of the Senate has been expressed. The amendment that you are now seeking would reverse that. On that basis—

                   , further to the point of order, what Senator Ludwig said is simply factually not correct. The amendment added some different qual­ifiers to the original motion, which was not amended. What we are now doing is delet­ing, to put it this way, any congratu­lations to Townsville Enterprise Ltd. The reason I do that, as I will say in my two-minute noting—if I am allowed to—is that it just does not make sense.

                    I now have a copy of the amendment before me, which was 'to delete paragraph (b) and replacing it with the following'. It was not an addendum to the existing paragraph (b), it was deleting the paragraph and replacing it. The amendment that you are now proposing is to delete the amendment that was just carried by the Senate.

                      I did not have the wording before me before, Senator Macdonald. I now have it before me and it makes it clear that what you are proposing is in contravention of standing order 92 because the amendment that was moved by Senator Bob Brown clearly deleted the existing paragraph.

                         <p class="italic">
                          In particular, the number of statements being made by leave in relation to complex motions leads to a

                           The amendment as it has been now carried talks about reducing housing supply pressur­es in Townsville through the redevelopment of the

                           . They may be reducing housing supply pressures but not through the redevelopment of Lavarack Barracks. Lavarack Barracks was extended, I might say, on an initiative of the Howard government in bringing the 3rd Battalion of the

                           to Townsville and providing accommodation for them, and a lot of the activity relates to general positive development works not just in housing but right across the vein in Townsville, some $53 billion worth of development.

                           The amendment moved is simply nonsensical. It was done, obviously, by Senator Brown with his mates in the Labor Party to try and get some credit for the Labor Party putting some money in the 2011-12 budget. As I mentioned, these were initia­tives of the Howard government. I would not expect the Greens ever to acknowledge any­thing positive the Howard government did, like bringing the 3rd Battalion to Townsville and providing the initial stages of funding to facilitate that and the housing and other development which we needed in Townsville.

                            facility that Senator Mac­donald has been referring to to the beautiful city of Townsville, which I had the pleasure of revisiting just a few months ago. I also want to congratulate the Gillard government on the expenditure described in the amend­ment which has gone to carrying on that good work and that development in Towns­ville. There are some contentious develop­ments in Townsville, but I would agree with the reference to positive develop­ments that Senator Macdonald made. It does indicate that not all the developments there are with­out contention. I think it is a good motion, and we are proud to have supported it.
