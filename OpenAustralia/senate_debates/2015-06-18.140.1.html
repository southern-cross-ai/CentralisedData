         I thank Senator Reynolds for the question and thank her for her service to this nation as well. In August 1915 the Anzac forces began what was called the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_Offensive" rel="nofollow">
          August Offensive
         </a>
         , the last great push to remove the Turkish forces from Gallipoli. It was probably the most fierce of our campaigns in Gallipoli. The casualties were enormous, and seven Australians were awarded the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Cross
         </a>
         during that particular campaign. To honour the service of those men, on 6 August this year there will be another major commemorative event at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lone_Pine" rel="nofollow">
          Lone Pine
         </a>
         . It is the first of its type, and the department is gearing up for that as it did for the Anzac Day services. I want to place on record my deep and abiding thanks to the department staff for the fantastic job they did.
        </p>
        <p>
         This service will start at five o'clock on 6 August. Today I want to announce a free and non-compulsory registration scheme to enable those Australians wishing to attend the ceremony to register to receive information about the commemoration. This commemorative event will not be ticketed or balloted as the Anzac Day service was. There will be about 5,000 places for those who wish to attend the service. I strongly encourage people who might be interested in going to register their interest in attending to enable the government to provide them with the information necessary to ensure the appropriate conduct of the ceremony. We encourage those who are attending to be there by midafternoon to enable security and other screening to take place.

           Again, I thank Senator Reynolds. As honourable senators will be aware, the Prime Minister and I announced that we will be returning those men from Terendak, and some dependents as well. This is righting a 50-year wrong and it will be in the run-up to the 50th anniversary next year of Vietnam Veterans Day. I met with the Malaysian deputy minister last week in Malaysia. He advised me of the government's very, very strong support to return these men. I want to thank

           and Bob Shewring, together with the late Tim McCombe, for this. The member for Solomon has also been of significant assistance.

           will be one of the most significant commemorative events in this nation over the Centenary of Anzac period. Bringing home these men, righting a 50-year wrong, is a very, very important part of that.

             Thank you again, Senator Reynolds. As the Senate has heard me say before, this four-year period is about a centenary of service and sacrifice, not just about events at Gallipoli. As part of that I today announce the opening of the recruitment process for an official historian to oversee the writing of the official history of Australia's involvement in Iraq, Afghanistan and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
              East Timor
             </a>
             . The government has provided $12.8 million in the recent budget to ensure that the

              I thought those opposite might be remotely interested in this. This is about our contemporary veterans. These official histories will, as we have done with all official histories, tell the story of the contribution of these young men and women to this nation.
