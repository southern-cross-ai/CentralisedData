        Pakistan is experiencing some of the most intense political, economic and climate turmoil it has seen in decades. The nation is caught in a debt spiral and the economy is in a nosedive. Pakistan has billions in debt from overseas governments and institutions, and inflation is at record highs. The cost of living is rising, and people are struggling like never before. Pakistan desperately needs

        </a>
        funds to avoid defaulting on its soaring debt. The shackles of debt have crippled countries like Pakistan for far too long, and it's high time to cancel the debt for the global South. The extent of Pakistan's debt means that social services are being neglected at a time when the country is still reeling from the catastrophic climate induced floods, which last year killed more than 1,700 people—a third of them children—and impacted and displaced millions. The floods caused more than $30 billion in damage. Terrifyingly, this year's monsoon season is off to a foreboding start, with Cyclone Biparjoy set to make landfall shortly.

        Amongst all this, Pakistan has been facing growing political instability, which was triggered by former prime minister Imran Khan's removal from office in April last year. There have been terrible stories of arrests, torture and pressure put on party figures. Human rights groups are concerned about extrajudicial disappearances. The media has reported police brutality and repression. The crackdowns on media and dissent have been extensive. The growing reports of violence are deeply concerning, and violators of human rights must be held accountable. Democracy and human rights must be protected. Having grown up in Lahore, and hearing about the current situation and turmoil from family every day, I find it really distressing, and I express my solidarity with the people of Pakistan and the diaspora here.
