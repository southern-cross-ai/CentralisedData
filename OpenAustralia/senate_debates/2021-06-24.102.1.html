        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hume. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        suffered its first mass coral bleaching in 1998, the first in recorded history. Even though our best climate models at the time predicted it wasn't possible to have back-to-back mass coral bleachings, they did occur in 2016 and 2017. We had a fourth mass coral bleaching in 2019-20. The reef is believed to have lost half of its coral cover. Your own internal reports in 2019 downgraded the status of the reef from poor to very poor. Last year,

        ESCO downgraded the status of the reef to critical. Minister, do you agree that the Great Barrier Reef is in danger?

         Thank you very much, Senator, for your question. The Morrison government is deeply committed to protecting the

          Great Barrier Reef

         . Benchmarked against global standards, Australia's management of the reef is recognised as a leading example and is considered by many to be the gold standard for large-scale marine protected area management, according to that same

        <p>
         The centrepiece of Australia's reef-protection efforts is the Reef 2050 Plan, jointly developed with the Queensland government. The plan has been delivered, and it is achieving results. We have reduced pressures on the reef, built reef resilience and strengthened partnerships for the future. The Australian and Queensland governments are now investing more than $3 billion, from 2014-15 to 2023-24, to implement the Reef 2050 Plan. More than $2 billion of this is from the Australian government, which is an unprecedented investment. They are big numbers, but what does that mean at the ground level? It means that the custodian of

            Senator Whish-Wilson, you will resume your seat. Senators will note that in the previous series of questions I reminded senators that, when questions are very strictly worded, the test of direct relevance can easily be strictly applied. This question contained a preamble, and I believe the minister was being directly relevant by stating facts that are relevant to assertions you made in your preamble, Senator Whish-Wilson. You've reminded the minister of the last part of your question, but she is free to continue being directly relevant to parts of the question as well. Senator Hume.

                    , and we fully recognise that the Great Barrier Reef is facing significant pressures from climate change and from other impacts. We do not support the recommendation to immediately place the reef on the List of World Heritage in Danger, and we will strongly oppose that recommendation. We think that this recommendation is premature and doesn't recognise the enormous efforts of the Australian and Queensland governments working with farmers, working with tourism operators, working with traditional owners and working with local communities up and down the reef coast to protect the reef and to support them with a $3 billion joint investment. This government has been stunned by the backflip on previous assurances by

                      ? As Dr Douvere suggested, are you going to stand together with the international community, rather than fight this, and address the issue at hand, which is that without climate action there is no future for the Great Barrier Reef?

                       , because the Morrison government, I reiterate again, is deeply committed to protecting the reef. That is why the Australian and Queensland governments are now investing more than $3 billion from 2014-15 to 2023-24 to implement the Reef 2050 Plan. More than $2 billion of this is from the Australian government, which is an unprecedented investment.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Australia's practical action on emissions reduction goes hand in hand with our practical action on reef protection and climate adaptation. This includes efforts to improve the health of the reef and its resilience to climate change by reducing local and regional pressures and leading the way in reef adaptation science through measures like $150 million for the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program. That's a word-leading project to find innovative ways for the coral reef to adapt to the impacts of climate change, an issue that I know is so dear to your heart, Senator Whish-Wilson.
