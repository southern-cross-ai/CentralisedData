        No. 1) Act 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 1 to this Bill implements stronger rules for foreign residents owning Australian housing to reduce pressure on housing affordability.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Firstly, foreign residents will be denied access to the main residence capital gains tax (CGT) exemption from 7.30pm
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEST" rel="nofollow">
         AEST
        </a>
        on 9 May 2017 except in the case of certain life events that occur within six years of losing their Australian residency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A grandfathering arrangement will apply for properties already held at that time, with the change taking effect for these properties from 1 July 2020. This will provide foreign residents sufficient time to consider and plan their affairs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These amendments will also allow foreign residents to continue to access to the main residence exemption within 6 years of becoming a foreign resident if a CGT event occurs to their Australian property and during that period they experience certain life events - their death, or divorce (and equivalent) or terminal illness, or the death or terminal illness of their spouse, or child who is under 18 years old.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Secondly, this schedule addresses an integrity issue with the CGT rules for foreign residents that hold indirect interests in Australian real property, such as land, from
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        7.30pm AEST on 9 May 2017.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This reform addresses an integrity issue with the principal asset test to require a foreign resident to consider any interests held by its associates, if it disposes of an indirect interest in Australian real property for example by selling shares in a land rich company.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This ensures the principal asset test cannot be circumvented by disaggregating holdings of membership interests.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These foreign resident CGT changes, together with the 2017 expansion of the foreign resident CGT withholding regime, are expected to have a gain to revenue of $510.0 million over the forward estimates period to 2020-21.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 2 to this Bill delivers on the Government's commitment to introduce tax incentives to boost investment in affordable housing, to create the right incentives and improve outcomes for those in need.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill allows resident investors in qualifying affordable rental housing to obtain a CGT discount of up to 60 per cent from 1 January 2018. Under current arrangements, individuals generally receive a 50 per cent capital gains discount for CGT assets held for at least 12 months. This includes residential investment properties that are supplied for affordable housing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The additional CGT discount will be available to resident investors who hold affordable housing directly or through certain trusts, such as holding units within a managed investment trust.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To qualify for the additional discount, the affordable housing must be held for a period of at least three years from the start date of this measure, and be managed through a registered community housing provider in accordance with state and territory housing policies and registration requirements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure encourages increased investment in affordable rental housing and forms part of the Government's housing affordability package announced in the 2017-18 Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This measure is estimated to have a cost to revenue of $15.0 million to 2020-21.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Schedule 3 of this Bill is a technical amendment that introduces a reconciliation payment for the near-new dwelling exemption certificate that has already been introduced through Regulation changes on 24 June 2017. This change supports the streamlined foreign investment framework announced in the 2017-18 Budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This amendment provides the mechanism for imposing a fee on the developer for each near-new dwelling sale to foreign persons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to thank those that contributed to the public consultation on the draft legislation for these measures.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In conclusion, the Government through this Bill is creating the right incentives as part of our comprehensive and targeted plan to improve outcomes across the housing spectrum.
       </p>

       <p class="italic">
        These amendments introduce a reconciliation fee on developers for dwellings sold to foreign persons under a near-new dwelling exemption certificate. The near-new dwelling exemption certificate was introduced through regulatory amendments that took effect from 24 June 2017.
