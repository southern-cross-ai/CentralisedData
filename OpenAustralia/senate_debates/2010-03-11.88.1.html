           I thank Senator Pratt for her question. A Perth company, Orbital Australia, has been awarded a $440,000 grant from the Green Car Innovation Fund to develop its carbon-cutting engine technology for the Chinese auto maker
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changan_Automobile" rel="nofollow">
            Changan Automobile
           </a>
           . Orbital will carry out this work, under the grant, in Perth. This is great news for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           and great news for the Australian auto industry. It is the latest in a series of success stories for the government’s A New Car Plan for a Greener Future. This is a plan which is transforming the automotive industry, and it has put it on a more environmentally and economically sustainable footing. It is also based on the principles of partnership and mutual obligation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Consistent with those principles, Orbital will more than match the grant with investment of its own. That support will be provided through Orbital’s development of its FlexDI engine management and combustion system. The air-assisted direct injection technology has the potential to deliver best-in-class fuel economy for passenger cars and other applications. It will be applied to Changan’s four-cylinder petrol engine to produce a car that complies with the new Chinese fuel economy standards.
          </p>
          <p>
           Changan is China’s fourth largest auto maker, with sales of 1.8 million vehicles last year and projected sales of 2.2 million vehicles this year. The partnership between Orbital and Changan Automobile is an important development in Australia’s deepening relationship with the world’s biggest car maker.

             The automotive sector is the cornerstone of Australian manufacturing, and manufacturing is the cornerstone of the Australian economy. The global recession hit our manufacturing sector hard, and companies and workers have responded creatively to minimise the loss of skills and capacity. The industry is now in a position to take advantage of the recovery and new opportunities in major markets like those in China.
            </p>
            <p>
             The Australian Industry Group’s Performance of Manufacturing Index hit 54 last month. I am sure senators would be aware that a reading of above 50 indicates that the activity is actually expanding. The index has been in positive territory for six of the last seven months. While manufacturing still faces many challenges, over the past 18 months it has given us a vivid demonstration of its resilience, its capacity for innovation and its continuing value to the Australian economy.

               There are many signs of recovery. One is that 2009 ended strongly for the automotive sector, with record numbers of vehicles sold in December. Vehicle sales in January and February, including sales of Australian-made vehicles, were well up on the same month last year. Our economy grew 0.9 per cent in the final quarter of 2009 to be 2.7 per cent higher throughout the year—an outcome that even those opposite would surely envy and which is certainly the envy of the developed world.
              </p>
              <p>
               Business confidence is rising. One measure of this is the overwhelming industry response. For instance, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_West" rel="nofollow">
                North West
               </a>
               and Northern Tasmania Innovation Investment Fund received some 126 applications from firms eager to invest in that critical region. The successful applicants will be announced soon. So all of these indicators point to one conclusion: the government’s stimulus package is working.
