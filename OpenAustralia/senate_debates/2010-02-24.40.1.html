        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Given that the Prime Minister has now accepted full responsibility for the mismanagement of the Home Insulation Program, why will government ministers not simply say when they were first advised about the risks to the homes of Australians through this grossly mismanaged program?

         I think Senator Ryan must have been out of the room when Senator Abetz asked me the same question at the start of question time. I took on notice the question about when each of the ministers was advised. I referred Senator Abetz to the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         of the House of Representatives, where both Mr Garrett and the Prime Minister have answered similar questions. As I pointed out, at this very moment they are both in the House of Representatives and able to be questioned by the Liberal Party about such matters.
        </p>
        <p>
         I took on notice from Senator Abetz the question that he asked. As I said, I think it is probably easiest if he just looks up the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         for the House of Representatives, but because I am an accommodating chap I have undertaken to get him an answer to that question. Senator, I suggest you actually listen to your colleagues’ questions or do not just accept what they hand you and repeat the first question. As I indicated before, those questions have been asked in the House of Representatives and answered. I have taken on notice the details you have sought, but I think you have wasted another question since that question was taken on notice by me in response to Senator Abetz’s question a mere 10 minutes ago.

          , maybe the minister can answer this supplementary question. How does the continual refusal of government ministers to state exactly when they first became aware of the risks in the Home Insulation Program square with the Prime Minister’s pre-election promises that ministerial accountability would mean that ministers ‘should be responsible to the parliament for their actions, to be responsible for the operation of their department as well’? Does the Prime Minister still require his ministers to meet this standard?

           As I said to Senator Minchin: he really ought to go to the tactics committee meetings! I dispute the premise of Senator Ryan’s question. The ministers responsible are answerable to the parliament. They are in the parliament now. They are answering questions proposed by the Liberal opposition. So, if you do have questions, they can be asked at this very moment, directly of those ministers.
          </p>
          <p>
           As for Senator Arbib, he is sitting right there—eager to respond to any questions asked of him! So you have the ability to hold the government to account. That is what the parliament is in part for. The ministers are available to answer questions for you. It seems to me that you do not like the answers you are getting. But the ministers are responsible, they are taking responsibility for their portfolios and they are available in the parliament at this very moment to answer any questions you have of them.

            I was not aware that certain questions were not to be asked in this place. The question was about the operation of the Prime Minister’s code of conduct for ministers.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            , I ask a further supplementary question. Does the fact that the Prime Minister has done nothing whatsoever to sanction his ministers for their mismanagement of this program, and their refusal to come clean about when they first knew of the safety issues, prove again that the Prime Minister’s word cannot be trusted, that he is simply all talk and no action?

             Senator Ryan uses his questions to repeat tired, prepared lines from the opposition, but I do not think he seeks a serious answer. As I have made clear, both the minister and the Prime Minister have taken responsibility for the programs and have taken responsibility for the administration of those programs. That has been made very clear. In terms of parliamentary accountability: they are in the chamber now, available for questioning—but you waste your time, Senator, by asking me questions about whether they are accountable.

              whether or not he should pursue that right now. If he has concerns with our answers, he ought to pursue that now. But, Senator, you seem to have been misguided by the tactics committee. I am happy to answer questions that are relevant. If you are concerned about the answers given by ministers, I have only taken one question on notice. Really, Mr Abbott ought to ask Mr Rudd directly, if he has concerns.
