        My question is to the Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services, Senator Colbeck. Minister, the latest data from the

         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        selected living costs index was released last week. By how much has the cost of living gone up for aged pensioners in Australia over the last calendar year?

           If the December quarter for 2021 is 3.4 per cent, do these latest statistics show that the highest annual increase to the cost of living is being inflicted on aged pensioners? Or have you conveniently forgotten to bring your homework today?

            The government has continued to support senior Australians through a number of measures over the course of recent times, including through specific and special payments, to support them through the COVID-19 pandemic. We've put a number of measures in place to support individuals who might be isolated in their homes during the COVID-19 pandemic. I reject any assertion at all that we have left any part of the community behind. We have worked as a government throughout the entire period of the pandemic to ensure that there are additional resources available for people to help them meet the cost of living. We have put supplements in place in respect of the pensionâ€”

              Direct relevance. The question was fairly tightly worded and specific as to whether or not there were the highest annual increases to the cost of living being inflicted on aged pensioners. The minister hasn't addressed that aspect of the question.

               I will allow you to bring the minister back to the question. However, the question did involve some commentary in the asking of the question, which, quite frankly, means the question is not worded quite as narrowly as you say. I have allowed you to bring the minister back to the question. Minister, you have the call for 15 seconds.

                The process that the government supports, and I'm presuming that the opposition supports, is to continue to support the increase in pensions on a regular cycle. I don't accept the premise that the government has left pensioners behind.

                  <p>
                   As I was just indicating, there is a regular cycle of pension increases which takes into account the impacts of the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
                    CPI
                   </a>
                   as a part of the pension increase process. And, as I said earlier, during COVID we've put additional payments in place to support senior Australians and pensioners to help them through the COVID pandemic. So I acknowledge the comments that Senator Sheldon is making in relation to the recent CPI increases, but those things are taken into account in the regular CPI increases that are undertaken for the pension. The pension rates increased on 20 September by $14.80 for singles and $22.40 for couples combined, and new maximum fortnightly rates, including pension supplement and energy supplements, are $967.50 for singles and $1,458.60 for couples.
