         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupied_Palestinian_Territories" rel="nofollow">
          Occupied Palestinian Territories

         . Overnight, Australia airlifted some 194 people from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv" rel="nofollow">
          Tel Aviv
         </a>
         to Dubai. These included 75 Australians, their families, and citizens from partner countries. As we speak, I'm very pleased that 222 Australians are on their way home from Dubai on an Australian government assisted departure flight. An assisted departure flight is also due to leave London for Sydney tonight. We have also secured seats for Australians on commercial flights and flights organised by partner countries. More than 1,400 Australians previously registered with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT
         </a>
         have now left Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, including more than 500 Australians and their families, on six assisted departure flights from Tel Aviv. I thank all those who have helped in these efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have for some time been encouraging Australians who want to leave to take the first option available to them. I will be clear: we have seen a lot of spare seats on flights for two days in a row, and we have people who have indicated they wish to fly who did not seek to fly. At this stage, we have no further flights from Tel Aviv scheduled, but we will continue to assess need. I want to be clear: my department is communicating directly with registered Australians, and we will notify with any updates.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can also advise the Senate that Minister Watt has given approval for the National Emergency Management Agency to activate the A

         RECEPLAN. This will include coordination between federal, state and territory governments to support the reception of people arriving in Australia through assisted departures, helping connect people with homes and families, and providing community support and government support where required.

            I think we all know that there is a very dire humanitarian situation in Gaza, and the situation for Australians in Gaza and their families at home is deeply distressing.

            is now in direct contact with 45 Australians who are seeking to leave Gaza and is keeping them updated. I want to assure everyone that, through my own engagement and the engagement of officials, including in the region, we are doing all we can to support the work of the United States, Egypt and others to make the Rafah border crossing open for humanitarian purposes, including the passage of civilians. Regrettably, efforts to secure passage have not yet been successful, despite many attempts. We are already planning accommodation and onward travel for Australians in Gaza if safe passage through the Rafah crossing is secured. I welcome Secretary Blinken's update this morning.

I thanked him personally for Fiji flying 13 Australians from Israel earlier this week. I indicate to the Senate that the Australian government has now flown 96 people from Pacific island nations on assisted departure flights from
