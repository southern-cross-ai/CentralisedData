        My question is to the Minister for Defence. I refer the minister to comments by the Assistant Minister for Defence on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">

        program, where he said, and I quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I just run the department. … I just make Defence actually work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that the Prime Minister's office is making all of the decisions on Australia's future submarine project, the Defence minister was overruled on his preferred candidates to write the Defence white paper, he has had staff imposed on him by the Prime Minister's office, the minister has refused to intervene about the new pay deal for ADF personnel that cuts their wages and he is continually being undermined by his senior cabinet colleagues, Minister, who is actually running the Defence department? And who is making it work?

          . Let me just go through some of the things that we have done, in stark contrast to the mess that we inherited: 58 Joint Strike Fighters; eight P-8 surveillance aircraft; managed a shortage in replenishment ships; and got submarines back into the water. I have had something like 35 bilaterals regionally with my colleagues. I have been to the

             for the Defence budget from 1.56 per cent—as I have said, the lowest since 1938—to 1.8 per cent in one budget. Of course, $14 billion was ripped out in the years previous to us coming to power. We have sought to repair that and have a funding envelope that projects Defence forward. These are things that they over there,

             You can roll your eyes! May I say, Mr President, Senate estimates has become just a doddle for the shadow minister. There was not a single bit of pressure put on the department. I really think that, if none of us had turned up, it might have been more fruitful than wasting a day with the senator over there. The fact is: Defence is back on the road after being devastated by you. I do not want to take the credit for it, but we over here take the credit for it, because we are a government that knows what good government looks like.

                  I will start with the quote from the minister, in Senate estimates, when he said he did attend the national security meeting when he was asked. And in his words, he answered—because I was in the room,

                   Mr President

                  —that he 'was not going to add much'. I just want to confirm if that is the opinion of the rest of his committee, the

                      I do appreciate the opportunity to answer, Senator Sterle. The fact is: I knew the subject matter before the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                       National Security Committee
                      </a>
                      . They did not bear directly upon my portfolio. But the point is this: we show respect to a committee of this chamber and Senate estimates is a very, very important part of the process. And I take it seriously. That is why I turned up to Senate estimates. I take it seriously; I have always taken it seriously. It was very clear to me that when your former Prime Minister sent her bodyguard to Senate estimates she did not take it seriously. We all take it seriously over here, in stark contrast to the political nonsense and game you think this really is.
