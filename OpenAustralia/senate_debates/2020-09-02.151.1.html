         I thank Senator Canavan for his question. He is, of course, a consistent advocate for Australia's resources industry, as the entire chamber knows. Lynas is an Australian-listed company and a great Aussie success and export success story. It is a key component of the global rare-earth supply chain and, I understand, supplies around 13 per cent of global rare-earth element production. Lynas owns and operates a rare-earth mine in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Weld" rel="nofollow">
          Mount Weld
         </a>
         , WA, and ore from Mount Weld is shipped and processed at Lynas Advanced Materials Plant in Malaysia.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 27 July 2020, Lynas announced that the US Department of Defense and Lynas had signed a contract for phase 1 work to deliver a US based heavy rare-earth processing facility. But this, I'm pleased to say, is not Lynas's only facility development. Lynas is also investing around $500 million to build a processing plant in Kalgoorlie that will use Mount Weld ore. Lynas is committed to using a residential workforce instead of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO" rel="nofollow">
          FIFO
         </a>
         workers, creating about 500 jobs in the construction phase and about 100 permanent roles. Lynas has a proven record in the processing of rare-earth elements, and this is an important milestone in delivering more diversified global supply of heavy rare earths.
        </p>
        <p>
         Critical minerals featured again in the recent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSMIN" rel="nofollow">
          AUSMIN
         </a>
         held by my colleagues in Washington. This highlighted the importance of work Australia and the US are progressing to diversify critical-mineral supply chains. The current COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted potential issues associated with concentrated supply chains, but we know that Australia is well placed to lead the diversification of critical-mineral supply chains across the globe, as we're the leading producer of some of the most sought after critical minerals, including rare earths, lithium, zirconium and titanium. These are critical minerals found in our phones, laptops and advanced technological products, and, of course, across defence industries as well. That's why we're so committed to working with our partners to help diversify that supply.

            Australia's resource industry is world leading. The world needs our raw materials and mining, and we have been a proud, consistent and reliable supplier of such minerals right across the world, in terms of support for the growth of others. Australia is the world's largest producer of iron ore, metallurgical coal,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
             LNG
            </a>
            and bauxite and the second-largest producer of gold and thermal coal. Australia also has extensive resources of nickel, copper and zinc, metals that will be key for the future economy. We're increasingly looking to and working with companies like Lynas in the value-adding of our resources. Our mining equipment, technology and services industry is world leading, itself exporting around $27 billion worth of Australian know-how and expertise to support resources projects across the globe.
           </p>
           <p>
            Australia has many robust trading partners. We export our resources to many of the world's major economies, meeting their demands and their needs, but, in doing so, creating jobs, and opportunities for Australians and for Australian businesses to grow.

               The resources industry is one of the most important industries for regional communities right across Australian states, including Senator Canavan's great home state of Queensland. Whether it's Karratha, Mackay,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Isa" rel="nofollow">
                Mount Isa
               </a>
               , across Queensland or right across the country, the resources sector underpins good jobs, reliable jobs, high-paying jobs for families, particularly those living in regional areas, and it creates economies and communities that provide further job opportunities right across regional Australia.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is of course also, I am pleased to say as trade minister, a leading export sector in terms of the contribution it makes generating income wealth for our nation. As I was saying before, it is not just the extraction of resources but increasingly areas of processing and the use of Australian skills, know-how and capabilities that we see now assisting projects around the world and again generating more high-paying job opportunities for Australians, which will be ever more important in our economic recovery.
