        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. As a result of vaccine supply shortages, the

         New South Wales
        </a>
        government has been forced to extend the gap between the first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine to eight weeks. What impact will this change, resulting from a shortage of vaccine supplies, have on the time frame of reaching the 70 and 80 per cent targets? And did the New South Wales government advise the Morrison-Joyce government of this change before it was announced?

          They say they support the vaccine rollout program. They say they support both vaccines. But the scoffing across the chamber belies that. They're focused only on Pfizer and they are not concerned about
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
           AstraZeneca
          </a>
          , which has done a large proportion of the work in the system. And I note that they have actually shortened the time frame between doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to promote the vaccine rollout. We have supported
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          in respect of their vaccine rollout by putting 50 per cent of the additional vaccine doses that we got from Poland—500,000-plus doses—into New South Wales to support their rollout. We distributed the rest of the vaccine across the states on a per capita basis. So we have supported, and we will continue to support, states in the vaccination program. Today we have passed 20 million doses—a significant effort. The Labor Party should be celebrating that.

                 That was one question amongst several asked. There was a preface. A minister cannot simply reject the premise of a question and say everything they want. They still must remain directly relevant to the material in the question. I'm listening carefully to the minister. As I heard him, he was talking about vaccine supply. It's not a place for a general address on the vaccine rollout program, but if he's talking about matters raised in the question then I believe he is directly relevant. I can't instruct him how to answer it.

                  and other states in the vaccine rollout. In fact, to date, as I've indicated, 20,028,084 doses of vaccine have been administered across the country. Of course, both vaccines—not just Pfizer—are playing an important part in the rollout. There are different time periods in different states between doses. Victoria has extended their second doses out to six weeks, rather than three weeks, for Pfizer.

                        I didn't have that in my notes. I try to scribble as quickly as I can. This is a specific question. I'm going to ask the minister to specifically address the issues in the question, but again I cannot instruct the minister the terms on which to answer a question, the terminology to be used or the content of the answer. In my view, this question goes to the extension of the time period for the vaccine—I didn't have 'Pfizer' written down, but I take your word for it, Senator O'Neill—and it goes to whether people will have to wait longer or any other arrangements that are directly relevant. Senator Cash, are you seeking the call?

                           . I do appreciate that. The question was actually: would it force those who've already booked their appointments to wait longer? It didn't go to whether people should book or not book. It went directly to the question of people who already have appointments booked for Pfizer.

                            I appreciate it did not go to—it's not the place for a general discussion of whether someone should book for a vaccine. But, at the same time, to a tightly worded question, an answer can still be directly relevant by addressing the issues raised in the question, even if it is not addressed in the terms the opposition would like. That is what the motions to take note are for, afterwards. So I call Senator Colbeck, taking all that into account, to continue.
