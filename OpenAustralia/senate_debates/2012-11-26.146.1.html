        My question is to the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. Minister, I refer you to commentary in the 2011-12 budget papers which stated:

       <p class="italic">
        To maintain a liquid and efficient bond market that supports the three- and ten-year futures market and the requirements of the new global bank liquidity standards, the panel agreed that the

       <p>
        Minister, what rationale does the government have to maintain the market at 12 to 14 per cent of GDP when at the end of the Howard government there was a viable CGS market with gross Commonwealth debt at six per cent of GDP?

              . I am very pleased that he has given up Mr Robb so easily, and may I say he is right to do so. They were very silly comments. Mr President, I think the best thing is to refer the senator to a response to Mr Robb's comments by the Treasurer which I think was published in

               Business Spectator
              </i>
              today, and if he cannot find it I am sure we can provide him with a reference.

               , I have a supplementary question. Can the minister, on behalf of the Treasurer, whom she represents in this place, provide a guarantee that both gross and net Commonwealth debt levels will not rise above the levels articulated in the government's Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook?

               <p>
                Net debt returning to zero by 2021 and peak net debt are very clear in the budget update. I deliberately referenced that date for this reason. If a number of the savings measures that were opposed by the opposition had not been taken, net debt would still be some $250 billion by 2020-21. That is the reality. That includes, for example, the private health insurance rebate and various other measures that the opposition have opposed, so if they want to talk about net debt they need to be aware their policy settings would actually lead to net debt not returning to zero and continuing to be high out to the end of the decade.

                 , I have a second supplementary question. Minister, hasn't the growth in the Commonwealth debt level since the global financial crisis reduced the amount of capital available to small businesses via the banking and broader financial system, therefore making finance harder to obtain and increasing their cost of capital? Why are you making it harder for small business?

                  I know that Senator Sinodinos got this question late but, seriously, from a party which is opposed to tax cuts for small business and would repeal tax breaks which we have put in place for small business, I think it is pretty galling and insincere for the senator to be saying: what has the government got against small business? I think you should look in the mirror, Senator.
