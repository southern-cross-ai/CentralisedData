         Thank you, Senator Bushby, for this timely question. There are a lot of exciting things happening in Australia's space sector. Just this week, we saw the launch of Cuberider-2, which I was delighted to authorise. A payload programmed by Australian students blasted off to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station" rel="nofollow">
          International Space Station
         </a>
         to gather data from space. It is a great thing to be talking about in this
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Week" rel="nofollow">
          National Science Week
         </a>
         , when we are trying to get the young people of Australia to take an interest in science, technology, engineering and maths.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Turnbull government recognises the incredible potential of our space industry to drive investment, create jobs and position us as a global industry leader. That is why we have commissioned a review of Australia's space industry capability. It will examine the role of government in supporting a strong, competitive space industry and the best way for us to harness our industry advantages. This is not about whether we should have a space industry. We have one. This is about the framework to take the space industry to the next stage. It will support leadership, innovation, opportunity and entrepreneurship across the sector along with our broader national interests. The result of this review will be a national strategy for the sector, a strategy that reflects both our developing strengths and national interests over the next decade. An important part of the review will be establishing the case for a national space agency to act as a coordinator of space policy across the government and to act as an interlocutor on the global stage when we interact with other players so we can look them in the eye and develop the networks and the contracts which are needed to take the space industry to the next level. This will be a very important development to be able to put together a space strategy for not only the next decade but the next two decades, recognising there are many great Australians who work in the sector, including people who are working overseas who we want to bring back to Australia.

                   I thank the honourable member for his supplementary question. I get the gist. I understand! We are witnessing a period of rapid growth and change in the space industry. No longer is the industry open to a few countries and companies capable of launching large and very expensive satellites into space. It's a global industry worth over
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

                   </a>
                   $300 billion a year. More and more of our daily life is dependent on space technology. It is important that we have a clear vision and strategy for our industry. But we can't make policy on the run. That's why the review is being undertaken under the direction of an expert reference group chaired by Megan Clark

                      I thank the honourable senator for that very specific question. The current review will complement the activity already undertaken by this government to support growth in the space industry in Australia.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      In October 2015, we announced a review of the Space Activities Act 1998, an act that regulates space activities undertaken by Australians here and overseas. Space technologies have advanced significantly since the act was legislated. Barriers to entry in the space industry are disappearing. This is creating new opportunities for Australian firms. So the act must provide an appropriate balance between supporting opportunities for participation and ensuring that Australia meets its international obligations.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      The review of the act is now complete and the proposed amendments are being drafted. We are making sure the legislation supports innovation and the advancement of space technologies in Australia. Combined with the current review, it demonstrates our commitment, as a coalition, to the success and growth of Australian industries.
