         Home Affairs

        , Senator Fifield. Minister, documents released last week show that the former immigration minister, Mr Morrison, asked his department for ways to delay the applications of people seeking asylum in Australia. The documents show the options included asking
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        to delay security checks and instructing the

         Thank you, Senator McKim, for your question. I don't think I can do any better than to quote the Treasurer, the former Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, himself who said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … what the report in the ABC failed to point out, about that memo, was that memo to me said that the Secretary of Immigration had already written to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_General" rel="nofollow">
          Director General
         </a>
         of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
          ASIO
         </a>
         . It wasn't seeking my approval. They were simply implementing government policy which was what we took to the election. We said, permanent visas would not be given to people who came to Australia illegally by boat, the Department was acting in accordance with Government policy that had just been confirmed thumpingly in a federal election so - headline – public official implement government policy approved by the Australian people.

           Well that was no answer at all to the majority of my question. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
            AAT
           </a>
           , of course, didn't get a mention there. Minister, I will repeat: was the AAT requested or instructed to hear cases in a particular order to slow down processing and delay justice and, if so, why did the government act with such reckless disregard for fair process, natural justice and the rule of law?

              Thanks, President, it is a point of order and it goes directly to relevance. I've been very patient. That's the second time I've asked Senator Fifield whether the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
               AAT
              </a>
              was requested or instructed to slow down processing of particular cases. It is clear his first response didn't address that in any way. I've asked it again. He is well into his answer and he is yet to even mention the letters AAT, so I ask you to remind him of the question.

                . As I was saying, as a government, we want to do everything we possibly can to ensure that people smugglers don't have a business model which is supported by government policy. In terms of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
                 Administrative Appeals Tribunal
                </a>
                , I'm just harking back to my memory. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal as it is today is differently constituted to 2013 when we came into government, where there were a number of different elements in different portfolios. I think there was the old Social Security Appeals Tribunal in the social security portfolio and, I think, there was the Migration Review Tribunal—

                  No answers. Minister, in his valedictory speech yesterday, former Attorney-General Senator Brandis said that powerful elements of right-wing politics have abandoned the liberal tradition 'in favour of a belligerent, intolerant populism which shows no respect for either the rights of individual citizens or the traditional institutions which protect them.' Can you confirm that this is the government's official ideology now that he is gone?

                   This government is deeply committed to the rule of law. This government is deeply committed to fairness and deeply committed to justice.
