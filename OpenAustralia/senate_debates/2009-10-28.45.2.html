        , Senator Ludwig. Is the minister aware that the Rudd Labor government’s decision to target more than 100,000 senior Australians in need of timely and affordable access to cataract surgery in the private health system will mean that they will face more than $600 in increased out-of-pocket expenses every year for every procedure?

         Clearly, cataract surgery is an area where this government is trying to ensure that we can get savings of $98 million over four years, at $24.5 million a year, but in doing so it is also about ensuring that those people who do require complex procedures also get a rebate of $850. We know that those on the opposite side do not want to support budget initiatives that ensure that we use the budget to help those people, including seniors, who require assistance right across the health system.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is not putting itself on the side of ophthalmologists and ensuring that they continue to receive $585,000 from Medicare each year. They earn, on average, $154,000 from cataract procedures alone. So this government is putting in place appropriate measures to ensure that consumers and patients benefit from the new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
          MBS
         </a>
         . When you look at the actual statistics themselves, you will see that ophthalmologists conduct, on average, about 243 cataract operations per year, which are covered 100 per cent by the MBS, 75 per cent by the MBS rebate and 25 per cent by private health insurance. Ophthalmologists will of course continue to charge their high fees, but we want to ensure that the government does not have to pay—

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given the Senate clearly does not support the government’s decision to cut cataract surgery rebates, will the minister now urge the Rudd government to seek a trade-off with the pink batts program and redirect increased funds to the real and genuine health concerns of senior Australians?

           What this government wants to ensure is that we have a policy that is responsive to the needs of the modern health system. In fact, if you look at the argument that is being placed, I would also remind the Senate that, in today’s

           We now have a position where the opposition support a position of ensuring that consumers do not win, that consumers miss out on important reform that this government is progressing with. What we want to ensure is that the community can access ophthalmologists and that ophthalmologists charge appropriately in this respect. What we are not going to support is a position where those opposite—

             The opposition’s actions today will throw cataract procedures into disarray. Australians scheduled to have this procedure performed will now face the uncertainty of being billed for their entire procedure without receiving any government rebate. That is what the opposition have now put—

Senator Ludwig could not have been more relevant to the question, if those opposite could hear him over the cacophony of noise that they are engaged in. This was clearly relevant and they are asking you to break standing orders by directing the minister to say yes or no.
