         The Bills
        </a>
        implement into Australian law the Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        on Trans-Tasman Court Proceedings and Regulatory Enforcement 2008 (the Agreement).

 Companion legislation to implement the Agreement is before the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand Parliament
        </a>
        .

 The purpose of the Bills is to establish a cooperative scheme to streamline the resolution of trans-Tasman legal disputes, and provide a single point of reference for rules regarding how such proceedings are conducted.

         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian and New Zealand Bills were introduced into the respective Parliaments as a matter of priority in late 2009.

 The New Zealand Bill was introduced before the Australian Bill.

 There is a risk that delaying consideration of the Australian Bill to Winter 2010 could result in Australia falling behind New Zealand in the implementation of its domestic arrangements necessary to meets its international obligations under the Agreement, and delay the commencement of the cooperative scheme which has bipartisan support and will benefit businesses and individuals operating in the trans-Tasman environment.
