            did not support the Howard government’s establishment of these colleges because we believed at the time that it was a politically motivated decision, that the colleges would duplicate services already provided by existing institutions—the

             TAFE

            colleges in particular—and that the establishment of the colleges was part of the attack on the union movement. However, these colleges have been established. They are very well funded in comparison with similar colleges offering similar services and that disproportionate funding is inequitable.

            Having said that, the Bartlett Labor government in Tasmania has made a complete and utter mess of the transitional arrangements to this new system of the academy and polytechnics and so on. There is no clear transitional arrangement for the 270 students and 35 staff in the Australian Technical College Northern Tasmania with its two campuses that we are discussing here today. There are no satisfactory transitional arrangements. There is no guarantee on staffing. We do note that the Bartlett government has now said that it will do everything it can to make sure that the colleges do not fail, and I am glad to hear that that is the case. So we are supporting this on the basis that those students and staff have proper transitional arrangements and that equivalent certification can be achieved as this process is worked through.

               This is a very important motion, and I appreciate that the Senate has supported it and I appreciate the views of Senator Milne as have been expressed on the record. I am not clear whether the government have made their position clear, and perhaps they could make it clear. I was of the view that the government were not supportive of the motion, but they have not made their position clear to me and I do not want to misrepresent their position one way or the other. I think it would be useful to have on the record whether they support the motion or not.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is a very important matter for northern Tasmania and north-west Tasmania. I was very hopeful that the Labor senators, particularly from Tasmania, would support this motion for the sake of the future of the Australian Technical College Northern Tasmania. It is a very important matter for northern Tasmania and it is very important to get that on the record. It would be useful to have that clarified by government senators so that we have on the record whether they supported the motion or not.
