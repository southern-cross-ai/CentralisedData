          Just a moment ago I spoke and praised and thanked the government for tabling two reports that I had moved in this place for an order for the production of documents last week, because my office had been contacted by Senator Nash's office to say that she would not comply with the order that said that the reports were to be tabled by 3.30 today and that they would be dealt with during ministerial statements. That meant that my staff were led to believe that these reports were going to be tabled. So I came into this place and thanked the government for tabling them and thought that was the reasonable and proper thing to do. Then I get the document that says:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I note that the preliminary and interim reports referred to above are deliberative in nature and that tabling of these documents prior to finalisation of the review process would inhibit the ability of the government to properly respond to the review.
         </p>
         <p>
          So everything I said five minutes ago I retract. This government is continuing to run this review in a cloud of secrecy. You cannot run mental health services by being secretive. The way to get a proper mental health policy in this place is to have an open conversation. This government should be condemned for the way they are using the National Mental Health Commission to deliver this inquiry and this review. The Mental Health Commission is a well-regarded entity in our health policy infrastructure and to use them in this way is appalling. The two interim reports and the final report must be published for people living with mental illness and their service providers to have any faith that this government will do the right thing for people living with mental illness. I call on the government to engage properly and appropriately in this incredibly complex mental health policy space.
