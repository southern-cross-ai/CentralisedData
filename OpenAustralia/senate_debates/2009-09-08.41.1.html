         Purpose of the bills
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The purpose of these bills is to urgently reinstate the Military Justice system which existed prior to the introduction of the Defence Legislation Amendment Act 2006 which established the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Military_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Military Court
        </a>
        .  On the 26 August 2009, the High Court unanimously held the provisions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force_Discipline_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force Discipline Act
        </a>

        <b>
         Reasons for Urgency
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Following the High Court’s decision in Lane v Morrison, which invalidated the Australian Military Court, the

         Australian Defence Force

        is currently working with a modified justice system. It is therefore urgent that an interim military justice system be re-established as soon as possible.
