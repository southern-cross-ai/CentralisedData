         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        is a vital national space of learning and of reflection. It is where our community pays its respects to those who have lost their lives in conflict, shares stories with those who have survived and reflects collectively on the importance of creating a peaceful world, free from violence. Unfortunately, this greatly important role, this vital purpose, is currently being undermined by the presence within the funding for the War Memorial of the donations of corporate weapons manufacturers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The major parties have allowed these corporate arms dealers to make donations to the War Memorial and to use this important space as nothing more than a billboard. The memorial now hosts events sponsored by these arms dealers and has even allowed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BAE" rel="nofollow">
         BAE
        </a>
        Systems, a British corporate weapons maker, to build a theatre within the memorial grounds in their own honour. Over time the major parties have eroded the transparency around donations to the memorial, meaning that the community now has no way of knowing how much these corporate arms dealers are donating. Our Australian War Memorial has become a space influenced by the same corporations, the very same entities, that have profited from the conflicts that took the lives of those remembered there. The only reason these corporations have the money to donate is that they profit from violent conflict. There is no other phrase for this than 'blood money'. Corporate arms dealers have no place in our War Memorial. It is far past time to end their influence on this vital public space and make sure that it is transparently, fully and publicly funded.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike the major parties in this place, the Greens will get corporate influence out of the War Memorial so that it can once again be the space that the community needs it to be. We will take on these corporate arms dealers and their shills here in the parliament and get their influence, once and for all, out of our War Memorial.

         I take this opportunity this afternoon to make a statement on the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment (Ensuring Integrity) Bill 2019. We've all heard the contributions from those opposite, trying to justify why this bill should not proceed. Their hypocrisy is rank. Day after day, they continue to stand up for the union bosses over the workers they claim to represent. They stand up for unions over small and family businesses, they stand up for unions over everyday Australians who are out there having a go, and they stand up for unions over the law. It might come as a shock to them, but it's us—only us—on this side of the chamber who are standing up for everyday Australians. We've banned dodgy secret payments between employers and unions, we've protected over 35,000 owner-operator truckies, and, despite the nonsense that Senator Watt spouted this morning, we've stopped a hostile union takeover of 60,000
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
          CFA
         </a>
         volunteers, and we're protecting 1.1 million construction workers and 380,000 small businesses from their thuggery.
        </p>
        <p>
         We often talk about the pub test in this place. I can tell you that Australians reject the idea that the unions should be a law unto themselves, they reject the notion that they're immune from our legal system, and they reject the double standards of those opposite here. We believe in enforcing the rule of law and in holding law-breakers to account. Our reintroduction of the ensuring integrity bill demonstrates that commitment. We're making organisations, whether they be unions or otherwise, more accountable, ensuring they're delivering in the best interests of their members, keeping Australian industries moving and the economy growing and making sure the jobs are being created.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a senator and also a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment, I sat through the hearings on this bill, and I had the great pleasure of enduring the many hours of questions from those opposite to employer organisations and to unions. After all of that, it became clear to me that they have little to no reasonable justification for standing in the way of this bill. They have nothing. They've published a dissenting report, which is no surprise, but what is it? It is a long bow that they've tried to draw, a very, very long bow. So concerned are those opposite about the impact on lawlessness and on their campaign coffers that they've claimed that this bill would have adverse impacts on 'the state of democracy in Australia'—I mean, how far can they go! They say that it's going to take us down 'an authoritarian path', and that it undermines our human rights obligations in relation to freedom of association. Give us a break. This is just about ensuring that those who have the great pleasure of being a union official or representing workers might need to comply with the law. Yet they take it so far. That being said, I do find it interesting that in their view there is no policy justification for this bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some of Australia's best legal minds have made the following comments in their judgements:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The union has not displayed—
        </p>
        <p>
         this is what was said—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         any contrition or remorse for its conduct.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         …   …   …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Substantial penalties for misconduct, prior to that presently under consideration, have not caused the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         to desist from similar unlawful conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
         In another judgement, they said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … the facts demonstrate the need to impose penalties which meet the objective of specific deterrence, particularly in relation to the CFMEU whose organisers appear to have shown a somewhat cavalier disregard both of the need to comply with the law and of penalties which have been previously imposed on the union for similar conduct.
        </p>
        <p>
         It paints a pretty depressing picture for those opposite and their dwindling union membership base.

         just yesterday morning claiming that these laws were undermining the ability of workers to do their job. This is the best that they can do, and this is what they expect us to believe. When they can't win on reason—we've seen how hard they've tried and failed in the inquiry into this bill—they just set out to scare people they claim to represent. I would urge the Senate to support the bill when it comes up, finally, and get on the right side of history.

          just remind the chamber and the good senator that the bill you referred to in your comments is still before the chamber and it's inappropriate to make a statement in this part of the day in relation to a bill that is still before us. You can certainly speak in the chamber in broad strokes in the speech, but I will bring that to your attention, Senator.

            I just remind senators, for everyone's benefit, that when there's a bill before the chamber it's inappropriate to refer to that bill in the detail in which you did, Senator. You have given your contribution. We will move on now to Senator O'Neill.
