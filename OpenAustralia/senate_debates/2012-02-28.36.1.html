        was released, interestingly, at 5 pm yesterday. The report by some of the foremost experts on dental and public health highlights the shocking state of dental health in this country. The report advocates a transi­tion to a Commonwealth funded, universal dental scheme. Will the government commit to this goal of universal, Medicare funded dental care for all Australians?

         I thank Senator Di Natale for his continuing interest in dental health—I did have the opportunity of seeing his press release this morning. The government has committed to publicly funded dental care which is targeted at those Australians who can least afford to pay for dental care themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
         To provide the government with options, as Senator Di Natale has outlined, we established the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Advisory_Council" rel="nofollow">
          National Advisory Council

          Dental Health
         </a>
         . Minister Plibersek received the report late last week. The report raises questions and points to challenges which would need to be resolved in order to deliver a publicly funded dental scheme. This is also about dealing with priorities—about how we spend our money and how we ensure we get value for money. Any scheme would have to be managed in a fiscally responsible way and be phased in over a period of time. It would also need to be targeted at those Australians who can least afford to pay for oral health care themselves, account for gaps in existing private and public dental services, and address workforce and infrastructure constraints. There is also the issue of existing Commonwealth funding of dental care—any new scheme would have to be established after the closure of the chronic disease dental scheme. I am sure the Greens would support that, but those opposite are not so helpful in that regard.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a first step towards delivering on its commitment, the Gillard government have said that we will direct $165 million over three years to a means tested, targeted scheme. Those opposite—

          , I ask a supplementary question. Senator Ludwig would be pleased to know that the report did present several near-term, targeted options for advancing the publicly funded dental care of all children and low-income adults. So will the government commit to immediate action and follow the council's recommendation that these specific groups be funded over the forward estimates as a stepping stone towards universal coverage?

           I thank Senator Di Natale for his supplementary question. The government has taken the first step. As a first step towards delivering on its commitment, the Gillard government have said that we will direct $165 million over three years to a means tested and targeted scheme. When you look at what those opposite are proposing—and I am sure the Greens would agree with this—Mr Abbot's aspiration for a dental care scheme is laughable. When the Leader of the Opposition told the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
            Press Club
           </a>
           his scheme would cost $4 billion, Mr Shane Fryer, President of the

            Australian Dental Association

           , said it would cost triple that amount. He told the

           :

           Yet more spending promises from those opposite to add to the $70 billion crater they are creating—their $70 billion black hole. In the meantime—

             I thank Senator Di Natale for his further supplementary question. One of the hurdles to the funding challenge we have is those opposite. I am sure the Greens understand that. We need first to close the chronic disease dental scheme, a scheme which is poorly targeted and unable to deliver. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDS" rel="nofollow">
              CDS
             </a>
             , while providing services to some, it is recognised, is not well targeted towards providing assistance in accessing dental services to those Australians most in financial need. If those opposite were to come on board and close that scheme down, it may provide us with the opportunity to look at how we could—

The report did raise, as I think Senator Di Natale mentioned, a range of challenges. But what this government has done is put forward—
