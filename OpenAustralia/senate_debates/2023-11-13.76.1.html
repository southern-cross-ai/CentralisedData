        There are many reasons to love the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasman_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Tasman Peninsula
        </a>
        , a cluster of tight-knit communities in the south of my home state of Tasmania. The region is steeped in Tasmania's convict past. It's where you go if you want to visit historic convict site
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur" rel="nofollow">
         Port Arthur
        </a>
        or the Dog Line at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eaglehawk_Neck" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It is this history that has allowed a thriving tourism industry to flourish in the area, but it's also the reason that many small businesses are held back. The Tasman Peninsula is home to a thriving small-business community that is bolstered by the strong tourism industry, particularly over the summer months. However, its remoteness, which is a drawcard for tourists, is also a pitfall when it comes to running a business, especially with limited options for banking, postage and access to the internet. They are often left to the mercy of technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        What's refreshing about the Tasman Peninsula, though, is that small business owners here don't let these things stop them from sharing what they love about their region with the growing number of tourists to the area. Look at places like the Tasmanian Chocolate Foundry, which is located at Taranna and manufactures hand forged products using Belgian couverture chocolate, or look at the owners of Tasman Honey, a family owned business located at Murdunna, which has operated in the community for many years. Owner Ian Kingston produces honey from hundreds of hives located across the peninsula and operates a tourist shop at his honey cellar door. The cellar door also has educational installations including a see-through hive that allows you to see the bees in action, producing honey. The educational installations were made by a young family member, and Ian himself built the see-through panels to show the hives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of the Tasman Peninsula are hardworking and passionate about their town and region and have adapted to the challenges of their remoteness to provide a unique and exciting experience for tourists. If you are looking for somewhere to go on your next holiday, I encourage you to come to Tasmania, and the Tasmanian Peninsula should definitely be on your list.
