        My question is to the Minister for Emergency Management and National Recovery and Resilience, Senator McKenzie. As we continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, many people are becoming increasingly affected by their inability to work, because of lockdowns and movement restrictions. Can the minister please outline what financial support the Liberal and National government is providing to people who've lost hours of work in areas that are currently locked down, including Commonwealth hotspots in and around Sydney?

         I thank the senator for her question and for her advocacy and passion for her home state of

         . I think everyone in this chamber stands with those who are experiencing lockdown in New South Wales right now. COVID-19 has had an unprecedented impact not just in Australia but around the world. More than four million lives have been lost, and we're facing the largest global economic impact since the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression" rel="nofollow">
          Great Depression
         </a>
         . In the face of a once-in-a-century pandemic, the Australian spirit has shone through. Early and decisive actions in 2020 saved lives and livelihoods. We closed our borders, we established the national cabinet, we as a federal government invested $291 billion in direct assistance to individuals and businesses to cushion the impact and we know that these measures have had a significant impact on all Australians and have ensured that we've been able to weather this storm together. When we look globally, not all countries can say that.

         and Nationals government has stood side by side with all members of the Australian community throughout the pandemic and will continue to do so as the delta variant wreaks havoc in so many of our states and communities. As the virus evolves, so does our government's response because there is no guidebook for COVID. That's why I'm proud to be part of a government that's delivering targeted, localised, individual support payments to those who live or work in a Commonwealth declared hotspot. There are two tiers of payments. If you have lost more than 20 hours of work as a result of the lockdown, you are eligible for $750 payments. If you've lost between eight and 20 hours as a result of that declaration, you're eligible for $450. If you're on income support payments and have been working, you are eligible for a $200 payment if you've lost more than eight hours of work. I would recommend that those who are in those areas apply online to keep Services Australia's phone lines open for thoseâ€”

           On 28 July Prime Minister Morrison announced an expansion of the COVID disaster payment. Can the minister provide details on the increased financial assistance being provided through the scheme and how this will affect communities in lockdown?

            If people have lost hours due to the impact of lockdown, I do encourage them to apply. Log on to Services Australia or myGov and apply for these income support payments. We've rolled them out in Victoria and we're rolling them out in

            </a>
            right now and will continue to do so as that lockdown is extended, and they will be available to Australians in those Commonwealth declared hotspots in South-East Queensland. We know that this is tough. Being locked down is tough. You have to shut your business, you can't go to work, you have to homeschool your kids. It doesn't just impact your financial situation; it also impacts your mental health situation, so we have a raft of payments in addition to this. The pandemic leave payment assists you, so if you're caring for someone with COVID, or indeed you catch COVID, we will be standing with you to ensure that you have financial support.

               As this pandemic has rolled through the world and, indeed, our nation over the last 18 months, state and federal governments have had to adjust their responses accordingly. We've used science, we've used data, we've used evidence. We've used the advice of our medical officials, which is exactly what we should be doing. We should be taking the politics out of our COVID response, and that's why I look forward to those opposite supporting Australians to get vaccinated as fast as possible. That's how we can get out of being locked down, actually stopping these lockdowns by ensuring that Australians aren't just getting Pfizer, aren't just getting Moderna, but are lining up to get
