Unfortunately, those opposite—the Liberal and National parties—have seen a few green shoots and they think they have seen a jungle.

          They laugh and they scoff in the same way they skated their way through last year with a very negative attitude to the decisive actions taken by the Rudd Labor government: to the guarantee, to the stimulus packages and to a range of other actions that were absolutely necessary to prevent Australia, like the rest of the world, plunging into a very deep recession—certainly the worst since the

            , I have a supplementary question for the Assistant Treasurer. Does the Australian government intend to maintain the economic policies and measures that it has implemented in the past year, which have been so effective in cushioning Australia from the worst effects of the global recession? Are there any creditable alternatives?

             As I have indicated on a couple of occasions, despite the comparatively good growth of the Australian economy—the only advanced economy in the world to have growth of some 0.6 per cent—it is way short of what is required to prevent unemployment going up. You need at least three per cent growth to ensure that unemployment will not rise. So we know that, even with a comparatively well-performing economy with economic growth of 0.6 per cent, unemployment will rise over the next year due to the financial and economic crisis. Yet we have those opposite in the Liberal and National parties advocating that we should abandon our stimulus measures. I make the point very strongly that 0.6 per cent growth will not deliver employment growth. You need at least three per cent, yet those opposite are effectively arguing for higher unemployment.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the Assistant Treasurer inform the Senate what the greatest challenges are in achieving sustainable recovery? How long will the near collapse of the world financial system continue to adversely affect global and Australian economies?

               As I have said, whilst we have outperformed the rest of the world in terms of economic growth there are significant challenges ahead. We are certainly not out of the woods yet. One of the greatest challenges will be in job creation. Unfortunately, as I have said, jobs are the last things that those opposite have thought about in the context of this recession.
