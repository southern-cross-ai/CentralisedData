        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Senator Ludwig. Can the minister confirm the report in today's

        newspaper that he was scolded by the Indonesian government because he had not consulted with them before the suspension of live cattle exports to Indonesia? Can the minister also confirm that he did not consult with the

         There were many opportunities to consult through this process. Clearly that was not taken up by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLA" rel="nofollow">
          MLA
         </a>
         with their representative members. Right throughout this process the engagement through my department and through the embassy with the Indonesian authorities in relation to the suspension has been ongoing. I did have the opportunity of speaking with the Indonesian Minister for Agriculture, Mr Suswono. The meeting went well. It pro­vided both of us with an opportunity to share views about how we can return this industry as quickly as possible. When you look at the comments the minister himself made, as reported, they provide clear encouragement that we can look to the way this trade can return on a sustainable footing whilst maintaining animal welfare outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important also to consider the other state and territory governments, including Queensland, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         and WA. They too are part of the industry working group to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. I have called them together and I have continued to inform the ministers for agriculture in WA, the Northern Territory and Queensland about the suspension and the ongoing way we can return the issue.

              The hide from the opposition in relation to this issue! The 40 per cent subsidy that they now describe was in fact a decision by the opposition, when they were in government, to move to full cost recovery within this industry. You then squibbed on the deal to return the industry to full cost recovery—a decision you made. It might have been stared down; I am not sure exactly what occurred. You then put in place a rebate in respect of this industry.

              In government, we moved $124 million to reform the industry to ensure they could receive the efficiencies from the export certification process. That reform, the AEMIS system, has been providing and is due—

                Mr Dutton said, 'We would have stopped them going to those abattoirs that have been highlighted,' and later he said: 'We wouldn't have had a full suspension. We would have stopped the cattle from going to those abattoirs where we saw that horrific action.' What he does not say is that without a suspension and an opportunity to reform supply chains, this approach would not have provided animal welfare outcomes at all. Without a suspension or supply chain reform in place, it would have ensured that animals would continue to be mistreated. That is what the opposition have signed up to.
