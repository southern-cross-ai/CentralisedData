        This amendment goes to the heart of Labor's policy, which is of course for Australia to have an emissions trading scheme. Of course, a key feature of the existing carbon pricing legislation is that it ensures Australia can meet its targets—and stronger post-2020 targets if it chooses to do so—but Australia's existing carbon policy suite also has a greater capacity to meet our current and future targets because it features a legally binding cap on emissions. That is exactly what an emissions trading scheme does; it provides a legally binding cap on emissions. This is something that has been given a huge amount of support by economists and scientists, not just here but right across the world. The reason for that is that it goes all the way back to a number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
         IPCC
        </a>
        reports—the first of which was in 1990; and there have been five since then—which made it very clear that limiting climate change will require substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions. That is why we need a legal cap on carbon dioxide pollution.
       </p>
       <p>
        So my question to Senator Cormann is: how on earth does
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Action" rel="nofollow">
         Direct Action
        </a>
        address the IPCC's finding of the need for substantial and sustained reductions of greenhouse gas emissions? I have not been able to find one economist who has said it has been able to do so. Labor, however, wants to tackle climate change in the most cost-effective way possible, and an emissions trading scheme has proven to be the most cost-effective way. That is why we said that we would negotiate with and support the government in removing a carbon tax if it is replaced by an emissions trading scheme which puts that legal cap on carbon pollution and lets business work out the cheapest and most-effective way to operate within that cap.
       </p>
       <p>
        Emissions trading schemes are already being adopted in many countries around the world. Despite that, the Prime Minister was recently in Canada trying to create a coalition of unwilling partners to support his Direct Action model—and he did not get very far. In his endeavours there, he spoke about how there were not any countries around the world adopting emissions trading schemes. He actually said there are no schemes on the cards and, in fact, countries are going backwards on emissions trading. That is so far from the truth it is not funny; it is a complete fabrication and thus it is a lie. Emissions trading schemes are being adopted in China, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        —and we already have the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        scheme, which includes Germany, France, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        and the like.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that the Liberals have an ideological opposition to climate change policy, which is why they do not even have a climate change minister. We know that Prime Minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott
        </a>
        has previously described it as 'absolute crap,' while
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        told a London audience that he would trust his instinct rather than the overwhelming evidence of 97 per cent of the world's climate scientists.
       </p>
       <p>
        If this package of bills is repealed, Tony Abbott will have made Australia the only nation in the developed world to reverse action on climate change. He is scrapping Labor's policy that has seen wind-generated electricity triple and continue to grow because of the framework that Labor put around its clean energy package, a framework which included the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
         ARENA
        </a>
        and, importantly, a renewable energy target. In all of that, the iconic part of Labor's policy is an emissions trading scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony Abbott's policy is completely out of step with the rest of the world. It is so out of step that it is embarrassing. Yet we know that the Liberal Party did support an emissions trading scheme and that there are still members of the Liberal Party who support an emissions trading scheme. I do not understand why the Prime Minister is refusing to include climate change on the G20 agenda. I understand that he has had pressure from the United States and China, both of which are acting on putting a legal cap on carbon pollution. Both countries are acting on emissions trading schemes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister has also accused the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        climate chief of 'talking through her hat'. We also know that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Hunt
        </a>
        relied on Wikipedia for his source of information when contradicting an opinion of the United Nations chief scientist in a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC" rel="nofollow">
         BBC
        </a>
        interview. So that is the kind of level of debate that we are dealing with when we are talking about climate change policy, one of the most fundamental legislative issues that is facing this parliament. It is an issue that we know will go beyond today and tomorrow and will continue to be so important after this debate is over. What is so disappointing is that, after this debate is over, because of the deal that the government has done with some of the crossbenchers, we will no longer have a price on air pollution in this country. We will not have a legal cap on carbon pollution. We will not have a market-based mechanism that will allow businesses to work out the best way to operate. It really surprises me beyond belief why a Liberal Party in Australia would not support a market-based mechanism to deal with the carbon pollution issue in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor stand very clear and very firm on our position, outlined in this amendment to these bills, to support an emissions trading scheme. That has always been our position and continues to be our position. It is backed up by scientists and economists right across the country, right across the world, including Professor John Hewson and conservatives in the UK, the US and the like. Labor stand here proud of the fact that we have supported an emissions trading scheme and have brought into this place a position that would take Australia forward. It is not too late for the government to sleep on this matter tonight and then tomorrow, when they wake up, think about how they really want to address the issue of climate change policy for this country. Do they want to be left behind and take Australia backwards? Or do they want to take Australia forwards, increase economic investment in renewables and actually do something for our children to reduce air pollution in this country and play our role on the planet to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?
