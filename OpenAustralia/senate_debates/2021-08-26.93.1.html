        [by video link] Over the last couple of days we've seen a concerted effort from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison
        </a>
        to push off blame for this bungled vaccine rollout. Over the last couple of days we've seen an attempt from Scott Morrison to blame Queenslanders for his slow rollout, and it's just not on. Queenslanders have done everything that has been asked of them, and because of Scott Morrison's failures we now have a slow vaccine rollout that is not keeping up with the lockdowns created by a lack of national quarantine facilities. This is absolutely unacceptable from our Prime Minister. He is trying to blame Queenslanders when, in fact, he himself is the one to blame.
       </p>
       <p>
        But this is very on-brand for our Prime Minister. He doesn't hold a hose. It's a states issue. It's not his job. These are the things that he has told people throughout this crisis. What we've learned throughout this crisis is that we have a prime minister who is a mediocre middle-management marketing man who doesn't care about Queensland; he only cares about himself.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we've seen the stark difference in the two leaders of Queensland. On one hand we have Scott Morrison, who refuses to do his job and has refused to build national quarantine facilities; on the other hand we have
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annastacia_Palaszczuk" rel="nofollow">
         Annastacia Palaszczuk
        </a>
        , who is building a quarantine facility. She is going ahead and building the Wellcamp facility in Toowoomba because Scott Morrison refused to do his job. That's what Queenslanders want to see. They want to see leaders who get stuff done. Instead, we have a Prime Minister who just keeps stuffing up. It is time for Queenslanders to see this man for what he is, an absolute impostor who has led us down the path of being behind the rest of the world. We should be opening up already, but we're not, because Scott Morrison didn't do his job.
