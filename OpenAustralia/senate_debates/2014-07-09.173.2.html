        has a different theme every year. This year's theme is Serving Country—Centenary and Beyond, which has particular personal significance for me and the

        NAIDOC is celebrated not only in Indigenous communities, but by Australians from all walks of life, and is a great opportunity to participate in a range of activities in support of your local—or our local—Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community.    Defence is honoured to have its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men and women acknowledged in the 2014 NAIDOC theme Serving Country—Centenary and Beyond.

        Indigenous members also serve country through their civilian work in Defence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence conducts its business with respect for Indigenous history and culture by recognising the achievements, culture and history of its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Defence formally and publicly recognises its Indigenous members during NAIDOC Week by flying the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags and hosting many other events across Australia.    NAIDOC Week is a time for Defence to acknowledge its current Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander ADF members and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APS" rel="nofollow">

         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        continue to serve at all levels in the regular and reserve forces on humanitarian assistance, peacekeeping operations and war-like operations and in APS positions across the Department of Defence. How many Indigenous people work in Defence? We currently employ about 1,300 Aboriginal and/or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islanders
        </a>
        . This figure is made up of    677 ADF permanent members, 440 ADF active reservists and 191 employees of the Australian Public Service. Defence has plans and initiatives in place to grow that number considerably over the next few years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence supports the government's commitment to reconciliation and closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.    Defence runs programs that support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders who are considering a career in the Australian Defence Force.    The programs are formally recognised by a vocational education and training certificate, and focus on fitness, leadership, self-confidence, and academic requirements. Programs are for either six weeks or five months depending on the individual support required. The aim is for participants to enlist into the Navy, Army or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">

        . Australian Public Service members, or the non-uniformed side, includes Indigenous trainees, cadets and graduates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence supports and values its Indigenous workforce. Defence values the diversity of its workforce and promotes a culture of inclusion.    Defence is an organisation that proudly has a Reconciliation Action Plan in place, which directs the efforts for significant and meaningful changes to Indigenous participation. Defence recognises that the diversity of our people enhances capability and innovation. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders bring backgrounds and experiences which enhance Defence's ability to defend Australia and its national interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, Defence looks to its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander members for advice and direction on Indigenous issues within the department and its day-to-day activities. Defence has an immense respect for individual difference, and values the knowledge, skills and attributes individuals bring to their work, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander members of the Australian Defence Force and the Australian Public Service defence department.
