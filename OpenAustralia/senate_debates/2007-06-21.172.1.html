         The opposition is extremely unhappy with most of this legislation. We have seen the government vote down every attempt to amend it, no matter how sensible. We believe that there are provisions in this legislation which will, in the future, hamper the industry rather than help it. We believe there are provisions in this legislation which will be unworkable and we believe this legislation does not give the necessary consultation mechanisms for growers who have been paying for the mechanisms to scrutinise the holder of the single desk on their behalf. On that ground alone one would have thought this legislation ought to have been opposed, but, unfortunately, contained within it is a provision which makes sure that the single desk arrangements do not, on 1 July this year, in terms of the veto power, revert to

         . We have indicated that we will support that.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will support the bill, but only on the basis that we would support that provision. Were it not for that provision we would oppose this bill, and we would not accept as honest any statement at any time if it represented our position as supporting the legislation because we voted for the third reading. We make it clear we are voting on the basis of schedule 2 being in the bill and not separated, and for no other reason.
