         I thank Senator McKenzie for her interest in this area, noting the professional experience she brings to her role as a senator. What this government understands is that improving student outcomes is not just about funding; it is also about quality teaching, a robust curriculum, principal autonomy and parental engagement. We think that quality teaching is critical to the future prosperity of young Australians and to their productivity, and we are committed to building an absolutely world-class education system. We intend to lift the quality and status of the teaching profession and believe that action needs to start when teachers are gaining their qualifications.

         In February, the Minister for Education announced the Teacher Education Ministerial Advisory Group, the TEMAG, which will advise how teacher education programs can be improved in their preparation of new teachers and in ensuring those teachers have the right mix of academic and practical skills for the classroom. The advisory group is going to undertake a consultation process. It will host up to four national meetings with key stakeholders across the country. It will also consult with the Australian Institute for Teaching and School Leadership,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universities_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Universities Australia
         </a>
         , the

         of Deans of Education, teacher employers, teacher regulatory bodies, key representative bodies of the education sector and relevant education experts.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is all about a much broader, much more focused approach to what makes quality teachers. It is about giving participants in the sector an opportunity to have their input into the advisory group and making sure that their views on quality teaching, a robust curriculum, principal autonomy and parental engagement are heard loud and clear by the advisory group.

         will chair the advisory group and there will be a number of other leading experts in the area on it. They will ensure that, as they undertake their public consultation process, all those voices are heard.

           The advisory group will adopt an evidenced based approach because we think that is the best way to identify world's best practice in teacher education. There is going to be a particular focus on pedagogical approaches, on subject content and on professional experience. The terms of reference themselves, which were made by public by the minister at the time, state that the work of the advisory group will focus on three areas. The terms of reference identify these as:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           1.   Pedagogical approaches—Ways of teaching and learning, including assessing learning related to specific areas and matched to the capabilities of students
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           2.   Subject content … and
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           3.   Professional experience … Improved university and in-school professional experience opportunities for pre-service teachers and better support from experienced mentor teachers.
          </p>
          <p>
           The third area is about making sure that those who have already grown and learned in the profession can assist those who wish to engage in the profession to learn more and to learn the best.
