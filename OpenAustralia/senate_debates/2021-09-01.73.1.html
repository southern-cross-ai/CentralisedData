        I rise to add my voice to those of Senate colleagues on what continues to unfold in Afghanistan. The country's collapse to the Taliban was a tragedy in itself, but to have been so quickly followed by terrorist violence is especially confronting.

        personnel targeted by the Kabul airport bombings were in harm's way because they were working to help Afghans trying to reach a better life. This evil behaviour must be strongly condemned, and of course our deepest sympathy is sent to the families and loved ones of those who have lost their lives.

        During the past several weeks we've seen and heard terrible things, but we've also witnessed an extraordinary evacuation effort, one of the largest humanitarian airlifts in Australia's history. Our forces evacuated more than 4,000 people, in cooperation with our allies and partners. It was a dangerous mission carried out by

        personnel and supported by

        </a>
        civilians, whom we must thank for their outstanding contribution. Again, Australians can be very proud of those who act in our name abroad and the professionalism they bring. Their professionalism reminds me of the impressive conduct I witnessed when I travelled to Afghanistan and met with Australian Defence Force personnel participating in our

        area of operations. We must continue to honour their commitment, professionalism, dedication and sacrifice.

        My office, and I know this is true of other parliamentarians, has received a significant influx of requests for help and information. It's an incredibly anxious time for many in Afghanistan, in Australia and around the world, with many people left vulnerable. This will only increase following the departure of United States forces in accordance with their deadline yesterday. The past few weeks have shown us the great value of our freedom here and how vital it is that we help Afghans following the loss of theirs, holding the Taliban to account for its behaviour and providing as much ongoing humanitarian support as we can, as a generous nation.
