        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Bob Carr) to a question without notice asked by Senator Fierravanti-Wells today relating to corruption and foreign bribery.
       </p>
       <p>
        In doing that, I note that Senator Carr was asked yesterday and today to deny that the state government he led was corrupt and that it took all of six questions for Senator Carr to get around to actually saying that the government he led in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        was not corrupt. That in itself raises some questions, as do Senator Carr's very short, curt and, if I might say, embarrassed answers to questions raised of him today. He took the coward's way out in the first two questions simply by saying that they were not relevant to him.

               <p>
                I return to the point I was making. Senator Carr's answers today showed lack of courage in any response to the questions asked of him. He took the easy way out of saying they were not related to him when, quite clearly, the question was how Senator Carr can lecture other countries about lack of corruption when it is suggested that he presided over a state government which is now being demonstrated to have been very, very corrupt.
               </p>
               <p>
                I might take this opportunity while I have the floor on this issue to remind people who might be listening that while my name is Ian Macdonald and while I was some years ago a minister in the federal government, I am not the minister Ian Macdonald currently being referred to in the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
                 ICAC
                </a>
                inquiry. Some of the allegations coming out in the ICAC inquiry—and I acknowledge that so far no-one has been convicted of anything—are such that I think the most uneducated observer would have to be concerned at the relationship between my namesake Mr Ian Macdonald, then the minister for mines, and Mr
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Obeid" rel="nofollow">
                 Eddie Obeid
                </a>
                , whose family ended up with quite lucrative pieces of land following some decisions by my namesake Mr Macdonald on coal leases.
               </p>
               <p>
                Why the question was asked of Senator Carr today was that the people who are featuring prominently in the ICAC inquiry were all ministers who were there when Senator Carr was the Premier of that state and the leader of the Labor Party. It was Senator Carr who promoted people like Mr Obeid and my namesake Mr Macdonald. I have to say that I met my namesake Ian Macdonald once or twice and he seemed to me to be quite a nice guy. I have to say also that I thought that about
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Collins" rel="nofollow">

                when he was a senator in this place and I thought that about Mr Gordon Nuttall, who I had a couple of dealings with when we were both ministers, I federally and he in the Queensland government.

                  Yes, you are quite right: I am not a good judge of character because I was quite easily fooled. Clearly, Senator Carr is also not a very good judge of character because, Senator Di Natale, Senator Bob Carr promoted these people in his government and put them in positions where the sorts of things that we read about in the paper at the present time were allowed to happen. So the question that is raised is: how can Senator Carr go round lecturing

                        Mr Deputy President, I wonder if Senator Macdonald and those over on that side would be brave enough to throw those accusations at business leaders. There are some fantastic and successful business leaders who, under their regimes, run very successful companies. But if there is a change of personnel at the top and something is not right or is illegal in that business, do you go back and blame the previous general manager or the previous

                        ? It is absolutely ridiculous.

                       <p>
                        I take offence when Senator Macdonald, who always goes the low road, revels in mud. Senator Macdonald loves to throw aspersions across the chamber at people's reputations, but he should be very careful because I remember the formative years of the Howard government when a number of ministers were removed. I do not know if you were here at the time, Senator Macdonald. I remember that when I came in you were a minister, but you did not last long—you got thrown out on your ear. That is another story, but I am happy to talk about that. It was quite hilarious, actually: the removal of Senator Macdonald with some of the incompetents on that side of the chamber. He was the only one that copped the axe between the eyes. But, Mr Deputy President, there is absolutely no credibility in throwing that. I think Senator Carr has the right to stand on his merits.

                              Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. I am well aware of the latitude you allow in these debates, but might I point out to you that the motion moved by Senator Macdonald was that the Senate take note of the answer given by Senator Bob Carr to the question asked of him by Senator Fierravanti-Wells. A personal attack on Senator Ian Macdonald's very distinguished record of public service does not bear in any way upon the motion before the chair.

                                    . It does not mean that there are not a heap of frivolous cases taken there. I note that there have been a number of frivolous cases—I will say 'frivolous', because it has just tied up so much taxpayer money—where accusations have been made, people's reputations have been trashed and there have been no charges. But for the opposition to sit there in question time and try and accuse Senator Carr of being somehow engaged in inappropriate behaviour is nothing short of diabolical. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I reiterate this: if you have something to say on that side, take 30 brave steps to your right and say it outside the chamber. Senator Macdonald will not say it. He is protected in here. I still will not retract mine: he was removed as the minister, so he was not even that good then.

                                     What a load of bollocks we have just heard there! In question time today, Senator Bob Carr once again sought to deflect his responsibility as Minister for Foreign Affairs—firstly when he suggested that the question in relation to corruption and upholding those standards had nothing to do with his portfolio. That clearly demonstrates what page the minister is on. In my mind, actions speak much louder than words, and no amount of the rhetorical flourishes and theatrical histrionics that we get from this foreign minister day in and day out makes a dot of difference. It does not compensate for the disgraceful cover-up that we have seen in

The union movement are part and parcel of it, and not only have they permeated the Labor government but we know they control its agenda. In relation to the scandal and corruption that have been revealed for a long time now in New South Wales, where Labor politicians have paid and continue to pay homage to the likes of

                                     I hate to say, though, that the incidence of behind-the-scenes corruption in New South Wales is endemic and is linked to a wider pervasive corrupt situation across the union movement across the nation. Indeed, there are a plethora of Labor politicians here in Canberra that are here by virtue of the patronage of the union movement. In my home state of Victoria—in my patron seat of Deakin, I have to say—we have another example of this invidious patronage and the activities that they have covered up with their involvement in the union movement. The case in point is

                                        Thanks, Mr Deputy President. It has direct relevance because what we were seeking is an assurance that the foreign minister was complying with the principles of the convention in how he applied that on the basis of his approach domestically, here in Australia, to the international convention and international transactions. Here is yet another example of where that compliance has been neither sought nor assured. So we have a situation where we have a senator on the other side of the chamber,

                                        The Cole royal commission looked into this. They do not want to deal with this, but the Cole royal commission looked into this, and I quote from it. It said, 'Unknown to the employers who contributed to the premiums in this trust fund, a private arrangement was made whereby large sums were paid by a company to the ETU as commission.' A trustee of that was one Senator Gavin Marshall, and the debt collector there was one Mike Symon.

                                          Mr Deputy President, in taking a point of order, might I remind you that, although the test of relevance in this debate is not direct relevance but the general test of relevance, relevance does mean something. It means that what the senator has to say has to have something to do with the question before the chair. The question before the chair is that the Senate take note of the question about the corruption of the

                                            Let me absolutely assure you, Mr Deputy President, that my answer will be far more relevant than the one I was subjected to from the member opposite recently. The nature of the motion that we are debating here today goes to the heart of some of the reasons the Australian public is losing heart in its politicians because, rather than using the opportunity to discuss things that may be of real concern to people—like fallacious reports in that cheap rag the

No wonder the Australian people—

                                               Mr Deputy President, I have a point of order on relevance. We are halfway through the time allotted to the senator. The senator has not yet addressed any aspect of the question before the chair. She has criticised the opposition for moving the question before the chair, because she considers that other questions are more important, but she has not addressed the question before the chair. Perhaps she is embarrassed to represent in this chamber a political party substantial sections of which are controlled by white-collar criminals. Whatever her motive is, she has to be drawn to the question.

                                                 Yes, fancy having to withdraw that. That was appalling. We are here to work for the good of Australia. In fact, our place on the world stage as represented by the foreign minister, Minister Carr, is one that is enviable. In 2010, from memory, we were described by the

Everyone on this side of this place defends the fact that we need to have strong anticorruption measures in place. Of course we do, and we totally and utterly support them. It is unfortunate that there are times when, in the interests of the greater good, these things need to be brought out into the public arena, but they do need to be exposed to the harsh light of day if any impropriety or misbehaviour is taking place. We are all in agreement about that—not to use a debate in this place which could be about things that are really relevant to the Australian people to attack the foreign minister. We have measures in place to deal with that.

That is what the Australian people expect of us, and we, as members of government, know and expect that we should get robust criticism and forensic dissection of all the policies that we are putting into place. That is what we expect of members opposite, not trivial, small-minded, mean-spirited attacks on individuals. It disappoints me, and I am quite confident that it is a source of great disappointment to the Australian people. I am sure that all my colleagues in this place in the Greens and the Independents are disappointed that this opportunity to take note of some of the important issues that were raised today, which included cancer, the situation in Nauru—

                                                  I note, from the previous contribution made in this debate, it seems to be of some surprise to the Labor Party and the government that indeed it is the opposition's job to criticise them, albeit on topics that they might not want to be criticised on. It seems that they are upset that they do not get to choose the issues upon which they are criticised and I note that in question time Senator Lundy seemed to be disappointed and accused Senator Brandis of bringing the government into disrepute, as if somehow that was a failure on behalf of the opposition. But there is a very important reason why that question was asked and people should take note of it. It goes to both the government's and the minister's ability to effectively oversee a department and it goes to the culture of the party that makes up this government. What we are seeing in

Sadly, citizens of New South Wales can easily remember it in their state. We can remember when former Labor premiers of

I do note, however, that there is a number of council scandals, particularly as to Brimbank, where I grew up, and that there is an investigation going on at the moment into Darebin that does involve the behaviour of Labor elected councillors. But this goes to the very culture of the Labor Party, because the culture of the Labor Party is tribal—and they brag about it. The culture of the Labor Party is so tribal that it gives them moral blindness. It gives them a moral blindness which makes those opposite unable to look at the errors and moral failures of the people on their own side.

                                                  A sad point is that the previous speaker referred to the disillusionment of the people of Australia with government at the moment. She is quite right, because it is the government of the day that sets the tone—it is the government that sets the tone of political debate; it is the government that sets the tone of the political institutions—and it is this Labor government that has failed on every single test. I find it amazing that we have members of the Labor Party coming in here and complaining about personal attacks when there was nothing of the sort and there was merely a question. That is given the character assassination that happens on the other side of this building whenever the House of Representatives convenes because that is all the Labor Party can bring themselves to do. The problem with what has happened in New South Wales is that it simply does not pass the sniff test. It does not seem in any way that any reasonable person could believe that something untoward was not going on. Let us go to

                                                    Senator Brandis, you are quite right. The problem is that the Labor Party has a pattern of moral blindness. That moral blindness comes from their view that the means that they undertake are justified because the ends are what they deem to be appropriate and particularly what they deem to be appropriate for all the Australian people. But the truth is that the last 20 years have seen a litany of former Labor ministers being dragged before tribunals like this and a litany of some of them even going to prison.
