        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the Senate record its deep regret at the death, on 27 November 2008, of Lieutenant Michael Kenneth Housdan Fussell, killed while on combat operations in Afghanistan, and place on record its appreciation of his service to his country, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know all senators and I think all Australians were saddened by the report of the death of Lieutenant Fussell and the injuries to two of his colleagues. We express our deep condolences to his family, who have lost a fine young man—a man who was very well respected by his colleagues and who had a reputation as a courageous and loyal soldier. His death saddens us all and I think highlights again the dangers of our mission in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        This brings to seven the Australian soldiers we have lost in operations in Afghanistan, and I think it very much brings home to us the seriousness and danger and the commitment we have made to Afghanistan. While we acknowledge the need for the efforts that we are making there and for the international efforts to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan, it is also becoming clearer that that comes at a very high price for the Australian defence forces and for the other forces engaged in those efforts in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it is important that we signal our renewed commitment to that international effort to bring some peace to Afghanistan and to provide for a democratic government to rule Afghanistan in peace and stability. I know this parliament has been as one in supporting our troops in Afghanistan, and I know there has been a bipartisan approach from this government and the former government to the responsibility and commitment we make there, but I think it is true that we all accept the burden of the decisions we have taken in this regard. While it may be easy sometimes for politicians to commit to such things, it has very much brought home to me the fact that that commitment has now seen the loss of seven Australian soldiers, and it is they and their families who bear the cost of the commitment we make. But we hope that their efforts will not be in vain and that we will have success in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The signs of renewed international commitment to the strategy in Afghanistan are, I think, encouraging. At the moment our focus is, as it should be, on the death of this Australian soldier and on the contribution he has made to Australia and to the interests of peace and stability in Afghanistan. Our condolences and thoughts are with his family, and, of course, our thoughts are also with his ADF colleagues, who have suffered another tragic loss.

        <p>
         by leave—I rise on behalf of the coalition to strongly support the motion moved by Senator Evans in relation to the tragic death of Lieutenant Michael Fussell. The coalition, like the government, is deeply saddened by Lieutenant Fussell’s death last week as the result of the detonation of an improvised explosive device in Afghanistan. Lieutenant Fussell was killed serving his nation. His courage and dedication are admired and respected, and his sacrifice will not be forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are again reminded of the extreme danger which Australian personnel face every day in Afghanistan, and the task at hand must never be underestimated. In a week where terrorist attacks also killed hundreds of people in India, it is a further reminder of the importance of the struggle in Afghanistan and the threat terrorists pose to our freedoms and our way of life. Indeed, Lieutenant Fussell’s tragic death was somewhat overshadowed by the outrageous and unacceptable terrorist attack in Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
         We do not underestimate the importance of our nation’s role in Afghanistan, nor do we underestimate the sacrifice made by our service personnel, willingly and voluntarily, and their families. So it is with profound regret and sadness that we record our sorrow at the death of Lieutenant Fussell. But, as Senator Evans indicated, the continued bipartisan commitment to our just cause in Afghanistan means that his death must not and will not be in vain. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and indeed all the families of personnel serving in Afghanistan at this very difficult time.

          . It does strike home when an individual Australian is killed in the service of the country what an extraordinary sacrifice has been given by Lieutenant Fussell and indeed his family. His brother is in the services as well. Lieutenant Fussell grew up on the

          personnel wherever they may serve. That said, we recognise that the danger to our personnel in Afghanistan is much greater because of the mismanagement of this conflict by the Bush administration from the outset. Had it not occurred that

          decided to go to Iraq, we would not have our personnel in the dangerous circumstances that are now pertaining in southern Afghanistan.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our heart goes out to all those families who are aware of those dangers, because good Australian service personnel are in south Afghanistan. There have been two further casualties since Lieutenant Michael Fussell died. We also think of those who were injured with him and have been injured since. We wish them a speedy recovery and hope there will be no further casualties—and not just before Christmas—but, again, knowing that that hope flies in the face of reality.
         </p>
         <p>
          Vale Lieutenant Fussell. You have served your nation, and we are all proud of that service and sorry you are no longer with us.

           by leave—I rise on behalf of the National Party to support others in this chamber regarding the tragic death of Lieutenant Fussell. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his family. We acknowledge the great sacrifice that has been made not only by Lieutenant Fussell’s family but also by other families of personnel who remain over there. We acknowledge also the distance, the loneliness and the fear that these people have to deal with. We acknowledge that they are there because they believe it is right, and it is right and proper that today, in a small gesture, we rise in the Senate to make sure that these people know that they have our full support.

           Their job is not one of politics; their job is to follow orders. And those orders at times can cost them their lives. This is an exemplary attribute of the human being that was obviously Lieutenant Fussell. Our hopes and prayers are not only with the family of Lieutenant Fussell but also with all those who remain and are currently facing a threat to their life for the benefit of our nation.

             Family First
            </a>
            , it is with great sadness that I acknowledge the death of Lieutenant Michael Fussell, who was killed last week serving his country in Afghanistan, and express condolences to his family and friends. Lieutenant Fussell was just 25 years old and, by all accounts, was a gifted and talented young man who had a lot to live for. He was the seventh Australian to die serving in Afghanistan. It is important that the Senate notes Lieutenant Fussell’s death and the death of each and every one of the military people killed serving their country. Each life lost in Afghanistan, whether an Australian or not, is one of immeasurable value.
           </p>
           <p>
            Family First does think that Australia has an important contribution to make to bringing stability and peace to Afghanistan’s citizens and to cutting the risk of terrorism being exported from that country. When we speak about the war against terror, it can seem like a conflict with a very vague and undefinable enemy. But, really, this is a war against the Taliban, against Al-Qaeda and against other relatively small but very dangerous groups. We only have to look to recent events in Mumbai to see that terrorism, even though it is in another country, is a very real threat to Australians. It is important that extremism of this violent minority is not allowed to succeed. Lieutenant Fussell’s life was not lost in vain. Family First’s thoughts and prayers are with his family at this very difficult time.
