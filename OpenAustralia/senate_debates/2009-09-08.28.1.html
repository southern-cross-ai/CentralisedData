         I thank the senator for her question. I know that it is a very important question. BreastScreen Australia is one of the best breast cancer screening programs in the world. Since 1991 the Commonwealth has been working with the states and territories to provide free biennial mammograms to women aged between 50 and 69 years, with women aged from 40 to 49 years and 70 years and over also being eligible to attend.
        </p>
        <p>
         The important study led by Dr Helen Zorbas, from the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre, which we have recently seen in the media demonstrates the effectiveness and value of BreastScreen Australia. The report that Dr Zorbas brought forward found that the program was well accepted by women, more broadly accessible and cost effective. It found that participation in the program by women in the target group had increased from 51.4 per cent in 1996-97 to 56.2 per cent in 2004. The program has reduced the mortality rate in the key 50 to 69 years of age target group.
        </p>
        <p>
         The report highlights areas where the program can be improved, particularly in increasing the participation of Indigenous women and workforce shortages. The Rudd government moved to address some of the capacity issues with an investment of $120 million in this year’s budget. We have provided significant funding to replace BreastScreen Australia’s outdated equipment with state-of-the-art digital mammogram equipment. In providing that $120 million we are providing assistance for this.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given the record levels of government debt, will the minister admit that any moves to limit the eligible age for screening mammograms will merely be a desperate attempt by this government to save money by endangering the lives of women and by restricting the ability to detect and treat breast cancer?

           The short answer is, I think, no, but I will seek further particulars from the Minister for

           . BreastScreen Australia is a very important program and it will continue. I make that plain. The expert committee has provided us with a number of options to improve the program, and the government, the states and the territories are jointly considering these options. The recommendations will be discussed further at the Australian Health Ministers Conference in November.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government released the BreastScreen Australia evaluation report yesterday. It is about ensuring that this very important program will continue. The expert committee has provided us with a number of options for improving the program. The government and the states and territories, as I have indicated, are jointly considering those options.

             This is a very serious issue. The difficulty always is in addressing what may be regarded as a question that suggests answers. As to government funding for cancer screening, what I can say is that the government has committed $2 billion to build a world-class cancer care system in Australia, including an investment of over $1.3 billion to improve Australia’s—

              , I hesitate to make this point of order but it goes to relevance. This is a very important issue. I am not for a minute impugning the minister’s answer but there are many younger women in Australia who are desperate to know whether the government will rule in or rule out providing to them this vital service of mammograms. Would he please answer the question?

                    The opposition should take heed and be very careful not to run a scare campaign on such a very serious matter. As I indicated, the committee recommended better targeting for women in screening for breast cancers to ensure that those most at risk are able to access free screening. The government, jointly with the states and territories, is considering the options presented in the report. I also said right at the outset that BreastScreen is a very important program.
