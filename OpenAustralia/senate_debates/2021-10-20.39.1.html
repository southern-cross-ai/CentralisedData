        Three thousand, one hundred and thirty-nine Australians lost their lives to suicide last year. That's about nine Australians every day. On top of that stark figure, a staggering 65,000 attempted suicide in 2020. One of the risk factors for suicide is relationship breakdown. Research confirms that separated people have a higher risk of attempting suicide and developing suicidal thoughts. In short, relationship breakdowns have their consequences. They are real, they are deep and they are potentially very destructive. That's the bad news. The good news is Parents Beyond Breakup.

        Parents Beyond Breakup is a national suicide prevention charity focused on supporting separating parents experiencing trauma through family breakdown. This charity has effectively gone about its vital task for two decades. One wonders what the statistics would be without their highly effective work. Under the able leadership of Brendan Blomeley and

It ensures the safety of parents coming to groups, and in the last year it has supported for 1,451 face-to-face engagements, 1,429 online engagements and 1,778 helpline calls. Parents Beyond Breakup does wonderful restorative work. It deserves our support.
