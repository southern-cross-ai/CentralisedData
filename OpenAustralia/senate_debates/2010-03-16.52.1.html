        I seek leave to amend general business notice of motion No. 740 by deleting in paragraph (b)(iii) the words after the word ‘result’ and replacing them with ‘in additional costs to end users significantly greater than the $3 to $4 per annum increases anticipated by the government’.

           I thank the Senate. The Rudd government’s Renewable Energy Target Scheme will be enhanced to provide greater certainty for households, employees and businesses within the renewable energy industry as we build the low-pollution economy of the future. From 1 January 2011 the renewable energy target, which guarantees that 20 per cent of Australia’s energy in 2020 will come from renewable resources, will include two parts: the small-scale renewable energy scheme and the large-scale renewable energy target. These changes are expected to deliver more renewable energy than the original 20 per cent target and will ensure we build the clean energy future Australia needs. Importantly, the government’s revamped RET will support new jobs and investment in both large- and small-scale renewable energy projects. While these changes address some uncertainty in the current market, uncertainty around the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
            Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
           </a>
           is also harming market sentiment. This illustrates why it is critical to have a market based, long-term response to reducing emissions to drive investment in the renewable industry. Renewables of course went back under the Howard government

           2006 renewables contribution. They contributed 10.5 per cent of our electricity supply in 1997 compared to 9.5 per cent in 2007. In 2003 the Howard government’s own review of the then
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRET" rel="nofollow">
            MRET

           recommended increasing the target, advice rejected by the Howard government time and time again.

             Mr Deputy President, I understand that the Greens support the motion. On that basis, the government recognises that, with the support of the Greens, Senator Barnett’s and Senator Fisher’s motion has a majority in the Senate. We will not call a division.
