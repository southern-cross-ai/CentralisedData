        by leaveâ€”I can inform the Senate that, following the election held on 2 July this year, His Excellency the Governor-General commissioned the Hon.

        </a>
        , Prime Minister, to form a government. Ministers and assistant ministers were appointed on 19 July 2016. For the information of honourable senators, I table a full list of the ministry. The document lists all ministers and assistant ministers and the offices they hold. It shows those ministers who comprise the cabinet, and it provides details of representation arrangements in each chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can inform the Senate that the Prime Minister has reappointed me as the

         Leader of the Government in the Senate
        </a>
        . He has reappointed Senator Cormann as the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and reappointed Senator Fifield as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I can further inform the Senate that Senator Bushby will continue in his role as Chief Government Whip in the Senate, and that Senator Fawcett and Senator Smith have both been re-elected as deputy government whips in the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate those honourable senators on their reappointment to the Senate leadership, as well as Senator Canavan on his promotion to the cabinet. I also would like to take this opportunity to congratulate senators opposite who have recently been appointed to shadow ministerial roles and other offices within the opposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
         Mr President
        </a>
        , I assure you that, just as we sought to do in the last parliament, we the government will once again work with you and, indeed, with all senators to ensure the orderly running of this chamber and the good governance of the Commonwealth. I thank the Senate.
