        My question is to Senator Coonan, Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts. I refer the Minister to Telstra’s extreme 43 per cent home phone connection price increase. I did note your previous answer, but as usual you tried to gloss over the issue. Is the minister aware that these plans will result in price increases for pensioners installing new home phone connections of from $135.30 to $194? Does the minister believe that a $60 increase for the price of a home phone for pensioners is justified? Isn’t the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Consumers_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Consumers Association
        </a>
        right when it says that this price rise ‘is going to hit people at the lower end of the income scale disproportionately’? Will the minister now act to stop these price rises to protect Australian pensioners from the impact of these extreme price increases?

               The Telstra carrier charge was in fact amended formally yesterday. The price controls that apply to Telstra are a key telecommunications safeguard. They do make sure that the efficiency gains Telstra makes are passed through to customers in the form of lower prices—

                                Unfortunately, I know that this information, which is relevant information to provide to those listening to question time, is constantly interrupted by those on the other side. They do not like the fact that this is the government that has put in place safeguards for people and for consumers and for pensioners with respect to telecommunications and the way in which the regulatory environment regulates not just Telstra but also all other providers. The price control arrangements that will apply and which were introduced on 1 January will remain. We have untimed local calls which remain capped at 22c, and Telstra is still required to continue to offer a package of services and support targets for low-income consumers.

                                   In the previous question I attempted, probably for about two minutes—I was timing myself—to provide information about targeted assistance to low-income earners. In four minutes you can only deal with the question, which I have done, and I specifically dealt not only with low-income earners but also the broader package of price controls which delivers benefits to consumers right across Australia and for consumers who were completely neglected by the Labor Party, which did not even have a customer service guarantee.

                                    , I ask a supplementary question. I have to say that the minister is consistent in avoiding answering any questions. Is the minister aware of recent comments by independent telecommunication analyst Paul Budde who said that, when it comes to a fully privatised Telstra, the prices of ‘everything that is not regulated will be increased’? Since the price caps have been proven completely inadequate in protecting pensioners, doesn’t this mean that these home phone price increases will just be the first of many Telstra increases for Australian pensioners?

                                     The reality is that the overall telecommunication prices have dropped by nearly 20 per cent since the Howard government was elected in 1996. What is the senator going to say to that? The incontrovertible proof is that this government’s record stands as having delivered real benefits for consumers in telecommunications, together with the fact that there is targeted information and assistance for low-income earners and an overall price regime that, of course, the Labor Party did not have the wit or forethought to introduce when they were in government. Now they resent the fact—
