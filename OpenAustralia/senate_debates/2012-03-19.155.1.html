          Home Affairs
         </a>
         has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFAC" rel="nofollow">
          CFAC
         </a>
         is an advisory council that exists principally to advise the Commonwealth Government on the technical operation of the laws governing the importation of firearms, as contained in the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. Accordingly, the members of CFAC were selected on the basis of their specific individual knowledge of firearms and not because of their stance on firearms issues.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) (a) Yes. The Attorney-General's Department has recently conducted public consultation on proposed amendments to the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956, including the proposal to increase restrictions on the importation of .50
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMG" rel="nofollow">
          BMG
         </a>
         firearms (among other things).
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Yes. At the fourth CFAC meeting, held on 27 October 2011, the CFAC discussed the current controls in place which regulate the use of sound moderators.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) No. Proposals to introduce paintball markers that imitate or replicate automatic firearms, such as the M16, have not been discussed by the CFAC.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) At the fourth CFAC meeting, held on 27 October 2011, the CFAC discussed a proposal relating to the use of higher calibre handguns in international sporting competitions within the context of current import controls. Proposals to introduce larger capacity magazines for handguns have not been discussed by the CFAC.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) At the third and fourth CFAC meetings, held on 28 July and 27 October 2011, the CFAC discussed knives in the context of proposed amendments to Schedule 2 and 3 of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 and recent reviews of weapons legislation in Queensland,

          South Australia
         </a>
         . Mental health issues were discussed by the CFAC at the third meeting in the context of recent suicides at public commercial ranges and discussions at the June 2011 Firearms and Weapons Policy Working Group meeting.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         These matters fall within the business of the CFAC in accordance with the CFAC's Terms of Reference.
