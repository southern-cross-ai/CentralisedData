        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Evans. Can the minister advise the Senate what impact the government’s stimulus package has had on the Australian economy, in particular in relation to support for economic activity and jobs? Can the minister update the Senate on how road and rail projects are being rolled out as part of the economic stimulus plan? What would be the consequences of rolling back these road and rail projects on our economy and on long-term productivity?

         I thank Senator McLucas for her question. The economic stimulus package was needed very much to support growth. Without the fiscal stimulus Australia would now be in recession. This policy stimulus has helped support activity and kept thousands of Australians in jobs who would otherwise have become unemployed. If it were not for the government’s fiscal stimulus, the Australian economy would have contracted by 1.3 per cent over the past year. Instead, as a result of the stimulus, our economy grew by 0.6 per cent. The government stimulus has helped ensure Australia has the strongest growing economy of all the world’s 33 advanced economies. Through our road and rail investments we are supporting jobs today and also building the infrastructure we will need tomorrow. We are investing more in rail in the next 12 months—

           , the opposition do not like being reminded of the facts, but the facts are that we will have invested more in rail in the next 12 months than they did in the previous 12 years. We have doubled the federal roads budget. We have injected $1.2 billion into the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Rail_Track_Corporation" rel="nofollow">

           to undertake 17 rail projects across the country. Three of these projects have been completed and a further seven are under construction. These stimulus measures are creating jobs and keeping people in employment. The thousands of people working on these projects have been able to support their families as a result of the stimulus. This has been vital for protecting jobs and vital for growing the economy, but also it has been investing in long-term productivity. These rail and road developments will allow us to continue to grow the economy through higher levels of productivity and allow us to enjoy continued economic growth. The stimulus package is working and it will be continued.

               last Thursday. He is responsible for the state government of Western Australia’s economic response. When asked about the idea of cutting back the stimulus package, the Western Australian Liberal Treasurer said, ‘No, I think it would be far too premature to argue for the Commonwealth to pull back on the stimulatory package.’ So on the occasions when the opposition want to argue for this, they ought to talk to their own state colleagues. They know that the stimulus package is creating and supporting jobs in Western Australia. They know it is essential to the development of Western Australia and long-term productivity gains. I wish the federal opposition here would be more responsible and support this very necessary measure to stimulate the Australian economy.

                 Only last week I had the pleasure to launch the commencement of works for the $12 million Mirrabooka town centre revitalisation project, supported by state government investment as well but with $2.4 million of economic stimulus money from our local community infrastructure program—nation-building investment in that redevelopment. I was very surprised when we were taking the photos and doing the speeches that not only was I joined by the state government representative, the minister, but I was joined by Mr Michael Keenan, a federal frontbencher, as in this photo.

                      Order! Debating across the chamber at this time is disorderly. Shouting across the chamber at this time does nothing to improve question time. If you wish to debate the issue and you have a point there is a time at the end of question time to take note of answers.
