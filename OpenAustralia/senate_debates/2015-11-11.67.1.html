         I thank Senator Ketter for his question. Senator Ketter, I have already been asked a question in this place on penalty rates and I responded that the government's position was that penalty rates are set by the Fair Work Commission. That is and remains the government's position. I would, though, now take the opportunity to remind you that the only time that penalty rates have been changed by the Fair Work Commission—and, in fact, reduced—is as a result of a review commissioned by the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. In addition to that—and thank you again for giving me the opportunity to remind those listening—the only person with a history in this place of ensuring that the lowest paid workers in this country have their penalty rates not just reduced but absolutely obliterated, slashed and cut without any compensation at all is, of course, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. This is what happens—

             Unlike those on the other side, on this side of politics we actually encourage people to have opinions, because, when you have a discussion and a variety of opinions, you are able to make a good policy. Senator

             is entitled to his opinion. I am sure it is based on the fact that he has spoken to people, probably in the hospitality and tourism industries, who would agree with him. There is a reason that the Fair Work Commission did what it did in relation to penalty rates.

                   As the Minister for Employment in the Turnbull government, our position is very clear. My position is the government's position, and the government's position is that it is for the Fair Work Commission to set penalty rates. The only reason that those on the other side are raising the issue of penalty rates is that they have no plan for employment in this country. We know that because they have spent most of this year playing to the puppet masters in the

                   in relation to the implementation of the China free trade agreement. Those on the other side are beholden to their union masters.

                     , I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The only question was: does the minister agree with the former Treasurer,

                     </a>
                     , who believes penalty rates are profit murder? That was the very straightforward question. I do not believe the minister has come close to that.

                        , I ask a further supplementary question. Can the minister confirm that Australian workers are facing the lowest wages growth in two decades? How much less will Australians have in their pay packets when the Turnbull government also cuts their penalty rates?

                             , I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The minister did come close to the second part of the question, but the first part was clearly: can the minister confirm that Australian workers are facing the lowest wages growth in two decades? I do not believe the minister has gone close to that question.

                              Yes, the minister was answering the second part. The minister has been relevant, and she has 26 seconds in which to answer the question.
