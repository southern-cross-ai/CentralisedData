        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, yesterday you declined to answer whether the Prime Minister had spoken with representatives of Australia's Jewish community since the threatening events that occurred targeting their communities in Melbourne and Sydney over the weekend. I ask the question again: has the Prime Minister spoken to representatives of Australia's Jewish community regarding those events?

         I can indicate that I have. I will take on notice whether or not the Prime Minister has had engagement since the weekend, but I would say to you it is the case that Australia's Jewish community are deeply distressed, as I said this morning. There is a history, obviously, to the persecution of the Jewish people, and the 7 October attacks by Hamas was a day on which more Jewish lives were lost in a single day than in any day since the Holocaust. That of itself is traumatising, and since then we have seen a rise in prejudice and hate. We've seen antisemitism on the rise. I would also say we have seen Islamophobia and other forms of prejudice also on the rise, hence my comments this morning about division. I think it is important to affirm in this place that we all stand against those forms of hatred. We all stand against antisemitism. I would also repeat the comments I made two days ago on
         <i>
          Insiders
         </i>
         : Australians have a right to feel and be safe. Australia's Jewish community has a right to feel and be safe. As the Prime Minister has said as well, the events in Caulfield were the wrong thing to do. I think other events have been intimidating. So I do understand why it is people feel distressed, and we need to affirm our support for that—

           Minister, you've just said that all Australians, including Australia's Jewish community, have a right to feel and be safe. They are expressing fears about displaying religious symbols, wearing religious garments or even wearing Jewish school uniforms in public. So what specific measures has the federal government taken to alleviate these concerns, and has the Prime Minister spoken to state and territory premiers and leaders to coordinate measures to support Australia's Jewish community?

            In part, this is a legal framework question which is obviously both federal legislation—including the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Racial Discrimination Act
            </a>
            , section 18C, which has a history in this place—and an issue of state and territory laws and police and policing conduct. What I would also say, though, is that part of how we affirm people's right to feel and be safe is also how we behave and what we say and do. I acknowledge, despite our many political differences and his occasional criticism of me, the leader of the opposition in this place and the whole opposition, who supported a bipartisan motion. I think that was very important.

                 I would make the point that the government has made commitments which go to social cohesion within a very short period after the attacks, including a grant or funds to the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council" rel="nofollow">
                  Executive Council
                 </a>
                 of Australian Jewry and similar funds to other communities affected, in terms of both support and security. There was also funding for targeted mental health, community and wellbeing support, as well as, as I said, security measures. There was also funding for the protection of Australians from terrorist and violent extremist content online. I would say to the senator that we are open to discussions about how we can continue to support all parts of our community at this time.
