                 I hear that those opposite do not like the question. I note that Senator Moore has a significant interest in the government’s commitment to reforming the health system. The proposed means testing of the private health insurance rebate would have made our health system fairer and more sustainable for the future.

                   The resolve of those opposite to neglect an area in urgent need of reform means that vital changes will be brought to a standstill. After 12 years of doctor shortages, nurse shortages and bed shortages, Mr Malcolm Turnbull and the opposition are still lagging when it comes to improving the health of all Australians.

                  <p>
                   This government is working towards building a world-class health system. We know that reforming the system to deliver the care we need to improve and extend lives will be expensive and difficult—and, of course, those opposite do not want to assist in that process—but we are making the difficult decisions necessary to build a better health system for all Australians.

This shows that Mr Hockey does not have the nerve to make the tough decisions. He wants to cut spending instead. He has just raised it by almost $2 billion. We will bring the bill back. It will be fairer for all Australians. This measure will not affect singles.

                       I know those opposite do not agree with the direction of our health policy, but they could help. After more than 12 years of neglect one would think that those opposite would want to assist in improving our health system, quite frankly. They have been complacent towards the Australian health system.

This will not have a significant effect on demand for public hospital services—on the premiums of the 9.7 million people with private health insurance. The President of the AMA agrees. On
