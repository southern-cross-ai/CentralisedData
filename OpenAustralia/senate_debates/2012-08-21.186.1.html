        During the last 12 months, many people have shared their concerns with me about industrial-scale wind farms in their neighbourhoods. They include farmers, conservationists, Landcare members, field naturalists and others. In my experience, most of the people upset by inappropriate, industrial-scale wind farm developments are not climate change sceptics. They are not deriding the need to reduce carbon emissions but rather trying to bear witness to the reality of industrial-scale wind farms in their neighbourhoods. The have learned that wind turbines are not a neutral technology. Large-scale wind farms can and do cause a range of serious problems. The planning of wind farms must be done very carefully. Without due care, inappropriate wind farm developments adversely impact the people living nearby, can severely damage the biological environment and impair the visual landscape. In order to assimilate these truths, based in common sense and sound conservation principles, we must stop thinking about wind farms in an ideological way and start paying attention to the facts.
       </p>
       <p>
        When politicians and government officers embrace the orthodoxy that 'wind farms are intrinsically good in all situations', their decision making becomes distorted. They stop seeing and hearing the facts. Their critical faculties become impaired as do the assessment processes under their control. Whole communities of people and wildlife are now being stranded by processes that are not working properly and are not assessing the facts in an objective, impartial manner. A striking example of this orthodoxy is the highly controversial and totally inappropriate wind farm proposed for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Bald Hills

        . This proposal was approved in 2004-06 by the Commonwealth and Victorian governments after a contracted battle starting in 2002. The site for the erection of 52 large wind turbines, up to 135 meters tall—that is, 52 turbines each taller than the

        —is right in the middle of a significant wetlands and flora conservation area on the South Gippsland coast. The site directly abuts the

       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to table a 1982 letter from the then Victorian Department of Conservation, Fisheries and Wildlife Division to the local Shire Secretary. It supports the Shire's application for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Trust" rel="nofollow">
         National Trust
        </a>
        funding to purchase land parcels to help establish and extend these nature conservation areas. I quote from the letter:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … without doubt—
       </p>
       <p>
        this land—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        can readily be converted to a wetland of great importance to a wide range of waterbirds. The location is on a flyway used by many species between eastern and western Victoria and will attract many birds as it will be one of the few wetlands in this region. … The proposed wetland is close to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarwin_River" rel="nofollow">
         Tarwin River
        </a>
        and Andersons Inlet, both important feeding grounds for water birds and will create a safe roosting and breeding site which, at present, are very scarce in this region.
       </p>
       <p>
        After thirty years of continuous efforts by local people and organisations to protect this high value conservation area, home to numerous species of birds, the message from today's Victorian and Commonwealth governments is: 'Bad luck. Who cares if an established roosting and breeding site becomes unsafe? Who gives a damn about birds, wetlands and flora conservation when we're in the business of approving wind farms?' Who gives a damn, indeed? Who cares about the 296 recorded bird species living, roosting, breeding and flying around Bald Hills,

I have also advised him that I have written to the Japanese and Chinese governments about Australia's apparent breach.

        Back in 2004 the Victorian assessment panel heard so-called expert evidence from an environmental consultancy firm hired by the then wind farm proponent. The consultants identified only 81 bird species, using field surveys conducted between 8am-ish and 5pm-ish. These observation times do not happen to coincide with the hours kept by many birds. The consultants limited their observation to 24 days, in the 12 months of a long drought period. A conflicting opinion made to the panel by another expert witness was that eight to 10 years of bird survey work was needed to develop a robust understanding. The panel criticised the consultancy's reports, concluding:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a body of work that is approaching the threshold beyond which it cannot be used for effective, rationally based public decision making.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … at this stage insufficient information to allow proper assessment against the criteria of no impact on species listed under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
        </a>
        or the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regardless, the then Victorian Minister for the Environment,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Delahunty" rel="nofollow">
         Mary Delahunty
        </a>
        , approved the wind farm proposal. When the federal environment minister at that time,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Campbell" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Campbell
        </a>
        , intervened to 'call in' the proposal on bird protection grounds, he found himself on the end of a good public kicking by the then Victorian Attorney-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Hulls" rel="nofollow">
         Rob Hulls
        </a>
        . Here we have dodgy assessments approved by some politicians pushing the belief that wind farms are intrinsically good in all situations. Anybody who gets in the way is stomped on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2006, the original proponent has sold on its approval to build the wind farm to a wholly owned subsidiary of Mitsui and Co. Will a wind farm at Bald Hills significantly reduce Mitsui's carbon footprint? Mitsui and Co. are joint owners and operators of five coal mines across Queensland and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , exporting coal to Japan and elsewhere as fast as they can dig it up and ship it out. Mitsui are major developers and exporters of gas, part owners of Woodside offshore petroleum and other developments. Mitsui were party to the catastrophic failure of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BP" rel="nofollow">
         BP
        </a>
        rig in the Gulf of Mexico. In the 2011-12 financial year, Mitsui and Co. energy businesses generated some $A20.78 billion in income. On their website, Mitsui describe some of their energy business goals:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our Energy Business Unit 1 aims to maintain a well-balanced energy resource portfolio and to enhance its trading and marketing activities while establishing a stable supply system to meet growing energy demand.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mitsui's core oil and gas assets for exploration, development and production are based in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        , South-east Asia, Oceania and the Americas. In Oceania, we have operations in the Enfield and Vincent oil fields. In the coal business, we have been developing and expanding our coal mining holdings in Australia, and have been increasing total production volumes. We are pursuing the stable supply of nuclear fuels in view of the long-term need for nuclear power generation. We are also pursuing development of non-conventional energy resources including shale gas/oil, and new technologies such as commercialization of clean coal technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        I may be just a blacksmith, Mr President, but Mitsui does not sound too concerned about reducing the carbon footprint of its energy businesses. Quite the opposite. A wind farm at Bald Hills will not reduce Mitsui's carbon footprint. However, it may mislead some people by green-washing the fact that Mitsui's carbon footprint seems to be getting bigger.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to conclude with some comments drawn from submissions made by a local South Gippsland ecologist called Lucas Bluff. In his 2004 objection to the Bald Hills wind farm he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The effects of climate change on the living world are very difficult to predict. However, the changes will be dramatic and they are already beginning to occur. Species will need to disperse freely in order to survive the effects of climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        He cites a number of scientists, already expressing concern about species being driven harder by climate change to migrate 'through landscapes that human activity has rendered increasingly impassable'.
       </p>
       <p>
        The pressures of climate change on species are driving them away from the heat. We saw evidence presented last week of tropical fish species appearing in Tasmanian waters. We need to think about the same plight of migratory birds: more birds moving south along their flyway and directly into the proposed Bald Hills wind farm. I call on the federal government and Minister Tony Burke to intervene and to stop this harmful project.

             South Australia
            </a>
            , Senator Madigan, because I too rise on to speak on wind energy. You could probably head it: 'Blowing away the spin of renewable energy developers pocketing taxpayers' cash—the money-go-round'. I have a different take on the same issue but, nonetheless, I think we are probably talking from the same song sheet.
           </p>
           <p>
            I rise tonight to talk about the proliferation of wind farms in South Australia and the adverse impacts they are having on my home state. I do not come to this issue from a perspective of whether or not there is a health impact from the noise of turbines or blades, rather that Australians are paying dearly for this renewable source of power. More than half the wind power installed to date across this nation has been in South Australia. Proponents of wind farms claim these are now generating 31 per cent of the electricity from 534 turbines in South Australia, but they never acknowledge this growth is being driven artificially.
           </p>
           <p>
            Renewable energy certificates have enabled the developers of wind farms to maximise their returns because of the Gillard government's commitment to 20 per cent of Australia's electricity coming from renewable sources by 2020. Electricity retailers are legally required to purchase a set number of large-scale generation certificates each year. One

             LGC

            I have welcomed an academic's critique of wind farms because consumers and taxpayers need to know how much this form of renewable energy is costing them. I refer to the statement of the University of Adelaide's climate change professor, Mr Barry Brooks, who said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            There's no guarantee that building wind farms will bring down power prices. It certainly hasn't to date …
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Wind costs a lot of money to build and then it has to be financed and then paid off and when the wind's not blowing it has to be backed up by something like gas. It's not cheaper than gas or coal right now; it would be more expensive…
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It's not going to bring down the cost …the overall trend is clearly that power prices are going to go up.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Madigan, you would strike a chord with those comments. These remarks by Professor Brooks highlight that wind energy has its limitations. They are a factor in why South Australians are being charged some of the most expensive electricity prices in the world, behind only Denmark and Germany. Apologists try to blame sharply rising power charges on the need to replace ageing poles and wires, but infrastructure costs do not account for all of those increases.

            Wind farm developers have concentrated on South Australia because of the benevolent planning guidelines of the Rann-Weatherill Labor governments, unmatched by any other Australian state. These planning policies have allowed turbines to be erected only one kilometre from houses with no rights of appeal by landowners. It is extraordinary stuff! Because of tougher regulations in Victoria, three developers want to erect 220 turbines along the

            The company has targeted wind power projects to take advantage of the large-scale renewable energy certificates and taxpayer subsidies that it and other promoters are getting from the Commonwealth. The Clean Energy Council, which is the umbrella organisation for the renewable energy companies, conveniently overlooks that, without the certificates and taxpayer subsidies, wind power would be twice as expensive as coal or natural gas. One critic of wind farms has claimed that a three-megawatt capacity wind turbine that generates at the most $150,000 worth of electricity a year is eligible for guaranteed subsidies of $500,000 a year.

            wind farm is worth $13.5 million a year to Pacific Hydro and $21 million to Keyneton once its turbine blades are turning in the wind. By law, electricity distribution companies have to take power generated from renewable energy before either coal or gas, except for times when the wind does not blow and, if it is too hot or too breezy, the wind turbines are switched off. A renewable energy company relies on the certificates to bump up whatever it gets from the distributors from the sale of wind generated electricity, and one ex-union heavy has worked out how best for consumers and taxpayers to direct their money to his organisations.

            Mr Weaven has said the investment in Pacific Hydro was an excellent decision. That is an understatement. Renewable energy certificates are giving tremendous returns to the companies involved, but it is at everybody else's expense. Industry SuperFunds took out a double-page spread on pages 2 and 3 of the

            state newspapers on 20 August—only yesterday—and these paid ads make the point that Industry SuperFunds have pioneered direct investment in long-term assets like    wind farms. Also, the industry-union superannuation funds will soon have more money to invest in wind farms with Labor, increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent by 2020. These funds have perfected the money-go-round.

No matter the excuses, the two are inextricably linked—and taxpayers and consumers are being gouged. This has prompted

            South Australia has an average electricity price of 28.6c per kilowatt hour. Yet the Clean Energy Council claims that renewable energy, specifically wind, is only responsible for two per cent of consumer's bills. Excuses include an upsurge in rooftop solar panels, the South Australian electricity network is big in area and extra network costs due to the additional spending required to upgrade ageing poles and wires. But these factors do not camouflage the part played by renewable energy certificates. Renewable energy should not be dependent on subsidies forever to sustain the wind farm industry.
           </p>
           <p>
            This form of renewable energy is a long way from being a baseload supplier of power when it is needed most at peak demand. Wind only contributed 60 megawatts during maximum demand in the summer of 2011, although at times during the week either side of that maximum demand output reached 873 megawatts—in other words, when the power is most required, you cannot depend on wind farms to supply it. It is all very well for wind farm developers to be talking up the potential of their industry, but there is a lack of transmission lines with spare capacity to take the energy generated from additional wind farms.
           </p>
           <p>
            Those pushing for the expansion of the wind farm industry point to possible areas that could be developed along the Yorke and Eyre peninsulas and on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Island" rel="nofollow">
             Kangaroo Island
            </a>
            . However, these areas have plenty of wind but do not have much spare transmission capacity. ElectraNet, the transmission network service provider, stated in its annual report last year that the capacity to export such energy was limited because of the restrictions of the interconnector, and this was already particularly noticeable during period of light load and high-wind conditions—in other words, the wind farms are generating excess power at times when there is reduced demand within this state and it cannot be sent elsewhere because of limited transmission capacity, so it is not being used.
           </p>
           <p>
            The proponents of the wind industry want the government to fund the development of greater transmission capacity within South Australia plus a connector interstate to offload that unused green power. It is all very well for wind farm developers to be talking up the potential of their industry, but there is a lack of transmission lines with spare capacity to take the energy generated from additional wind farms. The wind farms are generating excess power at times when there is reduced demand within this state and it cannot be sent elsewhere because of limited transmission capacity.
           </p>
           <p>
            There has been pressure for the renewable energy certificates to be wound back since the carbon price was introduced on 1 July at $23 a tonne. For renewable energy to be anywhere near the price comparable with either coal or gas, the carbon price would need to be more than $50 a tonne and over five times what the unregulated world market in Europe is trading at right now. The only guarantee is that the price of electricity will keep on increasing.
           </p>
           <p>
            In South Australia, the average yearly household electricity bill has gone from $770 in the mid-1990s to more than double that at about $1,600 today. This is the time for all Australians to put this matter at the forefront of the political agenda, lest we slip further behind in cost of living terms and business competitiveness. Renewable energy certificates might have been needed to kick-start a fledgling wind power industry but not anymore. As we can see by the topics raised in this adjournment speech, wind energy in both South Australia and Victoria is on the political agenda, and I urge the government to undertake an urgent review.
