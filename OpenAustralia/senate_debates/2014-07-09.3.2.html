          <p>
           I thank the Senate. Let us understand what is happening here, Senators. We have already had backgrounded to media—to
           <i>
            Lateline
           </i>
           last night and toSkytoday—on what the Senate will be doing. Media have already been told to prepare for the Prime Minister's announcement because guillotine and gag will be moved in this chamber to get the bills voted on. I want the crossbench to be very clear what you are being asked to do.
          </p>
          <p>
           You are being asked to run this chamber so as to accord with Mr Abbott's media schedule. Regardless of your views on carbon and—as I said to Senator Lazarus yesterday, I disagreed with his speech but I respect his right to put it—I respect the fact that you have differences of views on the substance of the matter, but I utterly object, as does every senator on this side, to this chamber of the Australian parliament being used as a plaything of the Prime Minister. What an outrage that we would have the Senate being asked to gag and guillotine legislation so that Mr Abbott can do a press conference tomorrow in time for prime time television. That is what is occurring.
          </p>
          <p>
           Where do senators in this parliament find this out? Do we find this out because the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
            Leader of the Government in the Senate
           </a>
           comes in and tells us what they want to do? No, we find out because
           <i>
            Lateline
           </i>
           was told last night to expect an announcement and we find out because Sky tweets that they have been told by the government to expect the bills to be voted on by 12.45 pm today. Understand what a disgrace this is. It is utterly disgraceful to run the Australian parliament entirely about the Prime Minister's media schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want everyone in this chamber to understand what the opposition was prepared to put on the table in the interests of proper practice, in the interests of ensuring that this Senate does what Australians expect us to do. We said very clearly, after the meeting that the Leader of the Government in the Senate held yesterday, that we were prepared to give up our time tomorrow when we would debate a Labor bill and our time tomorrow afternoon when we would debate a topic that Labor put to the chamber to ensure a committee stage of the debate in this legislation. And as Senator Xenophon has put—and I trust he will not mind; I am saying nice things about you, Nick, not bad ones—the committee stage is a very important part of Senate practice. It is where ministers are asked questions. It is where undertakings are given. It is where there is clarification about the interpretation of the application of legislation. It is the only time in this parliament where that is truly able to be done. And I say that as someone who was a minister on that side for a number of years. This is where the real work is done.
          </p>
          <p>
           I would remind those opposite that, whatever criticisms you might have of us, you are guillotining when you have been offered more time. You are not guillotining and gagging because it is the end of the session and you have to get bills through; you are guillotining now, on a Wednesday, so that
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
            Tony Abbott
           </a>
           can hold a prime ministerial press conference in time for prime time television tomorrow. That is what is occurring. It is an absolute disgrace and really demonstrates the arrogance of this government. You will not even allow a committee stage in a debate when you have been given more time. So be clear: you have been given more time to enable that debate to occur, time that the opposition has given up, in order to ensure that there is a proper process, a committee stage of this debate, and that amendments can be moved by the Palmer United Party, the Labor Party and any other crossbench senator. You have spat in the face of that offer and you have said: 'Do you know what? We don't want a debate. We just want a media conference. We're going to run the Senate in time for the media and we will not even give the Senate the courtesy of telling senators what our proposition is. We're going to go out and background the media ahead.' What an utter disgrace with respect to how to handle this chamber. I say to the crossbench: do not start this new Senate by supporting such a disgraceful act.

               Leader of the Opposition in the Senate

             <p>
              Secondly, in relation to gagging and guillotining, this package of bills has had 33 hours and 52 minutes of debate in the Senate and, according to Labor, that is gagging and guillotining. As for the Prime Minister's press conference, as we speak he is flying with the

                 Contrary to what Senator Abetz has just said, this is a new Senate, with a number of new senators who have not had the opportunity to go through a committee stage of this legislation. Let me say that the Palmer United Party has put up an amendment that has just been circulated. Nobody has had a chance to actually question anything about that amendment. Labor have got amendments and the Greens have got amendments. We are working to try to save the Australian Renewable Energy Agency,
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">

                 </a>
                 . This is an attempt to stop the Senate saving ARENA's finance. That is what this is about. As much as anything else, it is about tearing down the capacity of the Senate to actually have a committee stage of this legislation. We have to have a committee stage. This is probably the most important package of bills for Australia's future and we cannot allow this parliament to ram it through because the Prime Minister wants to axe the tax. That is ridiculous.

                    My plea to my colleagues on the crossbenches is that we can have, at least, another two hours and 20 minutes of debate tomorrow morning so that we can have some semblance of a committee stage. It is not perfect; I hate the guillotine. But we must have a committee stage for these bills and we must give other senators an opportunity to speak on these bills. All I am saying is that no harm will be done. If the government gets its way—as I expect it will with this legislation—it would still be out of here by tomorrow and into the House of Representatives on Monday morning. There will be no prejudice to the government. This is about the Senate doing its job. My plea to my crossbench colleagues is: do not set a nasty precedent. Whatever has happened in the past has happened.

                    It is. Come on, Senator Scullion. This is important. You will not be prejudicing the government's agenda if we deal with these bills by 11.50 tomorrow morning. That is my plea to my crossbench colleagues.
