         The opposition will do the courtesy of granting leave, but it is customary for the minister who was asked the question to answer the question, not to palm it off to someone else.

          I seek indulgence on the point that Senator Wong has made. I think if Senator Wong reflects on the question she will find that much of the question related to the agriculture portfolio, which I do not handle in the chamber. Indeed, if Senator Wong would prefer, we can wait and I'll come back at another time and provide the information that Senator Ruston is offering to provide to the chamber at this point in time. If Senator Wong wants to be hung up on that process, that is fine. Senator Ruston, who directly handles these matters in a ministerial sense in a number of ways, has brought information as additional information to the chamber.

           On the point of order, I'm not being hung up; it's about ministerial accountability. She is not the minister who represents the member of the executive who was asked the question in this chamber. On this occasion, we will grant leave, but I would make it clear that it is the opposition's view that the government decides who represents whom. We will ask the ministers representing the relevant portfolio and we would expect any additions to answers to be given by that minister.

            Thank you, Senator Wong. There is a question before the Senate. Senator Ruston asked if leave is granted. Is leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted.

            <p>
             In response to questions asked yesterday by Senator Hanson in relation to the use of foreign fishing vessels in Australian waters, I would like to provide the following additional information to that provided by Senator Birmingham.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have been advised, after discussions with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Fisheries_Management_Authority" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Fisheries Management Authority
             </a>
             , that from time to time it responds to requests for information regarding bringing in boats from overseas to fish in the Australian Fishing Zone. However, I can confirm to the chamber that neither the Australian government nor the Australian Fisheries Management Authority is engaged in any discussions with the Chinese government or any other government in relation to either the acquisition of foreign fishing licences or the deeming of vessels as Australian fishing vessels so as to operate in the Australian Fishing Zone.
            </p>
            <p>
             I have further been advised by
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFMA" rel="nofollow">
              AFMA
             </a>
             that no approvals are in place for any foreign vessels fishing to operate in Commonwealth waters under deeming provisions. If there has been any deceit, it has been the very dishonest campaign prosecuted in recent weeks by environmental campaigners, such as
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Save_Our_Marine_Life" rel="nofollow">
              Save Our Marine Life
             </a>
             , to deliberately mislead the Australian people with regard to foreign fishing fleets and the proposed network of Australian marine parks. Without any evidence, and contrary to the facts, it has been claimed that Australian waters, including those proposed for marine parks, are about to be flooded with cheap, distant water fishing fleets. I, absolutely and outrightly, reject these ridiculous claims and call them out for what they are: unsubstantiated scaremongering.
            </p>
            <p>
             The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge Australia's global reputation as a world leader in fisheries management, especially in terms of ecological and environmental perspectives, which has resulted in no fishery solely managed by the Commonwealth being overfished for the fourth consecutive year this year. The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge that Australia's fisheries management regime ensures that the total allowable catches for all fish stocks are set at ecologically sustainable levels. The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge that any vessel operating in Australian waters must follow Commonwealth fisheries rules and regulations. There are absolutely no exemptions to this requirement whatsoever.
            </p>
            <p>
             The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge that any fishing vessel, either foreign or Australian, cannot fish in declared no-take marine-protected areas or green zones. The campaign deliberately fails to reference the extremely strict requirements the Australian government imposes on such vessels, should they ever be approved to fish in Australian waters, which are outlined in the Australian Fisheries Management Act 1991.
            </p>
            <p>
             The campaign deliberately fails to acknowledge that the new marine parks will strengthen conservation outcomes, support sustainable fishing, attract more tourism, provide cultural, recreational and economic benefits for coastal communities and deliver investment certainty for the fishing businesses. The coalition government's management of marine parks will restore a balanced approach and allow a variety of uses for our shared marine resources. The coalition will safeguard not only our marine ecosystems but also the interests of current and future generations of Australian people, by striking the right balance between economic, social and environmental objectives, consistent with the aspirations of the entire Australian community. Under this coalition government, Australians can be confident that we will have both world-class, best-practice marine park networks and the world's best fisheries management.
