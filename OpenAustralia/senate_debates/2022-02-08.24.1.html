        I rise today to speak on the cashless debit card, as I have many times in this place. But today I rise with an update for the Senateâ€”one that I'm particularly proud of and one that I've been working on personally. Last week I joined my friend from the other place the member for

        , in the Goldfields to open up the first cashless debit card employment support hub. We on this side of the chamber believe in a strong welfare system that supports people into work. The cashless debit card, much maligned by those opposite, is part of this system.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
         CDC
        </a>
        is proving to be a more responsible delivery of welfare payments, it's not the destination. Economic independence through employment is the goal. Employment won't change everything, but without it nothing will change. To this end the CDC is being further supported in the Goldfields by a network of hubs, designed to help those who need specialist assistance to break into the workforce. Whether this is something as simple as obtaining a driver's licence, sourcing necessary

        or accessing the services of an interpreter to better understand the prerequisite requirements, these services and this assistance will be available. Extra funding has also been committed to alcohol and drug rehabilitation services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another key role of the hubs is to engage with employers in the region to source employment opportunities. Employers are screaming out for suitably trained and capable employees. Employers are eager to work with the hubs to make sure they understand their requirements and to assist them in sourcing quality candidates and supporting them on the job. The Morrison government has made just under $2.4 million available for these services. I was very pleased to lead the consultation that has seen these services delivered. I thank the local governments across these areas, and I thank them for their support in stepping up to the plate.
