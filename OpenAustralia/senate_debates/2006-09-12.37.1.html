        My question is to Senator Abetz, the minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Again I refer the minister to the government’s broken promise to deliver a mandatory code of contact for the horticultural industry. Can the minister confirm that the then Deputy Prime Minister committed on 1 October 2004 that ‘a re-elected coalition government will impose a mandatory code of contact on the horticultural industry’? Hasn’t the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources now walked away from that commitment, with his statement on ABC radio this morning that: ‘The government’s understanding as part of the 2004 election commitments was that we would introduce a voluntary code of conduct’? Why has the government broken its promise to protect Australia’s 20,000 fruit and vegetable growers?

         As I understand it, the ‘code of contact’ is that there be absolutely no physical contact between the honourable senator and me. I think that what she is referring to is a ‘code of conduct’. If that is what she is referring to, I am more than happy to oblige the honourable senator. Having said that, can I say that Senator Polley is one of the senators that my office does enjoy having contact with from time to time as we seek to serve the people of Tasmania.

         government is committed to improving the day-to-day relationships between fruit and vegetable growers and wholesalers by providing greater certainty and clarity for transactions. It remains clear that there need to be minimum terms of trade that are transparent and enforceable in law. Growers have the right to know whether the wholesaler is acting as an agent or a merchant prior to the sale. Other aspects that are being worked on as part of this process include an effective dispute resolution mechanism and the provision of clear market signals on price.

           I would have thought that those opposite would be interested in getting an answer. I know that Senator Polley is genuinely interested; those around her do not seem to be. As announced only two days ago—

             As I was saying, as announced only two days ago on 10 September, meetings of fruit and vegetable grower and wholesale representatives will be convened to develop an enforceable code of practice for the industry if that is deemed necessary. The key aim is to develop a code enforceable through law that will provide growers with a transparency of contract that many currently do not have. As I indicated, I think it was earlier this week or late last week, we as a government are a consultative government and we are seeking to work our way through this issue to ensure the appropriate protection to all the sectors.

              right when it condemns the government for trying to weasel out of its promise to deliver a mandatory code of conduct to help produce growers? Why is the government more interested in trying to deflect scrutiny of its broken promises to Australia’s 20,000 fruit and vegetable growers by promising another talkfest than in actually delivering on a clear election commitment?

               I for one, and I get criticised for this from time to time, am always interested in listening to Senator Polley and what she has to say. In relation to the scrutiny that the honourable senator refers to, we as a government made a commitment to the horticultural sector and we are working through the issues to ensure that we can deliver for them as we had indicated. As I have said previously in relation to this matter, we want to get this right—and as a result we will be consulting continuously to ensure that we do get it right.
