         I do not normally speak on third reading debates, but there are a couple of points that I seek to make. Firstly, the opposition chose not to divide on the amendment it moved in the committee stage on the basis that this is a day on which I think some people are absent. In addition to that, of course, we are very clear what the outcome of the vote would be. But I place on the record that the opposition remain committed to those amendments and believe that they were the appropriate amendments. We reserve the right to be critical of the government for not accepting them.

         In relation to the conduct of the debate, I think it is notable that this legislation establishes a body which will deal for the first time with marketing and promotion for the timber industry. We welcome that. I have noted both in the committee inquiry and in dealing with this legislation that representatives of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         have chosen to take no issue with those matters. I therefore think we can take it that they are entirely uncontroversial. We will treat them as such and we will be quite happy to continue our support for the marketing and promotion of this industry on the basis that it is an industry with important contributions to make in relation to a sustainable forest industry, environmental issues, carbon sequestration, the provision of sustainable building products and a range of other issues which deserve the attention of the Australian public brought to it by a responsible marketing and promotional organisation such as the one which this legislation promotes.
