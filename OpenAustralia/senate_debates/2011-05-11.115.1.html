           The coal-seam gas proposals in Australia, like those in the United States, Russia and elsewhere around the world, are simply mind-bending. There is a proposal for 40,000 gas wells to be sunk on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
            Darling Downs
           </a>
           , one of the world's premier food lands, alone. There are now proposals for 550 such gas wells in the Pilliga Scrub woodland near Narrabri in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           . We know that there is a proposal for a gas well at Petersham, right in the heart of metropolitan Sydney, and there are other proposals breaking out all over Australia. The concern about this is that not only would these proposals compromise some of the best farm and food producing lands in the country but they offer a direct threat to the groundwater systems, because they involve going through the groundwater systems into coal seams underneath and extracting methane under various measures—the worst of which is fracking, which involves the use of carcinogenic chemicals which have caused pandemonium in the United States. One only has to read the

           of this last weekend to see the extreme concern that is being expressed in Pennsylvania, for one. I am amazed that the big parties, and in particular the National Party, have voted against an inquiry into coal-seam gas in this country. I am amazed that there could be such a deliberate subservience to these corporations that the Senate has denied the opportunity for there to be a proper inquiry.

              First of all I would like to set the record straight. The National Party did not vote against that; we abstained from that vote and were not present for it. Secondly, I would like to clearly state for the record what is currently on the Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee website:

             <p class="italic">
              will examine:

             </ul>
             <p>
              We currently have an inquiry afoot into precisely this issue and we cannot see the point of having two inquiries into the same thing except to give this man beside me a wedge. That is what that was about—to create a wedge.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would suggest to you, Senator Brown, that before you get your facts wrong saying who voted for something and who did not vote to something, before you get the facts wrong about whether there is actually an inquiry there, you should check. If you had checked the website you would have seen that we are right at the forefront of trying to get into this issue and make sure we protect the interests and the property rights of landholders throughout the basin to make sure that they get a fair deal. So I ask you, Senator Brown, to retract your statement that you just made that the National Party voted against that.

                   The government indicated that it did not support the motion although it does appreciate—and I can say this in a more measured way than perhaps Senator Joyce—the public concerns about this issue, which is primarily regulated by the states. The government notes that it has already made a commitment to the member for New England, who chairs the Regional Australia Committee, to investigate coal-seam gas mining. In this capacity the Commonwealth will support that inquiry which will include some of the relevant matters that Senator Brown's motion refers to.

                   The government also notes that at present the

                   </a>
                   government is formally developing a strategy to investigate many of the areas raised in Senator Brown's notice of motion, and pending the conclusion of this review the regulatory environment is uncertain in New South Wales, making an inquiry at this time premature in our view. I do note the fracture that is developing between the National Party and the Liberal Party on this issue, though.

                        I wish to say in my statement that this is a very controversial issue. It was raised prior to the state election in
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                         New South Wales
                        </a>
                        of 26 March. The then shadow minister handling this portfolio on this issue was the Hon.
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Gay" rel="nofollow">
                         Duncan Gay
                        </a>
                        , now Minister for Roads and Ports. Mr Gay put his coalition policy forward, which was endorsed by the Greens in the New South Wales parliament, prior to the election.
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                         The Greens
                        </a>
                        supported the coalition and the National Party-led policy that the states are responsible on this very issue about exploration and mining rights. It was a very protective way the National Party put that policy forward, supported by the Greens in the New South Wales parliament. We have an inquiry into this under the Rural Affairs and
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Committee" rel="nofollow">
                         Transport Committee
                        </a>
                        . Senator Brown would probably like to have two to waste more taxpayers' money, because he does not understand budgets. We see that as a waste of money. The issue is being handled by the Rural Affairs and Transport Committee led by Senator Heffernan as chair. The inquiry will be carried out. We know how important it is to protect these areas, especially the underground water in these very prime agricultural areas. We support the inquiry totally. There is one running now. I have told you, Mr Deputy President, about the National Party in the New South Wales parliament in conjunction with our coalition partners led by Premier Barry O'Farrell and the policy announced prior to the election that was supported by the Greens in the New South Wales parliament. This is simply a political wedge by Senator Brown, trying to cause trouble. We support the inquiry and we will go with the inquiry that is already established.
