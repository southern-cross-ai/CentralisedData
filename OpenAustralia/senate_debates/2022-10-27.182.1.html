        My question is also to the Minister for Women and the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Gallagher. I note you just boasted in a previous answer about your support for women. But during the election, Labor matched the coalition's commitment to subsidise the cost of assisted reproductive technology services for aspiring parents diagnosed with cancer or risk passing on a genetic condition yet this commitment has been shelved in the budget to achieve a savings benefit. Has the Albanese government broken its promise to aspiring parents in need of

         Not at all. I would say the budget also includes almost $70 million, from memory, for women's health initiatives. The assistant minister, Minister Kearney, is leading the work on a women's health strategy. She's been doing a lot of work and consulting with various stakeholder groups. But this budget is a proud budget in terms of the investments in health, in hospitals, in primary care, in—

          I rise on a point of order. The question was specifically around a particular budget measure that is missing from the budget in relation to

           IVF
          </a>

           Thank you, Senator Ruston. I don't need the commentary. I do believe the minister is being relevant. She has been talking about women's health and, if not, I will direct her to the question. Minister Gallagher.

            I think it was about our commitment. I answered the question right at the front when I said, no, I didn't agree with the proposition that was being put by Senator Askew. I went on to explain the investments we're making in women's health and the work that is being done to put together a strategy around it, because we take this seriously. We understand that women's reproductive health is key to women's health overall and that obviously has flow-on impacts into our economy and our community; that is the point I'm making. I'm also making the point that we have a very positive investment in health. In dealing with some of the challenges, again—surprise, surprise—we were left by a former government that had spent nine years trying to dismantle Medicare and not investing in health.

                    may, President, before your ruling: I'd submit that if Senator Ruston had been paying attention the minister had actually responded directly to that point, the specific policy point, in her first few sentences.

                      During the election, Labor matched the coalition's commitment to fund 20 new Gidget Foundation Australia perinatal mental health and wellbeing services in every state and territory, yet the budget only provides for 12 services across Australia. Has the Albanese government broken its promise to new mothers in need of mental health and wellbeing support as well?

                        Order! I'm waiting for quiet. Senator Askew has asked a first supplementary, which the minister is endeavouring to answer. You may not like her answer, but at this point she is still being relevant. It is not helpful for any of you to be parroting other numbers across the chamber. If you have a question, speak to your side about getting on the list. I'm requiring the minister to answer the question that is for her, and that is the question from Senator Askew.

                            I'm not about to accept a lecture from those opposite about women and services for women. If you look in this budget, it is a good budget for women. If you read budget paper 2, page 143, you will see that we have delivered on the commitments we've made. Indeed—surprise, surprise!—we are going to also do some work on evaluation of initiatives to make sure they are delivering the support to the communities that those programs are intended for, and that is good, responsible budgeting. That is exactly the approach I will take as finance minister. We deliver on things. We also evaluate to make sure they are delivering the support and the programs that are intended by those measures.
