         I thank Senator Smith for that very important question. The Perth Freight Link project is a very important project not only for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         ; it is a project of national significance. It will help us drive stronger growth and stronger job creation by getting our products to market more efficiently and at a lower cost, more safely and, of course, with less disruption to local communities along the transport routes to Fremantle port. That is why the Australian government have committed nearly a billion dollars as part of this $1.6 billion investment. It finally creates a long overdue, world-class freight link between the strategic industrial areas of Perth and Fremantle port. I know it is enthusiastically supported by Senator Ludlam, who I see is nodding. It provides travel time savings of almost 10 minutes from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwinana_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
          Kwinana Freeway
         </a>
         to Fremantle port and delivers economic benefits of more than $3.9 billion to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australian
         </a>
         economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Why is this project so important and why does it contribute to growth and jobs? Because Australia is a trading nation. Western Australia is a trading state with about 10 per cent of the population and it contributes 47 per cent of Australia's merchandise exports. Of course Fremantle port is a critical part of the trading infrastructure of Western Australia and Australia. But the challenge that we have is that, with a growing population and a growing volume of freight being taken from the industrial areas around Perth and the north of Perth to Fremantle port, more and more of that traffic is utilising local arterial roads that are not designed for that purpose. We need to ensure that we get our produce to port and to markets in the most efficient, safest, least-costly way that causes the least amount of disruption to communities across Western Australia.

           As I have indicated, with increases in population and significant increases in the volume of freight being taken across the Perth metropolitan area to Fremantle, we are confronted in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           —and in other metropolitan places around Australia—with increasing levels of congestion. These increased levels act as a handbrake on economic growth. That is why we need to make this significant investment in productivity-enhancing economic infrastructure as part of our plan for stronger growth and more jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is why the Australian government is making a record investment of more than $50 billion in productivity-enhancing infrastructure across Australia, building the roads of the 21st century. Providing a more efficient freight route to the Fremantle port has been talked about for decades, but nobody has delivered. This government, working with the Barnett government, is delivering.
