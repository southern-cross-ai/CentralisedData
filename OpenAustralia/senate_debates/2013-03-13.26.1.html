        , Senator Conroy, and I refer to his proposed draconian media laws outlined yesterday. Has it ever occurred to the minister that the bad media that his government sometimes receives may not be due to unfair media coverage but rather due to the fact that the government is neither competent nor trustworthy? Does the minister really believe that a government that says one thing before an election and does another thing afterwards, that increases the cost of living, that cannot control its spending, that racks up record debt, that wrecks border security and that every day reveals its festering internal hatreds and bitterness deserves to receive good press? Is this not just one last desperate throw of the dice by a government that knows its only hope of survival is to intimidate and stifle the media?

         Could I thank Senator Abetz for his question and reject the entire premise of his question. The responses that we have seen in yesterday's and today's media could only be described, even with prediction, as hysterical. If we had announced nationalising the media, it could not have been more hysterical. All the package that we have put forward is about is promoting principles of privacy, fairness—

           The package that we are putting forward is about promoting the principles of privacy, fairness, accuracy and diversity. In 2007 in this chamber, those opposite voted to undermine and overturn parts of the cross-media laws. They have allowed a situation where a further concentration of diversity could happen, in a market that is one of the most concentrated in the world. We have argued for five-plus years that we support a public interest test on media mergers. Those opposite have always rejected that. Those opposite believe: 'Just leave it to the competition policy. Let's pretend that the lifeblood of democracy, diversity of opinion, is just another widget in the marketplace.' That is what those opposite want you to believe. That is what those opposite want you to accept as a position. At no time have this government threatened the media or intimidated the media. We reject that.

            decision, worked out on the back of an envelope and done on the run, without a proper cabinet submission or input? Does the minister really believe that this kind of decision making is a proper way to run the Australian government? Why does his unsighted legislation need to be bullied and guillotined through the parliament in less than two weeks?

                   You can read in the newspapers everything you need to read about the caucus. We will continue to argue to protect diversity in this country. The lap-dogs over there are happy to allow for voices to be lost. The lifeblood of democracy is at stake here. This is all about diversity, all about protecting diversity.
