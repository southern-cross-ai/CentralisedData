        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Faulkner. Can the minister advise the Senate on the position of the Australian government regarding any proposed travel by Australians to Indonesia at this present time?

         I certainly acknowledge Senator Forshaw’s interest in and concern about this matter—which I am sure is shared by all senators. I can inform the Senate that the

         ’s travel advisory for Indonesia was reissued on 8 November and again on 9 November this year. The travel advice is underpinned by up-to-date, recent and professional assessments. It is not issued on the basis of commercial or travel arrangements that Australians have entered into.
        </p>
        <p>
         The travel advice for Indonesia remains at the level of ‘reconsider your need to travel’. It has been at this level for some considerable period due to the high threat of terrorist activity or terrorist attack in Indonesia. The travel advice notes the execution of the three Bali bombers and that it could prompt a strong reaction from their supporters, such as demonstrations, acts of violence and reprisal attacks. These attacks could take place at any time, anywhere, including places frequented by foreigners. Previous terrorist attacks against Westerners in Bali and Jakarta indicate that these areas are priority targets.
        </p>
        <p>
         The travel advice notes we continue to receive credible information that terrorists could be planning attacks in Indonesia and that Bali is an attractive place for such attacks or for terrorists to contemplate such attacks. The travel advice urges Australians to exercise great care and avoid locations that have a low level of protective security and where previous attacks have occurred. These would be locations such as beaches, bars, shopping malls and other places where people, particularly young Australians, could congregate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The travel advice notes that we are aware that many young Australian school graduates may be travelling to Bali in mid- to late November and early December, and we urge these young Australians and their parents, like other Australians, to exercise heightened caution at this time. Ultimately, of course, it is up to individual Australians to decide whether or not to travel to Indonesia, but I urge, and the government urges, all Australians to consider and assess carefully the information that is contained in the travel advisory.
        </p>
        <p>
         We would strongly urge Australians intending to travel to register their contact details with the Australian government on the smartraveller website, www.smartraveller.gov.au. This is critically important so that if any emergency does arise those travellers can be contacted.
