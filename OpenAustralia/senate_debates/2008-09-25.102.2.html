        The inquiry identified a need to improve data available for identifying the incidence of disease.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>

       <p class="italic">
        The Committee’s examination of the adequacy and timeliness of regulation governing workplace exposures considered that improvements are needed in the introduction of changes to the declared standards and codes by all jurisdictions.

        The Committee report was tabled on 31 May 2006. The report makes 14 recommendations in total, eight of which are directed to the Australian Safety and Compensation Council (

         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports the majority of the findings of the Senate inquiry, however, it is noted that a number of the recommendations made by the Committee have been directed to bodies outside of the Australian Government. Where recommendations have been made to bodies outside of the Australian Government, the Australian Government will liaise with these bodies seeking their consideration of the recommendations made by the committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has committed to work cooperatively with state and territory governments to harmonise OHS legislation, and to replace the ASCC with a new, independent national body. Any reference to the ASCC in this brief should be read as a reference to it or its successor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The majority of the Committee’s recommendations were made to the ASCC. The Australian Government considers that these recommendations are broadly consistent with the role of the ASCC and to its successor in coordinating national approaches to OHS and workers’ compensation. The Australian Government will refer the recommendations to the ASCC, however, in some instances referral to, or cooperation with, other relevant groups such as Heads of Workplace Safety Authorities, is considered a more appropriate course of action.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government’s response to the specific recommendations in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Report" rel="nofollow">
         Report
        </a>
        is set out below.

         Recommendation 1
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.59 That the Australian Safety and Compensation Council review the National Data Action Plan to ensure that reliable data on disease related to exposure to toxic dust is readily available.

         Response:
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports the recommendation to make data on disease, including those related to exposure to toxic dust, readily available.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The National Data Action Plan, which was reviewed in 2004, includes the analysis and dissemination of information about occupational disease from a variety of sources. The Office of the ASCC has data that can provide information on disease related to toxic dust. These data include workers’ compensation data, hospital separations data and the National Cancer Statistics Clearing House. Data from these sources are published in Occupational Disease Indicators.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The ASCC has developed a strategy for the surveillance of workplace hazards, currently obtaining national data on workplace exposures, including toxic dust. These data are providing the evidence base to inform future efforts to control occupational exposures and thus improve the prevention of disease related to occupational exposure to toxic dusts. The first National Hazard
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure" rel="nofollow">
         Exposure
        </a>
        Worker Survey has now been completed and has collected self reported data on hazard exposures, including toxic dusts and information on the controls used in Australian workplaces. It is expected this survey will be repeated every two years. A supplementary detailed national survey specifically collecting data on hazardous substance exposures in the workplace is expected to be undertaken in 2008/2009. For hazards where the accurate self reporting of workplace exposures is difficult e.g. toxic dusts, research projects collecting measurements of actual exposures to particular hazards are also being undertaken. Over time these and other data sources will provide information on the levels of exposure to workplace hazards in Australia and the adequacy of our national prevention activities. This data will be used by the ASCC and others to inform the development of national priorities, activities and related OHS guidance material.

         Recommendation 2
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3.60 That the Australian Safety and Compensation Council extend the Surveillance of Australian Work-Based Respiratory Events (

         Response:

       <p class="italic">
        SABRE is a voluntary scheme for collecting data on work-related lung disease. Physicians report to SABRE on cases of occupational respiratory disease, with the patient’s consent. SABRE is not an Australian Government funded program. The Victorian /Tasmanian SABRE program is funded by the Australian Lung Foundation and the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As mentioned in the response to Recommendation 1, the ASCC has developed a strategy for the surveillance of hazard exposures, that will obtain reliable data on those agents to which workers are exposed. These data will inform efforts to control occupational exposures and thus improve the prevention of disease related to occupational exposure to toxic dusts.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Increased awareness among the medical profession of the health effects of exposure to toxic dust could increase participation in voluntary reporting programs such as SABRE.

        As mentioned in the response to Recommendations 1 and 2, the ASCC is currently concentrating efforts on supporting effective prevention of exposure to disease causing agents.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports the recommendation to consider mechanisms to improve health surveillance of employees and will ask the ASCC and HWSA to consider this recommendation in terms of the work currently being undertaken by the ASCC for a national approach to the surveillance of exposure to hazards.
