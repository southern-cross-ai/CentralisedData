        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck. Dementia is one of this country's greatest health challenges, and it touches almost all families in one way or another. Can the minister update the Senate on the way that the Morrison government is helping and supporting Australians who are living with dementia and who are dealing with it in their families?

        <p>
         Thank you for the question, Senator Stoker. Dementia is the second-leading cause of death in Australia. It's a significant issue for many families, as Senator Stoker has just said. We are delivering on commitments that we've made to the Australian community to better support people living with dementia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2019-20 the government will provide in excess of $68 million for dementia-specific support and training programs that will benefit people living with dementia, their carers and service providers. This includes $17.41 million for the Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service, $16.6 million for the severe behaviour response teams, $11.59 million for the dementia training support program, $8.32 million for the Specialist Dementia Care Program, $13.9 million for the National Dementia Support Program and $1.2 million for dementia-friendly communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         The $68 million also includes new funding of $10 million from 2019-20 to 2020-21 to increase dementia training and support for aged care workers and health sector staff, as announced by the government in November last year. This investment will deliver additional face-to-face and teleconference interventions to address the behavioural symptoms of dementia, as well as training for health and aged care providers through the expansion of the Dementia Behaviour Management Advisory Service, the severe dementia response teams, and training programs. At full rollout, the Australian government will provide $70 million per year for the specialist dementia care program.

           <p>
            This is a very important question. At the last Dementia Australia event held in the parliament with the support of Senator Polley as one of the co-chairs, we heard the voices of a number of people with dementia and the expression of their desire to see a cure for dementia. When we came to government in 2013, we made a significant investment of $200 million towards dementia research. Subsequently, we made another investment of $185 million over 10 years through the Dementia, Ageing and Aged Care Mission, funded from the Medical Research Future Fund. As we all understand, dementia is a significant issue for Australians, and we're determined to do what we can to assist with finding a cure.

               As I indicated to the chamber yesterday, when we came to government investment into the aged-care system was about $13.3 billion. This year it will be a record $21.4 billion. But what we see from the other side is that there's been absolutely no commitment to investment in aged care, zero investment in home-care packages in the last election campaign, zero investment in workforce and, unfortunately, zero investment in improving capacity in the mainstream residential aged-care sector. What they did promise was $387 billion in additional taxes on the Australian economy. But of that $387 billion in additional taxes, they could not find one cent—not one cent—for home-care packages or mainstream aged care.
