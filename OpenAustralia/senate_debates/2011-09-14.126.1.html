        As I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, the Greens have a number of amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011. While we are supportive in principle, as I outlined in my speech, we think improvements can be made to the bill—and improvements not only to the bill but also that offer better protection for the environment. Given the extra enviro­nmental responsibility that NOPSEMA is going to have, we believe it is important that there be environmental expertise on this new regulator. One of my amendments is about increasing the membership of NOPSEMA, and others go to who is the environmental decision maker in terms of making decisions under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC
        </a>
        Act. Some time ago I outlined some concerns about that. I will briefly go into those. Hopefully I will not hold up the chamber too long, but I do want some explanations from the government and some further detail about a couple of issues. I now move amendment (2) on sheet 7119:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Schedule 2, page 83 (after line 21), after item 427, insert:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        427A Paragraph 656(1)(b)
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Omit "4 or 6", substitute "at least 5, and not more than 7,".
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment increases the membership of the NOPSEMA board to make sure there is somebody there with environmental exper­tise. As I said, I understand that you do not represent organisations on boards anymore, but the Greens believe that we do need this expertise in the environment on the NOPSEMA board. I commend the amendment to the chamber.

         The government will be supporting the amendment to increase the number of NOPSEMA board members to allow environmental expertise to be added to the board. The government understands the arguments from the Greens in this matter. We do think it is a reasonable approach so we are supportive of the amendment.

          These amendments add new provisions to enable the government to choose not to grant licences to companies where there are significant question marks over their ability to manage oilfields when they have caused significant accidents, for example like the Montara incident. This was an issue I raised during the course of the inquiry into
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTT" rel="nofollow">
           PTT
          </a>
          EP, where PTTEP were allowed to acquire leases and titles when they were being investigated for what was a very serious incident. This occurred with the granting authorities knowing full well, from the company's own submissions to the inquiry and from the transcript of the inquiry, that there were serious concerns about PTTEP's operations.
         </p>
         <p>
          Specifically the amendments insert a new section, 478(2A), providing that the Titles Administrator must not approve the transfer of a title where the transferee is the subject of an inquiry being conducted under part 9.10A. They also insert a new section 780AA, specifically allowing the minister to suspend consideration of applications under the act while an entity is being similarly investigated. It is important to note that these provisions are triggered when an entity is under investigation under the commission of inquiry provisions of part 9.10A. This requires a 'significant incident', which we believe is an appropriately high threshold.
         </p>
         <p>
          These provisions deal with the fact that companies, despite the fact that they may have caused a significant incident, can still be granted titles. I understand there were issues under PTTEP where in some instances the titles were requiring transfers—rather than being granted, the licences were being transferred. We have sought to deal with that through these amendments. This is to ensure that we treat appropriately companies who have caused serious incidents, or it looks like they have caused serious incidents to the point where for example there is a comm­ission of inquiry to look into it. We still have this farcical situation in this country where these companies can acquire further licences.
         </p>
         <p>
          We believe these are sensible amend­ments. They protect our environment—and this is about protecting our environment. That is what this new regulator is supposed to be doing—managing the sector and ensur­ing environmental management. To us, this is common sense. We do not give someone we think has caused a serious incident further licences when we do not know their capacity to safely manage their operations. We believe this significantly improves the regulation of the industry and I commend the amendments to the chamber.

           The government will not be supporting amendments (1) and (3). We have a significant policy concern with the proposed amendments relating to entities subject to a commission of inquiry. We believe there are legal problems with the way the amendments will work in practice. It was a deliberate policy decision when providing for commissions of inquiry into significant offshore incidents that they focus on causes of adverse events and how to prevent similar events happening in the future, not to allocate blame to particular companies. This is for the courts and other legal processes to determine. Therefore, we believe your pro­posals to prohibit the Titles Administrator from approving transfers involving an entity subject to a commission of inquiry, and provide for formal decisions by the minister to suspend applications from entities subject to a commission of inquiry, would under­mine the no-blame nature of the inquiry. I also note that the minister can already effectively suspend applications through existing operational and administrative means, as was done during the Montara inquiry. Similarly the Titles Administrator could refrain from approving a transfer.
          </p>
          <p>
           It should also be noted that entities are not the subject of the commissions of inquiry; incidents are the subject of the inquiries. So the proposed amendments fail to make clear what relationship between an incident and a particular company would justify making a decision against the company. The causes of the incidents can be complex and the minister would have to prejudge issues before the facts had been established by the inquiry. It is also unclear how references to an entity would work, given that applications are usually made by a group of companies.
          </p>
          <p>
           With respect to the amendment relating to declarations under the Environment Protect­ion and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Productivity Commission
           </a>

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
           </a>
           1999 both recommended streamlining environmental approval processes under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC
           </a>
           Act and the offshore petroleum legislation. Therefore the government cannot agree to an amend­ment that would preclude the possibility of streamlining environmental approvals pro­cesses. Having said that, the government accepts unequivocally that decisions on matt­ers that have been determined to be matters of national environmental significance that fall within the scope of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC Act
           </a>
           must be made by the minister responsible for the administration of that act. The government does however contemplate NOPSEMA pro­viding the EPBC Act minister advice on such matters where relevant to offshore petroleum operations regulated by NOPSEMA. The weight which that minister attaches to such advice will depend upon the rigor with which NOPSEMA prepares such advice and the respect NOPSEMA has earned with the EPBC Act minister's department as a result of previous advice tendered in relation to such matters.
          </p>
          <p>
           In regard to notification of vacated areas, as part of its consideration of offshore marine parks policy, the government has been giving preliminary consideration to the possibility that the area defined by a petroleum title immediately adjacent to a marine protected area that is surrendered or terminated be reassessed for possible inclu­sion in that protected area. This assessment has made it clear that such a policy would not be free from substantial difficulties and complexity and should not be introduced without detailed consultation with stakehold­ers. While the government will not support this amendment at this time, it will continue to give consideration to the policy behind it. For those reasons, the government does not support the amendments.

             The minister has gone to some of the issues I was going to subsequently ask some questions about. I did not actually go into those and I apologise. Amendment (3) covers a multi­tude of changes, which I was going to handle sequentially. If the minister will bear with me, I do want to ask some questions about each of the changes.

             Can we go back to the issue around transferability of titles and the comment the minister made about

              My advice is that it was actually companies that were transferred, rather than an ownership change. Companies were transferred as distinct from—and it is an important distinction—the ownership being transferred.

                Yes, the ownership of the company changed from that which had existed—I am not sure who the ownership was with at that time; I do not recollect—to another totally new owner, a different owner. That was the change that occurred. The registered company, the proprietor, was still the same. It was the overall ownership of the company that changed.

                <p>
                 Thank you for that clarification; I understand where you are coming from now. The minister can expect some further questions on notice, because that ownership had changed about nine months or so prior to the Montara incident and
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTT" rel="nofollow">
                  PTT
                 </a>
                 EP, I understood, were subsequently involved in a number of other licence transfers. But I may put those questions on notice.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The point here is that, whether it is PTT or not, there is potential under the act at the moment for companies which have been involved in an incident to apply for licences. I understand the distinction that the minister was making between the incident and the company, but in this particular incident there were pretty clear reasons for concern about the operations of this and associated comp­anies—certainly from the evidence that was coming out in the commission of inquiry—enough, I would have thought, to make the government concerned about granting licences to those same parties until the matter was cleared up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Hopefully this sort of incident will never happen again in this country, but you can never say never. Is the minister saying that he believes there is already enough power under the act, if the minister chooses to use it, to suspend somebody's application or not grant somebody an application because they have been involved in a previous incident or in an ongoing incident that is yet to be resolved?

                  Where there is a change of ownership—that is the actual ownership of the entity, the company—yes, the minister does have the power. However, the minister cannot prejudge, as I said in my earlier remarks, the outcome of an inquiry or some other equivalent judicial process and make a decision to exercise that power prior to the outcome and conclusion of those processes.

                     I thank you for that clarification. I will ask just one more question on this area, then I promise I will move on. Under the current provisions of the act, if an incident were sufficiently significant—and I would maintain that Montara was—and if there were clear liability with a company or that company had clearly caused the accident, is there power for the minister to say, prior to a commission of inquiry, 'No, we will not grant that lease because of the seriousness and significance of the issues involved in this incident'? That power would not, of course, be as clear as we were trying to make it with this amendment, but is it there under the current act?

                       I thank the minister for his answer. I will now move on to items 3 and 4 under amendment (3), which deal with the issues around the prohibition of decisions and actions under the Offshore Petroleum Act from being accredited under the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
                        Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
                       </a>
                       . As I said in the second reading debate, we are very concerned that we do not want to see the environment minister or the environment department being sidelined during the assess­ment of the environmental implications of offshore oil and gas operations.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       While I acknowledge that the amendments to the regulatory regime proposed by the government do not themselves address the role of the environment minister or say that NOPSEMA will take that role over, we are deeply concerned to ensure that there is no potential for the resources minister, at any time, to accredit NOPSEMA for this process under the act. In other words, what we are trying to do is ensure that the role of the environment minister and environment dep­artment is always paramount in terms of environmental assessment and that the decision-making power is not delegated to NOPSEMA. The minister has said that the government are not going to support our amendments, so my question to the govern­ment is: can I have their guarantee that this government—I appreciate that you cannot bind future governments, which is our concern—will not seek to make NOPSEMA a delegated or accredited authority under the

                           I will go to item 7, which requires the Titles Administrator to notify the environ­ment minister when the titles have been vacated. This would allow the environment minister to easily know of and consider marine areas for further protection when it is clear that the areas are not of interest to resource companies. Australia is embark­ing—and I touched on this in a speech I gave in this place yesterday—on what I hope is a rigorous exercise to put in place a system of marine protected areas around this country. Again in this place yesterday we heard of the values of the marine environment and we heard of the need for marine protection. We understand of course, and continue to express our concern about, resource exploitation overriding the need for marine protection, but where an area has been vacated by the resource sector we think it is fair enough that the minister be notified that the area has become available, which would facilitate their consideration of whether that area should be included in a marine protected area of some form.

                            Again, I do not think I can add a great deal more to my previous comments. However, firstly I would empha­sise that this government—and, I have to acknowledge, the previous government under former Prime Minister Howard—believe conceptually that what you are suggesting should be considered and could be possible. However, there are some quite substantial difficulties and complexities around implementation. We as a government do not rule out this approach, but I am advised there is a good deal of work invol­ved to come to a robust design of such a regulatory and legislative, as I would assume it would require, framework. But, as I said, I emphasise that we believe conceptually it is a good suggestion. The former Howard government believed that as well. We will continue to consider the policy behind it and hopefully be able to implement it at some point in time.

While I realise there is a spark of willingness to start addressing this issue, can I press the minister and the government on what the next step is and how they consi­der it is going to occur. Are you putting in place a process to consider further amend­ments to the act or are you putting in place a process that will in fact carry out the intent of this amendment without actually amend­ing it? What are you physically doing to pursue what I think would be a significant step in furthering our marine protected area system?

                              Are there public servants today or this week working on this? No, there are not. Is it a consideration by the current minister, Minister Burke? Yes, it is, but there is nothing actively before him on the matter. As I said, conceptually there is agreement that this is the right approach. Work has been done in the past, obviously—thought, con­sideration, some musings in writing, I assume, as part of that—but it has not been concluded and I cannot advise you as to any time frames for when that work would be completed.

                                   Thank you. If you could take it on notice that would be much appreciated. I have a final question, which goes to the release of acreage. Under this new process, is it envisaged that there will now be a wider consultation process carried out when acreage is released?

                                    One of the difficulties here—and I am sure Senator Siewert will appreciate it—is that people have different perspectives of consultation and what is consultation, and perhaps a positive conclu­sion, depending on a particular individual organisation's perspective, is then consult­ation but a negative one is not. We argue that the views of all organisations are taken into account in terms of such consultation. We do not see that the current process needs to be changed in that regard.

                                     Is that a public consultation? I am talking about before those acreages are released. There is a process that is undertaken once the areas have been released. Is there a process of public consultation that occurs before the areas are released?

There is a public gazetting that takes place, so if an individual organisation wants to express a view at that point they would be able to do so. There would be consultations for organisations and individuals. Environ­ment departments obviously are interested as well as companies and other state depart­ments. Specifically I assume we are going to

                                           Thank you. If you could take that on notice, that would be appreciated. My final question on that issue is: if that consultation process is found to be not adequate, would NOPSEMA be able to recommend that a new process be established for consultation before new acre­age is released?
