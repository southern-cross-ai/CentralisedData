        I present the interim report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the use of flag-of-convenience shipping in Australia. I move:

       <p class="italic">
        That the time for presentation of the final report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee on the use of flag-of-convenience shipping be extended to 25 February 2016.

        Question agreed to.

        It was only in late November or early December last year that another piece of legislation went through this chamber. I do not want to talk about other pieces of legislation, but I think it is important to note to remind senators opposite of what they are trying to achieve in killing off an Australian industry. Quite a few months ago, last year, there was a very high profile
        <i>

        report or

        report on a certain ship that came into Australian waters. To cut a long story short, there were a number of mysterious deaths on that ship, and one person mysteriously went missing. Of course, we have called an inquiry, fully backed up in this chamber by crossbench senators and the Greens, to have a good look at flag-of-convenience shipping and what it means for Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be of no surprise to the Australian parliament that we have a serious issue not only with the exploitation of foreign workers but for Australian governments, particularly of the persuasion that we have on the other side. Even though they have changed captains from Mr Abbott to Mr Turnbull, they are obsessed with driving Australian jobs offshore—and I do not mean that as a pun. It is probably better to say that they are obsessed with killing off the Australian domestic shipping industry. We must not get confused by all the nonsense that goes out from senators like Senator Day and Senator Leyonhjelm, who want to look at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and at how we can make shipping cheaper. It is plainly doing away with the Australian jobs and replacing Australian seafarers with foreign ships and foreign crew.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am the first one to stand up here and say we absolutely have to do our best to make sure foreign workers are not exploited. But, sadly, there is no other reason why we would replace Australian ships and Australian seafarers with foreigners—it is all about driving down wages. I have sat in the Senate inquiry into this matter and listened to the mining industry and the cement industry shedding crocodile tears about 'how broke we are because we have to pay Australian wages'. It is an absolute nonsense! We should not let a certain amount of people off the hook here, apart from the Prime Minister and the minister for transport, who has gone missing in sticking up for Australian jobs, when we have seen the demise of Australian jobs on the

        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <i>
         MV Portland
        </i>
        has been a high-profile issue. I am going to hear tomorrow about flag-of-convenience shipping from former employees of the
        <i>
         MV Portland
        </i>
        who got marched off their ship at one or two o'clock in the morning by some officials who were doing the bidding of the employer, who wants to use this bulldust about temporary shipping permits—permits that could go for a year. It is not temporary; it is getting rid of Australian seafarers and Australian jobs and replacing them with lower paid foreign workers. It is absolutely disgusting. If it happened to Australian farmers, I expect you would not be able to move in Canberra, because there would be tractors piled up on the road when they came to run over every Liberal politician on their way up here to the parliament. But with seafarers it does not matter!
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an island nation. We have a proud history—I had better go back a step or two for the purpose of the senators on the Liberal-National side of the chamber. You might not know it, but we do not have bridges to Asia. We actually bring stuff in and take stuff out on ships. We have proudly had a strong shipping industry from day one. Yes, those opposite can sit there and giggle, because, goodness me, some poor big multinationals want to save $6 million to $8 million or something because they can do it cheaper with foreign workers. This is nothing short of a national disgrace. I do not know how those on that side can leave this place and walk back into their states with their chins held high, saying, 'You beauty—we have killed off more Australian jobs. Fantastic!'
       </p>
       <p>
        When I was sitting here earlier I saw a motion from Senator Leyonhjelm and Senator Day about some nonsense that we do not have enough productivity out of shipping. I could say the same about this parliament—we could do it a lot cheaper here. Why don't we get a heap of Filipinos in? Why don't we bring foreign workers in? They can run the parliament. I know all those listening out there probably think that is a good idea. But I also raise this question: what is next? Should we get rid of all Australia's truck drivers? Should we get rid of all Australia's retail workers? Should we just flood Australia's hotels and restaurants with foreign worker? Yes, they would do it cheaper. While we are at it, why don't we get rid of all Australia's builders, sparkies, plumbers, roof tilers? Why don't we just get rid of the whole lot? Why should we just pick on shipping? You know I have my tongue stuck that far in my cheek it is nearly popping out. I do not actually find it funny, but I am getting sick to death of that lot over there proudly hanging their hat on Australian jobs going.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian people need to understand that there is no stopping point here. Those opposite will do whatever they have to do. I will go one step further and say: you will do anything on that side to appease your major donors. Prove me wrong. Come out and tell me that is not the case: 'No, we're not getting rid of Australian jobs, because we're not looking after big donors to the Liberal Party.' It is nothing short of a crime. It is criminal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I throw this challenge out there. We wouldn't cop it if the farmers were being attacked, and nor should we: we should stick up for Australian jobs whether they be on farms or in trucks or on ships or whatever. This makes absolutely no sense to me. I tell you what: I cannot wait to hear tomorrow from those poor buggers who were dragged off their bunks in the middle of the night—it wasn't by the Gestapo, but something pretty similar—because the poor old aluminium mob, Alcoa, want to save a few bob. We could all save a few bob.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will be doing my best to expose the nonsense going on over on that side of the chamber while they all run off and want to talk about wonderful things—about how Australia can be great and fantastic and we can do all sorts of things and we can ship our commodities out of here and we can build things—as long as it is not Australians doing it. Not one of them would have the guts to come and challenge me to a public blue out there. They will hide behind every other thing: 'Oh, we've got to think about profits.' I can tell you now, as an ex-truck driver, as an ex-small business man, as a union organiser: the first thing I have always said is we need the employer to be viable—absolutely no argument. I know a lot of really good employers and I know a lot of good small family businesses who have put everything on the line, their hard work, and they deserve to get a return for their investment. There is no argument. But, as long as I am standing here and my feet are pointing to the ground, I will never ever say: 'At the expense of Australian jobs.' There is no way known that I could defend shipping Australian jobs offshore. It does not matter if it is in manufacturing or whatever it may be. And do you know what? If any member of this parliament thinks it is a great idea to see an Australian job go offshore, they should not even be in this building. They do not deserve to get the pay that we get paid to turn up here to defend Australian values and Australian jobs. In fact, they are charlatans, if that is the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        They may think it is very clever and very smart. But how would they feel if their kids' jobs went? Would it be a bit different if it were your kids? Would it be a bit different if it were your husband or your wife? I challenge you to that. If you can look me in the eye and say, 'I don't mind being unemployed because I've got to look after some foreign worker', well good; you have shot my argument to pieces. I reckon that not one of them on that side of the chamber, and not one of them on the other side in that green room over there, would like to see their job or their kids' jobs go. But what disgraceful parents they would be if they do want to see their kids' jobs go. Now it may not be popular, but I will always stand up for Australian jobs, as would all my colleagues on this side of the chamber. And do you know? If that condemns me, because I am not looking after some multinational who can make a few more bob in profit—well, then, condemn me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot express it, Mr Deputy President. I know your history, as I know the history of all senators on this side of the chamber. We have been called some wonderful things over the years. We are only union stoolies and all that. I can tell you now: every senator on this side of the chamber has dirt under their fingernails. Every senator on this side of the chamber knows and understands when times are tough: where are your friends? Every senator on this side of the chamber has had the experience that I have had—grown men in your office on a Friday afternoon crying because they have lost their jobs through no fault of their own.
       </p>
       <p>
        It sickens me to my gut when the mob over there hide behind 'productivity'. It is not productivity; it is bulldust! You are looking after your donors. You an absolute disgrace—the whole lot of you. If every one of you thinks that it is a good idea, get out there and tell the truth in your electorates. Tell the people out there that what you stand for is doing away with Australian jobs. It is gutless.
       </p>
       <p>
        No wonder Australians do not involve themselves in the politics of this country. They should involve themselves. They should sit back and say: 'What does this actually mean for my kids and my kids' future?' If you do not have the intestinal fortitude to stand there and look after your kids' future, I tell you what: you deserve to get your arms ripped off in your electorates. None of you have the guts to get out there and put the truth of the argument up. It makes me feel so mad.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that I had better sit down and have a Bex or something, because I am really winding up. I hear from those poor buggers dragged off their bunks in the middle of the night so that their jobs can be replaced by foreign seafarers on vessels that are older than their vessels. Do not tell me, from a national security point of view, that we know who those foreign seamen are.
