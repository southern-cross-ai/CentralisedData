        I rise today to, sadly, recognise that we've had a fifth woman in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        allegedly murdered at the hands of her husband. This is in a matter of 18 daysâ€”five women murdered, killed by their partners.
       </p>
       <p>
        Enough is enough.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        communities are rocked by this. The South Australian people are shocked that this is going on in such alarming numbers and that, still, governments are not doing enough to act. I stand with my local community to urge the South Australian government to establish a royal commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        Enough is enough. We are in a domestic violence crisis. This is an epidemic. If there was this type of epidemic of other crimes, there would be outrage. Heads would roll. Agencies would be brought in. Departments would have to act. Funding would flow. We need much more action from our leadership on a state basis and on a federal basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this year alone, 55 women across this country have been killed by their partners, in their homes, or at the hands of men that they know. Enough is enough. We must stop this, stop it in its tracks, and help women and children in this country to be safe in their homes.
