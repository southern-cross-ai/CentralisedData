          I might start by indicating to the Senate that it is not at all a correct interpretation of the events that have occurred to say that people have been abandoned on Nauru. In fact, if that were the case, Mr Faisal would not be in Australia receiving medical treatment. It is a somewhat difficult leap of faith to say that he was abandoned on Nauru when he happens to be in Australia receiving medical treatment. There is a little problem of a jump between a leap of faith and facts there, Senator—but I have had that problem with you before. Mr Sagar has apparently been offered resettlement in a third country. I note that you referred to a particular country. I do not know where you have got that advice.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
           UNHCR
          </a>
          and the third country involved had asked that that not be bandied about—but that is for you to answer to, not me. But, once again, I notice that you will do things that suit you rather than assist the UNHCR in their task.
         </p>
         <p>
          The United Nations High Commission for Refugees has secured a place for Mr Sagar in a third country. We are very grateful to them for working on that task. They indicated that they would, and they have knocked on a number of doors. This is therefore a successful resolution because Mr Sagar has an adverse security assessment and Australians do not want people who have adverse security assessments brought to Australia. The senator well knows that I cannot go against the adverse security assessment. I do not know what it is, and I do not seek to ask. There is another agency that is properly charged with that. We have trust and faith in that agency. They have given an adverse security assessment, and that is that.
         </p>
         <p>
          As to Mr Faisal—who you declared as being abandoned on Nauru—as you say, he is in Australia receiving medical treatment. Therefore he is not, in your terms, abandoned on Nauru.

           , I ask a supplementary question. I note the minister’s answer that this has been a ‘successful resolution’ after five years for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_Sagar" rel="nofollow">
            Mohammed Sagar
           </a>
           on Nauru. Does the minister also consider that it is a successful arrangement that Mohammed Faisal, after five years on Nauru, has become so suicidal he had to be evacuated from Nauru and now spends his days in a psychiatric hospital in Brisbane? Can the minister also answer: how long will the eight Burmese asylum seekers who are currently in Nauru be left to languish there? Will it be another five years, Minister?

            Just for the sake of my colleagues I think it is important to remind them that the question comes from the senator who did a press conference asking whether Immigration was responsible for someone being tipped over a balcony and coming to some harm in Sydney airport. She then later announced she did not really know whether there were Immigration people involved or not and the only reason she did it was it seemed a good thing to do.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Burmese people have been there for six weeks. That is a very short period of time. I understand the doomsayers want to go out and predict doom and gloom in advance, but they have been there for a very short time. We are doing everything we can to resolve that issue. When I have some more to say on that I will say it.
