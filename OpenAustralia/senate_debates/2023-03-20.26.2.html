        I rise to address some key misinformation that is out and about. As we all know, the voters of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        go to the polls at the end of the week. This misinformation was out, loud and clear, at the last federal election as well. It is the claim that Independents deliver.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me be straight. Independents can promise, Independents can argue and Independents can bang the table, but Independents cannot deliver. It is governments that deliver. For example, in my electorate we have an independent. They were formerly with the shooters and fishers party, but they jumped ship. They claim that they deliver on average $363 million per year. That's not true. They don't deliver a cent of it.

        and Nationals in government delivered, on average, $363 million per year to that electorate of Murray. That includes funding the Griffith Hospital to a value of about $250 million; funding for the beautiful

        in Leeton, which I personally put my support behind; and funding for the Deniliquin Town Hall redevelopment, which I was very proud to attend the opening of just a few weeks ago, as the local senator who, again, threw their support behind it. It is governments that deliver, not Independents.
