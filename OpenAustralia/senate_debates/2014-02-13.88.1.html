        My question is directed to the Assistant Minister for Health. Can the minister confirm that the assistant secretary to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        with responsibility for the health star food-labelling initiative was contacted directly by telephone by her chief of staff on 5 February last week, demanding that the food labelling website be removed? Can the minister confirm that the same official was removed from that position six days later, on Tuesday of this week?

         Yes, I can confirm that a discussion took place between my chief of staff and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Dennis" rel="nofollow">
          Kathy Dennis

         regarding the removal of the website. That was on my direction. That was, as I stated to the Senate earlier, my decisionâ€”to have the website removed. The question relating to the position of Ms Kathy Dennis would need to be directed to the secretary of the department, as the senator well knows.

           I can confirm that discussions took place with departmental officials. I can confirm that I spoke to a deputy secretary. I can confirm that I made no observation about the actions of staff and, as the senator would well know, I am not going to comment on hypothetical discussions that may or may not have taken place between my staff and those in the department. I take the opportunity to remind those opposite that I have very clearly outlined that there is no conflict of interest between my chief of staff and his role.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. When was the minister informed about staff changes in the healthy living and food policy branch of the Population Health Division of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Health
            </a>
            ? If she was informed, who informed the minister? Is there any formal record of such communications? Minister, I ask you to take on notice and report back as soon as possible to the Senate in relation to communications referred to in my previous question relating to your chief of staff and other staff members.

             I can indicate to the chamber that my knowledge of changes in staffing arrangements in the department came at the same time as everybody else, with a very general email that was sent from internal department emails advising of the change. I had no direct knowledge nor, indeed, was I told directly by the department about the changes in the staffing arrangements. I found out at the same time that the general issue was devolved to many individuals.
