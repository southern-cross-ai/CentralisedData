         I am very keen to get on with this debate after a one-and-a-quarter-hour delay on some procedural motions that should have taken five minutes. Because the government chose to filibuster with their speeches we have been denied one hour and 15 minutes to deal with this legislation that we have been told time and time again is superurgent and has to be dealt with. We had the spectacle of the

          Leader of the Government in the Senate
         </a>
         wasting 15 minutes of our time in one instance and others from his side wasting more time. We have now lost one and a quarter hours which we could have used to proceed with the issues before us and which are of vital interest to the people of Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I refer the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
          Climate Change
         </a>
         and Water to the domestic offsets program, which is the amendments currently before the chair. I ask that the minister correct me if my understanding is not correct, but I understand that we have to develop offset methodologies for the domestic offsets program. My question to the minister is: what internationally accepted principles will the government use to develop those offset methodologies? I particularly emphasise that I am interested in internationally accepted principles. The minister might indicate to me in what way these principles are ‘internationally accepted’. I would appreciate the minister addressing that query.

          These were outlined in the offer document which went to the good senator’s party room last week. We have said that those offsets that can be counted towards Australia’s international climate change obligation will be able to have abatement credited, subject obviously to proper methodologies being put in place. That is necessary because we are talking about a market. If we are serious, as the government is, about wanting farmers and other landholders to have access to the carbon market then the market will need to have confidence in whatever abatement is achieved by these mechanisms. I refer the senator to page 6 of the offer document which went to his party room last week, which refers to the establishment of an independent expert committee. The internationally accepted principles outlined in that offer document are the principles of permanence, additionality, measurability, avoidance of leakage, independent audit and registration.

                Thank you, Mr Chairman. The minister should be cautious in attributing intentions to anyone, particularly to other senators in this chamber. I suspect it is probably against standing orders that she so do, but again I thought my question was very reasonable. I am sorry it has upset the minister in her haste to have this urgent bill—which does not start for 19 months, I might add—dealt with before Christmas. So I am sorry if I have upset you, Minister, but my point is that when you say ‘permanence’ and the other words which you mentioned in what way are they internationally accepted? I know they are in a document you referred to, which many other people in Australia do not have access to, and I appreciate the answer as far as it goes, but what has caused those criteria to be internationally accepted? Are they what they have adopted in the European Union? Are they what they have adopted in the United States? They would not have adopted them in the United States, because I do not think the United States has a legislated position. Perhaps the minister could just indicate in what way those principles are internationally accepted.

                  I would like some clarification on the offsets. What sorts of activities would the minister imagine to be eligible under the domestic offsets program? Could she give some practical examples? Does the minister envisage that activities under the GGAS and NGAS programs, which cease with the

                  , would be covered and would this program cover landfill gas capture activities? Finally, would this program cover activities currently covered under statewide certificate schemes? I am happy to break those questions up if that would be useful.

                   In relation to landfill and legacy wastes, we have indicated that

                    I would like to follow up on Senator Macdonald’s question. On the methodology principles, the minister referred to proposed section 259K(1)(a) to (f). While I do appreciate the minister pointing us in that direction, it is still not all that clear. This is one of the things that certainly farmers are very keen to know, given that some of these offsets have been attributed to counteracting, if you like, some of the inputs that still exist within the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">
                     ETS
                    </a>
                    that they are going to have to face—things like fuel, transport, electricity, fertiliser and chemicals. It would be quite useful if perhaps, given the vague nature of proposed section 259K, the minister were to outline for the chamber exactly what types of activities are going to be undertaken. From reading through all of this, there is nothing that I can see that is all that specific to be able to take back to farmers. It seems to be a more general sort of view of how it will all work. So perhaps the minister, if she is able, could advise the Senate of some of the more specific components of that.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Could she also, perhaps, give a bit more specific detail around the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee, which is going to be constituted to assess offset methodologies. Again, that is quite vague. I would be very interested to know how that integrity committee is actually going to determine what those offset methodologies are going to be and the criteria that that is going to use. Perhaps the minister could respond to the Senate around those two issues, bearing in mind the very important issue for farmers of having to bear the embedded costs that still exist within the ETS. Even though, of course, agriculture in terms of the animal emissions is excluded, all of those input costs are still going to land right in the lap of the farmers. We have been told that these offsets will be available to counteract some of that. Perhaps the minister could just give us a bit more detail around those issues.

                     I propose to table the offer document which was provided to the coalition party rooms—I think we provided 100 copies—and which sets out in detail quite a number of the answers to the questions which are now being asked. I table that, and I would invite the senators asking questions to look at the document which was provided to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Turnbull, and, as I understand it, to the joint party room—but certainly the Liberal party room—prior to the party room endorsing the amendments, because many of the questions that Senator Nash and Senator Macdonald are proposing go straight to that issue.

                          I thank the minister for that, and I have read that page, but again it does not clearly outline for us the specifics around how that integrity committee will work. Obviously it is to advise the secretary in advising the minister assessing the costs and benefits. That particular section still does not necessarily, I think, provide the specifics either to the Senate or to those listening. In response to the minister’s comment about the information provided to the joint party room, of course, that has not necessarily been provided to all those people out there who are very keen to listen to the activities in the chamber this morning. So perhaps the minister, for the benefit of those listening, might like to refer to my previous question and, indeed, answer it. I am sure they will be able to access the bill itself, not necessarily information that is provided to the joint party room, and I think that for the benefit of people listening to the process in the chamber they would like an answer to my previous question. Again, part 25A really does not give us a great deal of detail regarding how the committee will utilise a certain series of criteria to do it.

                           I am attempting to be helpful, but I would suggest to Senator Nash that there are quite a number of pages about how the committee would operate. I am not sure how much more I can add than the legislation itself, which sets out the establishment of the committee, the functions of the committee, the membership of the committee, the consultation by the committee, the procedures for the committee, disclosure of interests and a whole range of other procedural matters. So I am a little at a loss to know what further information I could possibly put to Senator Nash to explain the committee to her.

                          <p>
                           In relation to the document, I certainly understand that not everyone in Australia would have a copy of this document. It would be unusual if everyone in Australia did have a copy of such a document but, for the senator’s information, we have ensured that the document which outlines the government’s offer to the opposition has been on the government’s website—I believe my portfolio’s website—since Tuesday of last week.

I do appreciate that all that information about the make-up of the committee is contained within the amendments, but my question went more to the criteria around the determination of those offset methodologies. If the minister feels she cannot provide that information at this stage, perhaps she might like to provide it to the chamber at a later time. I certainly do understand the processes.

                             Perhaps Senator Nash was not in the chamber when I referred Senator Macdonald to proposed section 259K which appears on page 9 of the amendments. It goes through the methodology principles. Essentially, the issue is that we want to ensure we maximise the possibility of Australian landholders being able to be part of the solution on climate change. We have to ensure that in doing so we do not expose taxpayers to fiscal risk by including abatement in our scheme that is not recognised internationally or that does not have sound principles associated with it. We need to ensure that this is abatement in which everyone can have confidence. The proposal we have is for a process which ensures that both farmers and people seeking to invest in sequestration or abatement activities will have confidence in the value of that activity and its environmental integrity.

                                 Thank you, Senator Macdonald—I am happy to yield to my colleagues on this issue. Minister, has there been any modelling or accounting work done, given that there has been an intimation to farmers that this new inclusion around these offsets will in some way go, as I said before, to counteracting the embedded costs that remain in the
                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">
                                  ETS
                                 </a>
                                 ? Has the government done any work at this stage on accounting modelling on, say, average size farms, measuring what the current input costs will be and potentially the amount of funding that may be forthcoming from these offsets? That may sound like a very simplistic question, given the complex nature of the detail of the bill, but I think the people out there listening, and certainly farmers, would be very keen to know whether, for a certain cost that will land on them and will be inescapable under this emissions trading scheme, the government has determined how much of that will be offset by some of the measures being proposed by the government and could be utilised by the farming community.

                                  Senator Nash, on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday last week you asked me a question about farm input costs and I have already put that on the Senate
                                  <i>
                                   Hansard
                                  </i>
                                  , so I refer you to my answers on that occasion. In relation to how much farmers could earn now, that would be very difficult to model. As you know, there are very different types of opportunities on different types of land and for different types of practices. No modelling exercise on what an average farm could or could not earn by virtue of a certain number of offsets being available has been done. It would be rather difficult for it to be done.

                                         Mr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I have every right to come into this chamber and ask a question under the process of the Senate regardless of what my decision is going to be on a piece of legislation. For the minister to suggest that senators should not come into this chamber and ask questions on legislation because she has a predetermined view about how we are going to vote is entirely inappropriate.

                                           With respect, I think the senator is being a little sensitive. I do not think I have resiled from answering questions for 3½ days now. I will certainly continue to answer her questions. I am simply making the point that she calls for modelling and everybody knows that any modelling will not change her view. If it would, Senator, I would appreciate you indicating that on

                                             Correct, it will not change your view. That is the only point I am making. I would also refer the senator to page 38 onwards of the supplementary explanatory memorandum, which goes through more detail in relation to offsets. I will respond now to Senator Xenophon. He asked me about GGAS. I am advised that any project that meets eligibility requirements can be brought forward under the offset program and eligibility there refers to being counted towards Australia’s international obligations. Existing activities under GGAS will need to meet additionality requirements. We obviously cannot pre-empt the methodologies which need to be developed by the committee, which is being proposed in the legislation before the Senate, and decisions would obviously need to be made about individual projects by the regulatory authority. I should also note that part 10 of the bill on reforestation will allow GGAS forestry projects to transition into the

                                              I am grateful to the minister for that. That relates to the whole issue of additionality, which I will raise at a later stage with some further amendments. In relation to the document provided to the coalition, which has been tabled, pages 6 to 9 deal with the whole question of offsets. In terms of the independent expert committee that will be established to vet offset methodologies and to recommend robust methodologies to the minister for approval, the document indicates clearly that the minister would accept or reject methodologies but would not be able to modify the committee’s recommendations. In terms of the methodologies that are recommended, to what extent is that a public process? Are they documents that will be tabled? To what extent will there be transparency in that process with respect to the whole issue of methodologies?

                                                I would like to go back if I can in relation to the whole issue of offsets. In the government’s original legislation, there was no provision for domestic offsets other than for reforestation projects. Now we have provision for a program of domestic offsets in addition to those reforestation offsets. When the government argued this case originally it said, as I understand it, that the reason that a decision could not be made about agriculture and these kinds of offset projects until 2013—and then if a decision was made to proceed with the inclusion it would not happen until 2015—is that we do not have the accounting methodologies worked out sufficiently to be able to guarantee that we had the carbon outcomes that were being claimed as a result of the projects. Can the minister confirm that that was in fact why the government was delaying until 2013 to make a decision in relation to this matter?

                                                 I may not have understood the senator’s question, but I think her question was about why we had a particular position on offsets pre the negotiation with the opposition. Obviously, there was a negotiation, but this is also connected to our decision to exclude agriculture indefinitely. There is a difference between creating offsets when you are subsequently going to review whether a sector will come in and creating offsets when the policy position is that that sector is excluded indefinitely. We are in the second world now, and we do believe this is a sensible process. It is one which ensures environmental integrity and certainty for farmers. There is no point having an offset agreed for soil carbon, for example, that does not have integrity and is not regarded by the public, the community and the market as being additional, as having cogency. If we are serious about generating economic opportunities through this for farmers then it will have to have market credibility. We are seeking to put in place a regime which enables that, but it is a different position to the position prior to the negotiations being agreed with the opposition—absolutely.

                                                  Yes, and it is precisely because of that difference of position that I am asking the question. My understanding is that the reason it was not in there before is that we did not have the methodologies. We do not have the accounting mechanisms right now. If somebody applied tomorrow for a biochar project for an offset credit, would we have the accounting methodology to be able to say, ‘Yes, I can say that that biochar has sequestered X amount of carbon; therefore, so many credits are available’? My understanding is that that does not exist. I notice, in the agreement with the government, that it will introduce voluntary emissions reporting trials in 2011 to allow the sector to better understand and manage its emissions. Can you explain to me what these voluntary emissions trials in 2011 will be and when do you expect we will have the methodologies and accounting rules in place to start issuing these permits?

                                                   Some of these might be issues that the committee would resolve—in terms of methodologies and so forth. I would also like to make a point about biochar. Under the agreement and because of the current status of the international accounting rules, biochar is only a voluntary market offset. It would not be an offset within the

                                                    This is precisely the point I am getting to. When the government went to the Australian people, they acknowledged we do not have the accounting in place to make robust claims about offsets. The reason reforestation and afforestation went in there is that there is methodology for that and you could apply it. For all these other things, there is no methodology.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    Whether they are counted under Australia’s existing emissions reporting requirements or they go into the government’s national carbon offsets standards, which are outside our current requirements, you still have to have a robust methodology, which does not exist. The government’s previous claim was that by 2013 we would have a better idea and we could make a decision about agriculture. My understanding was that the reason for the delay to 2013 was these methodologies. I am concerned that the coalition has been sold a pup here by thinking that farmers are going to be able to benefit immediately from offset projects, when what we are seeing here in the documentation is that there would be voluntary emissions reporting trials in 2011 to allow the sector to better understand and manage its emissions. Presumably this work is going to go on through the next two or three years, which would take it out to about 2013, which is when the government previously said it would be ready to make a decision.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    To follow through on that: I notice that you say that, first of all, you will be setting up the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee. Then there will be regulations struck which provide for an authority to approve an application form. I notice that applications for Australian emission units must be accompanied by a report on the project in respect of the relevant reporting period. Then a report on an offset project must be accompanied by a prescribed audit report, and the audit report, therefore, must be in line with a set of robust methodologies. It is envisaged that the audit report will be prepared by a registered greenhouse and energy auditor as defined under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act. I ask the minister specifically: how many registered greenhouse and energy auditors do we have at the moment with expertise in agriculture, land use and emission offsets?

                                                     I will take on notice, if I may, how many auditors there are who are identified under the NGERS. I am not sure we would track that data. The NGERS—the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme—of course, was Mr Turnbull’s legislation when environment minister, and it is a very useful piece of legislation in terms of providing the reporting base for some of the work we are doing now. I will check that. As I said, I am not sure that the government would, in fact, be the registrar for all such expertise.

That is not what this says. What this says is that we want to explore how we can bring more sources of abatement either into the scheme or through the voluntary market. Some of this work will be difficult, but we believe it is important and we have been very clear in this agreement about the specified areas in which we think work needs to be focused. We think that the

                                                     are correct when they say that farmers want to be part of the climate change solution, and we want to provide those opportunities.

                                                        I could not agree more. The area of land use, land use change and forestry is absolutely critical. I really want to see rural Australia being given opportunities to reduce the carbon footprint and, in fact, assist all of us in protecting carbon stores and reducing emissions. I am emphatically in favour of that. I have had lots of talks with the

You need to look at several factors together: water sustainability, biodiversity, food security and resilience in country communities. The concern I have is that picking and choosing offsets in the way that is happening will lead to perverse outcomes, just like the managed investment schemes did. Unless you look at food security, water and biodiversity all at once, you end up favouring one and destroying another.

                                                        That is the perspective that I come from here. It is not that I do not think we ought to be doing everything we can to maximise carbon stored in the landscape; it is about the manner in which this is done. It is not clear to me that it has really been well thought through. It is very ad hoc, and with adhockery you get those perverse outcomes. I assume the government said it would not make a decision until 2013 about whether it would include agriculture because it had to think through a lot of these methodologies. Now that it has been brought forward there will be a rush to get something done, and when you do that you inevitably end up, as with the managed investment schemes, with adverse outcomes for water, food security, land prices and all sorts of things.

                                                        The point that I was getting at with the registered greenhouse and energy auditors is that, whilst there are clearly people registered as auditors, I cannot see that they would have expertise in an area that we have not developed yet. In fact, they could not have expertise in this area. Minister, you were saying that units will only be provided for abatement that has already occurred and not for abatement that is expected to occur in the future, so there is going to be a whole lot of uncertainty in the next few years as to what you may or may not do on land in relation to this.

                                                        I would like to ask a specific question in relation to avoided deforestation. Can the minister explain to me what is intended here? Is it intended that you will provide credit to people who already have a permit to log or to clear and that, therefore, avoided deforestation is a decision not to proceed with a land clearance or logging permit? Can you just explain to me how this will work? What is your baseline? If that is what is intended, you will give credit to people who said they were going to clear and now are not going to. What sort of hectarage across Australia would people in theory have permission to log or clear?

                                                         I will take advice on that last issue. In relation to the first issues you raised, you made the point about whether or not other environmental objectives would be delivered through this, such as biodiversity and so forth. This is a difference of views between your party and the government which manifested in the debate over the carbon sinks tax legislation—that is, whether you ensure all environmental objectives through one piece of legislation or you make sure that the broader environmental framework which applies through Commonwealth and state or territory legislation deals with the issues that you raised, such as biodiversity and other objectives.

                                                         We do not believe that it is sensible to require every aspect of those environmental considerations in this section of the legislation. For example, there are planning legislative frameworks which apply in states and territories in relation to land use, and it is not sensible for the Commonwealth to second-guess all of those. What we have said is that, in relation to forests, we would include conditions for forests earning forest credits to have adequate water entitlements. That is consistent with the National Water Initiative, and we think that is sensible. We have also referenced planning approvals, which I think arose out of a discussion between your party and the government in the context of the previous debate in this chamber on the taxation measures.
                                                        </p>

                                                         In relation to your comments about whether or not auditors have expertise in a particular area, can I say, Senator, that there is a lot that we have to develop expertise in very quickly. If this country had started acting on climate change much earlier we would have far more expertise in many areas than we currently have. We have come a long way in two years, but we have to go much further. I for one am not of the view that you hold back reform on the basis that you are not sure if you can develop the expertise. I think when reform is in the national interest you have to simply ensure that you develop it. The government will work—as we are currently—with agricultural stakeholders. We were previously working through a technical options group which included a range of representatives from farming organisations. We will continue to consult with the sector. We may have to prioritise. I do not want to second-guess that consultation process. It may be that there is a decision made in consultation with the sector about which of the things we would prioritise first. I do not know; that will be a matter for the consultation process. But we are serious about delivering a more comprehensive approach when it comes to land use. We know it will take work and it certainly will take dialogue with the sector.

With regard to the burning of savannas, I think we can be satisfied that those methodologies are in place. I refer to the West Arnhem Land Fire Abatement Project. In contrast, referring to livestock—livestock contribute some 75 per cent of the greenhouse gas emissions, or at least they are ascribed to from agriculture, from activities of ruminants—I fear for our capacity to be able to develop robust methodologies in that area, given the diversity of management of ruminants in Australia from pastoral to agricultural, from extensive to intensive. I question the minister following the policy commitment to exclude agriculture indefinitely from the CPRS and the statement:

I cannot see anything in the documentation that helps me understand the details proposed with regard to the Productivity Commission review.

It is the government’s view that we have made a very clear policy decision as a result of the discussions with the senator’s party about exclusion indefinitely. That remains our view. The senator is asking me to second guess what a future government, or a future parliament, might do. As he knows, nobody binds a future parliament. Obviously, I can only indicate what the government’s position is.

                                                             I take issue with Senator Back’s suggestion about the exclusion of the participants. He may have a particular view about the Labor Party and farmers, but we have actually spent quite a lot of time ensuring the sector was engaged with this. Both Minister Burke and I have met with various peak bodies. We have an officials-level process that has worked through some of these issues with various peak representatives and we will continue that process. This only works if there is good consultation with the people who would actually benefit from these mechanisms—we agree with that.

                                                             You mentioned livestock. That is one of the things that was driving the argument for exclusion. I do not want to get into much of the debate I got into with Senator Joyce about this—and much of it probably was not appropriate for the Senate chamber—but the reality is that the inclusion of agriculture would have had a lot of problems and that was one of them.

                                                             </p>

                                                              The Minister must not make or amend a determination unless advised to do so by the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee …
                                                             </p>
                                                             <p>
                                                              I then refer you to the next paragraph, 4.69:
                                                             </p>
                                                             <p class="italic">
                                                              The Minister may revoke a determination at any time, without obtaining advice from the Committee …

                                                             <p>
                                                              So, in repeating that, paragraph 4.68 says the minister must not make or amend a determination unless advised by the committee and, in the next clause, the minister may revoke a determination without obtaining the advice of the committee. They seem to be directly contradictory. Am I misreading that? I would appreciate the minister’s guidance.

I have not taken advice of this—I will check—but I assume the words mean precisely what they appear to mean. To avoid a situation where a technical issue is the subject of political lobbying, the minister cannot make a determination or change a determination unless advised to do so. The minister does have the power to revoke. They are quite different things. I will check to see if this is correct, but making and amending are different functions to revoking.

So you are saying that the making and amending can only be done on the advice of the integrity committee but, if you are making another decision in relation to the determination, you can do that without seeking the advice of the committee. If the minister’s interpretation is correct—and I appreciate that she says she is going to get some further advice on that; it does seem contradictory—could she explain the principles behind paragraph 4.68 of the explanatory memorandum, which says that you cannot deal with a determination unless you get some advice, and the next clause, which says you can do something else with a determination but, in that case, you do not need advice?
                                                               </p>

                                                                What is the domestic offsets integrity committee all about? Is it to give the minister advice on what she should or should not be doing? Let me not ascribe motives to the committee but it seems to me that, while you recognise that making, amending and dealing with a determination requires advice from what is apparently going to be an expert committee, if you are going to make some other decision in relation to the determination, there is not the same urgency, apparently, to get that advice from the expert committee. I appreciate that the minister was checking her interpretation but, if it is confirmed her interpretation is correct, what is the principle behind it when you are dealing with a determination and making a decision? Is it that in some cases you need the advice of this expert committee but on other occasions, if you are dealing with a determination, you do not need the advice of that expert committee?

An example for why you might want the minister to have the power to revoke would be if there were a change in the international accounting rules such that continuation of the particular methodology without changing it would potentially expose the taxpayer to financial risk. Obviously, once we sign up to a target under Kyoto or any subsequent arrangements we have to ensure that what we do in Australia is capable of beating that target. In addition, we can do things voluntarily. If there were a change in that boundary you would want to alter the situation domestically pretty quickly; otherwise, you might be exposing taxpayers to risk. You would then want to enable the committee to go back and say, ‘Now the international framework has changed’—possibly for the better; that may well be the case—‘and we will propose a different determination for the minister.’

Obviously, these are public decisions and I am sure they would be the subject of a significant amount of scrutiny. The architecture of what is being put before the

It is a reasonably strict provision that says a minister can only change or amend a determination on the advice of the expert committee. That is intended to give farmers and others who are able to participate in the land use sector opportunities and the certainty that this is not going to be under the vagaries of some political process. That is the intention.

If you need the advice of this expert committee—and I think it is a good idea—in one instance, why do you not if you are going to revoke it? The same considerations might apply. In a circumstance which I cannot quite think of at the moment, revocation might be attributed to what you referred to as a ‘politically influenced decision’. Were that the case, the same would apply.
                                                                 </p>

I acknowledge that this is not going to determine my decision on how I vote, and I am sure that it will not in the end determine Australian support for or opposition to the legislation, but it might just support the Australian majority view that we are perhaps rushing into this. I know that the minister will say that we have been talking about this for 10 years, two years or 18 months—I think that she said since March this year—but these quite substantial and on the whole very beneficial amendments that the government has, kicking and screaming, agreed to need some scrutiny, not scrutiny on the overall impact but scrutiny on the things that I am raising with the chamber at the moment. It seems contradictory. Therefore, I wonder why we are being asked to sit night and day to rush this through, bearing in mind that it will not take effect until 19 months from today.

                                                                  Minister, I would appreciate your response to the technical question but also your comment on why it is essential to do this now when there are these little things to work through—and this is one that I happened to come across. I am only looking at the explanatory memorandum. I followed it through in the legislation, but that did not give me much help. It takes time to clarify these things. I hope that are able to work these things out. Perhaps if I sit down the minister can answer (a) the technical question that I raised and then (b) why it would not be appropriate for us to spend a bit more time going through these relatively minor issues. But they are things that relate to the operation of the scheme—which, once it is introduced in 19 months time, we need to have schmick and down pat. We do not want complaints in 19 months time with those affected saying: ‘Hey, the minister has revoked this determination without getting the advice of the domestic offsets integrity committee. Why did she do that? She had to get advice from this expert committee when she introduced it and when she amended it. We might be happy with it the way it is, but now she is going to revoke it and she is not getting the advice of this committee.’ It seems an inconsistency. Perhaps it is not. Perhaps the minister will be able to wave it away. But it causes me to worry that the actual implementation by the government of the day needs to be as good and smooth as it can be. This sort of inconsistency, from my experience, would make that difficult.

If the senator wants to have a discussion about delay, he and I have traversed that in this chamber many times. We believe that it is important to get this legislation through. This country has been talking about action on climate change for some 10 years.

We know that business certainty is a key issue in ensuring we can transform our economy. I think I have answered the senator’s question. He may not like the answer but it has been addressed.

I think your question was about the amount of land under licence able to be harvested. The officials in the chamber do not have that. Whilst we could take it on notice, my advice is that the Commonwealth would be unlikely to keep it because, as you would know, timber harvesting—and I appreciate your party’s position on this—for better or for worse is in large part regulated by state governments. It may be that you could reference the

The conditions which would need to be met are measurable and verifiable or capable of being verified, additional and permanent. Obviously these are also matters which would need to be worked through by the offsets committee but some of the work that is being done internationally currently may be of assistance to us domestically in considering these matters.

Minister Wong, it is not that I do not like the answer you gave; it just does not make sense. One of the reasons you gave for having the domestic offsets integrity committee giving advice in making or amending was so that those involved might not think there is some political reason for doing it. I think you acknowledge that most farmers do not like your party, Minister Wong, but that is quite beside the point of the debate. I think in that instance you are very right and very correct. I think perhaps that is the only thing I have ever agreed with you on. That was your reason for having the domestic offsets integrity committee advise you on making or amending, and my question, which I think is quite reasonable, is: why then doesn’t the same reason apply when you revoke it? Perhaps other people might think there is a particular political motivation behind the doing.
                                                                    </p>

Perhaps that might have been the better way to do it, and I seek your further advice—if you are prepared to; you may just say you have already answered that question, in which case I will take it that you cannot or, for some reason, do not want to answer it.

You do not agree with the government’s policy on this or on other issues. That is fine. You will vote against the bill, but I have answered that question. I have given you an indication of the sort of factual scenarios that would ground the reason for that.

You asked how many auditors are likely to have expertise in this area, and I am advised that the GEDO, the Greenhouse and Energy Data Officer—I am not sure where we came up with that particular title, but anyway—will commence registration of auditors in early 2010. Applicants for registration will be able to indicate whether they have expertise in specific industry sectors, such as agriculture. I am also advised that the government expects that a number of individuals with expertise in carbon sequestration, including forestry, will register under NGERS.

Just being an agricultural scientist—which I might say is an excellent profession, and we do not have enough of them and need more—does not mean that they would have expertise in carbon sequestration. This is an entirely new field and a very specialised one. So, whilst it would be more likely to have people in the forestry sector, as the minister is well aware it is a hugely contentious area in terms of developing methodologies for estimating the amount of carbon in a standing forest or in a regrowth forest et cetera, let alone a new field, which is that of estimating it in agriculture, soils and the whole range of things.
                                                                      </p>

And those people are actually going to have to help in developing the project, which they are then going to audit, essentially, because we will not have enough people who have expertise in the field. This is what has happened to us in a whole range of these new areas. As tragic as it is, this is what happened with our attempt at insulation, where we just did not have enough people trained in installing insulation and now we have two people electrocuted and one person dead from heat stress as a result of people not being adequately trained, I would suggest, to do this work. That was just in one field and this—assessing agricultural sequestration through these various methods—is a much more technically demanding field than that.
                                                                      </p>

Approval of projects and crediting of abatements cannot both happen on 1 July 2011, according to what you are saying, because you are saying that units will be provided only for abatement that has already occurred and not for abatement that is expected to occur in the future. I assume that that means that you can apply for your project to be credited on 1 July 2011 and then there will be the process by which you will actually do the abatement. Then you will apply to have the abatement credited and, as it says here, you have to have an audit report by a registered auditor to actually then qualify for that. So I should imagine that if this starts on 1 July 2011 it is very unlikely there will be any abatement credits issued in a reasonable length of time—it is hard to say how much time.
                                                                      </p>

                                                                       I want to particularly go to the issue of permits being provided for abatement from the sources counted towards Australia’s international commitments, subject to the development of robust methodologies. So, presumably, if there are no methodologies there will be no permits for abatements from these various sources. I want to go through a couple of them—actually, all of them—for a start in a general question. What is the baseline year for all of these things? Taking fertiliser use as an example, obviously we are talking here about nitrous oxide and about changing farming methods to go organic and get off petrochemical fertilisers and all the additives that are generating the nitrous oxide emissions. If you as an individual farmer decided you wanted to get abatement for this over the next few years, are we saying that 2009, with the passage of this legislation, is the baseline year? So, you would say that I used X for my property in 2009 and I am therefore measuring it against that? The same goes for all of these things—for manure management, livestock and all the rest of it. You are going to have to have a baseline year. You especially need it for avoided deforestation; otherwise, in theory, people who have forests on their land that they have no intention of clearing could go out now and apply for a forest practices plan in order to demonstrate, 12 months down the track, that they had intended to clear it and can therefore now claim something that they never intended to do in the first place. That goes to the issue of additionality.
                                                                      </p>
                                                                      <p>
                                                                       Then there is the issue of leakage. You might give abatement to someone for not clearing something they said they were going to clear, then over on the other property they start clearing and so you have got leakage. As you know, Minister, and as we all know, these are the issues that have vexed the international community for a long time. How do you measure it? How do you make sure that you have genuine additionality? How do you stop leakage driving the practice from one thing to another?
                                                                      </p>
                                                                      <p>
                                                                       My first question relates to livestock, manure management, fertiliser use, the burning of savannahs and agricultural residues, rice cultivation, avoided deforestation, legacy waste and emissions from closed landfill activities. How are you going to calculate the baseline year from which you would measure the abatement activities? You cannot wait for the methodology if you are a farmer, for example, because you might want to start now to maximise your abatement in three year’s time.

First, I would just like to remind the Senate and Senator Milne that the reforestation provisions in part 10 start a year earlier. Some of the discussion appears to have proceeded on the basis that all offsets would occur later.

Your question, Senator Milne, essentially proceeds on the basis that the only way to determine additionality is by taking a temporal snapshot. One of the key reasons why we have an integrity committee with a general principle which is set out—and I will come back to it—in 259K(2)(c) is so that we do not have a situation where you get the sort of perverse outcomes that you just postulated. You need to ensure there is genuine additionality. How you achieve that and how the baseline is constructed may differ from sector to sector. For example, if we had put in this legislation, ‘The baseline will be what you were going to do as at 1 July 2010,’ some of the difficulties you raised may well have arisen—what if someone then went and got a permit to clear land et cetera? The general proposition is at 259K(2)(c), which sets out the test:
                                                                         </p>

I just want to take it back to where the farming community is now: hearing on the radio that the agreement between the government and the coalition is that offset permits will be available for abatement activities around fertiliser use, avoided deforestation et cetera. They are now sitting at home thinking: ‘What do I have to do on my farm and when do I have to start? Who do I register it with? How am I going to do this in order to take advantage of it?’ I think the minister and everybody in this parliament is quite right in assuming that people in rural Australia want to be able to do things. There is no question about that. They want to be able to do things to reduce their emissions. Anyway, it makes infinite sense to reduce their marginal input costs by getting rid of a lot of the inputs that cost them a great deal of money, and fertiliser is one of those. But how, on fertiliser use—

                                                                            </a>

In particular, I was asking about issues around measurability, additionality and leakage and asking how, if you were a person engaged in any of these activities, you would know when this would apply, what the baseline years would be and so on. I was particularly asking, in relation to fertiliser use, how that would apply, because if you are on a farm and you decide that you are going to go organic, reduce your fertiliser use or something then you are going to need to know how that is going to be calculated in order that you can start making very clear what hectarage you have covered, what volume of fertiliser you have used over a period of time and that sort of stuff. It seems to me that there is no detail about how that will happen.
                                                                           </p>

                                                                            The issue I will come back to is avoided deforestation. This is an issue which still is not sorted out. I know the minister referred to REDD and the ongoing negotiations, but we still do not have a clear view of how avoided deforestation is going to be accounted for. I want to know: in the CPRS permits that might be provided, is that going to include properties or activities whereby a farmer in Queensland, for example, had let native vegetation grow back and then might have been going to bulldoze that for ongoing utilisation and then decides not to? Would that be counted as avoided deforestation?
                                                                           </p>
                                                                           <p>
                                                                            I also note, while I am on my feet, that the minister said she could not give an idea of what sort of hectarage across Australia might be counted as avoided deforestation, because that is something that the states have carriage of. The problem we have here, which makes this grossly unfair, is that every state seems to have different policies with regard to the clearance of native vegetation. In Tasmania, for example, because Tasmania has virtually no laws against land clearance, clearing native veg and so on, there would be an argument that anyone with any vegetation or forest on their land could be credited with avoided deforestation by virtue of being able to log it if it is not covered by existing legislation. So I am rather keen to get a much better sense of some reality in the debate about what sorts of time frames we are talking about before you would get robust methodologies, especially since they will need to be consistent with international best practice and what is agreed in international negotiations.

I again refer you to my answer before the break, Senator. It is the case that the detail on all of these offsets has not been finalised. That is why what the amendments do is to set out the regime which enables them to be finalised. That is why the legislation talks about the objectives. I have referred you to those objectives, including in relation to additionality.
                                                                            </p>

I do not propose to go to hypotheticals such as some of the ones Senator Milne proposes, because those hypotheticals assume certain facts which would be the subject of consideration by the committee in the context of a very clear legislative requirement around additionality, around integrity and around clarity.
                                                                            </p>

Obviously, some of that work has been commenced. There has been work progressed through our current consultation processes with the agricultural sector, but I absolutely concede and agree that this work is there to be done, and so it should be. This legislation is putting forward the framework which enables that to occur and a process which will enable that to be resolved. It is prescriptive as to the need to be measurable and capable of being verified. The subclause I read out before reads:
                                                                            </p>
                                                                            <p class="italic">

                                                                            </p>

What the committee determines is required as the methodology to ensure these policy objectives are met in relation to each particular section of this, or each particular type of offset, will be a matter for the committee and it will involve technical work—quite highly technical work—and that is as it should be.

There are many people who have proactively chosen to covenant forests or who want to protect forests, and there is no current regime which would reward them for that. In order to prove avoided deforestation, they are going to have to show that they would have logged it and now will not because of this scheme. It seems to me unfair that those people who have chosen to protect their forests, or will choose to protect their forests, are not included. If you are going to respond by saying, ‘Well, that’s not additional,’ then you cannot prove additionality for people saying: ‘We’ve got a standing forest. We weren’t going to protect it. We would have logged it and now we want the credits for not logging it.’ That is why I find this whole issue of avoided deforestation quite difficult. I do not see how you are going to get any robustness in the methodologies.
                                                                             </p>

Is the minister concerned that we could have a vast number of

Already the sugar mill in Tully is suffering from a lack or a loss of land—I do not have the figures in front of me, but I think it is around 12,000 hectares of land—and now this is threatening the viability of the mill because it will not have the necessary throughput to keep open.
                                                                                 </p>

This has not been discussed much in prior speeches, but I know that Senator Milne, although for a different reason, is as concerned as I am about this. Senator Nash, too, has raised this issue. Is there anything in the bill—because I cannot find it—and anything in the amendments—because I cannot see it in them—which would prevent a gross takeover of agricultural land for people putting in carbon sinks? The price of carbon will go up and the price of bananas will go down.
                                                                                 </p>

Senator Milne, Senator Joyce and I are convinced that this is a tax break for land—though we do not want to get into that argument; we have been in that argument before. Senator Milne has advice from a solicitor that the land will able to be purchased through a tax break. But leaving that aside for the moment, the real problem we have now is how we are going to prevent this from happening. It is going to happen and it is happening as we speak. It is going to happen at an accelerated rate if this CPRS legislation comes in.

If this bill is defeated, and the Greens have continued to oppose this bill, obviously there will continue to be delay on all action contemplated under the bill, including the development of the offsets regime under the bill.
                                                                                  </p>

A national Greens alliance opposed that measure. From memory, the opposition, other than the National Party, voted with the government on this. Those policy issues have been traversed. The government do not agree that the policy issues involved in trying to provide landholders with the opportunity to sequester carbon are outweighed by some of the risks that Senator Boswell puts forward. Many of the proponents of these types of activities do not envisage that you would utilise prime agricultural land for these types of activities. In fact, I would have thought there was an economic difficulty with some of what Senator Boswell is suggesting. He is suggesting that the carbon price, which starts off at only $10 a tonne in the first year of the scheme, could somehow displace agricultural production for what one would have thought would be much higher value products than that.
                                                                                  </p>

Secondly, as part of our agreement with the opposition in relation to forests earning forest credits, we said that we would require conditions for these to have adequate water entitlements. As I have previously indicated to one of your colleagues earlier today—or perhaps late Friday or Thursday night, or even late Wednesday night, I cannot recall—it would be our expectation that those conditions would be consistent with the National Water Initiative requirements. We have also indicated that we would include conditions for planning approvals.
                                                                                  </p>

We believe the risks have been overstated by those opposite. We think farmers should have this opportunity to make that economic decision, and we do believe that putting in place requirements around planning approval and water entitlements deal with some of the risks which are being put forward.

Is there advice on the process for appointment? Is it just a personal appointment by the minister? Is an advertisement process undertaken in considering applicants for committee membership?

My question is: what is the process by which the minister actually identifies those people? The documentation speaks of the membership, the chair, the numbers et cetera, but the mechanism or the process by which the minister would identify from the community those who might want to express interest in membership of the committee is not clear to me.

I assume, Senator—and these are not usually matters in legislation—that the normal government processes around appointments to statutory committees would apply.

Can the minister advise on the obligation, if any, of the committee to respond to public submissions that they may have received.

I note with some irony, Minister, that last time we had an exchange on carbon sink forests I was sitting somewhere rather different in the chamber. You mentioned the entitlements that would be attached to the establishment of a carbon sink forest. Can you clarify for the Senate that you mean that the landholder would have to have a water licence to put those carbon sink forests in? I imagine that would only apply to areas where there is not enough rainfall to sustain them anyway. There are two parts to the question. If my understanding of what you said earlier is correct, where do you see those entitlements actually being required if a carbon sink were to go in? And, if the carbon sink forests are going to be encouraged for the purposes of reducing the greenhouse gases, what work has the government done in terms of interception, particularly across the Murray-Darling Basin, to determine what impact the establishment of those carbon sink forests is going to have?

The detail of those is not in the legislation. That is a policy commitment which we would develop in consultation with the various sectors and stakeholders. I referenced in relation to the adequate water entitlement issues that this was consistent with the National Water Initiative commitments that states made in 2004.

I understand that all of that information exists. I am trying to determine whether, regardless of the rainfall in an area where a carbon sink forest is going, you will require an entitlement even if there is not a need to irrigate. I imagine that in some areas where there is a high enough rainfall it would be quite possible for a landholder to put in a carbon sink that would not actually require irrigation or the need for an entitlement. I am trying to ascertain what the arrangements would be where the rainfall itself is appropriate to deliver the water necessary for the establishment of that carbon sink forest.

I had one the other day from a farmer who runs a 1,500-acre farm near where I live, between Young and Cowra. This follows on from Senator Milne talking earlier about the fact that these very sensible questions are coming from farmers on the ground. This farmer put to me: ‘In terms of my farm, with all of the increased costs which are going to arise because of the increased inputs for me’—which you have outlined, Minister, so I understand you have a rough idea per acre of how that would work—‘how many acres of trees would I have to plant to offset the increase in my costs from the inputs?’

This one relates to the arrangements that already existed before the amendments. My question this morning was to do with the amendments. My question now relates to the provisions that were already in the bill with regard to forestry.

We are not forcing landholders to engage in planting forests. We are enabling the choice, so people can choose to access the carbon market just as they choose to access other markets as farmers. We are providing an opportunity. It is not obligatory; it is a voluntary opt-in.

Those actions have added to uncertainty over a number of years—most recently since June, from which time you have delayed this debate for months. You delayed it in June. You engaged in procedural games so you did not have to vote on it. You then voted it down in August. What you have been engaging in since it came back into the chamber is the same delay. I do not think anybody is under any illusions. That is fine; you will be held accountable for that political strategy. I disagree with it. I think it is an abrogation of responsibility, but that is your strategy—you can defend it. If there is uncertainty about this policy area, it is not because the government has not been trying to provide certainty. It is because the opposition—which believed it was in the national interest to act on this issue and believed it was in the national interest to pass this bill—is currently engaging in a round of internal division because they do not want to take action on climate change.

We know that managed investment schemes—not something that Senator Wong and her government were responsible for—got out of control. They have impacted on the water market. We now have the issue of the potential impacts of this on the water market and also the whole issue of interception. How will any assessment look holistically at the whole Murray-Darling Basin, for instance, and the water market and its impact on the pricing of water?

That is precisely why we have said we have a policy commitment that would include conditions for forests to have adequate water entitlements and planning approvals. I reference that, in response to Senator Milne and also to Senator Nash earlier today, I said that we see this as being consistent with the National Water Initiative, which, as you will know, included a discussion about the need to license other interceptions—for example, plantations. The states have not moved as far on these issues as many people would have liked. We hope that the states will continue to move forward on complying with their obligations under the National Water Initiative. What we have said here is that we are making a policy commitment to such a regime. Obviously the detail of that is something we do need to work through with the stakeholders.

Just to follow that through, I think she reinforced my point that the Commonwealth should take over the management of water. It just shows you how much confidence I have in the minister that I would rather she take over water than let a number of states run it. At least she is smiling!

There will be a question of what ‘adequacy’ means. Senator Nash raises the question: ‘If you are in an area which is non-irrigated and not regulated, why would you need to have a water entitlement?’ That will be an issue that the government will have to work through. But I think the point you are making is precisely why we wanted to include this, which is that we need to progress water reform but recognise that some parts of that will progress more quickly than others. We can make the requirement to have an adequate water entitlement a condition of credits under this scheme for forests.

In other words, will they have to consider holistically what the impact will be, for instance, on the Murray-Darling Basin?

                                                                                                                      </li>
                                                                                                                     </ul>
                                                                                                                     <p>
                                                                                                                      One of the issues which accounted for the failure of managed investment schemes was that people got a 100 per cent tax deduction for planting trees in areas where they would never grow. They never, ever had sufficient water to be able to grow a forest, but it did not matter to them because it was not for the investors in the end. So the way this is written can actually be read two ways. One way is that in order to get abatement you have to demonstrate that you already have a water entitlement. The other way it could be read is that it is including conditions so that, if you plant a forest, you get adequate water entitlements. But I also want to know if you are going to revisit the issue that you cannot get it unless you are in a rainfall zone or else have water entitlements such that the trees will actually grow. I also want to know if you will be ground-truthing this, however many years down the track, to ensure that the abatement is there. Can you just tell me how, in two, three, five or 10 years down the track, you will get a forest credit for planting a forest? Are they the same provisions as the reforestation provisions in terms of accounting for it?
                                                                                                                     </p>
                                                                                                                     <p>
                                                                                                                      The second thing I want to ask about is planning approvals. Again, this is something that the Commonwealth does not have control over. It is local government that controls planning, and most local governments do not have in their planning schemes anything pertaining to plantation forests, carbon sink forests or any other kind of forest. If you get the ability to declare an area a carbon sink forest or whatever, in the Tasmanian case you just have to get it approved as a forest and local planning laws do not cover it. I want to know what this planning approval is. How is the Commonwealth going to guarantee that the planning approval will be at the local level and not at the state or the Commonwealth level in terms of giving planning approval for these forests?

If the senator is asking the minister with carriage of the bill for a commitment that we are only going to allow local planning approval and not any state or Commonwealth planning process to be relevant, I do not think I can give that commitment. The senator may want us to do that, but that is not the case and that is not what the policy commitment is.
                                                                                                                      </p>

I have to say that I had some difficulty just discerning what you were asking in relation to the first part. In relation to the second, we have made a policy commitment. Yes, we will have to work through the detail on that; I accept that, but part of what was agreed with the opposition was that we would include these additional conditions.

The point that I was making was that the Commonwealth has no power over local government. How are you going to guarantee anything about planning approvals unless you are going to have Commonwealth or state planning override local planning? I simply do not know how you are going to guarantee that when it is not your area of jurisdiction. In terms of the first, the simple point—

I am not an expert on what planning jurisdiction that the Commonwealth has, but what we do have power over under this bill is the issuing of credits, so this goes to what conditions apply to the issuing of those credits under that division.

That is my point. Putting planning approvals in is completely meaningless because we do not know at any level what it is you are intending. So I am asking you: what sorts of planning approvals are we talking about that would need to apply before a person was eligible for a Commonwealth credit?

                                                                                                                          Secondly, in terms of water entitlements, the point I was particularly making was that managed investment schemes allowed for people to get a 100 per cent tax deduction for planting a forest in a place where they knew it would never grow, and it did not matter, because the people who were making the investment and the people who were setting up the investment were making mega profits out of it, and they did not have to worry whether the trees ever grew or not because it was never their intention to be bothered about that end of process.

I also asked you about assessing the carbon in these. I have not read the provision you just quoted on page 243 or whatever it is. What is the review process for determining the volume of carbon in these carbon sink forests and at what interval is that assessment going to be made?

Sequestration, I am advised, will be measured by the national carbon accounting model, which will take into account actual rainfall and the implications for actual sequestration.

The parties to that, the states and the Commonwealth, agreed in relation to water interception that ‘in water systems that are overallocated, fully allocated, or approaching full allocation,’ any proposals for additional interception activities above an agreed threshold size will require a water access entitlement. So the intention was that we would be seeking to require conditions under this regime that were consistent with the National Water Initiative.

There are an awful lot of catchments that have not yet been assessed under the National Water Initiative. Does that mean you cannot get a permit if you are living in a catchment where that has not already been determined?

The question of what is adequate will include consideration of some of those issues. But that level of detail is not in the legislation, Senator, and it would not be normal for it to be. I appreciate your proposition about clarity, but these are requirements and conditions which we have given a policy commitment to, and we will work through with stakeholders as to what specifically constitutes adequate water entitlements because, as you quite rightly point out, that will differ depending on where the forest earning forest credit is located.

Wouldn’t this give a great capacity for a renewable form of carbon stored in cities and buildings all around the nation and all around the world?

These are in the primary legislation. It is a voluntary opt in, which means that you can gain a permit but then, if you choose to harvest, you would have to remit a permit for the equivalent amount—for however much carbon is deemed to be no longer sequestered as a result of harvesting.

That is an issue; it is something Australia has said should reflect better the reality of what occurs in terms of wood products. I make the point, though, that you would also then have to account, for example, for—and this is one of the reasons it has been problematic—what happens when the wood rots and who that is allocated to. The current international accounting rules draw a line. You raised an issue that Australia, under both governments I think, has been discussing in the international context for some time, but the bill before the chamber reflects the current international rules.

We said the proposal had potential as a viable accounting treatment for harvest of wood products post 2012. In the submission we supported New Zealand’s proposal that the approach be applied to wood products harvested from 1 January 2013. I read from the international submission that Australia made:

It will be necessary to ensure that this does not at the same time create leakage for production of short lived wood products to countries not subject to emissions limitations.

In recognition of the scientific reality of carbon sink forests—that, in many cases, they are an inferior storage of carbon to summer grasses—are we now going to go back to that piece of legislation and review it in such a way that it recognises the scientific reality that summer grasses store more carbon than dry sclerophyll forests?

Minister, we would have to go back, using your words, to the scientific reality that carbon sink forests as prescribed in the legislation are an inferior storage of carbon to summer grasses; therefore, we will have to go back to that legislation to bring it into a form that deals with the reality of the carbon it sequestrates. Is the government going to review that legislation to bring it into line with the carbon reality or isn’t it?

You referred to the offsets that you are now discussing but you did not give a clear answer as to whether you are going to review the legislation pertaining to carbon sink forests, brought in by the current government and currently in place, which quite clearly and evidently brings about an inferior sequestration of carbon to what was there prior to that. It is a clear question I am asking. We have a piece of legislation in place now dealing with carbon sink forests which is completely oxymoronic, because we are actually storing less carbon than was originally there. You are going to have to amend the legislation to go back to what it was so that if you really want to store carbon you are going to store it in the form of summer grasses as opposed to dry sclerophyll forests. The question is: are you going to review that piece of legislation? The answer you gave the other night was in relation to what happens from this point forward with regard to carbon offsets for farmers. You said that people can apply for carbon offsets but you did not address the issue of what happens with the current piece of legislation pertaining to carbon sink forests.

The current belief in terms of developing an international agreement says nations such as Australia, the US and others come forward and we make a commitment to the international community that we will reduce our emissions. That is our contribution to the global agreement. Similarly, actions are committed to. We are seeking actions from developing nations; they would be of a different type. Obviously developed countries have already achieved a certain level of development; what we have to do is to have a net reduction. That is what Europe has committed to, what

Therefore, if the CPRS is, as the government wants it to be, the scheme that gets us reducing those emissions and reducing our target then obviously we only want included in it the things that help us meet that target. Otherwise, we sign up to a target as the government and, if we include things in our scheme that do not count towards that target, the government is going to have to make up the difference somehow. That would be a risk to taxpayers, so we do not want to go down that path.

For the things that do not count towards our target but which are valuable anyway—because we know they may be of benefit, we know they can sequester carbon or we know that we want to learn about them by doing—we will create a voluntary market. The non-forestry-vegetation vegetation management currently does not count towards the international commitments. What we are saying is: let’s create a voluntary market where people can buy a green credit that is not in the CPRS if they wish. In the voluntary market they can purchase it for whatever reason. We learn by doing. Then, if and when the international accounting rules enable us to count that, we have a solid base of action and evidence which enables us to bring it into the scheme.

That enables us to work with the sector and with landholders to develop methodologies for the voluntary market, which places us in a much better position when the international community decides that this is a sufficiently proven method that it should be included internationally. Remember: this is also about proving up sequestration opportunities. We cannot just pretend something sequesters carbon; we have to be able to demonstrate it and prove it, and proving it up is an important part of what we are doing.

As I understand, currently, the grasses would not count towards Australia’s target, because we have not elected, for a range of other reasons, to include cropland management in our national inventory.

One brief thing in closing: I understand what you have said about a voluntary green market. That makes abundant sense if that is the process. One thing you did say was that there was an issue of summer grasses sequestering more carbon than a dry sclerophyll forest, if not rainforest timber. It has been suggested that rainforests sequester more, but for that you need in excess of 1,500 millimetres of rain. Dr

This is very important. The intertwining of this tapestry is that if summer grasses sequestrate less carbon than dry sclerophyll forests, then you would have to have a form of forest that is not dry sclerophyll forest but rainforest. That means you would have to go to a form of land that can sustain a rainforest, which means you are heading towards prime agricultural land, at the expense of cane lands, and there are a whole range of issues. I have not seen where the dispute has been raised about dry sclerophyll forests and lesser forests sequestrating less carbon than summer grasses. You keep mentioning that that is a disputed item. I am just curious as to where you get that evidence of a dispute because, for the life of me, I have never seen it.

It is an existential crisis that we face, but the government is authorising the destruction of the biggest hedge against climate change that nature gives us in Australia. It is not just an absurdity but it is an irreconcilable piece of irresponsibility by this government. The minister volunteered that there will be voluntary consideration of projects which have this effect. She was responding to Senator Joyce talking about summer grasses, but I am talking about an already in place hedge against climate change which is massive—the biggest natural one that we know of on land in Australia—and I just want to know if the minister has done the arithmetic on the research which shows what the carbon would be worth if landowners—let us go to private landowners outside the regional forest agreement—want to protect their tall eucalypt forests or rainforests from the option of logging? What is the carbon market going to offer those landholders, and what incentive is the government going to give to landholders in private forests—if governments cannot do it themselves in state owned forests—to forbear logging and burning and converting into massive greenhouse gas emissions the natural forests of Australia?

What is the incentive if you do a far better thing for climate change and do not knock the forest down in the first place and, by the way, add another gift to the nation by protecting biodiversity, because nearly always these forests are the habitat of rare and endangered plants or animal species? So, I just ask the minister: can she see an absurdity in a projected gift to people who log forests and then replace them with some form of regrowth rather than there being a direct assistance from government or the market to protect forests that are already standing, have been accreting carbon for centuries and are doing the best possible job we could want in an age of greenhouse gas emissions and dangerous climate change?

Part 10 in the original bill—it is in the definition section, section 5—requires that as at 31 December 1989 the land stand was clear of trees. This is what is known as a Kyoto forest, I think. That deals with the incentive issue that you raised.
                                                                                                                                                        </p>

There is not a suggestion that people could knock down trees now and then put in place a forest and get a credit. That is a separate policy issue to the policy issue you are putting, which is your party’s policy of opposition to forest management or forestry. I understand that, but that is not the government’s position. The government’s position is to maintain the regional forest agreements and to seek to strike that balance between productive use and conservation use.

We are opposed to the gross dereliction of custodianship in the mismanagement we see in those logged forests, particularly those spurred by the woodchip industry at the moment. The minister has effectively answered the question: if you protect your forests you do not have a look-in. Is it not right that under the Kyoto arrangements people who logged forests after 31 December 1989 were not to get any reward for it because they were actually converting carbon resources into something less, forever?

I know why you want to use that example, but this is about the measures we can put in place to encourage the reduction in Australia’s emissions as our contribution to fighting climate change. I know the philosophical position that some of the Greens have—which says we should not reward people for past behaviour—but we also need to think about how we give people an incentive to sequester carbon now. We are not putting in an incentive for people to knock down trees. We have made it clear that it is only land which has already been cleared. You cannot now say, ‘We are going to include it up until the end of this year and, therefore, if the Senate passes the scheme I will knock my forest down, replant it and get a credit.’ That is not what this provision says; it says if you have already legally cleared it. Whatever you might say about that, Senator Brown, the fact is that it was cleared. You may say that it should not have been cleared, it was wrong, it was political et cetera, but whatever the reason for it we are saying there is a net benefit to the environment if we enable credit for people allowing forests to grow on that land. That is a net benefit to the environment. That is why we have allowed credit for regrowth on forested land to be part of this agreement.

It is absurd to give them credit for the plantation that is growing there, which will never get back the carbon and methane that has been lost out of the original, natural forest. Now suddenly in this legislation all those people who were told, ‘You cannot do that because it would be wrong; it would be an immoral accounting trick,’ are being told, ‘We’re going to reward you.’ The coalition may have come in and convinced the government that is a good thing. One should not be surprised, because the logging lobby, the

I have two direct questions here which the minister might answer. Is the government allowing avoided deforestation credits in this program? Is it allowing offset credits for regrowth on deforested land? I think the minister has already said yes to the second question.

I had a rather long discussion with Senator Milne about the first question, and we do say we are prepared to include avoided deforestation. Senator Milne and I—you may not have been in the chamber, Senator Brown—had a discussion about the fact that we would require robust methodology for that. I acknowledge that is a complex issue, but we are saying it could be included subject to that methodology being created.

If you start from the proposition, ‘This clearing was bad so we should just make sure that no-one who now owns land that was cleared can do anything about it,’ then your proposition flows. The government does not think that is a sensible way forward. Regardless of what one thinks about the reasons for past clearing, surely there is environmental and policy merit in giving landholders an incentive to sequester carbon through regrowth forests. Whether or not they should have been cleared is a separate policy argument, and obviously one’s answer to that will depend on the factual circumstances because they would not be the same on every occasion. But, if this land is already cleared and we can give landholders an incentive to contribute to the solution on climate change, may I suggest that is a pretty sensible approach?

The woodchip and logging industry has got this government, against the public interest, to fail to reward those people because it involves large areas of publicly owned forest. It is the public, the average person in Australia, who is losing out massively in this whole deal, whichever way you look at it. We know about the $6 billion being transferred out of households across to big industry under the coalition’s pressure, on top of the $16 billion already going to the big polluters. This program is another case where good-hearted Australians, even on private land, who want to protect old-growth forests get nothing and those who log forests and start growing seedlings of some sort get rewarded. That is plainly absurd and it is culpable. It is illogical and unforgivable behaviour from the government in an age of climate change.

Can the minister give an estimate of the potential reward, in a carbon-trading era, that will go to those forest managers? I am sorry I mentioned Gunns before. They are going to be the recipient of a huge windfall before this is through, but mentioning them has upset the minister’s sensibilities so I will just ask a general question. What is the value of this amendment—which the government has accepted from the opposition—going to be in windfall gains to those people who did the wrong thing and cut down standing forests in the last 20 years, knowing full well that that would pour massive amounts of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere?

That is not an incentive for clearance now. I think that covers the issues you raised.

Minister, one would presume that there is more carbon sequestrated in a big tree than a small tree. Under this, when a small tree becomes a big tree, do we get a credit for that?

So what? 1989, 1990 or 2008—it really does not matter. If you leave country vacant, it will revegetate. It is the natural occurrence in Australia. It does that all the time in Australia. There are vast amounts of country in Australia. If you do not keep vegetation control in play, the country revegetates. It is just the way eucalyptus country works. I can show you an abundance of country that was cleared about 1920 or 1930, and when that country is left alone it revegetates with trees. So are we saying that you have to have made a decision to keep the stock off it or to keep off mechanisms of human induced timber control? That is what it is: human induced timber control. You go out there and Velpar it or, before that was available, Graslan it. If you want to completely clear it, you run a chain across it to keep the country clear—because if you do not then it just turns into a forest and therefore you lose all the value of your land because you cannot run stock on it—or you pack it up with sheep. You might pack it up with wethers, for instance, that flog the country out and keep the timber down.

If it goes back under timber by that process, it appears—I am trying to get to where you are—that that is not human induced. I read into it that you have to actually plant the trees.

What you have been talking about is afforestation or reforestation, and clearly the circumstance which Senator Joyce has outlined would not qualify as reforestation under the rules. But the question I asked this morning on avoided deforestation was precisely this question that Senator Joyce has just asked, and I was asking it in terms of the baseline. You would have to assume that, if a farmer did as Senator Joyce was just saying and made a decision this year not to go and reclear land—or to take the stock off or whatever—in order that it regrow, you would have to know that in making that decision you would qualify for avoided deforestation, because five or 10 years down the track you will have your forest growing there and you would want the credits for that. Otherwise you would keep on clearing it, grazing it or doing what you were doing to it.
                                                                                                                                                                                      </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                      <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                       So that is why I asked the question about baselines and avoided deforestation. This is a critical issue for people to know about, because it is going to influence their land use decisions from here on in. That is why I would like to know whether the scenario that Senator Joyce has just outlined would qualify for avoided deforestation. I am going to come back to the accounting in a minute, but I just wanted to follow up, because that is precisely what Senator Joyce is asking. I just wanted to follow it up in the context of avoided deforestation.

I have indicated to you what the legislation says. It also refers to regulations. Other than that, you are really asking me to tell you what a court would say ‘direct, human induced methods’ means. The legislation says:

I explained to the senator that the offset integrity committee would be charged with the methodologies for the offsets, including avoided deforestation. Those methodologies would be established in accordance with the act, if passed, and the proposed act does refer to additionality at 259K(2)(c), which I referred the senator to this morning. I again read it:

What you are asking me to do is to second-guess how the committee, if this legislation were passed, would approach its job in determining what methodology should apply to give effect to that statutory commitment.

We prefer not to wait. The whole idea of waiting for a court interpretation shows the litigious nature of what can happen if things are not clearly spelt out. The farmers listening to this do not want to have, if this goes through, to wander off to court to get their credits. What they want to do is to know that the process that they believe that they are following to get a credit is applicable. They do not want to then find that their land is all revegetated and they cannot touch it—they cannot take it back to grazing land—yet they cannot get the credits for what is there. That leaves them in a real quandary. Obviously, therefore, the safest way for farmers to go about it—seeing that, as you state, the interpretation would be that of the courts—is to not let it revegetate.

In order to ensure that people understand it, Senator, we propose to establish regulations. That is referred to in the legislation as well. My reference to a court was not because I want people to go to court; I was making the point that you are asking me to provide an interpretation now. We want to be absolutely clear with landholders about what their rights and obligations would be if they chose. And I again say that people only do this if they wish to—you might roll your eyes, Senator, but that is true; they do not have to do this. The regulations will be consistent with what I have read out from the legislation.

You do not have to state the point that it is opt in; we understand that. We have that part well and truly booked out. What we are querying here is the issues for the people who do opt in. We want to know what human induced means are. The only answer that I have gotten so far that seems to go towards the issue is that you have got regulations to come that we at this point in time have not seen.
                                                                                                                                                                                             </p>

To be honest, it is far cheaper for me to leave the land alone, and it has been cleared for years, it will revegetate. The answer that I want to know is: is that a human induced means of revegetation or is that natural? If it is natural then I will not do it. If you are saying that the regulations are yet to come then the whole point of this legislation becomes opaque and implausible, because we do not know what we are talking about. We will have to send it to a committee—especially when the regulations turn up. If the regulations are not right, we will have to disallow the regulations and, if we disallow the regulations, the whole legislation falls over. So it is really important for you, the minister, to be able to clarify this at this point in time. If you are going to answer the question, give me a nod and I will sit down. If you are not going to answer it, I will go to the next question.

In terms of the quip about regulations, it is quite normal practice—and the senator knows this—for delegated or subordinate legislation to come after the primary legislation. That is not an unusual situation. In terms of the senator saying to me, ‘Well, we had better tell him now; otherwise, when the regs come along, the whole scheme will follow.’ But the senator has made it clear that he is going to vote for this no matter what. So, I appreciate his concern, but he has already decided that, no matter what I say in this chamber, he is not going to vote for it, because he does not believe that Australia should take action on climate change. He can come in and ask questions all he likes and I will continue to answer them as best I can, but everybody knows he is not going to support it.

Has the committee got any time frame in mind for bringing the discussion of this set of amendments, which has occupied much time, to a conclusion, or is it proposed that this simply go on ad infinitum—that is, forever?

I will draw a simile there. That is like saying that you are not starving a child if you choose not to feed it, but quite obviously you are. You are making a conscious decision that brings about an outcome. If a farmer makes a conscious decision not to maintain their vegetation management program there is then human induced reasoning behind its revegetation. What you are saying is that that is not the case. That means that, obviously, the only way to get a credit is for farmers not to let nature do it by itself. They have to actually go out and plant exactly the same trees that would grow there naturally in any case and incur the cost. For the life of me that is nonsensical; it is illogical.

Do you have the tables before you so that we can see which tree is the most effective to plant? Since we cannot let nature do its job and we have to plant it, we had better have calibrations on which is the most effective tree. Also, if it is going to be scientifically relevant I suppose we had better start planting imported trees, and if we do that let’s not worry about the biological nexus between native animals and the environment—we will just plant the most carbon effective tree. It might be the sequoia—the California redwood. Do we have a range of these? Are there certain types of trees we can plant? Are they all the same? Is there a differentiation between trees? Do we have that scientific evidence before us?

In relation to the assessment of sequestration, I am advised that the landholders who are interested in opting into this process will be able to estimate, through utilising the National Carbon Accounting Toolbox, the likely sequestration opportunities on their land for different species and for the type of land.

It is also a metaphor that is used all the time in literary concepts to show that you are precluding the propensity of a subject arising, and that subject arising also has all sorts of forms of metaphor incurred.

I imagine that is going to be done by satellite mapping. Is that correct?

Senator Joyce just raised the national carbon accounting system. I presume that you are proposing to use NCAS as the tool and, if so, how are you going to deal with the situation where the model is clearly flawed, as it is with old-growth forests? Also, how are you going to deal with future improvements in the modelling? Does everyone get the benefit—or ‘disbenefit’—of model upgrades, or is the government going to take all the residual risk?

You said this is the national carbon accounting system but you made reference to old-growth forests. Obviously for this discussion—that is, land legally cleared previously—old-growth forests were not relevant. So I am not sure what your point is on that.

As everybody would be aware, under the current accounting you do not have to account for the emissions from logging the forests and that is the problem we have had all along: you can get the benefit of afforestation but you do not pay the penalty for logging a forest if there is no change of land use. That has been our big issue and that is something we have argued for years and years. I understood from our discussion the other night that the government intends to argue for full carbon accounting. Can the minister clarify whether or not the government is going to start asking, campaigning or negotiating for full carbon accounting in the international negotiations? How is that going to change the methodology as it pertains to this

The issue that gave rise to the discussion about NCAS was for the purposes of determining what was on land that was previously cleared. That was the context of the discussion. For that purpose, some of the issues Senator Milne raises are not relevant to the proposition before the chamber. We do not accept Senator Milne’s suggestion that the model is flawed and I do not want people to believe that my silence on that is acquiescence.

Not only would emasculation be a breach of standing order 203(b); it might even bring a cessation of standing orders.

Yes, we certainly do intend to vote on them. They are very important amendments which will substantially improve the scheme that the minister originally brought forward to this chamber. If these amendments are not passed today, is the minister suggesting that the government would vote against them if they were brought up at a later time? I find it a strange proposition that, if the scheme came back, the government would vote against them. We certainly do want to vote on these very important amendments. When are we going to do that? When senators have had their questions answered and are confident that the amendments are appropriate and in accord with what their constituents are seeking.

Could the minister elaborate on what she called ‘windfall gains’ under the domestic offsets program?

The only thing that was in there before was reforestation and afforestation. Now the whole shebang is in there. Because it is so hugely complex, it requires a lot more discussion and none of it is settled because it is all part of the international negotiations anyway in terms of what is going to happen with REDD into the future.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                    I ask about these particular permits that the minister is talking about in the abatement. In the case of avoided deforestation and also in the case of the national carbon offset standards, I want to know whether the calculations are going to be based on a model. If so, will it be the National Carbon Accounting System or will it be based on a measurement? I would like an answer to that. If it is based on the model, how are you going to calculate the disbenefits over time as the model is recalculated or reframed? The minister would be well aware that for the last several months I have been trying to get the maps which demonstrate the Kyoto forests. The government have indicated time and time again that they will provide those maps but that they just need more time and so on. We still do not have them. These are the maps which are supposed to be the basis that enables your calculations of what was standing in 1990, what the progress has been, where forests have been lost et cetera. We still do not have them. Mr Temporary Chairman Bernardi, I know you will be shocked to learn that that is the case.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                    How can you have confidence in what the government says is going to be achieved in measuring carbon in situ if you cannot have confidence that the methodology is accurate in the first place? Since Australia has made so much globally of meeting its Kyoto target because of avoided land clearance, there should be the maps and a proper accounting system to demonstrate the claims that Australia is making. I want to know whether we are going to go with a model or a measurement. I would like to know when we can expect to get the maps that we are continually promised and have not got. It will be critical for anyone who imagines they are going to get permits under this system that there be proper, verified carbon on the ground and that there be a calculation over time.

If somebody gets a CPRS permit or a national carbon offset under the scheme that is proposed and there are emissions as opposed to sequestration, is the landowner going to pay for those emissions or is the government going to absorb that? How is that going to work? As we all know, that variation from year to year will be huge. Will people be issued with credits one year and have to pay a liability the next? Will it be averaged over five years? Who will pay the liability if you have a credit for establishing something and then it disappears?

In relation to your first point about needing a lot of time on this, I accept that. I was just asking if it was envisaged we would get to any resolution after some 20 hours of debate—whether we would actually be able to vote on it. In relation to the National Carbon Accounting System, I reject one implication, which is that the National Carbon Accounting System does not include measurement. My advice is that it does. It is also a model. We think it is a very sound accounting system, particularly given the size of this country. If we want to properly measure these things, we need to have methods which enable us to look at the broad scale of the Australian landscape. In relation to the maps, I understand we have tabled an answer on that and given you an indication as to our view about that. Finally, again, your question really goes to the methodology for whether it is avoided deforestation. That goes back to the need to develop a test for the methodology around additionality, and that would be a matter for the committee.

To date, I do not think there is anywhere anyone can go. There are so many people who have been asking to see this information, this data, and it is simply not there. No state government, landholder or parliamentarian can actually interrogate this information that the government claims is there in relation to the maps and where the carbon is on the ground, where the Kyoto forests are and where the deforestation is.

If we are going to a scheme that expands what we already have—that starts to give credits for avoided deforestation and establishes a national carbon offset standard for enhanced forest management and credits for regrowth forest on deforested land—we want to be able to see the maps of the deforested land right now so we know what we are dealing with. At the moment we cannot get the high-resolution maps to look at it. We keep getting told one thing or another, but I think it is only a matter of time before the international community say to Australia: ‘Let us look at the maps. Let’s actually have a look and see where these Kyoto forests are and where your avoided deforestation claims are going to come from.’ There is a long way to go before we get the ‘robust methodologies’ that the minister is talking about.

Presumably, if we are going to provide credits for regrowth forests on deforested land as of 31 December 2008 we have to have maps across Australia for what was forested or not forested at the end of December last year, and in a resolution sufficiently high for people to be able to look at them and say, ‘Yes, that’s right,’ or ‘No, that’s not right.’ Minister, when are we going to get the maps, even for 31 December last year as the baseline, that you were telling Senator Brown and the whole country about in terms of being able to sit down and say, ‘That’s where the forests are now’?

In relation to the natural disturbance issue, I am advised as follows: permits are issued for net sequestration. Permits are issued up to a limit that takes account of the risk of reversal as a result of natural disturbances such as pests and fires. The regime contemplates a buffer essentially being withheld by government, which essentially can be best understood as an insurance against the sorts of scenarios that you have outlined.

Now we are getting somewhere on that. It says that if a landholder applies for

How many years after you plant is abatement to be demonstrated?

You said that the amount that will be paid takes into account the possible loss. Does that mean that there is a calculation of the total amount and then a percentage of that is withheld over time? Is that basically what you are saying?

The risk of reversal buffer would be in the form of a small deduction each time permits are issued.

In addition, during the early years of forest growth the amount of total carbon storage and therefore potential carbon that could be lost due to natural disturbance is relatively low.

Buffers could be amended over time to reflect changed circumstances.

I would like in particular to go to ‘manure management’—a phrase I am finding rather ironic at this point. Minister, could you inform the Senate—and I have tried to find some more detail and I do apologise if it is somewhere and I have not found it yet—of what the exact process will be for manure management? All of these areas are quite a concern to farmers with respect to how they are actually going to access the assistance through these offsets. What are the processes? How will it actually work? If a farmer comes to me and says, ‘Senator Nash, what do I have to do as a farmer to get the permit for that manure management area?’ How will the process actually work?

They have been included by virtue of the fact that they can count towards Australia’s international targets. However, whether it is this, fertiliser use, savanna burning, rice cultivation and so forth, we are establishing under this legislation a framework that sets out clear statutory requirements and a statutory committee which would then work with stakeholders—such as some of the ones I read out who are currently working with government on these and associated issues—in order to determine the methodology for what would be required to qualify as a credit.

I do appreciate that. I do understand that the methodology process has not been got to yet, but I am simply trying to understand what has to be done with the manure to qualify. There must, obviously, have been some consideration by the government up to this point to even be including manure management in there. I understand the methodology has not been determined as yet, but I guess I am after a definition of what ‘manure management’ actually is.

I am sure farmers would be interested to know whether after a rainy day they are supposed to get out a harrow and run around the paddock and harrow in all the manure or whether they are supposed to rake it up somewhere and burn it or maybe put it in a big pile somewhere and do something else with it. It is a very genuine question because the minister obviously is not able to manage that. I appreciate that it is very complex legislation, but it is on the list. As a Nationals senator—even though, as the minister says, I have indicated very strongly my view that this tax should not go forward—it is entirely appropriate that I ask these questions on behalf of farmers. I think that they will be extremely disappointed, to say the least, that the minister is not able to give any clear indication of what that manure management is going to be.

I think you referred to them before as ‘gibos’; I was not quite sure. I do apologise if you mentioned a number, but you indicated to the chamber that it had not yet been determined how many of those reporters would be in place. Just in terms of agriculture, could the minister perhaps indicate to the chamber very roughly how many of those persons would be in place to provide that reporting mechanism for the farmers?

On each of those farms, under their farming practices, they may be able to identify an offset that they might have that they might want to claim. They would then have to go through the entire process that we have been discussing all morning. Given hypothetically we could have the situation where nearly 140,000 farms would be putting forward their claim for offset at the same time, it seems a little bit odd that the government has no idea at this stage how many of those audit reporters are going to be needed. One would imagine, having that quantum of farming practices in mind, there would be at least some indication from government that they have done some work in determining how many of those reporters would be needed.

The minister said she had tabled an answer to my question about the maps, and the answer is always: ‘Give us more time. We need more time to produce these maps.’ Yet in the global negotiations on the reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation Australia is arguing strongly for NCAS. The government are spruiking NCAS all the time. Yet there are a lot of people in Australia who have real doubts about the accuracy of the National Carbon Accounting System. For example, the Queensland government says its maps show a larger level of deforestation than is reflected in the NCAS figures et cetera. I would like to know why we cannot have the maps before Copenhagen so that people in Australia who are very familiar with what is happening on the ground—state governments especially—can actually look at their maps and figures compared with the national map and figures and get some understanding of why there is a discrepancy between what state governments believe to be the case and what is reflected by the National Carbon Accounting System. That is why we want the high-resolution maps as soon as possible.

If it is good enough to go to Copenhagen and tell the rest of the world they should have confidence in the National Carbon Accounting System, the very least that should happen is that the maps be on the table here in Australia. I do not think it is satisfactory for the minister not to produce the maps.

I have looked at the amendments before us and cannot find these changes. Maybe I have missed the obvious, Minister, and I will stand corrected on that. But I note that page 8 of the agreement of 24 November, under a box entitled ‘Implementation’, refers to other environmental enhancements to be included via amendments in 2010. Can the minister confirm that, in relation to legacy waste, that will be the subject of other amendments or is it covered under the amendments before us?

I will just get some advice; please wait a moment. Now I understand the confusion. That and other environmental enhancements to be included via amendments in 2010 relate to the water entitlement planning approval and other issues referenced in the paragraph above. Subsection (3) of the amendments before the chamber deals with landfill facilities. Is that the provision you were having trouble finding? It is at page 10. I just had trouble finding it too, but we have now found it.

It is the case that we are setting up a new market scheme which will enable Australia to reduce its contribution to climate change for the first time. It is the case that, if you have a much narrower scheme, you do have the issue you have just raised. We have therefore sought to bring forward a scheme that has as broad a coverage as is practicable.

They have expressed concern that one of the stated conditions of accessing these offsets will be additionality and they are concerned that early movers, who have invested in power generation and abatement infrastructure under existing abatement schemes, are unlikely to meet the additionality requirements imposed under the rules. Does the minister concede that those early adopters could be prejudiced because they will not be able to deal with the whole issue of additionality? It has been put to me by one particular legacy waste gas industry member that they will be looking at shutting down existing plants because those plants do not comply with the additionality requirement—because the plant has already been set up. Is this an unintended consequence, or a perverse outcome, of what is being proposed on offsets?

So that is the concern. So my question is: does the minister consider that any site that has existing power generation or gas extraction infrastructure would not be considered additional under international rules? In other words, will infrastructure not be eligible unless it has been installed specifically in order to create offsets under this new scheme?

I might ask my officials to provide me with an answer shortly. But again I say that the fact that a project already exists, of itself, does not mean that it cannot meet the additionality test. But it would need to meet the additionality test, and the public policy reason for that is clear: there is no point in giving people an incentive through an offset regime if they would have done it anyway. I am not talking about this particular company; I am talking about it as a general proposition. I will find out if I can provide any further detail.

Does that mean that existing landfill waste gas projects may have difficulty in selling permits in Australia? It has been put to me by those in the industry that, should they relocate offshore, they could definitely sell permits back to Australia, so that could lead to an outcome where there is a greater incentive for these plants to be set up in Malaysia, for instance, rather than here in Australia. Is that a potential consequence of the way that this amendment is structured in terms of a policy outcome?

I have also said to you that the fact that a project is already in existence and was subsidised under the GGAS does not of itself prevent that project from meeting an additionality requirement. But it would need to meet that additionality requirement. Again I say that that makes public policy sense; there is no point in providing a financial incentive for action that would have occurred anyway. It is a factual decision, based on what the Domestic Offsets Integrity Committee outlines, as to whether or not something would have occurred anyway.

The minister makes the point that additionality is required under this scheme even though it is for existing projects—I have not misunderstood that. The point that has been put to me by the industry is that if they cannot comply with additionality then it would be easier for them to go offshore and sell their permits back to Australia. That is what has been put to me in unequivocal terms—it would be easier for them to close down—or not build new plants here—and go overseas to do the same thing there and get credit for it that way.

I do not want to make, by fiat, a decision in this chamber about what a company would or would not be entitled to. If the argument about additionality is that you would not have done this if you did not get the offsets, then I would have thought that was prima facie evidence that it would be an argument for additionality. You do not want people to gain this, Senator, and I am sure you would not be supportive of that. Leaving aside the factual scenario, because I do not know all the detail in relation to that particular company, in relation to an offset, if the argument is that this project would not be carried out in the absence of the issue of free units in accordance with this program then surely, if they are genuinely, credibly and demonstrably in a situation where that project would not be carried out in the absence of the units, then that would assist in meeting the additionality test.

It also makes reference to a climate change adaptation fund and international efforts to restore terrestrial carbon. Perhaps, in the context of these amendments, the minister can respond on notice to the extent to which the Wentworth Group’s concerns would be covered in these amendments. I do not want to take it any further than that at this stage.

We believe that there should be 100 per cent auctioning of these permits. This is an absolutely critical matter for us and I indicate to the committee that this is a matter on which we will seek a division later.

I cannot understand for the life of me why the government would not seek to get the economic and financial benefit of the permit through an auctioning process rather than by allocating so many free permits. Once you go down this path of a combination, as the minister has clearly chosen to do in the scheme, then you get into a situation where it is highly complex. There is pressure on government decision making and you get rent-seeking behaviour. If ever we have seen rent-seeking behaviour in Australia, it has been from all of the companies who are here declaring why they should get free permits and from the coalition going into bat saying: ‘Yes, even more free permits. Every player should win a prize here, everyone should get free permits, more free permits and more free permits on top of that.’

It deprives the government of the economic benefit which would accrue from the full 100 per cent auctioning of the permits, which they could use, as Professor Garnaut noted, to address some of the market failures in the development of new low-emission technologies. We have had endless debates in this chamber; the government argues constantly against a gross national feed-in tariff saying, ‘Why should the community have to pay an equivalent amount? It is a regressive tax et cetera’, in order to provide a benefit to low-emission and new breakthrough technologies. So it continues to oppose it and argues that the renewable energy target is enough.

We argue that we do not have the money to do it, and here we have a perfect income stream with which to do it and the government has chosen, in a most unfair way, to shoot the benefit to the people who have caused the problem—the big polluters who get these free permits and to all the associated rent seekers. In the case of the energy-intensive trade-exposed, there is no set of underlying principles, which goes to the compensation behaviour. So it has become a political auction, not an auction in terms of what ought to be occurring—that is, that everybody should have to purchase their permits and then the government would have the revenue which it could then use to encourage new technologies. It would have a revenue stream to assist, for example, in meeting our obligations to mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. It would also have an income stream which it could use to pay cash payments, if it chose to do so, to some of the polluters. It could also recognise that it could go for accelerated depreciation on new investment in some of those instances whereby they reduce their emissions. It would actually place the cash in the government’s hands to start wit, to actually drive the low-carbon to zero-carbon economy.

Instead, we will give these free permits out in increasing and vastly increased quantities to coal fired generators, to the energy-intensive trade-exposed and so on out there. We are giving out the free permits.’ Does that mean that they will not pass on that price rise to the customers? No, of course it does not. They will get something for nothing and they will continue to pass on a higher price. The higher price will be compensated in part by the government’s compensation package to low- and middle-income earners, but we have already seen that almost $6 billion out of that compensation package was taken directly out of the pockets of consumers and put into the pockets of these coal fired generators and energy-intensive trade-exposed. For the life of me, I cannot understand why a government which says it is committed to principles of fairness and social justice wants to have one of the largest wealth transfers in Australian history across to the people who have caused the problem. There is no justification for it, as Professor Garnaut noted in his review:

Professor Garnaut goes on to talk about that in the review.

It could have used the money to support R&amp;D, commercialisation and scale-up of new technologies. It could perhaps have allocated some of the money to the overseas commitments we are going to have as part of a fair financial mechanism.

We would like to know where the money is coming from, since the government have chosen to give free permits to the big polluters rather than having the money to allocate to whatever cause they chose in terms of meeting the carbon challenge—including some cash payments, some accelerated depreciation and some mechanisms to assist some of the big polluters to make the transition that they need to make. Instead, they have locked in coal fired power.

All the business analysts are now recognising that, far from driving the transformation, the government’s new arrangements actually lock in the generators to coal fired power well beyond 2020. As I indicated in this debate on Friday, the emissions trajectory from Australia’s energy sector does not come down, even under the government’s analysis, until 2034—and that is way, way too late to address the problem.

As they will all tell you, there is no money at the moment and no incentive under the Renewable Energy Target Scheme for geothermal, solar thermal, wave power and that next tranche of technologies which cannot at the moment compete with wind, for example, let alone coal, and will not be able to do so unless there is some money out there to actually assist them to scale up and do this. This was the opportunity to have the cash, and it is not there. There is a preference to give it to the big polluters rather than to use it in the national interest.

Australia is one of the world’s most carbon-intensive economies. To reduce our contribution to climate change we have to change the way our economy works. That is not an easy task. If it were easy, previous governments would have done it. If it were easy, we would not have this Senate still debating this issue some nine months or so after the draft legislation was first released.

In trying to strike that balance we have consulted widely; we have spoken to industry, to

I just want to make this point, because it is a very important point: if you look at the percentage of auctioning as the marker of an environmentally effective scheme, the scheme before the committee, even with the amendments that have been negotiated with the opposition, has a higher level of auctioning than the European Union’s scheme when it first started, or even in its second phase, and a significantly higher level of auctioning than the scheme that is currently before the United States congress.

It is not until phase 3, which I am advised does not commence until post 2012, where you would have a majority of auction permits. The scheme that is currently before the US congress—the Waxman-Markey scheme—and also, I am advised, the Senate bill, has 85 per cent allocation. So, what is that—15 per cent auctioning to start with? So the proposition that somehow we have gone way beyond where other nations have gone is simply factually incorrect.

The emissions-intensive trade-exposed sector we anticipate would be around 30 per cent or less at the outset. I think the electricity sector adjustment scheme is in the order of six per cent of permits and you have the additional permits for coal. But the majority of permits will still be auctioned.

There is a lot of talk—and the senator used the phrase ‘rent seeking’—about people coming to government seeking assistance for the transition. Why does anybody think that changing how you implement a carbon price is going to resolve that issue? Firms are still going to ask for assistance, it will just be in a different form. Under Senator Milne’s scheme it would be in the form of cash, as opposed to permits. Under a carbon tax it would be around how that tax was levied, the quantum of it and who could get exemptions from it or how that would work. These policy issues are not avoided, because they are central; they are about how we best and most fairly share the costs of moving to a lower carbon economy.

My advice is that in excess of 40 per cent of the revenue goes back to Australian households. In fact, I think it is more than that when you add the proportion of household assistance which would be provided through the fuel tax offset, which I know the senator opposes. I make that point because I think there seemed to be in Senator Milne’s contribution some suggestion that this is wildly at odds with what the rest of the world is doing. Actually, we are doing quite well if you regard the percentage of auctioning at the outset as a marker of the environmental effectiveness of the scheme.

We have invested a very large amount of money in clean energy initiatives. My recollection is that just in the Solar Flagships program there is $1.5 billion or $1.6 billion and there is some $460 million in Renewables Australia, and a four-fold increase in the renewable energy target. These are not investments that can simply be waved away, and we make no apology for the transitional assistance in this bill—absolutely none. This is about supporting existing jobs at the same time as giving the incentive for those industries to become more efficient and for Australian companies to invest in clean energy projects and lower carbon goods and services.

The senator chose to focus on the emissions-intensive trade-exposed program. This is a set of amendments that provides assistance in cash. We do not believe that is the appropriate way of providing assistance. We also suggest that the provisions add significant complexity to the EITE—emissions-intensive trade-exposed—regime. It also does not deal with the issue for business, which is how you manage the hedging against the carbon price. One of the benefits of providing assistance in permits is that there is an inbuilt hedge because the value of the permit correlates with the carbon price. If you are providing assistance in cash, one would anticipate that if the carbon price is higher than anticipated at the time that the cash is provided you will get companies seeking additional cash assistance from government.

We do not agree with these. We have consciously sought to have a measured start to the scheme. We do want to give business and the community time to adjust to the introduction of a carbon price. That is why we have a fixed price and a price cap for the first four years. We think that is an important transitional assistance.

I believe the Prime Minister said that we all should kick in $10 billion. I do not know what that is, but let us assume that it is another $4 billion, $5 billion or $10 billion—whatever. What frightens me about this proposition is how you get out of it. Once you have established that the permits have a value and the value becomes a property right, if this emissions trading scheme turns to custard, as it probably will, how do we as a nation extract ourselves from it? Do we have to go in and buy every permit that may be worth $50 or $60? These are considerable amounts of money. No-one has got a crystal ball and knows whether this will work. Many think it will not work and that it should not be done until after an agreement has been reached at Copenhagen. Most people do not see any point in doing it unless the other countries in the world do it.

Last week—senators may be able to tell me—I think they ruled out 162 industries, so they have highly qualified their ETS and reduced it by 162 industries. But we are bravely galloping ahead with this. What happens if all these things fail? What happens if no-one else comes in and it is only the EU? They will then have an ETS when you do not have an ETS. What happens if America does not come in? How do we get out of this? How do we escape or do we just say: ‘Gee, wasn’t that a shocking decision; that was a costly one. We’ll let that $120 billion go through to the keeper’?

Do we go out and buy all those millions of permits back? Who pays for that? This is why the popularity of this scheme is going down like a brick. A week ago 54 per cent of people did not want it till after Copenhagen and 34 per cent did. This week it is 60 per cent that do not want it and 27 per cent that do. While we are talking, the popularity of this scheme is reducing and reducing. As people understand this more and more, they become more and more frightened. Senator Wong has not been able to sell this. I understand why she has not been able to sell it: it is a dog. You cannot sell it, so you want to get this scheme through as quickly as you can—saddle up the people with $120 billion worth of debt, with another $4 billion or $5 billion for the developing countries—and there is no escape route. Once you put it in there is nowhere to go that I can see. Up at Yabula last Thursday, I think, 1,200 people lost their jobs because of an ETS. Sixty-odd lost their jobs in Rockhampton in a cement factory. That is just, as I said, the canary in the mine. An ETS has not even hit yet, but just the threat of an ETS is costing a lot of people their jobs. Surely you are not going to saddle Australia up with this, with no way to get out of it. I would be very interested in the minister’s reply.

Australia today has said that should such a fast-start fund come into being, then it should be governed by the following principles. Firstly, fast-start assistance should represent a substantial increase on existing climate change funding allocations, and use existing distribution channels to ensure fast-start finance is not delayed. Second, focus on the most vulnerable, least developed countries. A large number of these are small island states.

Fourth, to focus mitigation finance on time-critical activities, including reducing deforestation and forest degradation, otherwise called REDD. And fifth, increase the capacity of developing countries to absorb significantly scaled-up climate finance in the post-2012 funding arrangements, including through leveraging private investment flows.

It is an important issue because, as I have said, there are many of these small island states who face absolute calamity. To come to your first question regarding the number of permits, at a five per cent cap in 2020, initial permits as at 2011 are estimated to be 450 million. The permits have to be acquitted under the scheme, which means you do not necessarily have to build up a large excess pool.

It was a meeting of the G20 finance ministers, who were pushing very hard for a decision to be made there and then in advance of Copenhagen. The decision they wanted agreement on I think was an expenditure of some US$150 billion annually by the developed countries. Treasurer Swan quite correctly said that there was no way that Australia could contribute prior to Copenhagen—there was no way that Australia could make that commitment prior to Copenhagen. He said that we should wait until after the meeting in Copenhagen before any commitment should be made by Australia. That is critically important, because any reasonable, rational person would agree with him.

The reason many of the European countries are low carbon emitters is due to their reliance on nuclear power for electricity generation. For example, 80 per cent of France’s electricity is generated by nuclear means. On the very same weekend as the meeting, 7-8 November, the Labour government in the

So the Europeans were trying to wedge countries like Australia, making the observation that we should be committing. The figure that I have seen advertised that Australia should make as our contribution is some $7 billion annually. We could find ourselves in the ironic position that China, being one of the developing countries, could be the recipient of Australia’s $7 billion annually, and who would we look to to borrow the $7 billion from but China. Most of the borrowings that have taken place, certainly by the United States and probably by Australia in the purchase of our government bonds in recent months, have been from China. So we find ourselves in the unusual position of borrowing $7 billion a year from China to give it back to them on the basis of them being a developing country. This is untenable and unconscionable. The Treasurer was quite correct in his statement that we should wait until after Copenhagen. Of course, it simply emphasises and underpins that we should be waiting more generally until after Copenhagen.

The minister has referred to the possibility of the Chinese indicating that they might show some interest in introducing some sort of a carbon-reducing plan sometime in the future. I do remind the Senate that it was only this time last year that the central government in China admitted that they have no idea how many illegal coal fired power stations are being commissioned each month.

It was very interesting, but it was not what I asked him. I asked him how much money it was. The Prime Minister was overseas just a couple of days ago and he made some comment about the undeveloped countries. He said that we have to put in something like $10 billion—I think that was the figure. He did, however, make a statement on how much money would have to be paid.

They deserve to know. That money is public money and the amount should be made public. It is beyond belief that you tell us that the Prime Minister went over and made a statement about how much money—he did not actually specify what Australia had put in but he told people what he thought the money should be—but that that amount is not made public.

One week later—and this is the same pollster with the same question—the 54 per cent has gone to 60 per cent and the 34 per cent has gone to 27 per cent. The reason this is happening, Senator Wong, is that you will just not come clean. You will not tell the people what is involved. So no wonder people are turning off this and the support for it is dropping like a brick. And next week it will be less. You cannot expect people just to take you on your word. You know what it is and the Prime Minister knows what it is but you will not tell them. I cannot go over there and beat it out of you but you should be able to tell the people what the cost of it is.

The other issue I wanted to get some advice on is this: what happens if this emissions trading scheme turns to custard, if it does not do the job, if no-one else goes in? I suspect that will be the case. We will have the EU in, which is a collective of countries, but so far no-one else has made a move to join. Yes, you have a few press releases from China, Japan and a few other places that have made some sort of commitment, but in real terms the EU is the only one that has put an

A couple of weeks ago they removed 162 industries from it, so it is the ETS you have when you do not have an ETS.

We would have 450 million certificates valued at somewhere between $20 and $30 each. They have a price. They would be property rights. Once we push these into legislation, they will become property rights. If everything turns bad, what is our strategy to get out of this? What is our exit plan? Have we an exit plan or do we just write off something like $129 billion over 10 years and say: ‘Well, that was bad luck. We miscued on that one’? These are the things that people want to know. It is no good telling me that they have to be acquitted. I do not know what that means in real terms. I want to know how we recover our money. How do we extract ourselves from this mess if no-one else joins?

If everyone in the world joins, we’ll pay our premium.’ That is how I am interpreting the polling that indicated that 60 per cent of people did not want to go down that track and 27 per cent did. The poll was taken by Galaxy over the weekend. The reason the popularity of this is falling is that you are not explaining it. You are not telling anyone. You are standing up there and giving glib replies but you are not answering any questions. When its popularity drops further next week, down to about 14 per cent, you are going to be officially labelled the worst saleswoman in the world because you have not been able to sell this to the public. You cannot even sell it in this parliament. Please tell me how we get the $129 billion out of this if the worst comes to the worst.

Some of it seemed to focus on me, some of it focused on press releases and some of it focused on the debate we had for hours, I think, on Wednesday night. In terms of polling—I am not quite sure which poll the senator was reading from; I think there were a range of polls in the papers over the weekend—can I just say we do not do this because of polls. We do it because we think it is the right thing to do. I would also remind you that you also went to the last election committing to do this.

I understood that there was bipartisan agreement in the parliament for the targets, so I am not sure if the senator is suggesting that he is now changing the coalition’s previous stated position of supporting the targets, including the unconditional target of five per cent. If that is his position, it might be useful to know that.

You are right, Senator Boswell, and I have said so. We will be accountable for what we propose internationally, but we have not made that announcement. If and when Australia does so, we will be accountable for that and we will explain to the Australian people why we have made the decision that we have made. But what you are asking for is for me to pre-empt that government announcement, and I am not going to do that.

If the Prime Minister of Japan makes a public statement indicating what his commitment is on behalf of his nation, that is not a bad indication of what they are proposing to do. These are elected heads of government or heads of state and they are making commitments on behalf of their nation.

That is the difference between your ETS and Howard’s commitment. Howard’s commitment was something like that. I do not have it in front of me, but it said we will not ruin our exporters and we will do it in sync with the rest of the world. You have gone well and truly beyond that. You are affecting our exporters and the rest of the world has not joined in, so do not come to me and say, ‘You went to the electorate with a similar ETS.’ We went to the election with an ETS that was highly qualified. We were not going to hurt our exporters and we were going to do it in sync with the rest of the world. You have not done that, so it was totally different to yours.

I have been doing some figures today. China have said that it will reduce some 45 per cent. Putting that in context, China produce about seven billion tonnes of greenhouse gases a year and they forecast that by 2020 that will grow to 14 billion—double. They said they were going to reduce that around 45 or 50 per cent and that it will grow from seven billion to 10 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases. We are going to see China increase their greenhouse gases by three billion tonnes from now to 2020.

Australia will reduce its emissions by just 30 million tonnes.

Surely, Minister, shouldn’t we reconsider this whole plan before these other countries sign up to doing something? Our forecast reductions are simply a drop in the ocean, while the forecast levels for these other countries just go up and up and up. What are we going to achieve?

Minister, I have the explanatory memorandum in front of me. Page 6 says—and it is on the public record—that the medium-term national target is to reduce emissions by five per cent to 15 per cent of the 2000 levels by 2020. An article in today’s

Some have just been recently released and I think the US indicated a target last Thursday. What I would like to get is an update on the target for the various countries—like the US—compared to Australia at 2000 levels. We have five to 15 per cent of 2000 levels. That will be the cut by 2020. This report says the US, one of the world’s biggest emitters, has promised to cut emissions by 4.5 per cent by 2020 based on 1990 levels.

We can then get the US target comparison. Likewise, Senator Williams referred to China. From what I read from this report, China is the biggest greenhouse polluter.

Minister, can you help us by comparing apples with apples? Likewise, can you give us the figures for the European Union, Japan, Brazil, India, Russia, Africa and other relevant countries? I am happy for you to table a document to summarise that. That would be greatly appreciated.

I say in response to the contributions made by Senator Williams and Senator Boswell—who has left the chamber—that we are not acting alone. I do not know why it is that the National Party and some Liberal senators continue to come into this chamber and assert something that is simply not true. Action is being taken in other countries. It may not be the action you wish to be taken.

I do not think it is reasonable for senators who oppose action on climate change to try to fudge the facts to assist their argument. They can argue it, if they wish, on the basis that they do not believe the science—which is some of them—or for whatever reason, but it is not correct to say that we are acting alone. The second point I would make is by way of a quote—and this is, I think, quite interesting, when you consider that this was the report commissioned by then Prime Minister Howard:

It believes that there are benefits, which outweigh the costs, in early adoption by Australia of an appropriate emissions constraint. Such action would enhance investment certainty and provide a long-term platform for responding to carbon constraints.

He said the advice was ‘go soon’. That was the advice to you in government, and that was why the emissions trading scheme policy was adopted by the Howard government and taken to the last election. In relation to Senator Boswell’s polling questions, I suggest that action on climate change was something that was a significant aspect of the last election campaign.

Senator Boswell made a comment last week in which he said, ‘I pay my share of the rent.’ This is our share of the rent. If we accept that this is a nation vulnerable to climate change—if we accept, therefore, that we need a global agreement—then we have to be prepared to do our bit. That is what we are proposing: to do our bit, to not stand back and say, ‘You go; you do it.’ That is for two reasons. First, it is not fair. Second, it is because we have an interest in acting and getting the world, as much as we can in pressing, to a global agreement, because if we do not get a global agreement it is our farmers, our land, our natural assets and our economy which will be hit hard. So we have a self-interest as well as a public interest in acting.

We are smaller than China. We also are part of an international agreement that recognises that we cannot simply ask people to stay poor, that what we have to do is have a framework which enables some growth in developing countries, then a peak and then a decline. That is what we signed up for. What we have to do is encourage the same thing in China as what we are encouraging here: a low-carbon growth path. We have to, for the first time in human history, really de-link emissions growth and economic growth. We have to stop making worsening climate change the price of economic growth, because if we do not we know it will cost us much more in the long term. That is why we have before the parliament a scheme that is about reducing our contribution to climate change as a nation.

I think this is the fourth time I have read this table out and I am happy to do it again. I will then also give you some figures in relation to 1990. You know our targets, which I think we have bipartisan agreements to; they are minus five, minus 15 or minus 25 per cent on 2000 levels. Canada has a target of 20 per cent below 2006 levels.

The margin that was announced was, I think, 40 to 44 per cent, but I will check that—the notes I am reading from predate the announcement. India has announced a national energy efficiency plan, including a cap and trade system, to save about five per cent of India’s annual energy consumption by 2015 and reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by 100 million tonnes. It has a solar target of 20,000 megawatts by 2020. Indonesia has agreed to reduce emissions by 26 per cent below business as usual to 41 per cent with overseas support and agreed to seek to convert forestry from a net source to a net sink by 2030.

I made my question very clear, and you have a department full of people who can answer that question and compare apples with apples. I will ask my question a final time—I am not going to ask it again. The chart you just read out again to this chamber was very hard to comprehend and made it hard to compare the figures. We know the Australian targets are set out in your explanatory memorandum, and we all know what they are. They are compared to 2000 levels. Would you please instruct your department to compare the target levels from the other countries that you have referred to with the 2000 levels, or at least provide something that will allow us to compare apples with apples and understand exactly what we are talking about? That was my question the first time; it is my question for the second and last time.

It does concern me because I am probably one of the very few people in this parliament that has experienced Australia leading the way, in this case in trade. When the Hawke-Keating government agreed to allow the importing of pig meat into Australia it was very costly for Australian piggeries and it shut down a lot of them. My brother and I worked extremely hard in our piggery; it was a seven-day-a-week job. So I am very sceptical about Australia leading the world, and we are about to do it again. I do not know what we did wrong with our piggery. The other pig producer at the time was Prime Minister Paul Keating. He was obviously a much more successful pig farmer than me.

The figures the minister reads out are reductions of different base figures of different calculations. I hope that, before we progress too much further, we can have the answer to Senator Barnett’s question so that we can all consider it.

The minister mentions all of these other countries—this is the bit that I cannot quite understand—but none of them, with perhaps two exceptions, have a legislated scheme.

I do not particularly follow American politics and their systems, but you do not have to follow it terribly much to know that congress is not going to determine a position by next week, when the climate change conference starts. They will not be determining a position. President Obama may believe that that is what his country should do, but it is a democracy and the President does not rule by decree. He requires approval by congress—by two houses of parliament. I would be happy to be told I am wrong on this, but there is no way in the world, as I understand it, that the American congress is going to make a decision before Copenhagen.

I keep mentioning South Africa because it is a competitor of Australia in the supply of coal to the world, as is Indonesia. They are aspirational targets announced by their leaders. None of those countries is going to have a firm resolve because until we know what the world is doing it is a bit hard to say, ‘We’re going to do what Japan is doing and reduce emissions by 20 per cent,’—although I think Japan’s target is 25 per cent. But to what does this target apply—and to whom and for what industry? And how is it going to operate? There are so many imponderables. What I thought Copenhagen was all about, and what we have been told for month after month, is that Copenhagen was going to bring the world together and arrive at a fairly common scheme so that everyone could go back home and say: ‘Are we in this or are we out? Once we’re in it we can have this world scheme going with world trading of permits, and the bankers will be very happy with all this.’ That is fine, but clearly Copenhagen is not going to do that. So why wouldn’t we take the benefit of what happens at Copenhagen in finalising the design of our own scheme?

The coalition had nine principles which we sought to have adopted. And I am pleased to see that the Labor government—after severely criticising them and saying they were a waste of time and money, that they could not work, that it would not happen and that they would be pointless—has changed its mind on that. That is good. What is the necessity in the next three days—the dying days of this year’s parliament—of making sure we vote on these things? I pointed out an obvious error in the legislation this morning. It was obvious to me when I had a look at it. It is an error that has occurred because we are trying to rush something through for no purpose.

Australia produces less than 1.4 per cent of global emissions of greenhouse gas, and we are being told in this debate that, unless we vote for this in the next two or three days, Tuvalu and a lot of other Pacific island countries are going to disappear under the sea, suggesting that if we pass the Rudd government’s legislation, which will reduce world carbon emissions by 0.2 per cent, then that is going to save Tuvalu and that if we do not then it is the fault of all of us that Tuvaluans will be swimming above what used to be their homes. It just defies logic. So why don’t we wait and learn from and take advantage of what the rest of the world is doing? We would then come back and say to the Greens and the other people involved in this: ‘Look, that’s what the rest of the world’s doing. On this point they have a better idea than we have; on that point they have a worse idea. We’ll try and convince them.’ Why wouldn’t you do that? Why is it essential that in the next couple of days we have this legislated? Mr Rudd has already done what President Obama has done: he has issued a press release to the world saying, ‘This is our target.’ I think the coalition says, ‘Yep, we agree with those targets, but let’s see what happens.’

The spokesman for that nickel-refining company in Townsville has said that, if this scheme goes through, 1,200 working families in the Townsville area, where I have my office and hang out, will no longer have a principal breadwinner. I invited the minister, on several occasions, to say this was wrong. All we got was that the Yabulu people, the Queensland Nickel people, were going to talk to her department in the next couple of weeks. That is pretty good. If the minister has her way, in the next couple of weeks this will be legislated, and then it will be goodbye to the jobs of 1,200 people in my community. I feel for those people; I really do. I get emotional about those people.

A clever businessman came in, bought it and kept it going. There was huge relief in Townsville, because there had been a pall over Townsville when we thought that one of our three refineries was going to close. We have the nickel refinery that I am talking about, the zinc refinery that has also been prominent in this debate over the years and the copper refinery. They are the sorts of things that, if we do not get this right, could be a problem.

The nickel ore ran out so, rather than shut down a valuable asset and all the jobs, including port jobs, in Townsville that are associated with it, the then owners used to bring the nickel ore from Noumea or the Philippines, ship it into Townsville, refine it in Townsville and then ship it out to the world, keeping lots of jobs and wealth in the country. Most of the nickel ore now comes from the Philippines, where there was a nickel refinery. It was not a terribly efficient nickel refinery. It was one that operated without any restrictions on the amount of its emissions to the world. It was a real greenhouse disaster, but it is still there. It was not shut down or pulled to pieces; it was just put in mothballs. If the nickel refinery in Townsville can no longer operate, I guess that one would be un-mothballed and put back into production to use the ore that that section of the Philippines is currently selling to an Australian company to refine in Townsville. These things really need to be addressed.

That is simply an untruthful explanation of my position. I accept the climate is changing. I do not know whether man is doing it, but then 20,000 of the top scientists in the world do not know either. Half of them think they know and the other half think they know as well but they have a different view, so what chance do I have? I go along with the principle of taking out some risk insurance. Even if it does not happen we should take out insurance, but do not do it before everybody else and put Australia’s economy and jobs at risk just to swan over to Copenhagen and say, ‘I’ve got my legislation passed’.

We did a lot of things to reduce emissions, and so we should have. I agree with the minister on that: we should be reducing our carbon emissions—but not legislating in this way, and putting at risk 1,200 jobs in my home town, for a scheme that may or may not achieve agreement. What would it matter if we waited until parliament resumed and say: ‘Okay, we’ve seen what everyone is doing in Copenhagen; we’re convinced everybody is going to do something, or at least everybody who counts to Australia; and if everyone who has an impact on the

As I understand their amendment, this will mean a massive price rise across the board for Australian industries, putting jobs at risk, as I have just said.

If there are no cost increases, I would like the mover to explain how that could possibly be.

He asked why we need to do this before Copenhagen, and I say two things to him. First, we want to go to Copenhagen with a plan to meet our targets. I would have thought one of the things we in this chamber all agree on is that this is a significant reform. We will be reducing emissions for the first time in our history whilst continuing to grow our economy. We have never before achieved that. We want a plan to meet our targets. We want to be able to do it at the lowest cost. We accept the advice that was put to your government. I was just reminding myself of your own election commitment, Senator Macdonald—with lovely pictures of Mr Vaile as well, with Senator Nash, and Mr Howard and Mr Costello on the front—which was to establish ‘an emissions trading system, the most comprehensive in the world, to enable the market to determine the most efficient means of lowering greenhouse gas emissions’.

Well, press releases do not fix the climate. We want a plan to meet our targets. The point about the press release issue is that there was a suggestion by Senator Boswell that somehow we ought not to rely on a public announcement by the

The important point we keep asserting—and I have to wonder how it is that the party that used to pride itself on being the superior economic manager, according to its rhetoric, could advocate for a position of continued economic irresponsibility—is that we know that delay will increase the costs. We know that delays will increase the costs, so the people in this debate who say we should delay are actually arguing for Australia’s price tag for action on climate change to grow.

That is why we will not commit to our targets until we are clear about what has occurred. But, again, I pose this question—and Senator Macdonald may not be in this camp but I suspect he will be: does any one of you believe that those who have done what they have done over the last week will change their minds in February? Does anyone honestly believe that?

I think most Australians would ask that question. Most Australians would believe, from watching Senator Minchin’s behaviour and that of others, that you are not going to be for changing. No amount of fact, detail or evidence is going to change your minds. You do not believe that this is something that this nation needs to do, notwithstanding the fact that it was your policy. You are entitled to believe that. I disagree. But I think it would improve this debate if you could come in and be honest about it and say, ‘Actually, I do not believe we should act.’

The problem in doing our bit is that what has been presented to this parliament is a very elaborate and complex emissions trading scheme. Doing our bit requires that we trade with other countries who have similar emissions trading schemes. There are other ways this could be done, but we—Australia—have elected to have, through the Rudd government, an emissions trading scheme. It is predicated on countries in our region, our major trading partners, all having emissions trading schemes so that we can trade carbon credits with them. But in reality I think it is very unlikely that our trading partners will have emissions trading schemes.

A month ago I was in Beijing and I went to a renewable energy forum at the National People’s Congress. I asked the delegates there from China, Japan and South Korea whether or not their countries planned to set up emissions trading schemes. They were all very keen on renewable energy, but I asked: would they have emissions trading schemes? The head of the Chinese delegation, who was the chair of the environment committee of the National People’s Congress, made it very clear that China regarded an emissions trading scheme as very difficult to set up for China. He saw immense difficulties in setting up an emissions trading scheme and said they would be unlikely to go down that pathway.

Anybody who has been to India and seen the immensity of the emissions in India understands that an emissions trading scheme simply will not occur in India. The government simply cannot legislate to cover all the many and diverse emissions which occur in India. While, again, the Indians may be interested in renewable energy and many of these countries may also go down the nuclear pathway, an emissions trading scheme is highly unlikely.

So here we are, setting up this very elaborate scheme to ‘do our bit’, as the minister says, but there is not going to be anybody with whom we can trade these credits. That means that ‘doing our bit’ is going to result in an enormous extra cost burden for the Australian people. This scheme is a very costly scheme. It is a very complex scheme. It is going to adversely affect many Australian industries. It is going to cause an increase in the price of consumer goods because there will be a massive increase in the price of power. We are going to see loss of jobs and many other adverse effects from the scheme.

It may be that, if we are going to ‘do our bit’, as the minister says, we could do it a different way, with some other form of action, but not this immensely complex emissions trading scheme which will require an enormous bureaucracy to administer and will cost a lot of money.

SMEs employ more people than any other sector of our economy and yet they, through their peak industry body, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, are opposed to this emissions trading scheme because of the adverse impact it will have on small- and medium-sized enterprises.

In the agreement that has been reached, only the production side of the agriculture sector has been exempted. The processing side is still going to be subject to the additional costs of this emissions trading scheme. I would have thought that commonsense should prevail and we ought to think this through. We do not have to rush into this. The requirement to pass this scheme within the next few days is an artificial deadline that is being imposed on the Senate by the government. Why do we not just leave it and see what the rest of the world is doing? That is a commonsense approach.

I would agree with the point made by Senator Macdonald—that it seems to be sensible to delay further consideration of this bill until we know what the rest of the world is doing. I would urge the minister to think about that and come up with a process whereby we do defer this until after the Copenhagen conference.

The only reason we are doing that, it seems to me, is to satisfy the ego of the Prime Minister. He wants to trumpet to the rest of the world that Australia is doing its bit, but the price of the bit is going to be the loss of jobs and an extremely adverse impact on the Australian economy. We proceed with this legislation ahead of Copenhagen in defiance of common sense.

If the argument is that Australia should not do anything because we are, if you like, in relative terms a small emitter then what of all those other countries below us who emit even less than we do? Are you saying that we should not have to do anything even though all those countries emit even less than us? It is an illogical position.

Senator Macdonald asked, ‘Wouldn’t 100 per cent auctioning put all these businesses out of business?’ I would draw his attention to the Garnaut report on emissions trading. I personally have not done the modelling, but the Garnaut review, in conjunction with Treasury, did do the modelling and the assessment. It was the Garnaut review’s conclusion that there are no identifiable circumstances that would justify the free allocation of permits. There is a whole section from page 331 onwards that explains why that is the case. He goes on to point out all of the problems which we now have because we did not go down that road—that is, essentially people coming along with no rationale and it being a political game as to who gets what free permits. Any sense of a principled approach has been lost. That is why we should go back to what Professor Garnaut recommended.

I did ask this question first up but I did not get an answer other than that it was government policy, or a choice the government had made. I am interested to know what the government’s rationale is for going with a mix of free permits and auctioning. Why not 100 per cent auctioning? What is the rationale for free permits?

I agree broadly with the Greens as to the destination of much deeper carbon cuts but it is about the manner in which it ought to be achieved. My issue is not whether you give out free permits but how you give them out. My concern is on the issue of churn. We can have a debate about Frontier Economics and their model, which I think is vastly more efficient and produces a better outcome both in economic and in environmental terms. I cannot support these amendments for those reasons. I am grateful for Senator Milne’s amendments, because they do beg a number of very important questions as to the whole issue of how the permits are allocated. That is a very valid point.

It is an article that I referred to during the February estimates when I asked Senator Wong a number of questions relating to that. But the point that Julian Glover made was at a time when the price of the EU’s carbon permits had collapsed. Julian Glover’s contention was that a collapsing carbon market makes mega-pollution cheap.

Mr Glover’s contention is that the lesson of the carbon slump:

I understand that that has been dealt with substantially in recent months. Mr Glover’s column was written at a time when the exchanges were in meltdown and a tonne of carbon dropped to about €8 down from the previous summer’s peak in 2008 of €31 and far below the €30 to €45 range at which renewables can compete with fossil fuels. My question to the minister is: notwithstanding the differences I have with the minister in terms of the issue of churn, and the difference between the Frontier model and what the government is proposing, given Senator Milne’s amendments, to what extent has this approach learnt from Europe where the market price was so volatile that it did not give a clear price signal for renewables and for cleaner, greener alternatives? In other words, how can we be sure that what happened in Europe will not happen here in terms of the safeguards that have been put in place with this particular scheme?

One of the issues there was—and there are a range of views about the volatility of the carbon price—whether or not the market had some sense of where the longer term carbon price would be. One of the reasons we have said five years of caps and then the gateways is to try and give the market better information about where the carbon price in the longer term will be. Obviously, that is important in terms of business planning its investments and also working out what its carbon liability is likely to be and so forth.

Finally, one of the policy mechanisms that is in the scheme before us is a banking mechanism, where you can bank your permit. That is a mechanism about trying to manage price volatility and one which has been put in after some discussion with a range of people in the business community.

It is one of the biggest issues which we have to face with emissions trading schemes. As he says, the volatility of prices can make the use of renewable energies quite uncompetitive. One way of avoiding the volatility of an emissions trading scheme would be to have a carbon tax. A carbon tax provides a very steady and known price for carbon, if you like, which is only varied by varying the tax. That tax can be set at a level that allows renewable energy systems to be competitive. So my question to the minister would be: what consideration was given to the introduction of a carbon tax in Australia instead of an emissions trading scheme, given that this huge issue of price volatility would have been avoided through the introduction of a carbon tax?

This is what I understand occurred in the European Union, and if there are people from the EU listening—I am sure there will not be—I apologise if I get this wrong. In phase 1 the allocation of permits was identified three years in advance and then in phase 2 it was identified five years in advance. Entities were not able to trade between one period and another, and I think most commentators would suggest that in fact what occurred was that they overallocated. They got the cap wrong. That resulted, of course—basic economics—in an excess of supply and therefore the price dropped. That is not the design of the Australian scheme. I had a question from Senator Eggleston, but I am happy to finish any question you have, Senator Xenophon.

My recollection of the EU scheme is that the EITE allocation was not on the basis of output. So that differs from the Australian scheme. In other words, we link our assistance to how much you emit, because it is about transitional assistance. Everybody does their bit and everybody faces the carbon price, but how much of it you face is adjusted, given the need to support employment and various industries through the transition.

I asked whether or not the government had considered a carbon tax. I just ask you to comment on the issues of a carbon tax and of price volatility. Why did the government not go down that pathway, since it seems to be a much simpler sort of scheme to implement and it does provide price stability?

I think I have made it clear on numerous times in this place why we believe this is a more efficient mechanism than a tax. If you want a certain environmental outcome then a cap-and-trade system provides you with more certainty because you can identify the cap. If you put in place a carbon tax you have to try and estimate how much of a tax, and on what sectors you would need to impose that amount of tax, in order to achieve that environmental outcome. It may give price certainty but it does not give an environmental certainty.

One of the issues has been how we treat the emissions-intensive trade-exposed sector. They have said to the government and to the opposition, ‘We would be facing a carbon price’—put, insert or interpolate the words ‘carbon tax’ for the purposes of this discussion, Senator Eggleston—‘and we want assistance to meet that’. So there would still be the argument for assistance, exemption or some other form of relief from the same sectors of the economy with whom the government and opposition have been consulting about how you manage the introduction of such a tax.

It is not like the government is saying, ‘We in the government know best and we want you to do it this way’. We are saying: ‘We are going to put a price on carbon. That is a cost that reflects the cost of climate change but you can find a way of reducing that cost by becoming more efficient as you know best in your business’. We think a properly regulated and structured market mechanism is more efficient.

The issue Senator Xenophon called attention to was the impact price volatility had, particularly for the sustainability or viability of renewable energy sources. I think that is a very important issue because we would like to go down the renewable pathway. While I agree that a carbon tax would have meant that emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries sought exemption, I just ask whether or not an implication of your rejection of the carbon tax option means that you are saying that renewable energy is not such an important issue.

I am happy to debate the issues but propositions such as that really have no merit.

On the government’s own MYEFO estimates, the CPRS will raise $5,422 for every single Australian in the period to 2020. It seems that that is a very high figure, on a per capita basis, compared with the EU and a very high figure compared with the US and most other countries that I am aware of. In fact, their costs on a per capita basis are a tiny fraction of that burden. It has been said that Australian firms will pay the highest carbon costs in the world. The tax take from the CPRS is much higher than those from other international schemes. So the question is: how is that justified? Could the minister please indicate the costs on a per capita basis in the EU and certainly in the US for clarity purposes so that we know exactly where we stand?

Why are we burdening our economy in advance of Copenhagen, rather than acting in parallel? Why are we not doing this in parallel, consistent with an international agreement? The fact is that there is a very heavy burden, as I have indicated from those figures, and the consequences are obviously quite serious. Senator Macdonald indicated earlier the fact that Australian firms will start paying those billions of dollars from 1 July 2011—some 19 months away. What is wrong with waiting for Copenhagen and then having a few months to get our act together? I think that rushing Labor’s

Tasmanians will be paying a 16 per cent increase in power costs. The rest of the country will be paying more than 20 per cent, and there is a $1,100 cost per year per family. I have a range of questions around the impact on business and small business, but I wonder if the minister could address those two specific questions about the $5,428 for every Australian up to 2020 and comparing that to the costs in the US and the EU. Could those matters be addressed as a preliminary measure?

I am happy to have the discussion again, but I think I have placed on record very clearly in this chamber why the government’s view is that we should act and why we should pass this legislation. If senators do not agree with it, I do not think that me explaining the rationale over and over again is going to really assist the process.

I am not sure I can give per capita figures, because that is not really a sensible way of approaching it. Perhaps I can explain it this way. What the Treasury modelling showed with a scheme, frankly, that had less industry assistance than the scheme that is before the chamber—and this is excluding what climate change costs us; this is just what the effect of a carbon price would be—was that out to mid-century the effect would be this: we would grow by one-tenth of one per cent slower each year. So we would continue to grow jobs and the economy—I think 1.7 million additional jobs by 2020—but we would grow one-tenth of one per cent slower. In the context of the costs of climate change, most would agree one-tenth of one per cent slower is a reasonable contribution. That modelling did not include what the costs of climate change were to our economy, so it did not include the costs of inaction. That is the price. That is what we are asking the community to bear: growth one-tenth of one per cent slower.

It is about 1.1 per cent higher at the end of the second year of the scheme than it would have been before. That is the additional consumer price index increase. In relation to the assistance to families, the largest single share of the revenue will go to Australian families. Of Australia’s 8.8 million households 8.1 million will receive direct cash assistance to help adjust to the impact of a carbon price. That is about 90 per cent of all Australian households. Low-income Australians will be fully compensated for the overall cost increase they face. About 2.6 million Australian households within the low-income bracket will receive assistance equivalent to about 120 per cent of the overall cost increase they face. All pensioners, seniors, carers and people with disabilities will be fully compensated for the overall cost increase they face. About 3.6 million middle-income households will receive some form of direct cash assistance. About half of that number, about 1.7 million middle-income households, will be fully compensated for the overall cost increase flowing from the scheme.

The chamber is in fact discussing Senator Milne’s amendments in relation to a different method of allocating EITE support. I have indicated the government’s position. We are not proposing to support that. I wonder if it would be possible for us to perhaps bring this discussion on Senator Milne’s amendments to a conclusion.

Have we got the latest figures for the CO2 emissions in terms of forward estimates and in terms of the forecasts between now and 2020 and now and 2050? That would be appreciated and would help inform us. In terms of Tasmania, what is important is that we have undergone a greater transition to renewable and low-carbon energy sources than any other state or territory in Australia over the last decade, certainly during the 1990s.

I would like the minister’s response to that. From a Tassie perspective, we are a renewable energy state, and I would like to know whether we are going to gain any benefit whatsoever under this scheme as a result of the hard work, the good innovative approach and the efforts towards building a renewable energy future. How, from Tasmania’s perspective, are we going to benefit? What we do know is that we will be paying a 16 per cent increase in power costs, while the rest of Australia is paying over 20 per cent—but that is cold comfort.

I gave him figures, I think, on Friday—it might have been Thursday—on Tasmania. My recollection is that we indicated that because of the particular energy profile in Tasmania we would anticipate a lower price impact. In fact, I think you are using the figures from the answer I gave you, Senator. However, the household assistance will still flow to Tasmanian families and Tasmanian households at the same rate.

The government’s scheme as it stands allows for the unlimited purchase of overseas permits, and we seek to amend this to restrict the purchase of overseas permits to 20 per cent. I will go into it in a bit more detail.

The proposition is to transform the economy away from a high-carbon economy to a low-carbon, and then ultimately zero-carbon, economy. From the Greens’ perspective, for this scheme to be a success it has to do both of those things.

That is a true proposition if all the carbon pollution reduction permits are actually valid and measurable and truly additional and so on. It is a little bit difficult to know where REDD is going to go and there is really quite a genuine concern that the permits are not all of the same validity, as it currently stands, in being able to be sure that they genuinely represent a reduction in carbon.

The gold standard means certification by the Gold Standard Foundation in accordance with the gold standard methodology for carbon offset project development. That gold standard is the world’s only independent standard for creating high-quality emission reduction projects in the

It was designed to ensure that carbon credits are not only real and verifiable but that they make measurable contributions to sustainable development worldwide.

In that way we make sure that those overseas permits we do buy come from the least developed countries and that therefore the transfer of income goes to those countries which need it the most. It is a happy coincidence that many of those least developed countries are in our region.

We cannot just let them buy overseas permits and allow them to continue to do so. They need to transform themselves in the context of a low-carbon or zero-carbon economy, and there is a real risk that that will not occur unless we put a restriction on the amount of permits that can be purchased offshore.

Under the government’s scheme, there is a regulation-making power in proposed section 129(7) of the primary bill which enables a regulation-making power to be made outlining what can be surrendered—that is, what international permits can be used domestically. I think you and I have had this discussion before, Senator, but I make this point: we do absolutely believe that part of the plan that will enable the globe to meet this challenge of climate change is to have a properly functioning global carbon market. What does that mean? It means that we get the right market incentive for private sector firms to invest in abatement and we enable that to occur wherever that abatement can be found in the world, because this is a global problem.

That is an issue of quality, and we are absolutely of the view that these international units must be credible, measurable, reportable and verifiable. We are working closely with Indonesia, for example, on the reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation aspect of the Bali roadmap—known as REDD. We have made, I think, two joint submissions—I could be wrong, but my recollection is two—with Indonesia to the international negotiations. So we are serious about working with a developing country on our doorstep to put in place the mechanisms and the systems that ensure that emissions reductions from these activities are ones in which the world can have confidence.

My view is very simple: if, through this policy, we can give Australian firms an incentive to reduce emissions in developing countries then I think that that is a good thing. We need to ensure that those investments are in relation to emission reductions which are real, transparent and verifiable. But I think that is a good thing because we have to change the market failure that has caused climate change—where people have had an incentive to pollute. Instead we need an incentive to reduce emissions. We are strongly of the view that this is a sensible way forward and we do not support the amendments.

That is why I thought it appropriate to try to bring them up at the beginning of a new, fresh amendment and not intervene in amendments that have been discussed at some length. The first in my series of questions relates to the government’s future planning in relation to the size of Australia’s population. Mr Rudd has this grand vision of 35 million people. Given that we have an emissions cap and we intend, in general terms, to increase our population by 50 per cent over the next couple of decades, that must surely come with a huge impact on the amount of emissions from our country. So I am just wondering whether the policy that was put to Treasury—as part of all the modelling that we had provided to us—was that we were dealing with a potential population of, as I understand it, 35 million people by the year 2050.

We might deal with these; I will get the minister to answer your question, Senator Abetz.

I am happy to vacate the space for the time being, allow this amendment to be dealt with and then come back into the debate before the next amendment is moved. I am more than happy to facilitate that. Officially, I indicate on behalf of the opposition that we will not be supporting this tranche of Greens amendments.

Yes, we did assume population growth in the Treasury modelling and the advice I have is that the assumption was of some 33 million. So the Treasury modelling which shows the impact of the continued growth in the Australian economy and the continued growth in the number of jobs did assume that.

I assume that the senator, from his previous comments, does support the previous government’s and the current government’s policies—for example, to help families and parents in terms of the assistance for mothers on the birth of a child and in relation to family tax laws. So I assume he is not making reference to those issues.

I am asked if we will have a national cap. I think it is important when we discuss issues of sustainability to be very clear about this: we are one of the highest per capita emitters in the world, if not the highest; therefore, reducing our per capita emissions would enable us to continue to grow our economy and our population without necessarily growing our emissions or growing them along the same trajectory as they have been growing.

Of course we are. Remember our days at school in physics class, where we learned that V equals IR. Look at how far we transport electricity across Australia. It is a big country. If we transported electricity in Europe along power lines as long as power lines in Australia, we would go through six or seven countries. Because we have to transport electricity so far, including to places in the centre of Australia—whether it be

Everyone around here knows my opinion on this whole emissions trading scheme. I am very much against it. But what concerns me is, if the legislation goes through, if the emitters in Australia cannot reduce their emissions enough or cannot get enough credits here or overseas, how much of Australia will be planted down to trees. I raise that concern because we need agricultural land to produce food, especially with the proposed increase in population, which Senator Abetz referred to. If Australia’s population is going to go to 35 million, surely they cannot eat bark and branches for food.

The Kyoto agreement does not recognise soil carbon, which is probably one of the best ways to store carbon. It is a win-win situation—the more carbon in the soil, the better the soil is and the more food produced. So my question to Senator Milne is: if Australia cannot reduce those emissions and we are limited in our permits, has she any idea how much of Australia’s agricultural land will be planted down to trees to, obviously, produce the credits required?

That is essentially because I think the issue of green carbon needs to be looked at holistically in the context of food security, water security, biodiversity and resilience in rural communities. I do not believe the way that it is being dealt with now is going to lead to a process that does not have perverse outcomes. We saw perverse outcomes from managed investment schemes, and I do not want to see them again.

That is my main focus here. In terms of carbon in the atmosphere, providing they are verifiable credits then in theory they are the same. So the atmosphere will not change as a result of this but the issue of transformation in Australia will, and this is where my great concern with this scheme lies—that it will not drive the transformation away from the heavy, fossil-fuel-intensive emissions to smarter, cleaner technologies or new jobs in manufacturing. We are talking about new technologies and new jobs, and that is why I want to make sure that we have that drive for investment here.

We now have a system where the coal fired generators have an agreement with the government and the coalition that they will keep on producing the same amount of power out to 2020 and that in effect they can, if they want, buy overseas permits, bank them and do as they like until that time. There is no pressure on them to change. In fact, there is more pressure on them under the compensation agreements to keep going with old and antiquated plants, so ultimately it could lead to being completely uncompetitive in a global environment if other people make the transformation and we do not. The clever new technologies are where the money, the intellectual property, the jobs and the manufacturing are. It has been my experience in politics that giving more to industry to allow them to carry on with business as usual and not invest in upgrading ultimately means they close down and go elsewhere with complete dislocation. That has happened endlessly in the Tasmanian context, and I am sure it is the same if you look nationally. The best way to keep industries in Australia is to require them to innovate and upgrade—to invest in their plants—so that they cannot just walk away.

If it is part of a global solution, we need to have international permits—although Senator Milne is absolutely right: they must be clearly verifiable. She is seeking a higher standard, although I note that the minister has indicated that part of any international agreement requires that verifiability.

The minister stressed earlier the importance of certainty of emissions due to a domestic cap; however, does international trading of permits not mean that there can be no certainty over domestic emissions? I am not criticising that, but can the minister verify that? Can the minister confirm that the government will accept the global carbon price determined in international markets and that the domestic cap will not set prices and will not tightly constrain domestic emissions?

Rather than the situation that occurs now, where Australia’s contribution is worsening, we will be reducing that contribution. It is the case—and we have been absolutely clear about this—that we want a scheme that is open and where we can trade on world markets. What I have indicated is that our modelling suggests that the majority of abatement effort will still occur domestically. I have previously indicated that the analysis by the department suggests that, if the scheme is passed, domestic emissions are most likely to peak around or before 2012-13 and then be stable or fall to 2020.

So we are on a trajectory that is going up. This scheme will ensure that we reduce our emissions domestically but also—and, as I said, we make no apology for this—that Australian firms contribute to reducing emissions worldwide. Given this is a global issue, we think that is a sensible way forward.

A similar problem occurs with a scheme you were advocating—in fact, to a greater level. From my recollection, a greater level of international importation is assumed under the Frontier model. I have given you my answer about our view about domestic emissions and the rationale for that. I failed to answer one aspect, which was the international carbon price. It is the case that, if you have a scheme where you are able to trade in the way that the Australian scheme has been designed to do, you are looking at a situation where the Australian carbon price is likely to be equivalent to the international carbon price. Again, I think that is quite reasonable. We want a situation where there is increasingly a global carbon price and an increasing number of global carbon markets, where the private sector can invest in abatement.

It is a question of the robustness of those permits, and I think we are at one—including Senator Milne. Does that mean that, because Australia will accept the global carbon price for international markets, whatever we do in Australia will not necessarily have much of an impact on the international price of carbon in terms of that international trade—that it will be negligible in the scheme of things?

The first and most obvious one is the extent of reductions that the world commits to. That will be the primary driver of the carbon price—how much and how deeply the world agrees to reduce its emissions and over what period of time. So, obviously, Australia’s engagement is relevant to that, which is probably the key determinant of price.

The global price of carbon will respond to a whole range of decisions that the global community makes, including how much the world reduces by and how much private sector investment there is. There are a whole range of things which affect that carbon price. Obviously Australia’s involvement in an international agreement would be one of the things that affects the carbon price. But, no, we will not determine the global carbon price—just as we do not determine the price of a whole range of commodities traded on world markets.

It was first announced in the white paper, I think—possibly suggested in the green paper—that we would not allow exports in the initial years of the scheme. We do think that, over time, the ability to export emissions units is desirable, but, in the short term as a transitional measure at the commencement of the scheme, we believe that it is sensible not to allow exports. It would add complexity to the scheme in the early years.

We believe that allowing exports could lead to upward pressure on the domestic price. It could add complexity to the scheme. We believe that, in the early years, it is desirable to have a simpler scheme and a scheme where price volatility, including upward pressure on price, is managed. That is the reason for these transitional measures.

So the official modelling was done on a population of 33 million. I understand the official projection is now 35 million. I would have thought an increase of two million would be of some significance. I would be interested if the minister could advise us as to whether that figure has been revised up—and, if so, what impact that would have on the modelling.

I accept that. But I then ask: what financial and other impacts will a projected increase in our population to 35 million as opposed to 33 million mean in relation to the modelling done and to the figures? In very rough terms that would be an eight-or-so per cent increase. Somebody might be able to do the maths for me, but two million extra people is a fairly significant figure. I would be interested in how the government intends to calculate for that in the scheme.

Those assumptions included action around the rest of the world, technology—there were quite a number of assumptions. The key and central finding of that is that we can reduce our emissions and continue to grow our economy. The alteration in the order you refer to is of course a mid-century projection; we are not talking two million more people by next year. The question of how fast we grow and when we will hit a certain population figure—whether that is by 2050 or later—does not, in the government’s view, change that central proposition. The key issue in that modelling is that we can grow the Australian economy, we can continue to increase the number of jobs in Australia and we can still reduce emissions.

We are told that this is the most extensive modelling ever undertaken, and that we should rely on it, yet within a matter of 12 months the official figure for our population has blown out from 33 million to 35 million—and that is just to be discarded and ignored as being of no consequence. If the modelling was so good, how did they get it so wrong, by miscalculating Australia’s official population projection by a factor of two million people? That is, in anybody’s language, a pretty significant figure. But I accept that the folded arms and the look on the minister’s face indicate that we will not get a response to that, so we will move on.

I would be very interested to know why this New South Wales Labor government report—let us be quite clear on this: a state Labor government report—has come to this finding. It would be great if their findings were wrong but I think the people of Australia, particularly in New South Wales, are entitled to know the rationale for why this is wrong. I do not think they will have much faith in just a glib answer, given that it is now on the record that the modelling in relation to Australia’s population within 12 months has already blown out by two million. If we were to model that error out until 2050, I daresay we would have a very big population by 2050. Let us not rely on modelling that was done in the past. Let us just deal with the study undertaken not by some coalition but by the New South Wales Labor government. Tell us why it is wrong.

We are talking about projections of population some four decades away. The difference between reaching 35 million at 2050 or 35 million some years later is, in terms of demographic modelling, not the sort of issue he is trying to make it. But that is as he may wish to proceed. I cannot comment on a report about a draft report from Frontier Economics to an independent body that is not a statutory authority of the Commonwealth or on a report that is not provided to me. I cannot comment on the status of the report, other than to say that public reports are that it is a draft report to IPART. I have again reiterated what our view is as to the increase in electricity prices.

To clarify in terms of what the minister said my understanding of the way that IPART actually works is that it does not release a draft determination lightly although it has not been publicly released. The media reports relate to their draft determination, which is what the

My understanding is very clearly this: the draft determination and the final determinations rarely change apart from perhaps some minor amendments. The draft determination is not reached unless there has been extensive consultation with consumers, industry and all the key stakeholders. If these reports are correct, that is indeed very sobering.

That is something that concerns me. Minister, given that Senator Abetz has raised these issues, I am happy to ask these questions in the context of amendments I will be moving on an alternative intensity based scheme, but I will put them on notice now. Can the minister confirm that the government’s estimate was a seven to 12 per cent increase in electricity prices? This seems to be nearly three times, up to over four times, that amount.

If IPART is correct, won’t that mean a very substantial blow-out in the budget outlook, given the level of compensation?

I am giving the minister the option as to whether she wishes to answer it now or later. That may not be an option that Senator Abetz wishes to give the minister, but as a courtesy to the minister I am happy for it to be answered either now or later. But I want to make the point again that IPART does not make even draft determinations lightly, given the very extensive processes it goes into before a draft determination is made.

That is why I am trying to explore this a bit earlier—to see what the responses are.

That is basically the choice, and do you know who I am putting my money on? The state Labor government, because they are concerned about the higher prices, and that is why I made the reference that I did to the state Labor government. But technically Senator Xenophon is right. IPART commissioned it but it was then passed to state Labor and—surprise, surprise!—in that process somehow it got leaked. I do not know how that would have occurred, but I am going to give the benefit of the doubt to IPART that they did not. But now that it is out in the public arena, I would have thought the federal government would say: ‘This is a matter of interest. This is coming to a different conclusion to our original modelling’—

Interesting, isn’t it? Who had a state government report about the cost to power stations? We cannot actually see the report, but the details have found their way into the media. It would not have been the Victorian state government, would it, by any chance—another Labor state government?

The senator is imputing motive and intention which was not there. He may make an argument but I would ask him to withdraw that comment. The senator made an interjection. That may not have been an appropriate thing to do, but that she interjected to try to get the senator opposite to be relevant is not to suggest that she is dismissive of the interests of working families, which seems to be the proposition.

So, Senator Abetz, do not come in here and lecture me and other Labor senators about participating in this committee debate and answering questions, because we have gone well past the time that your government permitted for questions on an extreme industrial relations policy. That is the factual situation and that is the context.

If and when that report is finalised and IPART believes it is appropriate for the federal government to consider it, obviously we will do so. But you are asking me on the basis of a media report to comment on a draft report that I have not seen.

Labor are not. In fact, the largest single proportion of assistance under this scheme goes to Australian families. Ninety per cent of Australian families gained support from our scheme to help them manage the impact of a carbon price. We have consciously sought to do that. That has been a principle to which we have adhered.

I understand, Minister, that earlier in the chamber you placed on record some of the figures. Throughout this whole debate I think I have only been away for about 10 minutes. I have tried my hardest to be in the chamber for the entirety of this debate. My questions are around the 90 per cent of the low-income households who are going to receive the assistance, as you say, equal to around 120 per cent of the overall cost increases they face. Could you advise the chamber how you determined that 120 per cent was the appropriate figure? We would assume that 100 per cent of that 120 per cent would relate directly to the increases in electricity costs and the other 20 per cent would relate to overall costs. If that is not the case, Minister, perhaps you could explain why it is that 120 per cent of the increase for electricity costs is being given to households.

There have been a range of questions in the committee that have been of a general nature, which have been quite useful in enabling those people out in the community to get an understanding of some of those issues they are particularly interested in that may not relate to specific amendments. I thank the chamber for its indulgence to continue very briefly. People out in the community, particularly those in the low-income area, are particularly interested to get some answers. I certainly do not intend to hold the chamber up for a very long period.

I thank Senator Nash for the courtesy. This is the table I was having trouble finding that I had prepared for the Senator Milne debate on free permits to the electricity sector. I am happy to table the cameo analysis of household assistance packages. It is available on the website. Obviously family types differ, but, for example, for a sole parent on a taxable income of $25,000 or thereabouts with two dependent children—one aged between 8 and 12 and one aged between 13 and 15—we have estimated the total cost increase for that family type to be $544. The actual assistance being provided is in excess of $1,000. All of this information, with detailed cameos, is available on the website. If the senator would like me to table the document I am happy to do so.

These will be my final couple of questions. I do understand that we want to move on. I do appreciate that the government is trying to compensate particularly low income households for their increased costs, but I am just struggling a little bit to find the rationale for why they should be overcompensated for the increase in costs. I think the minister just said it was $544 in this particular instance, yet the government was going to pay $1,000. I am at a loss as to the rationale for why they should be overcompensated for what are the identified increases. Given the obvious variable nature of these costs, I would also be interested to know how the government has determined to budget for that, taking into account this overcompensation. Perhaps the minister could advise of some answers to those questions and, indeed, the very important question of when this assistance runs out.

This assistance is ongoing. The amount of the assistance will be adjusted each year in the budget context. This is this government’s commitment. Obviously if a coalition government at some point is elected I cannot speak for what their policy would be. Our government’s commitment is that we would continue the assistance. The amount of the assistance or the adequacy of the assistance will be reviewed each year in the budget context. It is important to understand that the cost impact of putting a price on carbon is related to what that price is. If the price on carbon is high, therefore the revenue stream is high, therefore we can give more assistance to Australian households.

Over the 10 years it is actually budget negative. But the households package continues to be funded out of the revenue stream. So the more polluters pay, the more that impacts in terms of the carbon price, and then we provide more assistance to Australian families. We make no apology for prioritising low-income Australia and middle-income Australia and providing that assistance. You asked about the level of assistance, the review of assistance and why we were giving so much to low-income Australians. We have made a policy decision about that. Then I think you asked about how we assessed overall cost increases: they are the average cost increase assumed for that household type. That is why we do have an additional amount built in for a great number of family types. Senator, you are about to jump up again; you have said now on two occasions that this was your last question.

This is the issue of free permits to coal fired electricity generators. The issuing of free permits to the very industry that has caused the greatest problem, that as a sector generates the greatest number of emissions in Australia is the coal fired electricity sector.

I repeat: there is no public policy purpose for these free permits going to coal fired power stations. Of course, they are not just bits of paper; they have monetary value.

When that figure was announced everyone assumed that was the extent of it. But no, the figures show that the $7.3 billion for no public purpose, given to the biggest polluters in Australia, is based on a cut of five per cent. If the cut in emissions goes to 15 per cent, then from our calculations it is well in excess of $10 billion. I would like the minister to actually specifically put on the public record what the cost is if this goes to a 15 per cent reduction in emissions, and what the cost is if it goes to a 25 per cent reduction in emissions.

This is robbery, in my view. There is no justification for it whatsoever. These companies have known for 20 years that a carbon price was coming, just like the tobacco industry knew for years and the asbestos industry knew for years. They have all employed the same tactics, whether it is tobacco, asbestos or coal: they have known about the greenhouse effect in all that time and they have known that a carbon price was coming. They have done everything in their power not to reduce their emissions, not to transfer out of coal fired power but, rather, to spend the money on expensive lobbyists here in Canberra, rent seeking.

Interestingly, Citi Investment Research and Analysis director Elaine Prior said yesterday that the deal has secured the immediate future of coal-fired electricity. Well, how ridiculous is that? We are meant to be taking action on climate change to drive transformation in the Australian economy—to get rid of coal-fired generation and to transform to the new low-emission technologies—and what do we have? We have a guarantee on coal-fired electricity. As Ms Prior said:

There has never been a more disgraceful example of unjustified policy.

Even worse, the government will delay the windfall gains test that applies to this assistance to apply to the last three years of 10 years assistance rather than to the last two years of five years assistance and apply the test to only half of a generator’s allocation.

If the government thought it was reasonable even when there was no justification for this to apply a windfall gains test in the last two years of a five-year period, on what possible basis are they taking out this assistance to 10 years, applying the windfall gains test in the last three years and then only to half of a generator’s allocation in this three-year period, which will give generators greater certainty over their allocations? Of course it will, and that is what they set out to do. Wasn’t it a great investment in those lobbyists? Haven’t they done incredibly well out of all of this to the detriment of the whole community? This is a disgraceful, unjustified wealth transfer. The Labor government and the coalition are all under the influence of the lobbyists who came here to Canberra. How they must be laughing all the way to the bank.

They can go out there and say, ‘We are taking action on climate change,’ but when asked, ‘How is that?’, they will have to say, ‘We are giving compensation to the coal-fired power industry and keeping them operating out to 2020. In fact, we are penalising them such that, if they cannot produce the level of coal-fired power, they will not get the compensation.’ So the only condition to the $7.3 billion is, ‘Keep on pumping out those emissions.’

It was around the corner. It was only a matter of years away. Then it was decades away. Now it is more than decades away under the Treasury’s own modelling. It shows that electricity generation emissions are not going to fall in Australia until 2034. Why 2034? It is 2034 because that is when the government and Treasury assume carbon capture and storage will come into its own. Everybody knows that is a joke. Nobody in their right mind now believes that carbon capture and storage is going to be real. So all we have here is a guarantee that the biggest polluters will get the most out of this scheme. Money is being taken out of the pockets of households. The compensation provisions for households have been changed. Billions have gone out of households and straight across to the polluters. It is $7.3 billion to keep on polluting. So those people who are saying, ‘Just pass this and we will improve it,’ should think again. You cannot improve it. You are locking in $7.3 billion for nothing. It is nothing for householders and, worse still, it is locking in failure by guaranteeing that these coal-fired polluters will keep on polluting out until 2020 at least and beyond.

We are talking about less than six years from now and yet the government has sandbagged coal-fired power and locked in a guaranteed failure in terms of transitioning the electricity sector at least out until 2020. So do not let us hear any of this talk about transformation in the Australian economy. Every one of you that supports this package is supporting the transfer of $7.3 billion into a situation where, as Professor Garnaut describes:

It is for nothing at all other than to give multinational companies a massive gain at the expense of the Australian community and at the expense of transformation in the electricity sector. I really look forward now to hearing from the minister and from the coalition. What is your justification? What is the public policy explanation for this appalling handout to multinational corporations in return for nothing, other than the fact that it is a craven cave-in to the coal-fired electricity sector?

The answer to your question about why we are doing this is very simple—this is about the security of Australia’s electricity supply. That is the public policy question to which we addressed our minds. It is not about giving people a windfall gain. It is not about being craven. It is not about being corrupted. It is about this government responsibly working with the opposition to deliver a package which, we believe, secures Australia’s electricity supply through this transition.

I again put on record what I put on record last week—it seems to escape the Greens’ focus that sometimes people of goodwill can approach a public policy question and come to a different answer. It is not because we have been got to. It is not because we are craven. It is not because somehow we have been corrupted. We simply come to a different view. We disagree with your policy proposition. This is one of those occasions.

I want to try—briefly, if I can, because I know Senator Abetz was jumping to his feet—to deal with them. I will try to deal with them as best I can. One issue was that you asserted that people have to keep polluting to get this assistance. It seems to me, respectfully, that you have misread the power system reliability test that the government has included in the original bill—I will come to the amendments we are moving shortly—which is a requirement for receiving assistance under this scheme. What we have said to the recipients of this scheme is, ‘You cannot exit unless the market operator says you can.’ That is about ensuring that we can continue to supply. It is not saying ‘You have to stay.’ It is saying, ‘If you want to exit, you have to exit with the consent’—with a certificate, I think, is the way we have regulated it—‘of the market operator.’

That new investment must have an emissions intensity of less than current best practice coal-fired power generation capacity in Australia.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     </p>

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      So your assessment of the eligibility requirements, with respect, is not correct. In addition, one of the amendments we are moving is saying, ‘Let’s amend that so as to ensure that, if people want to invest in lower emissions generating capacity, they can do that and still receive their assistance.’ That is an incentive for the transformation to which you refer. I apologise, Senator. I do not believe that amendment is yet before the chamber. I understand we have foreshadowed it. I recall why—it is because we need some consultation with the stakeholders and I am advised that it is quite difficult technically to ensure that it is properly drafted, so we want to make sure that that occurs.

I have said publicly—including in the face of various companies asserting that they should have significantly more than is on the table—that we do not believe the public policy proposition that we need to consider is full compensation for all loss of asset value. The public policy proposition is what we need to do to ensure we have a package which ensures confidence in the sector and which delivers the continued security of Australia’s electricity supply through this, as you quite rightly described it, transformation.

In the context that this bill should have been voted on at the end of last week, where would we have been on that issue if the bill had been passed last week? That is just an interesting observation.

I had sought previously, in an orderly way, to ask a few general questions. Unfortunately there were interruptions by other senators and now Senator Milne has moved her amendment. That is fine, but I will now ask a raft of general questions and seek to get the minister’s response to them in due course.

The new information, for example with the IPART report, is a matter that could not have been asked about beforehand in the general discussion of the committee or before the report was publicly released. If a senator is to be condemned for raising a general matter of this nature in the committee stage, that would mean that the senator would be locked out from asking questions about what is a very serious matter.

He believes that the government, in assuming a price of $26 for each carbon emission permit, may well be wrong. He believes it will be more like $35 to $40. Now either the government agrees with Mr Hitchens or they do not. If they disagree with Mr Hitchens, can they please tell us not that they have done earlier modelling but why this literally hot-off-the-press information is wrong? Could they also give us all the calculations as to why his assertions are wrong? Because clearly, if there is going to be in rough terms an extra $10 cost for each carbon emission permit, the impact on the economy must of necessity be considerably greater.

But, if that falls—and for every 1c it might fall it is over $1 billion of revenue to the Treasury—and if we get back to what is considered to be sort of a long-term rate with the American dollar, which is around 80c, then the Treasury is looking at a shortfall of about $12 billion. This is just hot off the press. It was reported yesterday. Today is the first opportunity to raise it in the chamber, and I have given way to other senators for other particular debates and amendments in this place. But these are fundamentally important issues that the government really do have to answer to the Australian people for. They may have perfectly good explanations. If they do, that is great.

If that is the case that is good, but I just wonder whether the government is going to provide an official statement or document in relation to what has now become known as ‘Climate-gate’, where clearly the information has been doctored or, to use that terrible term, ‘sexed up’. I said ‘clearly’ but I should have said that that is the allegation. The allegation is that that has occurred. That allegation has now been in the community for some two to three weeks. I still have not seen an official government position being put out in relation to that by way of a document indicating whether the allegations are true or not. It would seem, given the response of the academics involved, that they have been unable to deny the truthfulness of the email exchanges and that there is an absence of the raw data which would enable people to rework their calculations.

You took us just past 24 hours—so I am advised. In relation to household assistance, that is scaled to the carbon price, and the document I tabled is scaled to the carbon price that was assumed as a result of the MYEFO change. In relation to Mr Hitchens’s calculations of a carbon price, you will have to ask him. I have no knowledge of what assumptions he utilised.

You spoke on a range of questions which, as a matter of courtesy, I am responding to. They have nothing to do with the amendments, and I would invite the chair to start to consider, given that taxpayers are paying for us to be here, the fact that these are completely irrelevant to the amendments moved by Senator Milne. They are completely irrelevant.

Senator Abetz, you will have to ask Mr Hitchens what his assumptions are for his carbon price calculation. We have been transparent about our calculation of the carbon price. That is the MYEFO estimate. I would make the point that the international carbon price, from memory, is currently around $22. So one would, just as a matter of logic, not have thought that $26, which is the assumed starting carbon price in the first year of a floating price, is that demonstrably different.

I want to move on to the serious issues that I raised in relation to compensation for coal fired power. I did ask the minister specifically whether the $7.3 billion compensation pertained to a five per cent cut in emissions, exactly how much this would rise to if there were a 15 per cent cut in emissions and what that would rise to if there were a 25 per cent cut in emissions.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        </p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        <p>
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         I also go to the minister saying that there will be a low-emissions transition incentive that will amend the power system reliability test to allow generators to receive credit for their own investments in replacement capacity, and that not only will they get that but they will continue to receive their remaining scheduled compensation payments at the same time. I would like to know what the quantum of the low-emissions transition incentive is. Is this an unlimited amount of money? This is over and above the compensation we have talked about. Can the minister say what quantum is expected there in addition to the specifics of exactly how much compensation these coal fired generators are going to get if the emissions reductions rise to that which I have suggested?

The whole point of an emissions trading scheme, surely, is to put a sufficient price on emissions so that gas and renewables are more cost-effective against coal. This surely deliberately undermines one of the central tenets of the whole point of emissions trading. As I indicated before, the share price for coal companies, coal fired generators and electricity generators has reflected the risk of carbon pricing for a long time. You cannot suggest that the same companies who are now generating coal fired power are necessarily the companies that are going to be offering energy into the future. We do not owe them a living. There are a whole lot of new companies that are involved in renewables and that have moved across to gas and so on. They have a right to be in the market, able to compete. As we know, the generators can pass on the costs, and this is getting to a point where the competition is such that gas and renewables take over. What is happening here is that you are undermining all of the drivers for that to happen. So I again would like to ask the minister why she is undermining her own scheme with sandbagging the big coal fired polluters. Can she give me the quantum of figures in relation to those matters?

Obviously there were some carbon price estimates in the Garnaut modelling and the Treasury modelling from 2008, but I do not have further modelling on those figures to provide you. You could extrapolate though—it is just a calculation of multiplication on what the carbon price estimate under the Treasury modelling is. But those are the figures which are in the Treasury modelling. Perhaps I was not clear when I was explaining what the low-emissions transition incentive was. That is not an additional payment; that is a change to the eligibility requirements that enables a generator to invest in replacement low-emissions capacity as a requirement for continuing to receive their existing

So it is not an additional payment; it is saying that you can continue to receive this if you invest in low-emissions technology.

I do not know what projected price they are suggesting, but the Australian community has a right to know. When the $7.3 billion went out there as a price it was never made clear to people that that was based on a five per cent reduction. I am not suggesting that the government needs to put all detail in always, but I think it is imperative, since the government is saying that its scheme is five to 25, that the Australian community knows what five, 15 and 25 would do in terms of this compensation for coal fired power. So I would like to ask the government to do that calculation.

If that is not a windfall gain, then I do not know how you would define a windfall gain.

We are not discussing assistance to coal—we have discussed those amendments. We are discussing assistance to the generation sector. I have sought to treat Senator Joyce’s questions with due regard for his office, but I do not see how that question has any relevance in terms of assistance to coal when we are talking about assistance to generators.

To the best of my knowledge, the vast majority of electricity generation is done by coal—or maybe things have changed since five minutes ago. So it has an immense connection to coal because the generation of electricity is done by coal. Minister, using that 2008 modelling, which you say is also premised on two factors from Garnaut, is this a part of your compensation arrangements for electricity generators?

They will have to pay anything over that. That will be passed on to them by the brown coal fired generators from the Latrobe Valley—0.25 to 0.6 CO2 megawatts per hour will be passed on to them.

They have calculated that that will affect their bottom line by $40 million. If that is the result, that will be unsustainable for Victoria’s largest exporter, Alcoa, and yet they cannot get certainty from the government. So my question to the minister is: what certainty can you provide the industry once the current contracts run out?

I will give you an hour and a half. I will make it 23 hours, Senator Parry. Senator Joyce, I think any reasonable observation would be that I have sought to answer a great many questions. I genuinely do not understand what you are asking. I do not understand what the phrase ‘prevalence of Garnaut in modelling’ means. I do not understand what the reference is to coal. Are you talking about coalmines or coal-fired generators? I genuinely do not understand the questions, so I am unable to assist you.

However, I would emphasise as follows: the issue is not the emissions intensity of the generators; it is the increase in price. The modelling indicates that the change in price is less than that assumed or given by the electricity allocation factor. For this argument to be correct, coal fired generators would fully pass on their costs and would have no loss of asset value. That is not consistent with the argument from the generators. I do understand. I am familiar with this issue. It has been raised with me by the company and others. There is a negotiation between the company and generators. That is a matter of commercial negotiation.

I have taken a very clear policy view that governments do not second-guess commercial negotiations. That is the case essentially across the board. I certainly am aware that there are a range of different views about the outcome of a range of contractual negotiations and how prices will or will not be passed through. What I can say to you is that the policy position of the government is that the electricity allocation factor which has been established is a reasonable one.

At the time of the white paper the government made announcements about its view about the appropriate quantum of the Electricity Sector Adjustment Scheme. I am just asking my officials to go back to that, because my recollection is that there were three different modelling exercises undertaken by private sector companies which informed the government decisions in relation to the Electricity Sector Adjustment Scheme.

The modelling to which I have referred looked at a range of issues. What we have put here is the model change in asset value. It is the case that there was a very significant variation in the asset value that was modelled. That is all public; it is on the public record. There was never a mechanical link between the modelling and the policy decision. We did not contract out a government policy decision to a few modelling firms. We contracted modelling firms to model and that informed government policy, and that informed the negotiations with the opposition. As I said, I think the best way to say this is that we considered a range of issues. One of them was the modelling which informed our decision but was not determinative of the decision of the government. I cannot speak for the opposition, as to what process they undertook, but we did come to an agreement on what was regarded as a sensible approach.

My job as minister is to carry through the parliament, if the parliament will support it, a bill which will start to reduce Australia’s emissions, which will put in place a carbon price and which will support a whole range of sectors in our economy through this transition. The energy sector is one of them. What private sector individuals or companies do as a result of us putting in place a carbon price will be a matter for them. We are unashamedly and absolutely changing the incentives. For once we are saying, ‘Yes, you should have some regard to the cost of climate change in the decisions you make,’ and the way will do that is by putting in place a carbon price.

As I understand the nub of the issue, this is about the allocation of permits to generators. I have made it clear that I do not have so much of an issue with the allocation of free permits, because it is important to have continuity of supply. My concern is the question of the conditionality of that and, if you like, the mutual obligation. If taxpayers’ funds are being used, what do we get in return in the context of a scheme that is meant to reduce greenhouse gas emissions? I would be grateful if the minister, with respect to the amendment moved by Senator Milne, could elaborate on the matters raised by Senator Milne about the potential costs.

How conditional is it, and how robust is the process to ensure that for the billions of dollars in free permits there is a requirement for coal-fired power stations, for instance, to mandatorily moved towards lower emission technology?

In other words, as the focus of this package, as the government intended, is on ensuring we have a package that delivers energy security, we put in place criteria which required that a generating capacity not exit without the market operator’s consent. What we have said is that you can, in terms of maintaining the available generation capacity, invest in low-emissions technology—that is, lower emissions than best practice coal—in order to meet the supply availability test. I went through this previously with Senator Milne.
