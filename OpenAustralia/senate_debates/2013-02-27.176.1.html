        asked the Minister representing the Treasurer, upon notice, on 1 November 2012:

        With reference to the
        <i>

         1998

         ADI
        </a>
        s), and in particular Section 8, which sets out shareholding limits by reference to voting power, and subclause 10(1) of Schedule 1, which defines the stake that a person holds in a company at a particular time as 'the aggregate of: (a) the direct control interests in the company that the person holds at that time; and (b) the direct control interests in the company held at that time by associates of the person':
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Would a company that makes an application to the

        (a) what would be the legislative grounds for rejecting this application; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) is it the intention of the Act that such an application would be rejected on the grounds that the funding base is not diversified.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Does APRA require a diversification of not only the voting power but also the economic ownership for financial sector companies to comply with the 15 per cent shareholding limit; if so:

         The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The 15 per cent control threshold in the Financial Sector (Shareholdings) Act 1998 is based on the concept of voting power. However a person with less than 15 per cent voting power may be declared to have practical control over a financial sector company, for example if the company's directors are accustomed or under an obligation to act in accordance with that person's wishes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSSA" rel="nofollow">
          FSSA
         </a>
         does not impose a blanket prohibition on a person controlling a financial sector company. However it does require the person to obtain the approval of the Treasurer (or APRA, where it exercises the relevant delegation). Approval may be granted if it is deemed consistent with the national interest. Prudential considerations are a key factor in determining the national interest in these circumstances.
