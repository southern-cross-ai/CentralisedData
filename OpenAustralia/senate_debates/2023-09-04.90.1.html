        I rise to promote the importance of voting in support of the Voice on 14 October. It is essential for our nation to come together, and I'm very proud to be part of a government that wants to unite the country and to right the wrongs of the past. There is nothing more important than having your name on your birth certificate, and that is the case for our

        people. We know that decade after decade—and the majority of that, I might add, was under those on that side when they have been in government—we have failed the First Nations people of this country. They have failed them.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an important time in our nation's history as we continue the journey of reconciliation. History is approaching on 14 October, and supporting the Voice to Parliament should be a proud moment for all of us as we honour and recognise

        the Prime Minister—yes, he was moving around the country—got a wonderfully warm and supportive welcome when he came to Launceston. As the Prime Minister and I walked around the streets of Launceston we were inundated with people thanking him for showing this leadership because they want to see our country come together. They want to see real change. They are sick of reading the terrible health statistics of Australia's First Nations people. They are sick and tired of hearing about First Nations children who don't have the same opportunities with their education as the rest of the Australian population. They are sick and tired of hearing the terrible, sad effects of those who end up incarceration or those who take their life.

       <p>
        We have failed the First People of this country, but on 14 October we can take a step and be part of history. There is nothing to fear from bringing the country together and giving all Australians the opportunity that we all deserve.
