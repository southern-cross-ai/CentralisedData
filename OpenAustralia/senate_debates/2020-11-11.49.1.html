        In the brief time that I have available, I'd like to acknowledge the service that

         John McVeigh
        </a>
        gave to the Commonwealth parliament, thank him and his family for the service they gave to Toowoomba and the broader
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Downs
        </a>
        and wish him and Anita the best for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        has a brilliant candidate in Garth Hamilton, who is flying the flag of freedom for the LNP in the upcoming Groom by-election on 28 November. Garth is someone who was raised by his family. His dad was a concreter, and Garth spent his childhood helping pour driveways. He was so fascinated by building things that he went to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        , where he became an engineer, and then went overseas to help build things. He's come back to Australia and he wants to help build things in Queensland and Australia. He wants to help finish build the inland rail, which, after 100 years, is going to be built by this government. He's going to help build a better Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, on 28 November, I encourage everybody in Toowoomba to make sure they vote for Garth Hamilton—someone who is going to deliver for Groom and is going to deliver for Queensland, someone who is a fighter, someone who is going to put his experience into making sure that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Liberal National Party
        </a>
        and this government are a party and a government that do things for Queensland, like dams and roads. Because guess what—the Labor government in Queensland won't be doing it.
