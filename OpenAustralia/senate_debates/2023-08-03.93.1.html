        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water, Senator Wong. It was revealed last week that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Antarctic_Division" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Antarctic Division
        </a>
        needs to now slash $25 million, an astonishing 16 per cent of its operating budget, from its activities. As a result of these cuts under the Albanese government, how many jobs, contract, part time and full time, will be lost, and, from the 56 of those now apparently identified on an internal list, how many different Antarctic science programs, projects and research activities will you gut?

           I will answer the question, Senator Birmingham—thank you for the advice. Given what those opposite did to the Public Service, but also given the fact that, on the one hand, they want us to spend more, but, on the other hand, they want us to spend less, Senator Duniam should probably speak to Senator Hume. The advice I have is this: despite what those opposite have been claiming, there has been no government decision to cut spending to the Antarctic program. That's the advice I have. We are continuing to roll out the $804 million invested in the Antarctic program through to the end of the decade. I'm advised that the $25 million figure referenced in media reports reflects the Antarctic Division's internal management of its own budget.
          </p>
          <p>
           Honourable senators: Oh!
          </p>
          <p>
           Oh! Wow! There's spooky music over there, isn't there? I would make this point. In the past, when I have had relevant portfolios, whilst I didn't get to Antarctica, I did visit the Antarctic Division. They do very good work. It is a very important part of not only Australia's future but also Australia's legacy in terms of the work that we have done, both at the scientific level and in terms of international law. We understand how important the program is, and I understand that the minister recently was in Tasmania and addressed all staff.

             Given apparently there are no cuts, in an email to staff on 10 July—just 11 days after Minister Plibersek visited the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAD" rel="nofollow">
              AAD
             </a>
             , as the minister said, to talk up their work—the AAD director said, 'It is my expectation that we won't be able to afford all current positions—and I recognise that this will be hard.' Then, on 28 July, she again told staff, 'We will need to carefully consider our current staffing levels.' Given the director's statements, how can the minister and her department possibly claim there will be no job losses?

                Senator Duniam, I can only give you the advice I have received. If there is anything further that I have in relation to that, I obviously would, as I always do, seek to provide that to the Senate. But that is the advice from the portfolio minister. I appreciate that Senator Duniam wants to run a political issue. I'm providing him with the advice that I have received from the portfolio minister.

Minister, aren't both Associate Professor Zika and Mr Batchelor right about the devastating impacts of the pursuit of this $25 million worth of cuts?

                   I'm very pleased that Senator Duniam does think it's a good thing that trade unions speak up for their members. Maybe he should have a chat to Senator Cash! What I would say is that the premise of the question is incorrect. The advice that I have from the minister is as I've outlined.

                     Everything thereafter is probably more akin to a speech by Senator Duniam than a question of a minister. I would say that Australia, obviously, has had a very proud history in relation to Antarctica. We are a global leader in Antarctic science.
