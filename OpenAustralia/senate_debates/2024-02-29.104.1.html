        My question is to Senator Gallagher, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Water. There have been some disturbing reports today that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        is on the brink of a seventh mass coral bleaching. Could you please update the Senate and the Australian people on this disturbing news? When will we know for certain that this has occurred?

         Thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson, for the question. I haven't seen those reports this morning, I must say, but I am aware, obviously, of the issue of coral bleaching and the impact on the

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         This government has made it a priority to make investments into the reef, to restore and repair it, and I know that Senator Green has been leading that work, in consultation with and in support of Minister Plibersek, to do what has needed to be done to ensure the future of the Great Barrier Reef. It's a reef that, as anyone who has visited knows, is of incredible beauty. It's an important part of

                     This is potentially the seventh mass coral bleaching since 1998, which was the first mass coral bleaching ever recorded. It's the fifth in eight years. Ocean temperatures right around the world, year on year, continue to set new records. Minister, does your government accept that the burning of fossil fuels—and climate change—is causing these marine heatwaves and coral bleaching, and that it is the single biggest threat to the

                      Well, we certainly believe in climate change. We believe that the transition to renewable energy is an important and essential piece of work before the government. We work with you where we can. I think our record, in the first 18 months, is of doing what we can in the environment portfolio—and it shows what you can do when you have a government that actually does believe in climate change—to make the necessary investments. I will go through them: 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030; 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030; doubling the rate of renewable energy approvals, with 43 ticked off, which will power 2½ million homes; a record 127 more renewable projects in the pipeline; cheaper electric cars; higher fuel efficiency standards; huge upgrades to our energy grid, to take more renewable energy; help for homes and businesses to get off gas and electricity—

                        —and it's not the only coral reef in the world that we will lose. Minister, you've said several times today, 'We're doing what we can,' and I agree we can do more, and I'm sure you agree. Will your government consider a climate trigger in new environment laws so that we can actually reduce our emissions in this country and play our part?

                         The minister for the environment is working with people across this parliament around reforms to that piece of legislation. I have no doubt that that will play out, as it will, in this chamber and the other place. But I would say that it's a much better position to be in to deal with the effects of climate change if we have agreement across the parliament. The biggest threat to the work we're doing now and to reducing the impact of a warming climate is sitting right in front of you, opposing fuel efficiency standards, opposing renewable energy projects and opposing energy bill relief—opposing all the measures we take. If 10 years of climate wars has proved one thing to anybody outside this place it is that when this parliament works together we can get some things done, and we can make steps in the right direction.
