        I have a question about certainty. It is addressed to the Minister for Resources and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        , Senator Canavan. We all like certainty in our lives. Senator Canavan, why is it important to provide certainty to native title stakeholders?

         I thank Senator Macdonald for his question. I know his strong appreciation of the importance of supporting development in northern Australia in particular. In many parts of northern Australia of course native title is the governing legal arrangement for the use of land. It is a different title from what most of us would expect. There are different arrangements in place. Because investments there go over a number of years, in mines, farms or other developments, there is a need for certainty to underpin investment and to underpin confidence from others around the world that they can come to this country and invest and create jobs in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of decisions in courts earlier this year uncertainty has been introduced. The government has acted quickly to remove that uncertainty and to restore faith in the system. We should act to do that because that is what the native title holders themselves want. That is what the National
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Title" rel="nofollow">
          Native Title
         </a>
         Council want. They have written to the government and said that they urge parliament to consider this bill 'as soon as possible'—their words. That is what members of the National Native Title Council who represent parties in this area want.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Queensland government have written to the government and Premier Palaszczuk said, 'I request that as a matter of urgency your government moves to amend the act.' They want the change to occur because they realise what this means for the state of Queensland and the importance of investment there. Indeed, the Australian federal Labor Party have recognised how important this is as well. On 31 March, Mr Shorten and others wrote to the Prime Minister saying, 'We're willing to work to achieve these objectives'—that is, to change the bill—'as soon as possible and we believe with the cooperation of government this matter can be resolved quickly in the next sitting of parliament.' That is what we are trying to achieve.

           <p>
            As I mentioned on the first question, this is a matter of urgency. The decision in the court, known as the McGlade decision, was made on 2 February, and the government moved to introduce legislation just under two weeks after that. A Senate committee was held which made a number of recommendations which the government has taken on board.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Brandis, Senator Scullion and Senator Dodson—I do recognise the work of Senator Dodson—held a round table in Melbourne on 27 April with a number of registered native title claimants and their registered bodies. The result of that meeting was that consensus view—that letter to the government in support of these changes. What is holding us up?
           </p>
           <p>
            On radio this morning, Mr Warren Mundine said that we need to get this on now, today, otherwise we are going to delay and delay it, and more Australian jobs are going to be delayed, and economic advantage for Australia and more opportunity for Indigenous jobs will be at risk. That is the view of Indigenous people and we should respect their views in this place and get on with the job we are here to do.

              I thank the minister for that answer. Is the minister aware of any threats to jobs and prosperity, particularly to workers in Central and

               Senator Macdonald is absolutely right: the risks that are involved here if we do not act in accordance with the views of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
                Indigenous Australians
               </a>
               . There has been some suggestion that there is only one agreement at risk. But a letter from the National
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Title" rel="nofollow">
                Native Title
               </a>
               Council to the government makes the point that a number of ILUAs, Indigenous land use agreements, that are currently subject to the registration test due to deceased or non-signing RNTCs are at risk of not being able to be registered unless we act—a number of those agreements.
              </p>
              <p>
               One of those agreements that is at risk is the agreement relating to the Adani Carmichael coalmine, which is supported by the local Indigenous people. It will provide thousands of jobs for Australians, including jobs for Indigenous people. But, because we cannot seem to do our job in this place, those jobs are now at risk and they are at risk because of the actions of the federal
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Labor Party
               </a>
               . I hope there are no claims from them tonight, from Mr Shorten and others, that they support jobs in this country, because their actions today in this place clearly show they do not support jobs. They do not support the creation of jobs in this country and they cannot make claims to the contrary tonight.
