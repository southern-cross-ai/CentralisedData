          Thank you, Senator Paterson. I've had a response from the Attorney-General and it's a very long response. I'm happy to give it to you—to read it out or to table it. What about that? Are you happy to receive it through tabling?

           I certainly have no objection to it being tabled, but I would also like to ask follow-up questions based on it. If it's a very long statement, I suppose that we shouldn't waste time on reading it out. Perhaps other senators can ask their questions and deal with their matters while I consider the document, after it has been tabled, and then I can ask questions on that basis.

              I would have thought that they would police it in the same way they police it in a general election: if somebody makes a complaint or they discover that somebody hasn't authorised relevant material then they would take the action they would take in any other set of circumstances.

                        My understanding is that if they go over the disclosure threshold then they would have to declare. That threshold, which I think I talked about earlier today, is in the vicinity of $15,000.

                          This act replicates the foreign donations provisions of the Electoral Act. As I've said so many times today, the idea is to match the same experience, and so the same provisions would apply.

                                  The idea is that, by virtue of the foreign donations rules, it would work in the same way it would work in a general election.

The idea is to standardise the experience that people get and the obligations organisations have, whether it be for a general election or for a referendum.

                                                It would be the same as it is for a political organisation if they raise more money than they use in an election. It would sit somewhere, I guess, in a bank account. Obviously, if it exceeds the threshold, they would be required to declare that. I assume it would be up to the organisation as to what it subsequently does with the money.

                                                  I think the rule would be the same as a political party getting more money than it expends. I don't know how often that happens. I suppose it happens occasionally. It never happens in the Labor Party, so we never have this issue. The only answer I can give you is that the organisation would have to resolve how they dealt with the money. If it were no longer required, you'd hopefully get them to return the money if that were possible.

                                                   My concern there, of course, is that if you donate to a political party the chances are it's going to be fighting another election—a referendum is a one-off occurrence. I think that there probably needs to be some clarity around that. Perhaps you could confirm for the chamber that the government is considering how to build some clarity around that.

                                                      The hope of the government is that this referendum will be conducted in a civil fashion—that each side will have an opportunity to progress its arguments through civil society. Our expectation is that people will abide by that sense of civility in the processes and that we won't find people doing things that are inappropriate or, for that matter, illegal.
                                                     </p>
                                                     <p>
                                                      If we find that issues arise in that regard, and I hope we don't find that those sorts of issues arise, then I guess we'll have to deal with them. But we're working on the basis that people are going to behave appropriately throughout the course of the referendum and that we won't get into a situation where, for instance, people are illegally taking money on false pretences. But I guess there are other laws which might come into play. If somebody set themselves up as an organisation receiving money for the 'yes' or 'no' case and we discovered that in fact they were a bogus organisation, I imagine there are laws in place that deal with those sorts of things quite independently of the referendum.

                                                     <p>
                                                      I think we have to work on the basis of a degree of trust in the Australian people and trust that this will be a civil campaign and that, at the end of the day, whether it's a 'yes' case or a 'no' case, people are satisfied that the Australian people have had appropriate opportunity to express their view on a Voice to Parliament.

If the money is received and spent in the six months prior to the issuing of the writ then, yes, it will have to be included in the declaration that you make. I consider that a prospective rather than retrospective application because the declaration would have to be done after the issuing of the writ.

I'm happy to take you into the AEC one day and show you what they do in this space to keep an eye on all of these things. If they felt that there was an issue that needed to be addressed in this area, I'm sure the first thing they would do is make contact with me about it—or, for that matter, with the

I've got the greatest confidence that they will conduct the referendum in exactly the appropriate way, but that if an issue of foreign interference does arise then we will become aware of it and we will take appropriate action.

You suspect that if there were issues you would have heard about it, and since you haven't, perhaps there aren't. That indicates to me an attitude or a culture in the government of not taking this issue seriously. It is your job as ministers to seek advice and to consider the advice you are provided with. Minister, I did ask you this morning whether the government had sought advice from any agencies. You did undertake to come back to me about that. You appear not to be able to.

I've said that I have not received any advice which would lead me to believe that we currently have an issue in respect of foreign donations. One of the things we're doing here is reflecting the foreign donations provisions in the referendum. The last time the referendum took place, we didn't have those provisions in the referendum act. We will have them in the act now. Those provisions are there to stop foreign donations. I've got the greatest confidence in all of our authorities that, in the event that somebody were seeking to influence our referendum—foreign companies, foreign organisations—we would take the appropriate action to ensure that the law of this country applies and that those foreign donations were prohibited.

Members of the EIAT consult with online media platforms, including for major electoral events such as referenda, and have also established escalation processes for the referral of content in breach of the Commonwealth legislation or in social media platform terms of service. Agencies that participate in the EIAT are already working to provide appropriate support to protect the integrity of the proposed referendum, including from foreign actors. The government will continue to work through the members of the EIAT on risks to integrity of the referendum, including the threat of foreign interference, to ensure the public can have continued confidence in the conduct and the outcome of this and other electoral events.

If the answer is that the government has not met with the technology platforms in relation to this issue, you should just say so, and if you don't know, you should say that you don't know.

I'll read out what I said previously, which answers your question directly. Members of the EIAT consult with online media platforms, including prior to electoral events including referenda, and have also established escalation processes for the referral of the content in breach of Commonwealth legislation or social media platforms' terms of service.

In a normal election, the Electoral Integrity Assurance Taskforce that you referred to might contact a person that is leading a political party or an organisation, but, in this referendum, we don't have political parties or organisations, so how will this be managed under the current referendum machinery, where participants don't need to register prior to engaging in electoral activity?

I'm absolutely confident of that. We can be assured, I hope, that, at the end of this process, we'll get the same sort of communication from the AEC that we got in July 2022 that they didn't identify any foreign influence in the referendum.

In contrast, there are registered political parties at elections, which have officials and structures that can respond to those sorts of events. So, in this referendum, who will the agencies contact to make the 'yes' or 'no' cases aware of any of these issues?

Therefore, you don't appear to be informed about it. It is, of course, this legislation itself that will contribute to and risk exacerbating the risk of foreign interference, because you have not allowed for official 'yes' and official 'no' campaigns.
                                                                                                              </p>

How did you form the view that it wasn't necessary to have a 'yes' or 'no' case to ameliorate this risk if you didn't seek or receive briefings from our agencies and if you haven't met with tech platforms to discuss their point of view?

You can never guarantee that no foreign organisation may seek to influence them. I'm not saying that you could make that guarantee. But, certainly, based on the advice that we got subsequent to the last federal election, I have the greatest confidence in the AEC and other organisations that are responsible for monitoring this issue, and I know that they'll be able to deal with any issues that may arise.

I've had many such briefings in the past, and from them I know that it's not the AEC's responsibility to deal with content in an election campaign or a referendum campaign. It is, of course, content of speech and debate in the context of a referendum campaign which has the greatest risk of potential foreign interference. We have seen this in relation to recent reporting about foreign interference in the Canadian elections. We have seen this in other elections where content has been weaponised on social media platforms to drive disinformation—sometimes weaponised by foreign states to undermine social cohesion, undermine national unity and cause division. That is the risk in this debate, in this referendum, and it is exacerbated by your policy choice to not allow a formal 'yes' or 'no' case. Will you reconsider your opposition to a 'yes' or 'no' case?

I think she was just foreshadowing moving her amendment. But Senator Hanson does need to be relevant to the question before the chair, which is the content of the current amendment, so I will listen very closely to ensure that she is being relevant to that. But, I think, Senator Hanson, you are in order.

Policymakers, political parties, lobbyists and the media have become increasingly distanced from the Australian people they are supposed to serve. As a result, legislation and political commentary increasingly do not reflect the wishes and aspirations of the Australian electorate, and the people themselves are feeling increasingly powerless and disenfranchised. Our amendment seeks to reverse this trend and, for the first time, allow the agenda to be set by the Australian people, instead of out-of-touch politicians, lobbyists and the media.

Democracy is not an easy exercise and was never meant to be. By its nature, democracy is hard and difficult. Winston Churchill perhaps described it best when he said that democracy was the world's worst form of government except for all others that have been tried.
                                                                                                                     </p>

This is an important truth which the Albanese government seems to have forgotten with its disturbing habit of rushing through extremely poor legislation with the absolute minimum possible scrutiny. One Nation calls on the Albanese Labor government, the opposition and the crossbench to recommit to the fundamental principles of Australian democracy and stop this 'my way or the highway' cowboy approach to lawmaking. There is no better way to signal this commitment to the principles of democracy than by supporting One Nation's amendment and allowing Australian citizens to initiate a referendum.

Will you be supporting the no vote with the—allowing them to put out literature on the same basis that you are going to put out for the yes vote?

The government won the election, and we are carrying through on that promise to the Australian people. In the process, we are seeking advice on the nature of the question that should be put to the Australian people to determine that issue and a range of other issues around that. But once this legislation passes, and the subsequent legislation to deal with that question, then, of course, we are leaving it to the Australian people, either the people who want to vote yes or people who want to vote to no, to run that case, or present the arguments to the Australian people. At some time later in the year—the Prime Minister has said in the second half of the year—there will in fact be a referendum. People will be able to make a choice—yes or no—for Indigenous recognition. I, for one, will be voting yes.

Rest assured; we are not into hypocrisy. I think you're taking selective references from my comments. You might recall I referenced Twitter and I revealed that Twitter was the least likely form of communication that would change your vote. One of the reasons that political organisations do spend money on social media is to make contact with the people that they know are supporting them. So you spend a lot of money in an election actually geeing up your own supporters and reassuring your own supporters. I don't purport to be an expert on social media. I am sure there are other people who can speak more authoritatively on this topic than I can, but the reason you spend money on social media in that period of the election, as I understand it, is that you reinforce your message to those people who are already are considering voting for you.

Finally—then I am very happy to move on—if social media is such a legitimate advertising channel that the Labor Party in one week would spend $1.3 million on Facebook, why don't we just add it to the blackout period? We have listed all the other mediums where people consume content. Social media is a big part of that now.

You can see what's happening to some of the social media organisations around the world and you might conclude that there is a bit of a decline there.

So what we are trying to do is marry the two sets of provisions so that that can occur. It has been more than 22 years since we have had a referendum. The Electoral Act has been updated. For instance, Senator Paterson was talking about foreign interference. We didn't have that as an issue when we had the republic referendum. It's been raised as an issue since. There has been legislation. We have legislated it in respect of a general election. We are now legislating to make sure that the same provisions apply to a referendum.
                                                                                                                                 </p>

I am not saying that we should reject that out of hand. But we have a process that deals particularly with general elections. There is a whole range of issues, including many raised in the amendments that the Greens are proposing, like ceilings on disclosure and real-time disclosure. All of these issues will be subject to a JSCEM inquiry. Let's not pre-empt that JSCEM inquiry. There will be significant issues if you extend the ban. I think the appropriate course of action is to let that JSCEM process happen. Let's have a look at what comes out of that and make some evaluations after that. I welcome your participation in that discussion.

Having heard the answers you have given the chamber today, Minister, I am interested to know: if this referendum were on a different issue, if it weren't about an Indigenous Voice to Parliament, if it were about something far more basic, would you change the mechanism and the machinery by which Australians go to the polls? Would you consider 'yes' campaign and 'no' campaign organisations, as there have been in previous referenda, or would you persist with this mechanism and this machinery the way you have established and described it today?

In fact, the machinery bill has been updated by the government specifically for this question rather than the fair and free referendum that Australians would normally expect no matter what the question is.

Your previous question was based around what we would do if a different topic were the subject of the referendum. I answered as honestly as I could that I am not sure, and I don't know what we might do in some future referendum.

We took a deliberate policy decision not to do what you have been seeking. I have explained to you time and time again that we have made that decision. What we would do in respect of some future referendum, given how hard it's been to get this particular bill through the parliament, I don't know. We would have to look at that and see what we might do. We've made a policy decision that civil society can run these campaigns—they run them free of any political interference—and I'm hopeful that at the end of that process the Australian people vote for an Indigenous voice in the parliament.

It's our wish to try and increase the number of people participating in this referendum. We've made some changes that make it easier for people to get on the electoral roll, and I referred to a couple of those changes today. One of them is the use of the Medicare card to get yourself on the roll, and the other one is the use of a naturalisation certificate. I've asked the

As time goes by and we get closer to the referendum, I think we'll see the number of people on the roll increase. That's certainly my wish. That's certainly what happened, for instance, in the plebiscite that dealt with the issue of same-sex marriage. I'm hopeful that the same processes will apply.

I think that, even now, there would be members of the coalition who would admit that that was the wrong course of action. We defeated that legislation, so you're not required in this country to produce photographic evidence to vote. There's a certain degree of trust in that process. The level of people who vote more than once is absolutely minuscule. I could probably get the exact figures, but I have a feeling that something like 16 people were discovered to have voted more than once at the election before last. So there's only a tiny group of people that ever vote more than once. You've got to have a little bit of faith in the Australian people that they'll participate genuinely in this debate, they'll have the opportunity to express their point of view and that, at the end of the day, they'll make the right decision, which, in my view, is a 'yes' vote for Indigenous recognition.

One of the reasons for allowing the Medicare card to be identification for the purposes of the electoral roll is that I want the people that you're talking about who might turn up on election day to be enrolled today, tomorrow, next week, next month—but well before election day. I'd certainly encourage all of those people to get on the roll. We're making it easier for them to get on the roll. I'd be hopeful that we wouldn't have anybody in the situation that you're talking about on election day, and that they would have been enrolled well and truly before that.

As I said in my second reading speech, this bill is an important and timely opportunity to improve enfranchisement, particularly for First Nations communities and particularly on this topic, and we must not waste the opportunity. The government have consistently said that they want the referendum to be as close as possible to a normal election, but in the last election many people missed out on voting. That's something that we need to fix rather than replicate.

We support automatic enrolment and we support the recent changes to allow people to use their Medicare card or their citizenship certificate. They're all good amendments that will help boost enrolment, but they are not enough. I have talked to the government about this consistently and put the position, which we've heard over and over from stakeholders, that on-the-day enrolment and provisional voting will have a significant impact on the number of people able to cast a vote on referendum day. It is, if you like, an insurance policy in case those other provisions don't work. I hope they work, and you seem confident that they will, but if they don't, we need an insurance policy.

It is crucial that as many people as possible have their say. We don't require them to all think the same thing. We just want to know what it is that they think. Our amendment would allow voters, including, but not only, First Nation's voters, to attend the polling place, apply for immediate enrolment and cast their votes. That vote would be done by declaration to manage any risk of fraud. That means it would only be added to the formal count after the usual checks are made. The

It is in fact a right. Moreover, this proposal has the support of the Electoral Commission. Not just that, it has been operating in other states and territories for years. There is no evidence of voter fraud or admin delays, and there is no undermining of election results. There is only evidence that more people get to vote.

I thought this was about maximising people's chance to have a say. Well, please pass this amendment! Allow people who wish to have their voice heard to enrol to vote on the day. I have just run you through the checks and balances which will exist, and there is no risk or downside to this! There is only an upside for democracy and for our nation to have its voice heard, ironically, on whether it should have a Voice to parliament. What dark irony it is that you wouldn't allow as many people as possible to have a voice on whether they would like to have a Voice!

Frankly, it's unconscionable to refuse a change that would only increase the number of votes cast in a referendum. Again, we strongly urge the government and the opposition to support this amendment. This is an issue which, yes, we will agitate through the JSCEM reforms when considering reforms to our electoral laws. But I'm concerned that we won't be able to do that in time for the referendum, and I don't want people to miss out on voting on this important question. We have the chance to actually fix this now. We know it works in other jurisdictions and we know that the AEC is happy with it; I don't understand why you don't just support this! Let people vote! They want to have a say. Please support this amendment.

I have great respect for your position, Senator Waters, but the opposition has the very strong view that changes to the enrolment procedures should be considered by the bipartisan Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters rather than done on the fly in the chamber. The voting franchise is the bedrock of the Australian electoral system, and changes to it should be considered in a thoughtful and deliberate manner under existing and established processes, including that joint standing committee. So we will be opposing the amendment.

But I will be moving the opposition's amendment on sheet 1804. It which creates official 'yes' and 'no' campaigns and ensures that those campaigns have equal funding. I think that the reasons for this amendment have become very clear throughout this committee process. I have stated in many speeches, as have my colleagues on this side of the chamber, that the creation of official 'yes' and 'no' campaigns will dramatically improve the integrity of the referendum and will increase trust in the integrity of the process. Having official 'yes' and 'no' campaigns will make things much simpler for the regulatory environment and for the proper conduct of the referendum. It will make life so much easier for the

We have restored that money, and the AEC is already having significant success in increasing enrolments generally and Indigenous enrolments in particular. I am confident that, between now and the vote, we will have significant extra people on the roll.

Now, I don't think that, outside of a dictatorship, there is any other democracy in the world that has that level of enrolment. That's not reflected in Indigenous enrolment.

That was a policy we took to the last election. We have been implementing that and, as I say, the changes I recently made will not only helped total enrolment but will particularly help Indigenous enrolment.

I accept that. I don't think it should be a choice between doing that and also having an on-the-day enrolment protection mechanism to scoop up anyone who hasn't availed themselves of your administrative opportunities. It doesn't need to be a choice between the two. You can actually do both and genuinely maximise First Nations enrolment. So I don't accept your premise that, because you're doing it now, you can't also have a safety net, if you like, to catch people on the day. I just think your logic there is a little lacking.

You have mentioned that this will be considered by JSCEM, in the course of the electoral reforms. I'll just remind the chamber that, in fact, this bill was already considered by JSCEM, and the report recommends that this very change be adopted. The

Let's do it.' So I do really feel like you're punting the ball down the road a little, when JSCEM has already considered this matter and has already considered in a multipartisan way that this is an amendment that would ensure more people can vote and, in particular, more First Nations people can get on the roll. This is one last opportunity for the government to explain why they don't want to do this extra thing, which seems to have no detractors and no downsides, to help First Nations people vote.

This amendment would take the politics out of preparing essential information about the two cases and put it into the hands of the Australian Human Rights Commission, an entity we all respect, which can ensure that the information provided is correct, factual and provided in clearly accessible terms, ensuring human rights are respected in the process. I urge you all to support this important amendment, as it would vastly improve the process in the upcoming referendum.

As I said in my speech on the second reading, the Greens support the public having access to clear, objective, accurate and respectful information outlining the 'yes' and 'no' cases. For many Australians the implications of a referendum are not clear, and they need to have the confidence that the official material produced in this place will help inform their decision. We have already seen the dangers of misinformation and missing information in the current debate.

And I hope that we can have that conversation as well as many others in the course of the JSCEM reforms that are coming down the line. But, in the absence of those laws which actually would have delivered a good and impartial result, we think this is a good suggestion. We will also be supporting Senator Pocock's amendment, which makes a slightly different proposal but with the same intent, to ensure that there's a basis of truth and independence in the preparation of these materials.

It works very effectively in taking the heat out of polling booths. In my opinion it's a much nicer experience for voters. Given the sensitivity of this referendum and some of the rhetoric we are already hearing, I believe it is a sensible amendment to ensure that people are safe when they're casting their vote.

To me it's frankly ridiculous in 2023 that, six months after an election, we find out who funded it. We have plenty of technology to be able to do that in a much more timely manner. I'm proposing seven days to disclose, seven days to make that public. I understand the government's reason—that they're waiting for JSCEM—but this is something that we know Australians want and something we have the technology to do, and it's disappointing not to have support for a sensible amendment like that.

We have a similar amendment to achieve the same outcome, although I do note that we would actually like the disclosure threshold to be lowered down to $1,000. I note that this amendment would simply maintain the disclosure threshold where it is. But we are in support of real-time disclosure, and, for the reasons I mentioned earlier, we support an independent review of the pamphlet text. We are happy enough with this formulation of folk to do that, as we were with the previous amendment.

It is nothing radical, nothing new and completely doable. It is a small measure with a big impact that would allow so many people who otherwise could not vote to vote because they can't physically attend a voting booth to cast their votes. If referendums are really the people's vote then we should all support these amendments. I'll also add that I won't be moving amendments on sheets 1854 or 1818.

This will give the people of Australia an opportunity to sign a petition and present it to the parliament if they have concerns with anything that's in the referendum, whether they wish to have something inserted or withdrawn from the referendum. It's basically the people's democracy. I must assure the parliament that it cannot be passed without both houses agreeing to it. It's basically giving the people a voice. This has actually worked in other countries around the world who have this in place, and it's worked very well for them. I think it's about time that we allow the people to have more of a voice in this country.
