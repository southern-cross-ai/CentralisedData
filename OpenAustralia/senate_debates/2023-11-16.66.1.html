        I rise to give a speech, as many of my colleagues have done this week, as part of the

        in Parliament Week Raise Our Voice campaign. I've been fortunate enough to help amplify the voice of a young man called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Patrick Jones
        </a>
        . This is Patrick's speech:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hello to all listening.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Patrick Jones, and I'm a fourteen-year-old from the electorate of Richmond.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Something that I have become painfully aware of in the last year is the undeniable influence of misogyny in our society—it manifests itself as sexist humour and attitudes; harassment at work or on the street; and as crimes of violence against women.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Only when my eyes were opened to the realities of how women are treated in "developed" countries did I become at all aware of the magnitude of these issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This being said, I call on the government to take immediate and significant action to combat the epidemic of misogyny and violence that is killing our society and poisoning our youth, the latter being under the constant influence of people like Andrew Tate, now under investigation for rape and sex trafficking.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When 23 per cent of men believe it's ok to use misogynistic language online, it's time for change. When 90 per cent of rape cases go unreported for fear of victim-blaming, it's time for change.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And when a woman is killed by her partner every 10 days, it's time for change. All of these are true—so why aren't we changing?
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done, Patrick. It is so heartening to see this recognition of a serious issue.

         Today, I'll address a critical issue that can shape our future positively, harnessing solar energy in Australia for a more sustainable nation. Imagine Australia leading in clean energy, reducing our carbon footprint for a healthier planet. This change benefits everyone, not just my generation. It's about safeguarding our environment and addressing societal needs. Solar energy isn't an option; it's an essential. By investing in solar power, we can reduce reliance on fossil fuels, cut emissions, and create renewable energy jobs. This change combats climate change, better air quality, and boosts the economy. Our parliament holds the key to this transformation. Through supportive policies, and funding, we can propel Australia toward a brighter, solar-powered future. Picture homes with solar panels, cities fueled by renewables, and inspiring global examples. In summary, embracing solar energy isn't a step, but a leap toward a sustainable future. I urge our parliament to prioritize solar initiatives. Together, we can create an enduring impact that benefits all Australians, and the generations to come. Australia can shine with the sun's boundless energy. This will forge an eco-friendly path and will create a lasting impact. Thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thank you, My. Our government does know how important this is. We're working very hard to bring more renewables online and to take real climate action, and we look forward to seeing what you will do in your future.
