        (b) confirms that Australia's Federal Parliament is a place that celebrates and encourages a diversity of opinions, as long as those views are expressed respectfully;

       <p>
        (c) condemns any senator who seeks to use Australia's Parliament to provide a platform to any person who preaches hate and incites abuse and harassment of women, Jews, and members of the LBGTIQ and multicultural communities; and

           The government does not support this motion. Freedom of speech includes the freedom to say things which others may find offensive. It is by protecting the speech of those with whom we disagree, even those with whom our disagreement is fundamental, that we secure and protect Australia's democratic values. The government recognises that free speech is not absolute but carries with it the responsibility to promote civil discourse as well as to reject hate speech or speech that incites violence and bullying of others.

              Mr Yiannopoulos is Jewish and does not attack those of his own faith because of their faith. Mr Yiannopoulos is gay and does not attack those of a similar sexual preference because of that sexual preference. Mr Yiannopoulos does not attack women because they are women. Senator

                 as a venue, advice provided to the opposition indicates that there are believed to be no examples where that power has been used to exclude entry to someone who has been invited by a senator or member, except where someone has been excluded on law enforcement or security advice. The opposition does not endorse the views of

                    Let's be clear about who Mr Yiannopoulos is. This is a man who is a racist and a bigot. He's a man who regularly solicits ideas from Neo-Nazis. He's a man who thinks that consensual relationships can exist between 13-year-old children and adults. He thrives on harassing and inflicting pain on people. He was banned from Twitter for inciting hundreds of thousands of people to bombard actor

                    with racist and demeaning tweets. He's been involved in organising public attacks against feminist writer and activist Lindy West. No-one is suggesting that Mr Yiannopoulos shouldn't have a platform with Senator Leyonhjelm should he wishâ€”perhaps in some dark corner of Sydney. He's able to do that, but we're talking about granting the privilege here in the Australian parliament to a bigot, to a bully, to somebody who has incited abuse against so many people across the country. Parliament should be a place where we respect each other's views rather than incite hatred.

                       , we've had bullies and bigots elected to this parliament. I agree with a lot of what you've said about this man. I don't want to make him a martyr. I go back to the case of

                       , when he was banned from coming to Australia and was turned into a bit of a martyr by all of the people who were holocaust deniers. It was in my days as a journalist, so I interviewed him on television, by satellite, from overseas, argued with him and tried to tear him apart. That's what should be done with this man here. He should not be made into a martyr.
