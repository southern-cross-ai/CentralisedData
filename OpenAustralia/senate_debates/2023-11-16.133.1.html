        I seek leave to make a very short statement, less than 30 seconds.

        I would just indicate—I anticipated getting a question from the opposition but did not, so I was not able to put this on the public record—that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Acting Prime Minister
        </a>
        in the other house has indicated that the government and opposition have met in relation to amendments to the bill that is currently before the chamber. I would indicate that there are six amendments and that the government have indicated that we agree in principle and are working with the opposition to establish the precise amendments that will be put here. The basis on which this is being done is that this bill must be resolved immediately, and the intention is to request that the Senate pass the bill this afternoon. I thought it would be useful to put that on the record in the chamber at question time. I thank the Senate.

         I acknowledge the statement by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leader_of_the_Government_in_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Leader of the Government in the Senate
         </a>
         . As the opposition have made clear all day, it is our desire to see this bill passed and for it to pass today. We also made clear that it was our expectation that amendments would have to be considered. I note that the government blocked consideration of any amendments in the House of Representatives. Thankfully, the Senate is at least a place where such amendments can be put. The opposition, despite having only seen this bill at seven this morning, when we were first briefed, have worked quickly. It is remarkable that the government, thankfully, is willing to engage in this discussion and to support the opposition's amendments, which we welcome, and we will work constructively to see the bill's passage, as we committed to.
