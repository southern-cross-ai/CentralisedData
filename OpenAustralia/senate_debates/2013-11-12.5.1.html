         Mr President
        </a>
        , I can inform the Senate that following the election held on 7 September 2013 in which the Liberal-National Party coalition was given the privilege of government by the people of Australia,

        MP, to form a government. Ministers and parliamentary secretaries were duly appointed on 18 September 2013. For the information of senators, I will table a list of the full ministry. The document lists all ministers and parliamentary secretaries and the offices they hold; it shows those ministers who comprise cabinet; it provides details of representational arrangements in each chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can inform the Senate that the Prime Minister has deemed it appropriate to appoint me as

        as the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate and Senator the Hon. Mitchell Fifield as the Manager of Government Business in the Senate. I congratulate in particular all of those of my colleagues who have received promotions, and I refer to Senators Cormann, Cash and Sinodinos. I also want to acknowledge the fine contribution of Senator Ian Macdonald whilst he served on the frontbench, and I am sure that he will continue to make representations with the normal vim and vigour that he provides in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can also inform the Senate that Senator Kroger will continue as the Chief Government Whip in the Senate and that Senators Bushby and Back will continue as deputy government whips in the Senate. In anticipation of announcements by other senators and party leaders in relation to positions, can I simply offer my congratulations to all those involved, especially Senators Xenophon and Madigan, who I am sure had very hectic party room meetings to determine their positions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr President, I observe that you are a true reflection of the Australian political landscape, because I have just discovered that your right profile is a lot more attractive than your left. But I can assure you that we, as a coalition government, will seek to work with you and with all senators in ensuring that we devote ourselves to the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth. I thank the Senate. I seek leave to have the ministry list included in the

        Leave granted.
