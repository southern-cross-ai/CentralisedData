        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. As the omicron variant emerges in Australia, a webinar promoted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation

        was recently hosted by the so-called COVID Medical Network, which is under investigation by the TGA for promoting hydroxychloroquine. Why did four government members—Liberal MP George Christensen and Senators Canavan, Rennick and Antic—appear on this anti-vaccination, anti-mandate webinar?

         If there is something that the emergence of the omicron variant should reinforce to all Australians and all those around the world, it is the importance of vaccination. It is the importance of encouraging all Australians to be vaccinated. Whilst from the outset our government has always said that vaccination should be voluntary and that we would not enforce mandates, except for working with the states and territories in relation to those areas of highly vulnerable individuals such as in aged care, disability care, and health practice, we absolutely encourage every Australian to get vaccinated.
        </p>
        <p>
         I urge every member across this parliament to engage in such encouragement as well. More than 19 million individual Australians have had at least one dose of the vaccine to date. That is an incredible turnout by Australians, who now count among some of the most highly vaccinated populations in the world.

           Yes, on direct relevance. I draw the minister back to the question. His answer here is not relevant to the question. It was very specific. Why did four members of the government appear on this webinar?

            You've brought the minister back to part of the question. There was an additional statement at the beginning of the question about the omicron variant. I'm listening carefully to the minister. You've had the chance to bring him back to the question. Minister, you have the call.

             As I said before, I encourage and the government encourages every member of the government, of the crossbench—of the parliament—to encourage vaccination and to encourage its take-up. I urge all members to do so, and it is the urging and the health advice from across the country that has helped to achieve 92.4 per cent of Australians over the age of 16 having had at least that first dose. That's 92.4 per cent of Australians who have heeded that message and who are out there, having been vaccinated, getting vaccinated, and building those numbers day in, day out. We will continue to work to lift those numbers and to grow those numbers as high as possible.

                I outright reject the quote that was put to me. Mr Morrison outright rejects it, and the government outright rejects it. We are very clear that vaccines do offer the best possible way for individuals to protect themselves, their loved ones and the communities in which they live and work. That's a message we've delivered consistently to Australians, and it has driven and achieved one of the highest vaccination rates in the world: a vaccination rate that is above the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
                 OECD
                </a>
                average and above those of many nations that suffered from COVID-19 far more than Australia has to date. It's our approach that has saved more than 30,000 lives. It's an approach that has delivered this high rate of vaccination. It's an approach that sees us as one of the most protected countries in the world now, having had such high rates of vaccination and being one of the first to have a nationwide booster program.

                     The point of order is direct relevance. This question goes to Mr Morrison's actions, and there was only a single question, which is whether he would counsel those members and senators who were active in spreading disinformation—disinformation that's contrary to government policy. That's the question. Where's the leadership?

                      Senator Wong, I cannot direct the minister how to answer a question. I believe the minister was being directly relevant to the question. Minister, you have the call.

                       As I said, we urge all members of the government and all members of the parliament to encourage other Australians to get vaccinated. Indeed, we urge all Australians to encourage one another to get vaccinated. Having achieved such incredibly high rates of vaccination across the country, we are working with states and territories and health officials to particularly target communities with lower vaccination rates, noting the critical importance of having those high rates spread right across the nation.
