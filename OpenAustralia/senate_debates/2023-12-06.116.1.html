        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Today in Canberra, National Cabinet met and made important progress on key reforms. Can the Minister outline to the Senate how the Albanese government is working with states and territories to deliver for all Australians? In particular, what's being done to strengthen our health system?

         I thank Senator O'Neill for the question. I'm very pleased to reflect the announcement of National Cabinet here today, an example of the federation working for Australia and, most centrally, of the government working with other governments to ensure a better health system for all Australians. National Cabinet made important progress on key reforms to strengthen Australia's health system, to secure the future of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and on keeping Australians safe. Premiers, first ministers and the Prime Minister are working together in the common interests of all Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         National Cabinet had agreed that the top priority for 2023 was health. I'm pleased to again communicate the National Cabinet decision to a further $1.2 billion package to strengthen Medicare. That's a further $1.2 billion of strengthening Medicare measures which are all about taking the pressure off our hospitals.

         , the Albanese government, is boosting funding for Medicare urgent care clinics and supporting older Australians through avoided hospital admission and early discharge from hospital. We are focused on delivering reforms that ensure the entire health system is more integrated, more equitable, more efficient and more sustainable. Of course, these measures are on top of the measures that the Albanese government is already doing, which include cheaper medicines, urgent care clinics and investment in bulk-billing, and are in stark contrast to the decade, the shameful legacy, of cuts and mismanagement by the coalition.

             NDIS
            </a>
            has delivered life-changing supports to thousands of Australians. It is pleasing to see that all Australian governments are committed to providing equity and fairness for Australians living with disability. National Cabinet acknowledged the need for reforms to secure the future of the NDIS, ensuring it can continue to provide life-changing support not just today but to future generations of Australians with disability. Governments will work together to implement legislative and other changes to the NDIS to improve the experience of participants, to restore the original intent of the scheme and to support people with permanent and significant disability with a broader ecosystem of supports. The National Cabinet agreed to jointly design additional foundational supports, working together to ensure a strong and sustainable NDIS for years to come.

               As National Cabinet reflected, we are marking the anniversary of the police shooting at Wieambilla, and this week the funeral was held for Brevet Sergeant Jason Doig, killed in my own state's south-east. Today, National Cabinet agreed to implement a national firearms register. This is a reform that has been outstanding for too many years. It is one of the reforms outstanding from the

                Port Arthur

               massacre response in 1996, which I acknowledge was one of the great examples of bipartisan support for new regulation in this country in order to keep Australians safe.
              </p>
              <p>
               The agreement struck today represents the most significant improvement in our firearms management system in almost 30 years and it will keep Australia's first responders and communities safer. The register will address significant gaps and inconsistencies, and we have agreed to work together to ensure it is fully operational within four years.
