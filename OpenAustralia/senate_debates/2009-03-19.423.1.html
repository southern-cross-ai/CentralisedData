         I wish to make a very brief contribution, at this stage, on behalf of the opposition. We commend the bill to the Senate and, in so doing, we want to say—especially to the government—that the compromises that have been reached over the past few days are sensible and that they reflect well on the operations of the Senate.
        </p>

         remind the government that it cannot claim a mandate on its policy when it itself cherry-picks through the policies that it took to the election and then adopts some and turns its back on or substantially amends others. It therefore loses the moral argument that it otherwise may have had to insist on the totality of its mandate. We, as an opposition and as a coalition, accepted the verdict of the Australian people on 24 November 2007, and I think anybody who has followed this debate would have seen the coalition adopting a very constructive and positive approach to ensuring that we have now come to a conclusion which I think reflects well on the Senate and is a very balanced bill. It is one that I commend to the Senate on its third reading, but in particular to the government. I would encourage the government—and, if I pick up the vibes correctly, we need to especially encourage the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister Gillard—to take a deep breath, look at exactly what has been passed by the Senate and acknowledge it as an appropriate compromise and a good way for us to be able to move forward. I commend the bill.

          I congratulate the government and the opposition, including Senator Abetz for his contribution. I think it is a very important piece of legislation and also that we have seen political cooperation in the Senate in coming to this conclusion. I think there will be 22 million Australians who will be relieved by this outcome. I congratulate the government and the Deputy Prime Minister for the work that has been put into the legislation and for ensuring that the program they took to the election in 2007 has now come to fruition. I congratulate the opposition for the contribution that has been made and the amendments that they have succeeded in having passed. In particular, I congratulate them for giving the accord to the legislation at half past two in the morning.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to congratulate my fellow crossbenchers for their contributions as well—not least, of course, Senator Siewert, who has put an enormous amount of work into this legislation. We Greens would have liked to have seen greater protection in the workplace and a greater ability for unions, not least to be able to assist workers to get better outcomes, but you cannot have all that you want. We are pleased as well to have contributed suggestions and amendments to this legislation which have been adopted here in the Senate tonight. I think it is an extremely good outcome from the Senate for the people of Australia. Workers, employers and people in general can be pleased with the work that the Senate has done and the conclusion that has been reached at 2.30 on this Friday morning.

           It is 2.30 am, and it is the end of a long process—not just of a long day but of the whole Senate process of the inquiry. At the end of the day, the Senate has done its job and various amendments have been made. It will now go to the lower house and we will see what transpires later on today. Each party represented in the Senate has done their job. We have worked well together tonight to make sure that the Fair Work Bill will pass the Senate. Quite clearly, with the Fair Work Bill about to pass this chamber, that will be the official end of
