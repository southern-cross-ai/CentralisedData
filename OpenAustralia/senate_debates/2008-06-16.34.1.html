        My question is to do with the proposed importation of so-called Savannah cats—domestic cats interbred with wild African cats. Is the minister aware of the comments by Professor Tony Peacock of the invasive animals cooperative research centre that these cats would be able to jump up to two metres and the loophole in the Australian law that allowing them into the country would:

          Has the minister made a definitive decision to prohibit the import of such crossbred cats and dogs and to close the loophole which has led to the placing in quarantine of animals on their way to Australia by order from a

           I thank Senator Brown for the question. As he would know but perhaps other senators might not, the Savannah cat is a relatively new hybrid—that seems to be a theme today—bred by crossing a serval with the domestic cat. There are none known at this stage to have been imported into Australia, although I understand several cat breeders are promoting the hybrid.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government does recognise that it is essential that Australia’s environment be protected from new, potentially invasive predators. I am advised that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts has initiated a process for the possible amendment of the live import list to prohibit Savannah cats. Senator Brown would be aware that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
           </a>
           provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for protecting Australia’s biodiversity, and that extends to controlling the importation of live animals into Australia in order to protect the environment. As I have said, Savannah cats are a new hybrid species that are currently treated as domestic cats under the live import controls. This means that under present law they may potentially be imported subject only to quarantine control. I think the good senator was referring to this issue in his question.
          </p>
          <p>
           The minister is aware of public concern that these animals may pose a threat to the Australian environment, although I have to confess I had not heard the term ‘nuclear’ in relation to it until that question was asked. I am advised the minister is aware of public concern. I can indicate that before any change can be made to the statutory import lists, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
            EPBC
           </a>
           Act requires that a rigorous assessment process be undertaken, including the preparation of an assessment report and consultation with the public and with relevant stakeholders. The minister for the environment has initiated the required assessment process in relation to Savannah cats and their potential impact on the Australian environment. The government is also conscious of the concern expressed today by those opposed to the import of these cats, of whom Senator Brown is one. We are also, as a government, conscious of the concerns of potential importers. I am advised that the minister will therefore ensure that the assessment process is undertaken as quickly as is possible whilst maintaining proper legal processes.

            , I ask a supplementary question. Why is it that the government can make a decision without bureaucratic reference on the manufacture of hybrid cars, but the minister cannot make a decision without a bureaucratic process to save Australia from the import of dangerous hybrid cats?

             I was not aware that Senator Abetz and Senator Brown had a coalition going on the hybrid car issue. Senator Abetz, if I were you, I would be very worried given your comments in this place that you are actually on the same page as Senator Brown. But that is a matter for you.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I have indicated in the answer, my advice is that, before any change can be made to such lists, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
              EPBC
             </a>
             Act does require that rigorous assessment be undertaken, including the preparation of an assessment report and consultation with the public and stakeholders. I know Senator Brown and other members of the Greens have always taken quite a strict or robust view in relation to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC_Act" rel="nofollow">
              EPBC Act
             </a>
             . I would not assume that Senator Brown is suggesting in any way that the government should not be observing the provisions of that act in the consideration of this Savannah cat issue. I am advised that Minister Garrett has initiated the required assessment process—as I said, an assessment process that is required under the provisions, as I am advised, of the EPBC Act. That required assessment process has been commenced.
