         by leave—The government cannot support the proposed motion in its current form. We have previously placed on the record our objection to dealing with complex international issues by means of formal motions. Along with other governments, Australia recognises China’s sovereignty over Tibet. The Australian government has serious concerns about the human rights situation in Tibet and other areas of China inhabited by Tibetan communities. The Australian government is particularly concerned by reports of a lockdown of those areas and travel restrictions imposed on Tibetan communities around the 50th anniversary of the uprising in Tibet.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia has consistently conveyed its concern over a number of years about the human rights situation to the Chinese government. The Prime Minister raised human rights, including regarding Tibet, in his meeting with Chinese leaders in Beijing in April and August 2008.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Smith
         </a>
         raised human rights concerns regarding Tibetans with Chinese Foreign Minister Yang in February and July 2008 and with visiting Chinese senior leaders in November 2008. Officials raised our concerns about human rights issues in China, including Tibet, in hearings of the Human Rights Council Universal Periodic Review, which took place in Geneva on 9 February. Most recently Mr Smith expressed our concerns about Tibet in his meeting with the Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister, who led the Chinese delegation to the 12th bilateral human rights dialogue held in Canberra in February. Officials reinforced the foreign minister’s message in the dialogue itself.
        </p>
        <p>
         We continue to raise our concerns through high-level meetings at appropriate international forums and through diplomatic channels in Canberra and Beijing. The Australian government considers that a viable solution to the Tibetan issue is through peaceful negotiation between the Chinese authorities and representatives of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
          Dalai Lama
         </a>
         . We were disappointed that the most recent round of talks broke down last year but see no other option than dialogue to reaching a solution. We urge both sides to resume substantive talks in good faith as soon as possible with the aim of achieving a durable and comprehensive agreement which covers questions of autonomy, religion and cultural freedom.

         <p>
          by leave—The motion simply acknowledges the recent unilateral efforts by concerned governments, including Australia, and the failure to secure meaningful negotiations on Tibet’s future. We have just heard a list of references that the Australian government has made to the Chinese bosses in Beijing and not one word of result—nothing. It has been an absolute failure to get any progress whatever for the seven million beleaguered Tibetans who are under the jackboot of the Chinese-Beijing authoritarian regime. And it is not good enough.
         </p>
         <p>
          This government is now following the failure to take action by the Howard government and several governments before that. It is an appalling failure not to use the diplomatic muscle that Australia no doubt has to at least get these talks back on the rails.

          has spoken about hell on earth being experienced in Tibet, and the world is turning its back on it. That includes this government. I am ashamed, as a legislator in this place, that we have another government that simply does not have the ticker to stand up against this appalling abuse of human religious civil rights in Tibet. We should get better out of the Rudd government than that.
