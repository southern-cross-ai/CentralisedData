          , and thank you, Senator Chandler, for the question. Australia's COVID-19 rollout continues to expand. To date, more than 17.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Australia. We had a record Sunday, with more than 139,000 vaccines administered, and 335,000 vaccines administered over the weekend. Yesterday was a record Monday, with more than—

           Order, Senator Colbeck. Stop the clock. The interjections started two seconds into his answer. While there is a place for interaction across the chamber, some courtesy, so that those appearing remotely can hear, would be appreciated. I'm having trouble hearing the minister, and it's very hard to tell who is

            . Yesterday was a record Monday, with more than 289,000 doses administered. That is good news for Australians and good news for the country. Just about the only ones barracking against this rollout are on the other side of the chamber. In the last seven days, more than 1.8 million doses have been administered into the arms of Australians—6.3 million doses in the last 30 days.

              The vaccine rollout is ramping up, as we always said it would. In our home state of Tasmania, Senator Chandler, 414,000 doses have been given to those who have stepped forward to protect themselves, protect friends, protect their families and protect their country. Each vaccine helps protect each one of us, but every vaccine helps protect us all. We now have national vaccination rates of more than 54 per cent for first doses among the eligible population and over 30 per cent for second doses. Perhaps most significantly, amongst our most vulnerable Australians—which is why we are seeing a difference in

              this year compared to Victoria last year—over 70 per cent of over-50s have had their first dose and over 85 per cent of over-70s have had their first dose.

                    The sooner Australians turn up at one of the more than 8,100 sites across the country, the sooner we will be able to return to a normal life, with fewer restrictions and fewer lockdowns. As the Prime Minister has said, the national plan that we have developed and agreed with the states is our pathway to living with the virus. That is our goal—to live with the virus, not to live in fear of it. It's a plan based on the best-possible scientific evidence, undermined only by those opposite. Once we achieve 70 to 80 per cent vaccination, we'll see less transmission of COVID-19, fewer people with severe illness, fewer people in hospital and fewer deaths. We should all get on with it.

                     woke up yesterday to harsher restrictions and a Western Sydney curfew as a result of a COVID-19 outbreak that started in Bondi. Why are South Western and Western Sydney residents, who are trying to do the right thing by their communities, being forced to take multiple busses and trains in the middle of a lockdown to get to a vaccination hub and being forced to wait up to five hours outside at those vaccination hubs to get vaccinated?

It will protect you, it will protect your community and, once we start reaching the thresholds that have been set down by the national plan, it is the way to start returning to a more normal life.

                          I thank Senator Keneally for her question. Clearly there is strong demand for vaccine across the country, and that is a good thing. I say to all Australians: it's clear that there's only one group of people in this country who are campaigning against the vaccine rollout and who are undermining confidence in the vaccine rollout, and it's that lot over there. We continue to increase the supply, and, as I've already indicated today, we continue to increase the number of outlets that are available for people to get a vaccine. As more vaccine becomes available, we will continue to increase the volume. It's only the Labor Party who are out there trying to undermine confidence in the vaccine rollout. It's only the Labor Party who are out there trying to undermine confidence in vaccines.

                              to assist with the current circumstance. We continue to work on vaccine supply, increasing the availability of vaccine and the number of outlets, as I've already outlined a number of times in the chamber today. While the Labor Party fight us, we fight the virus. While the Labor Party fight us, we will continue to fight the virus and we will continue to work in the interests of Australians to give them access to the vaccine. We appreciate the fact that they are lining up for an appointment. We appreciate that they are turning out to get vaccinated. They know, like we do, that vaccination is a pathway to freedom.

                               My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Senator Colbeck. There are a growing number of children, teenagers and young people sick with COVID. Do you acknowledge that including children in the vaccination targets will save lives? When will your government include kids under 16 in the national vaccination targets, and when will there be enough supply for those young people?

                                I thank Senator Siewert for the question. I reject the assertion that there's any sense on the part of the government that all parts of the Australian population aren't important in the vaccination rollout. The national plan for vaccination, which was agreed by national cabinet, with modelling done by the Doherty institute, was based on a certain population cohort and based on the information available at that point in time to Doherty and to Australia with respect to approved vaccines.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                I think it's also important, at this point, that we consider the impact of the virus on Australians within different cohorts, which reinforces our process. We have received approval for the administration of vaccines to 12- to 15-year-olds and we have commenced the process of rolling the vaccine process out to the most vulnerable of those. We have started that. We have said that when the advice from ATAGI comes to us, when the advice from the health professions that are advising the government and guiding the vaccine rollout comes to us, we will make the vaccine available to the rest of those cohorts. Plans for that are already being developed, and they are important. If you look at the wording of the information from Doherty, they stand by their modelling and the targets that have been established. When you consider there are 1.2 million children in the cohorts you're talking about--

                                               Order, on my right! Points of order have to relate to the standing orders. I'm going to at least ask people to treat the chamber with the courtesy of saying that it's to do with direct relevance. It's not a chance to restate the question. Senator Siewert, you also used a highly charged term in that question. I have ruled previously that where highly politically charged terminology is used ministers are entitled to respond, and that was a particularly loaded piece of terminology. So the minister is allowed to respond. I can't instruct him how to answer a question.

                                                . The government has at all times been concerned to ensure that all Australians are supported and protected through the management of the pandemic, and so in setting the thresholds under the national plan, the Doherty modelling takes into account the two-week time frame for people to get full immunisation and the later time for the vaccination of children.

                                                and Labor can come in here and run all the slurs they like against us, but we will continue to work in the interests of the Australian people to help them to get vaccinated and also to support the opening of the Australian economy.
