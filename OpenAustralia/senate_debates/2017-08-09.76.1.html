         Thank you, Senator Wong. That is a very important question, of course. Reports that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         has acquired the ability to develop a miniaturised nuclear device which may be placed on an intercontinental ballistic missile are deeply unsettling. We need to be clear that responsibility for tension and instability arising out of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
          Korean Peninsula
         </a>
         lies at the feet of the regime in Pyongyang, whose actions contravene international law, pose a serious threat to global peace, stability and the rules based order we seek to protect and advance.
        </p>
        <p>
         North Korea has been in flagrant violation of no fewer than six
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations

         Security Council resolutions going back as far as 2006, which condemn its multiple missile launches and five nuclear testsâ€”most recently its

          ICBM
         </a>
         test on 28 July this year. North Korea has a chequered history of making and breaking promises to wind back its illegal nuclear weapons and missile programs. Since taking power in December 2011,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Jong" rel="nofollow">

         intercontinental ballistic nuclear missile is capable of reaching the United States, then such a weapon is capable of reaching Australia and poses an unacceptable, existential threat to our country. Australia's policy, with respect to confronting this challenge, remains clear and consistent. Presently, North Korea is defiant; however, Pyongyang is deterrable, if the international community is determined and resolute.

         The collective way forward is to call on all countries to fully implement

            Thank you, Senator Wong. Australia has sanctioned 37 people and 31 entities under our autonomous sanctions measures. As well, of course, we are parties to all of the collective sanctions regimes, which are the subject of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
             UN
            </a>
            Security Council resolutions to which I have referred. In fact, on 30 November, Australia was a co-sponsor of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
             UN Security Council
            </a>
            Resolution 2321, which placed additional UN sanctions on
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
             North Korea
            </a>
            . We strongly support Resolution 2371, passed on 5 August, which places further significant restrictions on trade with North Korea, including on its exports of coal, iron, lead, and seafood. But all nations, particularly those with diplomatic or economic relationships with North Korea, must use their leverage.

               Senator Wong, let me expand on my remarks in relation to your first supplementary question. So, as I said, we were a co-sponsor of Resolution 2321 last November. We are one of the nations that supported Resolution 2371, supported by almost all members of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                United Nations
               </a>
               , which was passed four days ago, which is the most comprehensive sanctions package against Pyongyang to date. As I was saying to you a moment ago, all nations, particularly those with diplomatic or economic relationships with
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
                North Korea
               </a>
               , must use their leverage to place pressure on Pyongyang to change North Korea's calculations, and the Australian government calls upon them to do so. All nations, but most critically the P5, must defend the authority of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
                United Nations Security Council
               </a>
               . We are constantly reviewing and extending our autonomous sanctions regime to complement and augment security council sanctions.

                  North Korea

                 's ongoing development of nuclear and ballistic missile programs in the strongest possible terms. North Korea has shown that it has no regard for the welfare of its own population, no regard for the security of, and good relations with, its neighbours, and no regard for international law.
                </p>
                <p>
                 North Korea has claimed nuclear capability. It is repeatedly testing

                 , Japan and, indeed, Australia. Reports today of North Korea's threat to strike Guam further underlines the need for the regime to abandon its illegal ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs. North Korea's actions are, as the Attorney-General said, in blatant breach of

                 Security Council resolutions. Its actions undermine regional security and stability, and the international community cannot tolerate this behaviour. North Korea's long-term interests would be best served by ceasing its nuclear and ballistic missiles programs and engaging positively with the international community. Australia will continue to work with the international community in response to North Korea's actions to seek a resolution in a peaceful manner and to ensure the long-term stability of our region.

                    's actions, and the Attorney-General indicated a number of those actions. We strongly support efforts to forge regional and multilateral solutions to enhance security across the Indo-Pacific and to address what is a reckless and illegal threat from North Korea. We are working with the United States to counter the ballistic missile threat, including in the development of new technologies. Indeed, in 2014, Australia and the United States established a bilateral working group to examine options for potential Australian contributions to integrated air and missile defence in the region.

                   <p>
                    As I have said, we also work closely with our alliance partner the United States and other like-minded countries on diplomatic means to address North Korea's behaviour. Australia also supports international efforts to prevent the proliferation of technology that supports the development of ballistic missiles and other weapon delivery systems. We continue to work with our partnersâ€”Japan, the Republic of Korea and, of course, China and the United Statesâ€”to uphold global peace and stability.

                       In support of international efforts on North Korea, under our own autonomous sanctions regime, Australia will also apply targeted financial sanctions and further travel bans on several additional individuals and seven specific entities. They will target North Korea's extractive industries and its vessels. Our measures do add to the international pressure on North Korea, and they complement the resolutions adopted by the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">

We call on all countries, as the Prime Minister and the foreign minister have done, to redouble their efforts to implement unanimously agreed UN Security Council resolutions and sanctions against North Korea to impress upon it the unsustainability of its current path.
