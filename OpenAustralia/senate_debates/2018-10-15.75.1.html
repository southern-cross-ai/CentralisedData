         Thank you very much, Senator Smith, for being such a longstanding advocate for increased digital connectivity right across regional Australia and particularly for your home state of WA. It's not just about our local communities being able to access emergency services in times of need, or police services. If there are car crashes along our many highways and byways, they need to be able access those crucial emergency services, such as ambulances, on the side of a road. We know that our bushfire season is incredibly concerning; it is coming upon us with the summer. We are making sure that regional communities can access their fire services when they need them, and that our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
          CFA
         </a>
         volunteers can actually get those special texts. We have set up a whole lot of systems, but without digital connectivity it doesn't work.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also want to make sure that our small businesses can access crucial banking services. We know that out in regional WA there are over 35,000 small businesses operating outside of Perth. Each and every one of those needs increased digital connectivity so they can be more productive and efficient, so they can employ more people, and so they can sell more. It is not just about making sure small businesses in WA are more connected; it is also making sure that those of us who live out in the regions can study online. We know that we don't access higher education at the same rate as other populations. Having access to digital connectivity is crucially important if we are to increase our higher education attainment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, there is telehealth. That's an increasing technological advancement that's allowing high-quality healthcare service provision for those of us who live outside in the regions. On the weekend, I was incredibly proud to announce that the 600th tower has actually been opened. It's at

            Thank you, Senator Smith. There are many, and I outlined many of those in my answer earlier. We know that Ballards, a rural supply shop in Narrogin, has used its increased digital connectivity to sell more, to connect more and to bank much more easily, which means, instead of having to take time off and take the takings down to the local bank, they're able to stay in the business, working on the business and growing that business, and that's why it is so important. We know that, in the great south-west of WA, there is forestry and horticulture. It hosts the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_River" rel="nofollow">
             Margaret River
            </a>
            wine region, which is increasingly becoming an international tourist destination. That's why, when tourists leave Perth or leave from overseas and come into our regional communities, we want them to have that increased technology so they can send their WeChat and Instagram photos home to grow that tourist supply. The benefits are many and we're committed to the program.

               I'm incredibly concerned by the shadow minister's commentary recently. We know that Labor doesn't like regional Australia. We know that you hate the two industries that underpin our economy—agriculture and mining. You hate coal, you hate iron ore and you don't like agriculture. The fact is they drive not only our local, regional economies but, more importantly, the national economy.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jones" rel="nofollow">
                Stephen Jones
               </a>
               was talking about our lived experience out in the regions, saying that this is a life and death situation, this is about growing our local economies and this is about employing locals. But do you know what? He stopped short of committing any funding. What a surprise! So, five years ago, you didn't have a program. We've shown you how valuable that program is to our communities. Yet, when the mettle is put on you, you cannot find a dime to support regional Australia.
