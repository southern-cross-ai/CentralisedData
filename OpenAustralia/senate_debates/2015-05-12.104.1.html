        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash, representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Can the minister outline to the Senate the coalition government's commitment to building the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        <p>
         Yes, I can. Senators will recall that in April last year the Prime Minister announced the go-ahead for the second Sydney airport at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Badgerys_Creek" rel="nofollow">
          Badgerys Creek
         </a>
         . It has been talked about, as we know, for more than 50 years. The land was acquired approximately 30 years ago, but it was this government that bit the bullet and finally made the commitment. This is not just a second Sydney airport, as Minister Truss has said; it is an airport for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         . And the government's in excess of $3.6 billion investment in roads around the airport is part of our record $50 billion infrastructure investment for all Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senators will know that the Commonwealth-owned land at Badgerys Creek is a large site of around 1,700 hectares. And, as you would expect, extensive investigation is required to assist in planning for the first stage of the airport. But, unlike those opposite, who sat on their hands for years and did nothing, we are getting on with the job. Earlier this month the second phase of geotechnical works commenced on the site. These vital works are progressing on schedule, and they are doing so following extensive consultation with stakeholders. The $3.6 billion Western Sydney Infrastructure Plan is also well underway, with the Prime Minister breaking ground on the Bringelly Road upgrade earlier this year. Construction works on the Werrington Arterial Road have also commenced, and round 1 of the local roads package is rolling out. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government has also set aside a future corridor for a South West Rail Link extension to the airport, with community consultation underway. Going forward, a detailed plan for Western Sydney airport is expected to be developed by the end of the year, and residents of the area should be able to scrutinise a draft environmental impact statement within months. This is a project that will result in jobs and long-term economic growth for Western Sydney.

              Western Sydney
             </a>
             , under this government, is set to see an economic bonanza—something that your government, in the six years in office, failed to deliver. You sat on your hands. We are delivering, for Western Sydney, 4,000 jobs in the construction phase alone, and 4,000 additional jobs. Senator Cameron, you are always talking about jobs, but you failed to deliver them. This government is delivering for Western Sydney.

               Unfortunately, I can, and because of these impediments those on the other side and the Greens—who I will get to shortly—do not support the job creation in
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                Western Sydney
               </a>
               that we on this side are committed to. For example, the big contribution of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               Greens to transport policy in New South Wales is 'to support the relocation of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith_Airport" rel="nofollow">
                Kingsford Smith Airport
               </a>
               '. But then they fail to tell you where they are actually going to relocate the airport to. I am assuming they will be handing out wings to everybody so they can flap them to try and get everywhere. Then, of course, we have those on the other side who sat on their hands for years and did absolutely nothing, despite having Senator Cameron as a big advocate for jobs in Western Sydney. Senator Cameron, you delivered nothing to the people of Western Sydney. It is those of us on this side who are committed to ensuring that jobs, jobs, jobs are given to those in Western Sydney, and that is what we will do.
