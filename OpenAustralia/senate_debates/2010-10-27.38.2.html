        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, Senator Conroy. Does the minister agree with the following statement:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important that robust business cases are prepared to support the investment of very large sums of public money.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister identify who made that statement?

                     Thank you. Obviously those opposite had a very thin morning at the Senate tactics question time committee when they have to come up with such puerile questions as playing a guessing game. I would have thought in question time they might have had actually a question of some substance about some important issues. Maybe the
                     <i>
                      Australian
                     </i>
                     was not printed this morning, so they had no reference document whatsoever. But perhaps when we get a supplementary question we may have something—

                       , on the point of order, to the extent that the question asked was a guessing game, the minister has been directly answering the question. The opposition, if they wish to continue this facade of a question which does not provide in fact any real substance in relation to policy, if they do not want to ask the executive any policy questions today, then taking a point of order and complaining about a nonanswer where the question is in fact a guessing game, there is no point of order in respect of that, and if the opposition is to continue with a guessing game for question time instead of asking proper questions, they should expect the answers that Senator Conroy is providing.

Obviously some key individuals were missing this morning from their Senate tactics committee, but who would have thought that Senator Abetz’s contribution could be so large that they could not manage without him? Seriously, this is the best they could do without you, Senator Abetz!
