        (3)   Does the exclusion of PACER Plus from the trade policy statement mean that it will not longer have to be negotiated as a WTO compatible free trade agreement.

         The Minister for Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)   Australia is continuing to fulfil its commitment to provide $500,000 a year for three years to the

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PACER" rel="nofollow">
          PACER
         </a>
         Plus negotiations. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         provided funding for the first year of the OCTA's operations through an arrangement with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat. Prior to OCTA becoming a legal entity, Australia agreed that unspent Australian Government funding from the first year of the OCTA's operations would be rolled over to fund its operations in the second year. On 12 May 2011, the Australian Government sent the OCTA and Forum Island countries a draft funding agreement for the OCTA's second and third years of operation. Australia expects to finalise the funding agreement soon.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)   (a) References to the PACER Plus negotiations were not included in the April 2011 Trade Policy Statement or the Government's report to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
          WTO
         </a>
         Trade Policy Review of Australia because Australia's approach to the PACER Plus negotiations is different to that taken in traditional free trade agreement negotiations. Australia's primary objective for the PACER Plus agreement is to promote the sustainable economic development of Forum Island countries through greater regional trade and economic integration.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)   (b) Australia's approach to the PACER Plus negotiations is not affected.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3)   Australia is committed to pursuing through the PACER Plus negotiations an agreement which is consistent with the WTO rules related to free trade agreements.
