        My question is to the Minister for Ageing, Senator Santoro. Will the minister inform the Senate of the outcomes of the recent meeting of the minister’s Aged Care Advisory Committee, which of course focused on the important issue of abuse of the elderly in aged care facilities? Is the minister aware of any alternative views on this issue?

         Before starting my answer, I thank Senator Humphries for his question and I also commend Senator Humphries for the magnificent job he is doing as chair of the relevant Senate legislation committee. I particularly want to commend that committee, which is under the stewardship of Senator Humphries, for the very bipartisan and considered manner in which they are going about their job—and I am talking about senators on that committee from both sides of this chamber.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I said in answer to a question from Senator Forshaw on 27 February in this place, I undertook to inform this chamber of the outcomes of the 14 March ministerial advisory committee. As a result of this meeting, I will be taking a submission to federal cabinet in the near future outlining measures to build up arrangements that are already in existence to help eliminate the abuse of the elderly within Australia’s aged care facilities. It was an extremely worthwhile and very constructive meeting. As I have outlined in the Senate previously, it was attended by a broad representative group of people who work within the aged care sector. I felt very reassured to have that calibre of people offering me quality advice in terms of the contentious issues in question.
        </p>
        <p>
         The advisory committee at the end of it all expressed general support, I thought, for the following initiatives: a uniform system of police checks for workers in the aged care industry, an increase in unannounced spot checks for aged care facilities, a review of the current complaints resolution scheme and enhanced training for all aged care staff in relation to knowledge and awareness of abuse of the elderly and how to deal with complaints. One of the very interesting aspects of that meeting was in relation to the issue of mandatory reporting. At the end of the process, I thought the committee was significantly divided on the issue. I must admit that came to me as a surprise, and I have expressed that surprise publicly. Some members of the committee requested additional research and information in relation to the effectiveness of mandatory reporting schemes in other jurisdictions, including overseas jurisdictions. I have asked for some further research and for the existence of current literature to be brought to my attention.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would also like to express my appreciation for the advice that I have received from members of the Aged Care Advisory Committee since that meeting. Many of them have provided feedback following their deliberations on that day, and they have been very good in terms of elaborating on some of the ideas and views that they expressed.
        </p>

         may also be interested to know that I have now written to my state colleagues—and I should emphasise that my state ministerial colleagues are all members, unfortunately, of the Labor Party—asking them to meet with me. The majority of them have replied in the affirmative that they will be coming to a meeting with me and they have also expressed a view that they wish to go about the business in a very considered manner. That meeting will in fact take place in Canberra on 10 April.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since that meeting, I have received many submissions from carers, relatives, advocacy groups, providers and other professionals within the aged care industry. I have also spoken with a number of residents, including some who have been abused, and I have drawn much strength and determination from that in terms of my desire to continue to do the job that has to be done. Again, I reiterate my belief that the vast majority of aged care facilities within Australia are safe places for our elderly citizens to be in and that they are run by dedicated, ethical and totally committed people who look after the elderly as if it is their sacrosanct duty.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Could the minister further explain to the Senate the alternative views on which he was about to elaborate and explain why he will not be adopting those alternative views about this issue?

           I cannot allow that supplementary question. It does not conform with the standing orders.
