        My question is to Senator Minchin, the Minister representing the Treasurer. I again refer to the recent inflation figures, which rose to 3.9 per cent for the year ending September. Is the minister aware that the Prime Minister, in response to this increase, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What you have to consider is that if you don’t have an interest rate rise ... there will be a further boost in inflation ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister explain why the Prime Minister has given the green light to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        to increase interest rates? Haven’t there already been seven increases since May 2002, including three since October 2004, when Mr Howard said that interest rates would not increase under his government?

         I refute the assertion that the Prime Minister has given the green light to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank

         . The Reserve Bank is fundamentally independent in its policy settings. That is absolutely clear in the charter that the government has with the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank is entirely independent in its monetary policy settings. That is not to say that no Prime Minister or Treasurer should ever say anything about interest rates.

             Of course, as those responsible for fiscal policy and the responsible managers of this economy—one of the best-performing economies of the Western world—we are going to comment on all issues that pertain to people’s welfare and the state of the economy. Interest rates cannot be immune from comment by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, but that does not go to say that the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
              Reserve Bank
             </a>
             is not independent. Of course it is independent.

             The Labor Party seem keen on going back over the entrails of the last election. I would have thought they would not wish to do so, given the embarrassment of that election to them and given what a thrashing they got at that election. At the last election we made the proper, reasonable and sensible claim—and one that I see is still supported by the Australian people—that interest rates would be lower under our government than they would be under a Labor government, and history establishes that fact. As I said in my answer to a previous question, home mortgage interest rates averaged 12.75 per cent under the previous Labor government, peaking at 17 per cent. Home mortgage interest rates under our government have averaged 7.17 per cent. When we came into office at the end of Labor’s period in office, home mortgage interest rates were 10.5 per cent. Today they are 7.8 per cent. The Australian people understand that coalition policies are always more likely to produce lower interest rates than the policies of the Labor Party.

              , I ask a supplementary question. I again refer Senator Minchin to the Prime Minister’s comments. Can Senator Minchin explain to Australian families who are struggling with rising costs just why the Prime Minister has given the green light to an increase in interest rates? Isn’t the government’s failure to keep inflation under control directly responsible for the seven successive hikes in interest rates that have been suffered by Australian families?
