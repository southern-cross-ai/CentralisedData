         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        , Senator Farrell. Has the Albanese Labor government finalised new guidelines for the use of special-purpose aircraft? In what year were the guidelines that are currently applicable dated or first approved?

         I thank Senator McGrath for his question. Yes, I can provide some information in response to that question, Senator McGrath, and if further information is needed then I will seek to get that information after question time. The draft special-purpose aircraft guidelines 2023 have been updated to reflect the security advice ratified by the security coordination committee on 1 March 2023. In accordance with this advice, the draft guidelines will not be finalised until the transparency and accountability considerations are finalised.
        </p>
        <p>
         Well, I'm directly answering your questions, so please listen. Until the guidelines are finalised, the government is authorising flights in accordance with the 2013 guidelines. The use of special-purpose aircraft is being reported, reflecting the security advice and the updated draft guidelines. As I said, if there's further information that I can provide then I shall do that.

           Thank you, Minister. What is the security classification of the guidelines for the use of special-purpose aircraft? If these documents are unclassified, will they be released publicly in accordance with orders of the Senate?

            I thank Senator McGrath for his first supplementary question. In respect of the first part of your question, the 2013 special-purpose aircraft guidelines, as published, are classified as Official. In respect of your second question, I will need to seek some advice from the minister.

              According to leaked Albanese government talking points repeated by the Minister for the Environment and Water on Monday, the government is committed to providing
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPA" rel="nofollow">
               SPA
              </a>
              flight manifests to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPEA" rel="nofollow">
               IPEA
              </a>
              . However, a second leak of updated talking points removes any reference to providing manifests to IPEA. Is the government committed to providing the SPA manifests to IPEA or not, and why are the manifests not currently being provided to IPEA?

               I thank Senator McGrath for his second supplementary question. I'm advised that the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
                Royal Australian Air Force
               </a>
               stopped providing weekly manifests to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPEA" rel="nofollow">
                IPEA
               </a>
               on 7 December 2021. It's a matter of public record that the Leader of the Opposition, of course, was the Minister for Defence at that time. The Minister for Defence has directed his department to continue to work with IPEA for assurance and scrutiny of public expenses, including for special-purpose aircraft. Again I repeat that, if there's any further information I can provide to you after question time, I'll come back and do that.
