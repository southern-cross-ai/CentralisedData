         I thank Senator Furner for his question. I notice the baying from those opposite. I know this is difficult for you to have to deal with, but the prospect of actually reading a few books might be of interest to you.

           ’s—the Leader of the Opposition’s—idea of ‘the good old days’. I know they long for days of dearth and of pestilence, and the days of witch burning and the Black Death, but they might pay a little bit of attention to what are important matters for the future of this country in regard to the book industry, which is of vital importance to the cultural life of this nation, but is equally important to our innovative efforts. We need a strong domestic book industry to help us take Australian ideas to the world and to bring the world’s ideas to Australia. The book industry itself faces many innovation challenges, including the challenge presented by the e-book and other digital technologies. The government wants Australian firms to be in the vanguard of the emerging digital publishing industry. We want Australian books, whether they are in print or digital, to be able to compete internationally on equal terms with the books from the United Kingdom, the United States and the other big players in the English language market. The government wants to ensure that Australia is one of the international leaders in regard to innovation in the book industry.

               Senator Abetz, what we are seeing from you is yet one more episode in your never-ending crusade against the Enlightenment! It is about time you joined the 21st century! It is important that the interests of the whole supply chain be recognised. One of the national innovation priorities which has been identified in the government’s Powering Ideas innovation agenda is to improve the dissemination of new technologies, of new processes and new ideas. The more freely and more creatively ideas and research results circulate, the more impact they have.

                 This government believes that it has a responsibility to work in partnership with industry. This is the most effective way to promote the development and encouragement of new investment. This is what we have been working towards since we came to office. The Book Industry Strategy Group builds on that foundation. The industry will be able to contribute its skills and its expertise and other resources as appropriate. The government will support the group’s work by linking it to the Print Industry Working Group, the Creative Industries Innovation Centre and the

                 Industry Innovation Centre. We will also encourage the strategy group to call on Enterprise Connect and other areas of my portfolio to help with projects that are addressed in the terms of reference. Our aim, as always, is to promote the transformation and the renewal of this vital industry by working side by side with companies, with workers and with researchers.
