        It is the responsibility of each government agency, to ensure that they comply with the requirements of the Library Deposit and Free Issue Schemes (

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Due to the devolved nature of Australian Government publishing, it is not feasible to know what agencies are publishing and what publications are not lodged with libraries via the LDS.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        AGIMO will continue to build awareness of the LDS and remind agencies of their obligations. AGIMO will do this through direct communication with publishing agencies and the development of better practice guidance on publishing.

        The Committee recommends that agencies provide a website link, for all documents to be presented to Parliament, to the Tabling Officer of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.

       <p class="italic">
        For some website implementations, it is not possible in all cases to allocate a web address to documents until they are ready to be posted on the Internet. The government therefore does not support this recommendation as it would be inappropriate to provide a website link to documents that are under embargo.
