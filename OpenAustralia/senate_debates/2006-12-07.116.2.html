        DFAT can and does provide an on-ground point of contact for all Australians overseas through its network of diplomatic posts. DFAT promotes the interests of Australian expatriates and of Australia generally in a range of fields including trade, investment and commerce. Australian missions work closely and actively with Australian expatriate communities, organisations and social groups to maintain positive and productive links to promote Australian goods and services as well as information and cultural activities. DFAT’s core responsibility is to protect the interests of Australians internationally including by delivering a professional and wide-ranging consular service in support of Australians who may find themselves in distress overseas or requiring assistance. DFAT will continue to accord high priority to advancing and protecting the interests of Australian expatriates internationally, noting that these interests vary widely according to a range of geographic and demographic considerations.

        The ABS is currently working with the DIMA to improve the statistical information collected through incoming and outgoing passenger cards and other DIMA data sources. These investigations should lead to improved information relating to Australian expatriates. For example, it would be possible to conduct analyses of Australian residents returning to Australia who have been overseas for a period of 12 months or more.

        The Government accepts this recommendation noting that this is an existing requirement. Australian missions provide a broad range of services across, inter alia, consular, immigration, trade, cultural and business activities, as part of which there is a continuous process of engagement with local expatriate communities. In numerous posts a warden system is in place to ensure close and speedy contact with the expatriate community. An expansion of consular services, with an additional 15 officers to be posted to Australian missions over the next two years, as well as the appointment of 16 local support staff, will further improve the service delivered to Australians abroad.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the websites of Australia’s foreign missions should include on-line registration facility to enable local expatriates to register their professional profiles. The profile database will facilitate stronger engagement between missions and expatriates, and will provide a resource for missions in their work of promoting Australia’s interests overseas. It would also be used to notify expatriates of news and upcoming events.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        DFAT has a responsibility for protecting the interests of Australians abroad and its foreign missions encourage all Australians residing overseas or travelling in high-risk areas to register with the local mission. Many missions have highly active links with their local expatriate community including news letters, social clubs, business groups and, in some instances, warden systems. The missions maintain contacts with local chapters of the Australian Chamber of Commerce, business councils, friendship associations, alumni and other expatriate organisations and their members. Each mission also maintains a website (in addition to the central DFAT website) which can provide information on local events and developments. The Government does not however support the recommendation for a register of professional profiles. Privacy considerations, potential for liability relating to claims by third parties and the need to ensure entries are maintained and up-to-date argue against the practicability of such a register.

In its report of 27 February 2006 the Committee commented “the Committee considers that this matter has been fully considered by the Government over a number of years and that renunciation is properly regarded as a more significant and conscious relinquishing of the bonds of allegiance to Australia.

        DIMA’s strategy for responding to citizenship enquiries from clients overseas is to consolidate enquiries by geographic region. This ensures that information on local arrangements is provided. DIMA has expanded its global contact centre coverage to provide clients with access to information across multiple service channels such as phone, e-mail and fax. The implementation of enhanced overseas telephone handling arrangements in the United Kingdom (which will also be expanded to include Europe) and the Americas provide access for Australian expatriates to citizenship information through both telephone (where they can speak directly to an operator) and e-mail.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In addition, DIMA provides comprehensive information on citizenship through the dedicated website, www.citizenship.gov.au.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Clients in Australia can access citizenship information and services through the Citizenship Information Line, 131 880, from 0830 to 1630 (Mon-Fri).

        The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 was amended in July 2004 to extend the period of time in which an elector may apply to become an eligible overseas elector after leaving Australia from two years to three years. This followed consideration of overseas voting issues by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its report on the 2001 federal election. The Government considers that the provisions for enrolment and voting by Australians living overseas are appropriate and does not see the need to relax the requirements for these electors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also considers that Australians living overseas need to demonstrate a continued interest in returning to live in Australia to retain the entitlement to participate in its political affairs.

        The Australian Government supports the encouragement of non-profit organisations such as universities and arts organisations pursuing philanthropic contributions from expatriate Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For arts organisations, philanthropic income is an important supplement to government funding and other income and they are under increasing pressure to build and maintain relationships with their supporters to encourage greater giving. A number of arts organisations receive significant support from expatriate Australians with whom they have a strong association.

        ) status so that they can secure tax deductible donations in their own right in pursuit of their own cultural objectives. Similar arrangements apply to Australia’s public art galleries, museums and libraries. For many arts organisations, there would be limited scope for combining efforts across the not-for-profit sector to achieve benefits of scale, since success in securing philanthropic contributions is dependent on the individual organisation actively engaging supporters in its programs and activities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australia Business Arts Foundation (AbaF), established by the Australian Government to promote private sector support for the arts, could play a role in helping the arts sector maximise opportunities for obtaining support from expatriate Australians. AbaF connects business, the arts, donors and foundations through three programs – Partnering, Volunteering and Giving. Through the Giving Program, AbaF works with donors and grantmakers, artists and cultural organisations to increase donations to Australia’s cultural life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees that the Lowy report presents a compelling case for pursuing philanthropic support from expatriates, and that non-profit organisations such as universities and arts organisations should be encouraged to do so.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is supportive of Australian university philanthropy. Most universities have offices which seek to attract philanthropic income which may include approaches to expatriates. Universities also actively engage expatriates through the development of strong communication strategies and alumni networks, for example some universities run events for expatriate alumni around the world, advertising widely through a variety of media and interested alumni are able to register online.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In support of these activities the Australian Vice-Chancellors’ Committee has developed a ‘Code of Practice for Australian University Philanthropy’.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Philanthropy to Australian higher education institutions is an area of ongoing interest to the Business Industry Higher Education Collaboration Council. In 2005, the Council examined philanthropy in the Australian higher education sector including tax system incentives and disincentives to investment in higher education by the private sector; and issues that present barriers or disincentives to donations and endowments to higher education, particularly from private sector individuals and companies. Although the work to date has not focused specifically on expatriate alumni, one of the findings was that the sector should look at improving communication with possible benefactors including alumni.
