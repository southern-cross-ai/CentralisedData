        I rise today to speak about a very interesting and important program for young Australians. University students from across Australia are being given an opportunity to intern in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Congress" rel="nofollow">
         United States Congress
        </a>
        in Washington,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC" rel="nofollow">
         DC
        </a>
        through a program now known as the Uni-Capitol Washington Internship Program. Each year, young Australian university students are spending eight weeks gaining a valuable working understanding of the political process in America by interning in congressional offices in Washington, DC.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first group of five young women from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        completed their internships in January and February 2000. Since then the program has grown, with the 2007 program expected to see around 12 students matched exclusively from a selection of 17 congressional offices. Students are selected from seven to eight universities from across Australia, including the University of Wollongong in the Illawarra, where my electorate office is based, the University of Canberra and the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , to name a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        The success and growth of the program has been in large part due to the manner in which these young Australians have acquitted themselves in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        Congress. We should be proud of the way these students have served as ambassadors for themselves, for their universities and for Australia. I would like to share with senators some of the glowing testimonials from just a few congressmen and congresswomen who have hosted our students. Congressman Sam Farr of California on 13 February 2002 said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They have done this nation and the Australian people numerous proud acts of public service, which I hope will continue for many years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congressman Michael Castle of Delaware, from the congressional record of 15 February 2005, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am grateful to our Australian friends for their unbridled enthusiasm, tireless work ethic, and friendship over these past two months. The relationships we have forged here will last a lifetime, and it is my sincere hope that every congressional office partake in a similar endeavour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congressman Alcee Hastings of Florida, from the congressional record of 15 February 2006, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am proud that my office is part of this program, as I believe it provides a unique and important bridge between the United States of America and Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The interns are accorded unique access to the US political system and institutions across their eight-week, full-time internships. In-office experiences and training vary widely according to the needs of the congressional hosts. Administrative functions, constituent liaison and legislative research and support have been among the touchstones of past internships. Offices typically encourage interns to attend hearings, briefings and press conferences both on and off
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitol_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Capitol Hill

        , plus briefings at the US Department of State and the Australian embassy. Recent groups have also participated in activities such as: a roundtable with the senior congressional reporter of the

        The program was created in Washington, DC by Eric Federing, who directs the program pro bono. During the 1990s Mr Federing made extensive visits to Australian universities where he lectured on government, politics and news media. These visits developed in Mr Federing an admiration of our nation and people, which provided the impetus for the successful program that it is today. Mr Federing was a senior congressional adviser for several years and is now Director, Business Public Policy, Government Affairs for

        </a>
        , the global audit, tax and advisory services firm.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2004 Mr Federing received a KPMG Chairman’s Award for Excellence in Volunteerism in Washington, DC in recognition of the internship program. Former interns have said that Mr Federing and his wife, Daphne, have been mentors and friends to them. Many are very grateful for their hospitality and constant support. Many of the students who have completed this program say that they have returned to Australia inspired to become involved in the Australian political process, with former interns now working and volunteering in numerous political offices, including the Prime Minister’s office, and various government departments.

        There are so many common values between our two countries and yet there is such a huge physical distance between us which means that contacts between individuals can be very difficult to achieve. We see in our Prime Minister and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Bush" rel="nofollow">
         President Bush
        </a>
        the value of a solid professional and personal relationship. The relationships these students are developing are important, particularly because the future strength of the alliance between our two countries is not going to be just about economic and military relationships but is going to very much depend on the people to people strengths that will develop in us an understanding of each other. I congratulate the students who have already acted as ambassadors for our country and ensured the growth of this program. I would encourage future university students to utilise opportunities like this when they are made available to them.
