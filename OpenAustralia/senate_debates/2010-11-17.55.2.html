        by leave—I would like to add my own congratulations and that of many other people in this chamber to the royal couple and wish them great happiness and great success into the future. I did notice the news report which referred to them as ‘the British royal couple’, and that speaks very loudly of itself. I hope that very early in the period of their married life that we in Australia find an Australian head of state who can greet them in this country as heads of the United Kingdom.

         and his fiancee all the best for their marriage and a long-term, happy relationship. I say that as a Welshman who has had trouble in the past in wishing British royalty good luck, but it is obviously a very happy occasion for them and I am sure all senators are pleased for them.

          by leave—Knowing that many of my constituents think that this is a great occasion, I wish the happy couple all the best. I would not have their jobs for all the tea in China; the thought of living the rest of your life in a human goldfish bowl just does not appeal to me. But I do think that their representation in the Australian context in that we have a stable constitution that has provided the freedom of democracy that we all experience and enjoy is something quite worthy and admirable and is to be protected.
