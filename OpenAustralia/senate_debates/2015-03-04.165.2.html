        This evening I want to talk about a manifest abuse of the privileges we have in this place by a senator so that she could besmirch the personal reputation of a senior statutory officer holder by smear and innuendo of the worst kind, without a single shred of evidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last evening as the adjournment debate drew to a close, Senator Rhiannon of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Greens
        </a>
        delivered a speech that unfolded as a personal attack on a senior Australian public servant who holds an important statutory office. In delivering her smear, she cleverly tried to avoid direct accusation, preferring the coward's way of attacking by imputation. This attack on the director of Fair Work Building and Construction, Mr Nigel Hadgkiss, occurred in the context of a long-running
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
         CFMEU
        </a>
        smear campaign against him. This campaign is part of a broader smear campaign being spearheaded by the union's national secretary,

        , who has a record of smearing and victimising anyone brave enough to speak out about the behaviour of his union.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CFMEU's agents of influence in this place have repeatedly tried to attack this public servant. Following estimates in October last year, the CFMEU's former employee Senator Wong asked a question on notice relating to Mr Hadgkiss's career and his achievements. This question asked for a range of details about his background, including details of all 15 commendations received by him—

           The insinuation of the work by Senator Wong related that these commendations were somehow not genuine. Not surprisingly, all of the 15 of these commendations were exactly as they appeared. At Senate Estimates last week, the

           's most faithful advocate, Senator Cameron, again attempted to smear Mr Hadgkiss. This time, Senator Cameron made the absurd allegation that Mr Hadgkiss was compromised by receiving a cup of tea from building companies—a totally pathetic assertion.

            I rise on a point of order. A raise a similar point that has been raised so far. There is a customary practice in this chamber that if you are to besmirch the reputation of another senator you at least provide the courtesy of informing the senator so that they may well want to be here to hear these remarks, and may well refute them. Given that the senator has not actually said that he has actually contacted the senator, I take it that, in fact, the opposite is the case.

             Thank you, Senator Carr. As I said to Senator Rice, it is a courtesy of the Senate to advise senators if they are going to be speaking about them. But it is not a point of order.

Last night, the CFMEU's desperation reached a new level when it sent the Greens senator, Senator Rhiannon, to use privilege to again attack a distinguished statutory officer holder, bizarrely accusing him of somehow being complicit in murder and torture in

                 So the basis of this tissue of smear was that one time Mr Hadgkiss visited the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Ulster_Constabulary" rel="nofollow">
                  Royal Ulster Constabulary

                 as a member of Australia's premier national crime authority. Then she went on to provide the Senate with a colourful and selective history of the formal Royal Ulster Constabulary. At this point, it is worth recounting the record of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
                  CFMEU
                 </a>
                 smears, led by its chief smear merchant, National Secretary
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_Noonan" rel="nofollow">
                  Dave Noonan
                 </a>
                 . Mr Noonan is well known for his regular visits to
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
                  Parliament House
                 </a>
                 , so we should not be surprised that Senator Rhiannon has now been activated as part of his union's smear campaign.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The CFMEU's corrupt and criminal activities were exposed at various points last year in the Heydon Royal Commission. Each time, this evidence was met with smears and retribution from Dave Noonan. This prompted counsel assisting the royal commission to conclude that there had been a: 'CFMEU slur campaign against witnesses who were willing to give evidence against them.' This slur campaign was extensive and shameful. When Boral
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
                  CEO
                 </a>
                 Mike Kane blew the whistle on the CFMEU blackmail and secondary boycotts, Dave Noonan personally attacked Kane as the CEO of a multinational company. When CFMEU official Luke Collier had intimidated and threatened FWBC inspectors at Barangaroo, including calling a female inspector an 'f-ing slut', Dave Noonan excused this behaviour by saying that swearing on building sites was nothing new.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Last November, brave whistleblowers in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                  New South Wales
                 </a>
                 branch of the CFMEU came forward on ABC to reveal the union's involvement in:

                <p class="italic">
                 …corruption, association with murderers, association with gangsters, association with terrorists, money being paid to union officials, union officials intimidating other union officials, union officials being forced out of their jobs and their careers…
                </p>
                <p>
                 So what was Dave Noonan's response to that? He issued a press release smearing the whistleblowers as:

                  Victoria Police
                 </a>
                 Stephen Fontana implicated senior CFMEU officials in direct links to organised crime, counsel for the CFMEU tried to smear the assistant commissioner by asserting that he was engaged in cultural warfare and outrageously claimed that, in fact, Victoria Police was part of the problem. It was no surprise that Dave Noonan's union would attempt to use a compliant Senate in the parliament to again engage in its smear campaign against those who reveal the ugly truth about this corrupt union.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What was notable about Senator Rhiannon's speech last night was not just its sheer desperation and Noonan-inspired level of spite and rage but its absolute utter hypocrisy:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 I urge Hadgkiss to provide details about his past.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Let me say that again, but this time more slowly so that the irony is not lost:
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 I urge Hadgkiss to provide details about his past.
                </p>
                <p>
                 If Senator Rhiannon is now demanding of others that they explain their past then she is certainly inviting reflection on her own past. And what an interesting past it is! Senator Rhiannon, as we know, was a longstanding member of the

Of course, I am not the first person to ask this of Senator Rhiannon. She has many questions still to answer. As a former

                        Last night, Senator Rhiannon delivered an appalling smear against Mr Hadgkiss on behalf of the

                         CFMEU
                        </a>
                        . She asserted that because Mr Hadgkiss visited
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Ireland" rel="nofollow">
                         Northern Ireland
                        </a>
                        at a time when certain violent acts were taking place, that he is somehow implicated in those acts. Senator Rhiannon herself stated, 'There is no suggestion that Hadgkiss was involved in crimes committed by the
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RUC" rel="nofollow">
                         RUC
                        </a>
                        .' Of course there is not. But that did not stop her from claiming that he is somehow implicated in anything that the RUC might have done. Just a few lines later in her speech, after detailing some particular incidents that occurred in Northern Ireland, she reverses this position and says, and I quote again, 'Hadgkiss cannot use the excuse that the crimes perpetuated by the RUC were not known when he visited.' This is the lowest form of smear: when no evidence exists, simply assert 'guilty by association', no matter how ludicrous the claim, in the hope some mud might stick. As Senator Rhiannon's hero Vladimir Ilych Lenin once said, 'A lie told often enough becomes the truth.'
