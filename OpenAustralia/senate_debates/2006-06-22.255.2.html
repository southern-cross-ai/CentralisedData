        I do not need to speak further to these amendments. They are to abolish the private health insurance rebate so that that money can be spent on ensuring that we have a quality public health system that all Australians can use.

         Very briefly, Labor will not be supporting the proposal from the Greens. It is interesting to see that Senator Santoro at this time of night is harking back to the old, untrue, insightful proposal that Labor will abolish the private health insurance rebate. We are here voting against this proposal, Senator. Just stop the rubbish.

          I want to make a comment as well about one of the minister’s remarks: that those opposed to this bill or to private health insurance are somehow reflecting the politics of envy. I am not sure whether this offends against standing orders but it certainly offends against me. I think there are perfectly logical arguments to be put, and they are being put. They were by Senator Nettle and I have certainly done so in this place. It has got nothing to do with politics of envy of people who can afford or choose private health insurance. It has got nothing to do with that and I object to the minister saying so.

           have caused offence to Senator Allison—I had not heard her speak in relation to the matter that Senator Nettle spoke about—I apologise to her. Having listened to the speech of Senator Nettle, I stand by my remarks. It came across to me as being very much motivated by the politics of envy. As far as I am concerned I stand by those remarks. In terms of the remarks by Senator McLucas, I did not have an indication whether the Labor Party would be supporting Senator Nettle’s amendments. I am glad that you have placed on record your intention to vote against them and I am grateful for that support.

               <p>
                The proposal of the Labor Party is to extend the powers of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Health_Insurance_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
                 Private Health Insurance Ombudsman
                </a>
                even further than what is proposed in the legislation. The amendments allow the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman to refer all matters related to issues within his or her scope. The first amendment suggests that the PHIO can refer matters to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                 ACCC
                </a>
                . The second amendment allows the minister to refer matters to the ACCC. The fifth amendment allows the PHIO to refer a matter to another body. The sixth one allows the minister to refer, if appropriate, a matter to another body.
               </p>
               <p>
                For this amendment to take effect there also must be an amendment to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Practices_Act" rel="nofollow">
                 Trade Practices Act
                </a>
                and in particular to part VIIA, the prices surveillance section of the act. Part VIIA of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPA" rel="nofollow">
                 TPA
                </a>
                allows for price inquiries, price notifications and price monitoring. However, the amendment we are seeking relates only to the ACCC powers to hold and report on inquiries—that is, we are not proposing that the private health insurance market be subject to price notification.
               </p>
               <p>
                The amendments also will allow the minister to direct the ACCC to hold an inquiry into specified matters and report its finding to the minister, who then can make decisions on its recommendations. Companies are liable to a maximum penalty of 100 penalty points if they increase prices during an inquiry without approval from the ACCC.
               </p>
               <p>
                Public inquiries initiated under the

                 PSA
                </a>
                have been used for a number of purposes in the past, including to determine whether pricing outcomes reflect competitive market forces, to advise the minister on what types of prices oversight, if any, should be applied to the company or companies under inquiry and to play an educative role by bringing information into the public domain, thereby facilitating public understanding of the pricing matters at issue. These amendments, I think, extend the scope of the bill in question. In Labor’s view they will give far more consumer protection, using the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman’s role, than envisaged by the government.

                <p>
                 The government has considered very seriously the opposition amendments to this bill. However, it cannot support the opposition’s amendments for a number of reasons. Firstly, the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Health_Insurance_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
                  Private Health Insurance Ombudsman
                 </a>
                 already has the power, with the complainant’s agreement, to refer a matter to the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
                  ACCC
                 </a>
                 or another body if, in the PHIO’s opinion, it could be more effectively dealt with by the ACCC or another body. Also, the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman is already required to consult with the ACCC in relation to restrictive trade practice matters. The opposition’s amendments do not enable the ombudsman to provide more effective consumer protection beyond the measures contained in the bill before the Senate tonight.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Secondly, there is some doubt about whether a constitutional basis exists to allow the ombudsman or the minister to refer, and the ACCC or other body to inquire into, health care provider charges. This is because the ACCC’s prices surveillance role relies mainly on the corporations power, and specific provisions in the trade practices legislation expressly limit the ACCC’s powers to ensure that it remains within its constitutional limits.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Lastly, and most importantly, the ACCC already has a role, under the trade practices legislation, in relation to misleading pricing, price fixing and price surveillance. However, the ACCC is not a price-setting body for retail goods and services. As the health industry is characterised by a large number of participants, monitoring would be extremely costly and is unlikely to be warranted on the grounds of competition. The proposed amendments could lead to increased charges to the consumers of health care provider services. For the above reasons, we cannot support the amendments that have been moved.
