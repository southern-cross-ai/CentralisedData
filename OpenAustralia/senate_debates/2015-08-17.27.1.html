        My question is to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz. Can the minister give the Senate any examples that show the importance of having a tough cop on the beat in the building and construction industry? Is there any new evidence that the current system needs reform?

         It seems that barely a day goes by without reports of the blatant disregard for the law shown by certain militant union officials at construction sites across Australia. In the past few days we have seen a series of unsavoury events from Adelaide to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         and in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . On Friday, a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         official was fined $12,000 for contempt of court in entering an Adelaide hospital construction site. This follows more than $500,000 worth of fines against the CFMEU and five of its officials for an earlier incident at the very same site.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today we hear how a New South Wales secretary of the CFMEU, Brian Parker, threatened a project manager at a school building site, in the usual CFMEU style. We also hear today how the CFMEU has been fined $45,000 for attempting to coerce a Northern Territory developer into paying its employees' union fees. Last week we also heard of Baulderstones, a company unconscionably and illegally working in cahoots with the CFMEU to demote a worker who had resigned from the union, being fined over $30,000. These are examples of this sort of ugliness, of big business getting together with big unions to deny individuals their rights. We want to stamp that out, and these are just the latest examples.
        </p>
        <p>
         The courts have said the penalties in this area are far too low. The evidence clearly shows that we need to restore a tough cop on the beat. That is why we need to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission, with an effective
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_Code" rel="nofollow">

         , and that is what the government will seek to do, despite the vote of the Senate earlier today.

           I can inform Senator Johnston and the Senate that unlawfulness in the construction industry costs jobs. Unlawful work stoppages have already delayed such vital community projects as two new children's hospitals,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
            TAFE
           </a>
           and university expansions, road extensions and accommodation for the long-term homeless. How many children were left waiting for a hospital bed, homeless left without a roof or students left in crowded classrooms while the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
            CFMEU
           </a>
           pursued its unlawful campaign to line its own pockets? How many more hospital beds, school classrooms or rooms for the long-term homeless could have been built with the taxpayer funds that were wasted whilst projects were halted by militant CFMEU thugs? How many more jobs could have been created and facilities built? It will protect workers from abuse, taxpayers from waste and the community from a system that fails them.

             The Labor Party and the Greens continue to oppose reforms that would protect union members, workers and taxpayers. By their opposition, they make it very clear that they care more about their relationship with militant elements of the union movement than they do about union members, workers and taxpayers. This, quite frankly, is remarkable. Those opposite should not hold the construction industry to ransom so that they can continue to receive campaign support and millions of dollars in donations from the worst union offenders.
