         Thanks to my colleague Senator Bilyk. My colleague Senator Conroy today made some very important announce­ments about the future of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         . I want to comment on the importance of the NBN to economic growth, particularly for small and medium-sized business. This is a major economic reform. It will help business across Australia, particularly in the regions, to take advantage of the enormous online opportunities.
        </p>
        <p>
         These opportunities, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         online connection, have been well spelled out in a major new study, released by McKinsey Global, on the impact of the internet on jobs, growth and prosperity in the world's economies. It examined some 13 countries responsible for 70 per cent of the world's economic growth. It found that the internet is a significant job creator. In France, for example, it has resulted in a net addition of 700,000 jobs—that is, 2.4 jobs created for every job lost. In the survey of 480,000 small and medium-sized businesses across 13 countries, 2.6 jobs were created for every one lost.
        </p>
        <p>
         It also found the internet contributed to 21 per cent of the economic growth in the last five years in advanced economies. All industries benefited from the web, and in fact small to medium-sized enterprises benefited to a disproportionately greater degree. Some 75 per cent of the economic impact was a positive result for small to medium-sized businesses.

         s with a strong web presence grew more than twice as quickly as those with no or minimal web presence. I quote from the report.

           The Gillard government, particularly my colleague Senator Conroy, is rolling out the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
            NBN
           </a>
           because it is a very important economic reform. We intend to roll it out whereas the Liberal-National Party intend to roll it back. I have heard that theme before—the roll-back theme—and we know how successful it is.
          </p>
          <p>
           My colleague Senator Conroy and I were at the PayPal Driving Business Online program launch last week. It has received great support from small business. In the visit they made to Armidale there were 41 one-on-one consultations with small business, in

            Coffs Harbour
           </a>
           it went similarly well, and I understand Lismore is booked out. The National Party should take note. This is regional Australia wanting more information about web based connection and the internet—a major economic reform that particularly benefits regional Australia.

             The Gillard government has a vision for Australia to become a global digital leader. This is a major economic reform. We are aiming to put Australia in the top five advanced economies by 2020 in the percentage of businesses and not-for-profit organisations using the internet. It drives productivity, it expands customer bases and it creates jobs.

               We cannot afford not to, Senator Macdonald. You have to come out of the past. Why does the Liberal-National Party oppose this important modernisation of the Australian economy? The

               is going to put Australia amongst the leading five economies of the world. We are about rolling it out. All you are about is the negative, about opposition and about rolling it back. That is all you can do.
