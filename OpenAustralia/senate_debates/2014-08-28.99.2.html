        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson. I refer to the minister's decision to cut $800,000 from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        's Travelling Exhibitions program during the first year of Australia's World War I commemorations. I also refer to the minister's explanation that it was 'unfortunate' if the memorial had commissioned any more exhibitions as the memorial had received an official warning in May. Given the statement by the War Memorial, 'At no stage before 14th August, were we given any indication that the future funding for travelling exhibitions was at risk,' I ask the minister who are we to believe?

         I thank the honourable senator for his question. The Labor Party is very quick with these issues. It ran about three days ago, but I am happy to take it from the back of the QTB and put up with the hot issues again. I say to the honourable senator that this decision was made on the back of me as minister and the department to make some judgements about what expenditure we are going to put into various areas over the next four years. I think it is a pity that the shadow minister, who was talking about this being a $10 million program, is clearly not across his brief and clearly knows absolutely nothing about this and was actually talking about this in the context of a budget cut.

          , I rise on a point of order going to direct relevance. Minister, there was no mention of the budget. The question goes to an inconsistency between the minister's explanation and the War Memorial's statement—an inconsistency between what the Minister for Veterans' Affairs has said and what the

            I say to the honourable senator that this is a program that has been running for a number of years. We are talking about $800,000 as he indicated as opposed to the $10 million that the shadow minister referred to. But under this agreement, it is a memorandum of understanding signed by the former government. Under that memorandum of understanding, either party can give notice of its intention to—

The specific question is about the statement from the War Memorial about the timing of the knowledge from the department or the minister.

                 I thank the honourable senator for his question. The War Memorial will be receiving $47.8 million in this budget, up from $40 million in the last Labor budget. We have actually increased funding for Australian schoolchildren to come to the War Memorial to experience the most magnificent of our institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                 What you need to understand is that I did not do this with any joy, but we have some very big decisions to make in relation to this nation over the next four and 10 years. One of those is: how is this nation going to respond to the 71,500 young men and women who have served this nation overseas in the last 20 years? You may well be prepared to sit back and let this nation do to them what we did post-Vietnam, but I, most assuredly, am not prepared to do so.
