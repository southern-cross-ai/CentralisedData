        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
         ARENA
        </a>
        in its entirety. I believe that what the government and the Labor Party opposition have decided to do has the potential to destroy ARENA in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        This afternoon, we had Senator Sinodinos boasting that the government was not a one-night stand. Well, let him and the government prove that it is not a one-night stand. Years ago they courted ARENA, they wooed ARENA, they formed ARENA, they got engaged to ARENA and now they are trying not to marry ARENA—or, if they do, to make it a very short relationship. Leave it alone. You boast about all the things you can do. You boast about research and development; you say how good it is going to be. You talk about the jobs it can save and you talk about the things that it is going to do for everybody. You have left some of the money in there, and we know the fix is in and that you are going to ignore us.
       </p>
       <p>
        What you could do, if you were really sincere about it, is preserve jobs in the area of renewables and in research and development. You talk about those young graduate students who have great ideas about new products and the new things they can do—the way they can save the world—and now you are trying to put the handcuffs on them. All I am asking you to do is think about it. Leave ARENA alone. In areas like the automotive industry in Victoria, and especially in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        —I know Senator Xenophon agrees with this—in the next couple of years thousands of people are going to be out of work, including the subcontractors. If you believe in ARENA and in the things they can do, you could retrain those people. Thousands of people could have new jobs in areas we do not even know about yet. So all I am saying to you tonight—and it is getting late—is leave ARENA alone.

         The government does not support these amendments. At the request of the Labor Party, and in the context of the agreement on this bill, the government has agreed to restore $800 million worth of funding for the purpose of providing direct grants to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
          ARENA
         </a>
         . This $800 million is funded through savings in other parts of the bill, in particular, the changes to family tax benefit A supplement arrangements.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the benefit of the chamber and to deal with some of the issues that the Greens have also raised during the debate, separately and off budget, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Clean Energy Innovation Fund receive a capital allocation of $10 billion. The overall allocation is unaffected by the agreement that has been reached on this bill, and, unlike ARENA grants, these investments need to be commercially viable. So the agreement between the opposition and the government on the omnibus savings bill has no impact on the overall capital allocation for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, which remains unchanged at $10 billion. In relation to the decision to restore $800 million in funding for ARENA, and to avoid an unintended increase in public resources available to ARENA beyond this $800 million allocation, a commensurate adjustment has been made to the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, but without impacting the overall capital allocation to both the CEFC and the

          While Labor is sympathetic to the intention of Senator Hinch's amendments, we are not able to support them on this occasion. We certainly welcome both Senator Hinch's interest in safeguarding
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
           ARENA
          </a>
          and his enthusiasm for contributing to how this parliament can achieve real progress in tackling climate change while further developing our domestic renewable sector. We look forward to working constructively with you, Senator Hinch, and all willing crossbench and government senators in the future on this vitally important issue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our approach to budget savings is one guided by fairness but also an acute appreciation of the important work that programs like ARENA do. This agreement, we believe, represents that balance in action. We can achieve a significant budget saving while we maintain ARENA as a pillar of our support for a growing renewable energy industry. Labor is understandably protective of ARENA. Its establishment is a proud achievement of our previous term in government, and we will always support it. We have, over the course of the Abbott-Turnbull government, fought against its abolition, and now, through this bill, contrary to the initial intentions of this government, we have managed to obtain ongoing certainty of funding and purpose.
         </p>
         <p>
          This bill secures additional funding of $800 million for ARENA over five years. This is in addition to the more than 200 existing projects that ARENA is already auspicing and in addition to the 12 large
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PV" rel="nofollow">
           PV
          </a>
          solar projects that were announced by ARENA last week but are not yet contracted. ARENA has stated that this sum—$800 million over five years—will provide it with a budget that allows it to continue a strong work program into the future. This agreement places ARENA's funding on a sound footing. Importantly, it provides researchers, entrepreneurs and industry with the certainty they need to continue turning renewable energy opportunities into new technologies, new projects and new jobs.
         </p>
         <p>
          As part of the agreement underlying this bill, the government has also agreed to sit down with the opposition to ensure that our priorities are satisfied. These priorities are, first of all, to ensure that ARENA's budget preserves Australia's world-class leading research and innovation capability, particularly seen in our universities and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">
           CSIRO
          </a>
          , and also to ensure that there is a budget for demonstrational, proof-of-concept stage developments in the industry.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition to securing our research capability, the agreement between the opposition and the government will also allow ARENA to support demonstration and proof-of-concept stage developments in the industry that ensure that the findings by those universities and by CSIRO scientists are able to be shown to be commercially viable and then able to be presented to lending and equity investors and become a reality across the Australian landscape. It is important to point out that there is no change and no reduction at all to the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation fund that is overseen by the expert board at the CEFC.
         </p>
         <p>
          The final matter I quickly want to allude to is: there was also a commitment made by the government, as part of this agreement, to sit down with the opposition and explore opportunities for bipartisan agreement around policies that would accelerate the transition for Australia to a modern clean energy system and to ensure that this transition is, to use the words of the Paris agreement, a just transition for workers and impacted communities. So, whilst the opposition will not be supporting this amendment, I thank Senator Hinch for his concern and for the contribution. We do welcome the considered contributions to this vital policy area, and I am sure we will have cause and opportunity to work together on this issue going forward.

           I can indicate that I and my colleagues Senators Griff and Kakoschke-Moore will be supporting this amendment. Even though the cut is still happening—we acknowledge that there will still be a fund but cut significantly—we are still very concerned that the solar thermal plant at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Augusta" rel="nofollow">
            Port Augusta
           </a>
           , essential for that community, in one of the sunniest places in the world, ought to still proceed. I hope against hope there will still be enough funds for that solar thermal baseload power plant to continue.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have a question of the minister in respect of this, and it follows from the second reading amendment that I moved that was defeated recently. Can the minister advise whether there are any plans on the part of the government to allow—by regulatory amendment, for instance—
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
            ARENA
           </a>
           to make investments or to have a grant convert, in the event that it is a highly successful project, to be either repaid or get an equity in it? Is that something that has been discussed with the board of ARENA with a view to replenishing the fund in the event that there has an investment in a technology that takes off commercially?

            I thank Senator Xenophon for that question. The short answer in relation to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
             ARENA
            </a>
            on its own is no, but of course that is precisely why the government, within the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, set up the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, which is jointly managed by the CEFC and ARENA. That is a fund that provides debt and equity financing for projects that need to be commercially viable. The difference between ARENA and CEFC—and that is the way it was set up by the previous government, not by us—is that ARENA provides grants, whereas the CEFC is the vehicle which provides debt and equity financing. As part of this agreement between the government and the opposition, we have restored $800 million out of the initial $1.26 billion save to ARENA for the purposes of ARENA providing direct grants, consistent with their modus operandi up until this point. We also have guaranteed that the overall capital allocation to the CEFC will remain at $10 billion. The way this is funded is by other savings in the bill, as I have indicated to the chamber.

             Minister, just to clarify: you have confirmed that the CEFC's budget of $10 billion will not be altered, but am I correct in that you have also confirmed that you will move $800 million out of the $1 billion Clean Energy Investment Fund back into the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and that you have somehow linked that with the so-called savings from

              I certainly have not indicated that a saving to fund the $800 million contribution to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
               ARENA
              </a>
              would come from what you have just described. I actually answered that in my initial contribution in response to Senator Hinch's amendments. The funding for the restoration of $800 million to ARENA for ARENA grants comes from savings in other parts of the bill, principally the changes to family tax benefit supplement arrangements. However, given the decision to restore $800 million in funding for ARENA, for ARENA grants, and to avoid an unintended increase in overall public resources available to ARENA beyond that $800 million restoration of grants funding for ARENA, a commensurate adjustment in the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, which is a capital fund jointly managed by CEFC and ARENA to provide debt and equity funding, is necessary. However, for the avoidance of any doubt, the agreement between the government and the opposition has no impact on the overall capital allocation for the Clean Energy Innovation Fund and the CEFC, which remains at $10 billion as before.

               So, Minister, am I correct in interpreting that you are cutting money out of CEIF and putting it back in CEFC and you claim that that was not part of the Labor Party deal? Did you raise this with the Labor Party before you reached an agreement with them? Are they aware that this so-called savings of $800 million from

               will now sacrifice $800 million from the CEIF?

                may answer the question, no aspect of the agreement between the government and the opposition in relation to the omnibus savings bill has got any impact whatsoever on the overall capital allocation to CEFC and CEIF. You are mixing up off-budget-balance-sheet equity and debt financing instruments with actual cash grants which hit the underlying cash balance. You are mixing these up. If we were to do what the Greens are suggesting, instead of restoring $800 million to
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
                 ARENA
                </a>
                we would actually be making available to ARENA about $1.6 billion worth of resources for the purposes of providing grants as well as debt and equity financing. But that was never the intention of the arrangement reached between the government and the opposition. The intention, and in good faith what we have agreed to do, at the request of the Labor Party, is to restore $800 million worth of funding for the purpose of ARENA grants, which was previously supposed to be saved. But, obviously, when it comes to the capital allocation of the jointly administered capital fund between the CEFC and ARENA, within the CEFC, well, yes: the capital allocation for CEFC increases does take into account adjustment to the jointly administered CEIF.

                   to co-administer are now adjusted accordingly, given that there is an $800 million increase in terms of grants funding. What that means is that the capital funding for debt and equity financing for renewables remains precisely as it was. But we are not proposing to double the contribution to ARENA to $1.6 billion; that is not something that we are proposing to do.

                    Just following up on that question: it was a very straightforward question, Minister. The Clean Energy Innovation Fund, which was the centrepiece of the Prime Minister's announcement leading into the federal election, was funded to the tune of $1 billion—the Clean Energy Innovation Fund. How much will now be available within that fund?

                     I have answered that question. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation, which has within it the CEIF, has an overall capital allocation of $10 billion. That was the allocation before today; that will be the allocation after today, should this bill pass. On top of that, we have agreed to restore $800 million in funding to

                         Senator Waters, your characterisation is completely inaccurate. The capital available to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, including the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, was $10 billion before today; it will be $10 billion after today, should this legislation pass. And, on top of that, the government has agreed, at the request of the Labor Party, as part of this agreement, to restore $800 million worth of funding, for the purposes of
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">
                          ARENA
                         </a>
                         grants, which was previously supposed to be saved. I do not know how I can be any clearer than that. However, clearly the intention of the agreement between the government and the opposition never was to increase resources available to ARENA to $1.6 billion. It was to provide an additional $800 million, and the implication of what you are asking for is essentially to double the contribution to ARENA, once you take grants and debt and equity financing resources into account.

                          So, Minister, the implication of what you are saying is that there was really no point to the Clean Energy Investment Fund, if it is basically the same as the CEFC. So how then do you explain the Prime Minister's press release, in the lead-up to the election, trumpeting it as a 'strong new approach to clean and renewable energy innovation in Australia'? Which is it? Have you cut it, or was it meaningless in the first place?

                           Well, again, that is just political rhetoric—and I will conclude my contribution on this point. That was certainly the feedback during our conversations—without attributing feedback to specific people. The feedback that we have received was that

                            ARENA
                           </a>
                           did not feel that, for its purposes, debt and equity financing was workable—that that was more in the remit of the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, and that the focus of ARENA and its purpose were better suited to the provision of grants funding. And what we have done, through this exercise, is to restore $800 million in funding for grants, which was previously supposed to be saved, without making any adjustment to the overall capital available to the CEFC and the CEIF.

                            So, Minister, why were there multiple different explanatory memorandums when this bill was before the House—the first one mentioning the cut to the Clean Energy Investment Fund, the next one not mentioning it, and then a further version—before us here in the Senate? Which is the truth? Is there a link? And was this part of the deal with the Labor Party or not? Which version of the explanatory memorandum was accurate?

                                It does seem that the Greens are a little bit confused, even though the explanation has been very clear for some time. As a result of the agreement that the government and the opposition have reached in relation to this bill,

Separate to that and off budget—and this is not something that we put in place; this is something that Labor and the Greens put in place under the period of the previous government—there is a capital allocation—

                                 , I raise a point of order on relevance. I asked how they worked historically. I did not ask about what you are planning to do now. I want you to explain to me how those three organisations have worked together and whether they have taken on joint venture projects together and how they have actually shared their financing across different projects. Perhaps you could explain to us how it worked previously, and then we can work out what quantum of differences we are looking at from these bills.

                                  Thank you, Senator. I was getting to that, of course. You know that the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, as it was set up by the parliament under the period of the previous government, was set up to provide financing for commercially viable projects, by way of either debt or equity financing.
                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARENA" rel="nofollow">

                                  </a>
                                  was set up for the purpose of providing grants funding for relevant renewable energy projects. Our government has established within the CEFC a jointly administered Clean Energy Innovation Fund, which was aimed at bringing ARENA and the CEFC together in the context of, in particular, as it says, clean energy innovation related projects but providing support through debt and equity financing as well. What has been put to us is: instead of doing it this way, leave all of the capital that was previously allocated within the CEFC fund—not touch that at all; not reduce that at all. We have decided to restore $800 million worth of funding for ARENA, which they will be able to deploy for their pre-existing purposes, as per usual.

                                    with savings elsewhere, then that is true. We have paid for the additional $800 million funding for ARENA by proposing to pass adjustments to family tax benefit A supplement arrangements. We have not paid for this additional $800 million by savings in other parts of the renewable energy space. That is the point I was making. That is something that the Greens are inaccurately trying to assert, and it is not right.

                                      has always been an organisation that provides grants and not equity and debt financing. This continues. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation has always been the body that provides debt or equity financing for commercially viable projects. Within the overall capital allocation of the CEFC, the Clean Energy Innovation Fund brought together the CEFC and ARENA within the CEFC to pursue debt and equity financing options. The overall capital available remains at $10 billion. There has been no money taken out of that overall capital allocation. It is the same as it was before. However, as a result of the agreement that the government has reached with the Labor Party, we are restoring $800 million worth of direct funding to ARENA for its usual purpose, which is to provide grants.

                                       Minister, what impact will shuffling around the $800 million from the Clean Energy Innovation Fund—moving that to the CEFC—have on the decisions that can be made by the CEFC in relation to the risk profile of investments?

                                         Minister, my understanding is that the whole point of the Prime Minister's Clean Energy Innovation Fund was to allow higher risk investments within the pool of money allocated to the CEFC. If you are now taking that ability away and taking $800 million out of that $1 billion, are you also now claiming that it will not have any impact on the risk profile of the investment decisions that can be made? Are you saying that the Prime Minister's announcement was a complete sham the whole time? Or have you got your facts wrong?

As I have indicated consistently all the way through, the capital allocation to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation remains at $10 billion, consistent with the arrangements that were put in place under the previous Labor government, supported by a the Greens at the time, I believe.

                                           Minister, we can be here all night if you do not want to answer the questions. If you do not know the answer, I am quite happy to wait for you to talk to the advisers. I am simply going off the material that the Prime Minister has put in the public domain. You are the minister; I am happy to be corrected by you. My understanding was that the whole point of the CEIF was high-risk investments. If you are now taking money out of that and then saying there is no impact, are you belling the cat that in fact it was a bit of a farcical arrangement in the first place, or will there in fact be an impact in that higher risk investments will not be able to be made to the tune of $1 billion but only to $200 million?

                                            are not interested in that. You want to have your cake and eat it too. Instead of us putting $800 million back in, you want us to put $1.6 billion back in. Guess what: it does not work that way. You cannot spend the same money twice. Maybe the Greens can spend the same money over and over, but you know what? We are acting in good faith. We have sat down with the Labor Party in good faith. We have agreed to absolutely leave the capital for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation intact at $10 billion and on top of that we have agreed to restore $800 million in grants funding to ARENA which, of course, was previously subject to a savings measure.

                                            If you want to talk about high-risk investments, you cannot have an opportunity for higher risk investment than when you provide a grant, because, when you provide a grant, you literally give it away irrespective of what happens. If you talk about the fact that we now have a requirement for lower risk profile as a result of the money that is invested here, that is just plain wrong.

There is no significant impact on the balance sheet. Is this an attempt to undermine the Prime Minister and to shaft his signature project going into the last election? Is that what is going on here? Have the right-wing dinosaurs inside the Liberal Party decided: 'We are going to hobble the Prime Minister's signature renewable energy achievement. We are going to do it through the back door. We are going to use the Labor Party, who obviously went into this sleepwalking, and we are going to have a go at the

                                                     is wrong. I have spelt that out very clearly. The overall capital allocation for the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Clean Energy Innovation Fund remains the same. It was $10 billion before today; it will be $10 billion after today.

                                                     On top of that, what we have done is to restore $800 million worth of funding, at the request of the Labor Party, to ARENA for the purposes of providing direct grants. This is not funded from any source related to renewable energy; this is funded from other savings in the bill, principally the changes to family tax benefit A supplement arrangements. I have said that several times now. There is absolutely no truth to the absolutely inaccurate assertion that you have made and that Mr Bandt made in the House of Representatives earlier this week. I have been making that very clear all week.

That has been very openly and transparently put on the public record several times now and it is very openly and transparently the intent of the agreement between the government and the opposition.

We have not change that process. There is a process that is non-political, as it should be. It should not be political discretion that determines that we pick this project or we pick that project. There is a rigorous process. And of course, as to what we have done, there is grant funding available to ARENA of up to $100 million for large-scale solar deployment projects—that is not changing—and ARENA also has ongoing resources through the budget to manage 252 current projects and continue its extensive knowledge-sharing and brokering role. If you want to champion specific projects because you have an interest in a particular local project, then I would encourage you to make representation to ARENA in the appropriate way.

Let's just have a discussion here and you could say you want a hundred million dollars there—'I want one for my backyard. I want one for over there.' That is not the way the process works. ARENA is there for a purpose. ARENA has a job to do. We want ARENA to do the job. I am not going to second-guess the professional judgements that ARENA makes in relation to this. It would be entirely improper.

The most likely bucket that that would have come from, given that it was a higher risk profile investment, would have been the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, which used to have a billion dollars in it. You have confirmed tonight that it is going to be cut down to $200 million. Port Augusta needs $100 million. Obviously that is 50 per cent of what is left in that bucket, because you have just taken out $800 million, and yet you were trying to maintain earlier that there would be no impact. How do you reconcile those two things?

Again, I go back to the first point: whether it is a grant or whether they are seeking debt and equity financing, it is not the government that makes a political decision to allocate that. There is an independent process at arm's length to the government to make merit-based judgements. That is the way it should be. If you are saying we should just spend money based on the government's political interests, I think that would be wrong in relation to this.

That is important to me because it tells a story about who is out there with innovation and who is out there with projects that are going to reduce emissions and have an impact on climate change. If there is $10 billion worth of people seeking high-risk seed funding, that is very important to know if we are cutting the resources of this organisation by $500 million. Minister, I ask you again: what kind of proposition pipeline is there for these agencies? In other words, who is going to miss out because you are cutting $500 million of funding?

I traversed this in the course of the second reading debate. The concern is that this will impact by ratcheting down the R&amp;D tax offset. It will make it less attractive for small and medium enterprises to invest in R&amp;D. Given the hour I will not restate what I said previously, but this is something that the

This will cut it down to 43.5 per cent. All other eligible entities may obtain, and, depending on the size of the entity, there is a cut of 1.5 per cent from 40 per cent to 38.5 per cent. That percentage difference does make a real difference in the context of being competitive in the R&amp;D space compared to what other countries are doing in respect of R&amp;D. I urge all senators to support these amendments.

The government will not support either of these amendments. The reduction in the rates of the refundable and non-refundable tax offsets for eligible R&amp;D spending will help improve the sustainability of the program. The R&amp;D tax incentive will continue to provide generous, easy to access support for thousands of eligible companies in all sectors of the Australian economy. Companies with a turnover of less than $20 million will still get a 43.5 per cent refundable tax offset for the first $100 million of eligible R&amp;D expenditure. All other companies will still get a 38.5 per cent non-refundable tax offset for the first $100 million of eligible R&amp;D expenditure.

Innovative businesses will benefit from a range of other measures, including allowing more businesses to access prior year losses. Changes have been made for operations such as entering into new business activities, and start-ups' intellectual property and other intangible assets will be more attractive investment options through more generous tax deductions through depreciation and connecting more small and medium businesses with researchers by investing $18 million in a new innovation connections initiative.

The provisions as set out in the omnibus bill relating to the R&amp;D tax incentive are the same as those that Labor committed to supporting during the 2016 election, with a start date of 1 July 2016. As part of our election platform, Labor said we would support the government's proposal to take savings from the R&amp;D tax incentive. We also said that a Labor government would use the findings of the review to consider whether there are more appropriate methods to achieve the same level of savings. It is disappointing that the technical issues with this measure remain unresolved, despite stakeholders raising them with the government on numerous occasions, but it is the government's responsibility to resolve those technical elements relating to the drafting of these provisions and their interaction with other areas of tax law.

I just want to reflect on what Mr Conroy, the member for Charlton, said last year:
                                                                                               </p>

Veterans would rather return to war than deal with the mess the claims system is currently in and has been for many years. What the government is proposing under the single appeal pathways, even though it has been amended by Labor, still means that this bill denies veterans a right to legal representation when forced to go against a government body stacked with government lawyers. Important decisions about veterans' entitlements are being made in situations where a veteran and advocate walk into a room packed with government employees holding law degrees. It is a denial of natural justice and due process, and the government is trying to cover it up by saying they will simplify the process by taking away the lawyers. They are taking away the lawyers all right—they are taking them away quite nicely because, bloody hell, the veterans are not having one. You are putting them up against nine or 10 lawyers in a Veterans' Review Board. How would you go if you had

Before any change to the veterans compensation system is allowed by legislation, particularly a change which many veterans and legal experts say will have adverse effects on veterans, the findings and recommendations of the Senate inquiry should be seriously considered.

It is $3.6 million over the entire forward estimates. The reason we are doing this is to improve the service available to the ex-service community.

This implements the recommendation of the 2011 review of military compensation arrangements which was initiated by, and the recommendations of which were accepted by, the former Labor government.

This streamlined process combines the advantages of the two current appeals paths available to veterans under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The Veterans' Review Board provides a process that is non-adversarial and veteran friendly and will encourage and support participation in the process to reach a resolution for the veteran at the earliest possible point. This approach is supported by ex-service organisations, which have been consulted on this measure, because going through the Veterans' Review Board is independent. They know and understand the process, which is friendlier and less formal.

As I have indicated to you, the process we are putting forward here is designed to be better for veterans. It is designed to be more veteran friendly. It is designed to achieve resolution of relevant, legitimate grievances more efficiently. This is not driven by seeking to achieve a major saving; this is driven by seeking to improve the veterans' experience in these circumstances and responds directly to relevant recommendations that were made by the 2011 review of military compensation arrangements.

In 2013-14 you spent close to $10 million. In 2014-15 you spent just over $10 million. Can you tell me why you see a problem with changing to one single pathway yet are prepared to go and spend millions and millions and millions of dollars on external lawyers—taxpayers' money—denying our veterans their rights to compensation?

We will be supporting this amendment by Senator Lambie, and I thank her for bringing it forward. Senator Cormann, before I proceed too far, can you identify whether these particular amendments relating to the veterans compensation system have been put in some other forum to an inquiry, apart from the 2011 review that you mentioned just a short time ago? Have these measures actually been fully ventilated with the veterans community, with their representative organisations, with individuals? Or is this just an attempt to pass something pretty late at night without proper process of review?

These bills all have a long history. When the measure we are now discussing was considered by the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade back in September last year—you have to remember: the budget measures that are brought together in this omnibus bill are measures that were left unlegislated from the previous parliament. They have all been discussed and debated at length. They have all been subjected to scrutiny. In relation to this particular proposition there was a 2011 review. It was a very important review that made good recommendations, which the previous government accepted and which we accepted and which, on coming into government, we sought to give effect to.

If you are trying to suggest that this has come out of nowhere and is trying to be snuck through late at night for the first time, that is just not correct. It was the subject of a specific

There are advocates out there—the external service organisations that are out there—and you know what I do: they are not lawyers. So when you try to sell them the crap that you sell them with this single pathway—and then I brought to their attention the harm that was going to do—things turned around very dramatically. They realised that you are hoodwinking them. So can you tell me: in the last three months, out of the 200 external service organisations out there, how many of them support this, and can you give me their names?

We will not be supporting the amendment. The government's original Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2015 Budget Measures) Bill was flawed, and because of the referral of the bill to the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade the flaws were highlighted and we now have a superior piece of legislation. In particular, veterans will now be able to appeal determinations of the Veterans' Review Board to the

The introduction of a 28-day statutory reporting time frame for the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to consider new evidence provided by a claimant is an important step in speeding up the time it takes for a claimant to achieve justice under the appeal system. The changes also allow for an internal review of the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission decision as envisaged in the 2011 military compensation review. We believe that these changes make the bill stronger and will put in better protections for veterans, and that is why we are supporting them as part of the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill before us tonight.

This is the whole point. If it can be avoided, we should not send veterans into the sort of circumstance that you are describing, which is the whole reason why we are proposing to make this change. We are very grateful that, after making the improvements that Senator Gallagher indicated, the Labor Party sees fit to support this measure.

When there was a Senate inquiry into this very bill, the RSL appeared and after questioning they could not really justify their support for this amendment. Unless they have recently articulated why they are now supporting this amendment, I think that the RSL needs to explain to their members why they are going down a path that could very well prejudice their members, who could be seeking compensation, given that they could well be out of pocket and disadvantaged as a result of this. I guess we will have to wait and see.

To the extent that I am advised, any concern has been addressed in this amended form of the bill. This has been an iterative process for some time. My advice is that all of the concerns that the RSL has impressed at various stages of the process have been addressed in the final version of this bill.

These measures have been debated for years. They have been subject to Senate inquiries for years. Everybody well understands what the government is seeking to achieve. Any flaws that have been identified through various processes have been addressed along the way and, of course, the measures in this bill are a reflection of savings measures, which both Labor and the coalition took to the last election and which are now reflected in this bill in a way that both the Labor Party and the coalition are comfortable to support.

Does the minister actually realise it is cost neutral? All that paperwork he has to do on the outside, he could actually save himself the pen and the paper and be representing the veteran in the VRB, so then it is fair game against the other eight or nine lawyers he has against him on the other side. This is not fair.

It was only a matter of a few days ago that the Senate voted to establish an investigation into veterans affairs with particular reference to some of the issues we are traversing here tonight. Senator Cormann would probably be aware, if he had anybody observing the hearing that Senator Siewert and other crossbenchers attended the other day—because you denied this parliament the opportunity for a formal hearing—that these very points that you are making are contested not just by people such as Senator Lambie but those who have been put through the ringer and have had a lot of experience trying to make their way through this system. The veterans compensation system is complex and the

Before any changes to the veterans compensation system are allowed by this parliament, particularly change which veterans and some legal experts are saying will have adverse impacts on the very people that we are trying to help, the findings and recommendations of that Senate inquiry, which has just been put on its feet, should be considered before this matter is resolved.

The single appeal pathway to the VRB brings with it the right for legal aid for veterans with overseas service—deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan—irrespective of a means-test and based on the merits of the case. For the majority of veterans injured during their normal service—that is, non-overseas service—they are highly unlikely to be eligible for legal aid under the respective state and territory legal aid means-test, as the means-test is stringent. Minister, can you explain to me how you have offered them all legal aid and they are all going to be covered legal aid because I am a little confused?

This relationship is made abundantly clear by DVA to compensation lawyers. When we have previously highlighted how hard it is to run cases on the current grant of legal aid, we are told that it is not within DVA's control as it is state government that determines the amount of the grant. So the rights for veterans with operational service, and having gone through the proposed single pathway, the VRB, and expecting access to legal aid, are not enshrined, are they? Clearly, this is not a hypothetical question given what has happened in the recent past. DVA, the

They cannot rely on the goodwill of the state or territory legal aid commissions to fund veterans. That is a straight-out lie, especially when they are subjected to the Commonwealth Attorney-General reducing their annual grants. Who will miss out? Our veterans, not those applying for legal aid for committing violent crimes and needing access to lawyers as a liberty, are at stake. So maybe you can explain to me how all these people are supposed to get legal aid funding, because, by the way, while they are fighting their cases they are broke. They are struggling to put bread on the table for their kids; they are going through marriage break-ups. It is just putting more financial strain on them. So maybe you can tell them out there, while they are listening to us on radio, how you promised to give them a guarantee that they would get legal aid funding.

May I also just clarify that access for veterans to legal aid funding is not only not means tested; it is available irrespective of the type of service that was provided, whether it was service oversees or service in Australia.

That is not a decision that the government makes; that is a decision that is made in the relevant legal aid commissions around Australia, as it is done for everybody else.

We feel sure that retention of this provision is an oversight, and we think, a serious one. S357 provides for award of costs against the Commonwealth in some circumstances, in the event of a decision by the AAT in favour of the Veteran ... we hold strongly to the view that just treatment of Veterans' claims ought not to depend on their ability to meet the costs of access to the ordinary processes that are put in place to deal with those claims.

What you have just read out is evidence that this process works. It is also evidence, Senator Hinch, that this process has been going on for a very long time, because these concerns, which were expressed in September last year, were taken on board by the government, and the amended bill that is in front of us has addressed them. This concern has been removed. Senator Gallagher, in her contribution, also pointed that out explicitly. So this issue was raised. The government recognised that this was a legitimate issue, and we have addressed it by making relevant amendments to the bill that is in front of us.

What we are trying to do here is ensure that resolution of issues for veterans can be done in a less adversarial fashion, at least in the first instance, so that most issues, hopefully, can be resolved in a more informal setting through the Veterans' Review Board. Some issues will not be able to be resolved that way, and that is why the avenue for appeal to the

As a parliament, I think we have done everything we possibly can do to ensure that this measure is in the best possible shape, and I genuinely believe that what we are doing here, if we pass this, is doing the right thing by our veterans. I very much commend this measure to the Senate.

They are absolutely ashamed of you people over there. You need to know that you have Veterans Affairs' executives, the ones who are highly paid, sitting right next to them. Let me get this right: the veteran, because of their physical or mental injuries, does not show up at the VRB. Their advocates, who are probably not trained to be there because they are up against lawyers, are walked all over by those seven or eight lawyers sitting at the other end. And that is it, end of game. Don't you see why they need legal representation, at the very least, in that VRB? Please! What the hell is wrong with you?
