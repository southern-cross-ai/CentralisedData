        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        national platform commits a Labor government to ensuring that disadvantaged schools get the biggest funding increases in the shortest time. Does this government stand by that promise?

         I thank Senator Tyrrell for the question and for her advocacy on behalf of children, particularly those from disadvantaged backgrounds, who require assistance and support through their schooling years. The answer to the question is yes. The Labor Party has through our platform clearly outlined our position on education. We are the party that introduced needs based funding in recognition of students coming from disadvantaged backgrounds, whether that be where they lived, whether they had learning disabilities, whether they came from non-English speaking backgrounds or whether they be
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          First Nations
         </a>
         children. We recognise that the resourcing of those schools needs to accommodate student populations. We have a long and proud history of that. I know that Minister Clare is working very hard in the next round of negotiations with states and territories about how to best meet not only the commitments we've outlined in our platform but the position that the government has taken around ensuring that the education system, mindful of the fact the states and territories have a significant role here and the independent and Catholic sectors also educate large numbers of children and young people, recognises disadvantage and that we try to structure our funding accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also know from my previous role that education funding and how the resourcing is applied is a very contested issue. It's not easy, it's not straightforward, but we remain deeply committed to ensuring that every child, regardless of where they live, where they come from, what their parents' incomes are, get access to the best education possible in this country.

           Independent special assistance schools are a special stream of schooling that exists to provide education to the most socially and economically disadvantaged children in Australia, yet the government's 2023 changes to funding calculations will see their budgets cut. They're not getting the biggest funding increase in the shortest time; they're getting a funding cut right now. How is that not a broken promise?

            I have seen the reports about the situation in Tasmania. I understand that you and Senator Lambie have raised concerns about what is happening under this funding model and how those decisions are flowing on to schools. I also know that you have met with the Minister for Education and that you have advocated on behalf of the Jaqui Lambie Network, on behalf of the schools in Tasmania or on behalf of a particular school. I understand the minister told you that this is a scheme created under the former government. However, when it was brought to his attention about the impacts and how they flowed through to schools, he asked the Department of Education to work towards resolving the issue. This work is happening and he is working with some urgency.

              These schools are really important. My own nephew is on an 18-month waiting list and he had to leave Tassie to go to Victoria to get educated. Schools are making decisions about which staff to let go right now. They are asking you to reverse this decision urgently. I understand we are working towards it but it really does needs to happen toute de suite.

               As I said in my previous answer, acknowledging what Senator Tyrrell has said, I understand the minister is working on taking advice around what to do about this. I don't know the specifics about the funding scheme, but I don't know that it's having the intended—the consequences of how it's rolling out aren't what was intended as I understand it from this scheme.
              </p>
              <p>
               The minister is taking advice. He's had a number of meetings with Independent Schools Australia to understand their concerns about the scheme that, as I said, we inherited from the former government. When a resolution is reached, Independent Schools Australia and any impacted schools will be informed directly.
              </p>
              <p>
               I also understand, from running a school system, that schools will be taking decisions now in the lead-up to the calendar year for the next school year. The minister understands this as well.
