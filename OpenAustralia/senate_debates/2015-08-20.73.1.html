        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to the Minister's denial yesterday that he described his cabinet colleagues as 'gutless'. Given that the footage has run nationally showing the minister saying, 'I think it's gutless that his colleagues leak from cabinet,' will he now correct the record?

          <p>
           I would say to the honourable Senator that it is no surprise that the ABC has clipped and snipped and tried to juxtapose two things in a manner that is not representative. What I said was that those who provide unattributed comments have certain character flaws, and that is what I stand by.

            , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to the minister's interjection yesterday in which he claimed that no-one in this chamber is responsible for the cabinet to leaks. So which of his cabinet colleagues in the House of Representatives is he pointing the finger at?

              , I ask a further supplementary question. I remind the minister of his statement: 'Things are going exceptionally well.' Given that this parliamentary fortnight has seen a divided party room, the cabinet at war with itself, another captain's pick undone, and the leaking of both the cabinet agenda and the party room talking points, does he stand by his assertion that things are going exceptionally well?

               Since the election of the coalition government, in 2013, things have gone exceptionally well for 336,000 of our fellow Australians who are now in employment and would not have been, courtesy of an ongoing Labor government. That is an exceptionally good outcome for 336,000 Australians. What is more,
