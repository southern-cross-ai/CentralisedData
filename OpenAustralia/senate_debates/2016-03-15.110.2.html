        I seek leave to make a short statement in relation to the tabling of the report from the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Heerey" rel="nofollow">

       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 19 October 2015, I appointed former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Judge" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Judge
        </a>
        , the Hon. Peter Heerey AM
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
         QC
        </a>
        , to undertake an independent investigation into complaints about former Fair Work Commission vice-president Michael Lawler and related matters.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 25 February 2016, I informed the Senate that I had received Mr Heerey's report and that, before providing further information to the parliament, I would first afford vice-president Lawler an opportunity to consider it and respond. I set the date of 4 March 2016 for Mr Lawler to provide to me any response to the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 3 March 2016, I was advised that vice-president Lawler had resigned his office to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_General" rel="nofollow">
         Governor General
        </a>
        earlier that day. I accordingly advised the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Heerey has provided me with a considered report that addresses all of the matters referred to in the terms of reference. I would like to place on the record my appreciation to Mr Heerey for his work in conducting the inquiry and preparing the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am conscious of the public interest in the outcome of Mr Heerey's inquiry. The public interest in disclosure of reports must of course be balanced against the public interest in maintaining appropriate rights to privacy, especially when the latter relates to sensitive medical and health information.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accordingly, the version of the report that I am tabling today redacts sensitive personal medical information. It also redacts information that would identify third parties who were not the subject of Mr Heerey's terms of reference.
       </p>
       <p>
        No other redactions have been made, as I consider the material in the report is directly relevant to the terms of reference and that it is in the public interest for this material to be released.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table the report of the Hon. Peter Heerey AM QC.
