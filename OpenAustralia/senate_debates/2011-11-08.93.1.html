        , Senator Wong. I refer the minister to chart 3.42 of Treasury's modelling of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
        </a>
        , which shows that as a proportion of their income Australians in regional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        spend 25 per cent more on electricity and gas than those in Sydney, Australians in regional Victoria spend 30 per cent more than those in Melbourne, and Australians in regional Queensland spend six per cent more than those in Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is the Gillard Labor government making it harder for Australians to live in regional Australia by increasing their electricity bills even further through the world's biggest and most stupid anti working-family carbon tax.

         Unsurprisingly, I do not have the modelling from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         to hand, so I am not going to agree with the assertions that are in there. What I would say in relation to any increase in electricity prices—and the government has said there will be an increase in electricity prices—is that the government is also putting forward a package of reforms to tax, family benefits and pensions, amongst other things, to ensure that working families receive appropriate assistance to manage the impact of a carbon price, including on electricity. That is assistance, I might say, Senator Joyce has signed up to reversing.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to regional Australia I would invite the senator to look at the last budget, where we put out regionally specific information about the spending that the government is putting in place, particularly in relation to hospitals, as well as education and infrastructure. What you will see—it is an embarrassment to the National Party—is that this government is investing more into regional Australia than ever occurred under the coalition. That is even before we include the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         , which is an investment in regional Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         What people will see in the months and years to come is that Senator Joyce prattled on a lot—talked a lot—about regional Australia but did not really deliver for them. People will see that he certainly never delivered for them in the way in which this government delivered for regional Australia. It is very embarrassing, I think, for the National Party; unsurprisingly, they had to put out the coal seam gas discussion thing—

            , I ask a supplementary question. I am aware, Minister, that we are better off—apparently by 20c per week. But the question is, of course: with the extrapolative increase of the cost in regional Australia, is this 20c a week going to be enough to cover people in regional Australia? If it is, can you please show us the proof and what conclusions you base that proof on?

             Senator, the Treasury modelling goes through the whole-of-economy impact and looks at different household types. Cameos are available, from my recollection, from the Treasury website about how different household types are assisted. We are talking about a cost-of-living impact of some 0.7 per cent of the consumer price index. That is significantly smaller than that which occurred when the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
              GST
             </a>
             was put in place, which was 2.5 per cent of

              CPI
             </a>
             .
            </p>
            <p>
             I thank the senator for his concession that some families will be better off, even if he says it is only by 20c a week; I think that is the first time he has conceded that. I would point out that that is obviously an average impact. We have targeted unashamedly the assistance to lower income Australians, to people on lower incomes—to pensioners, disability support pensioners and people earning less than $80,000 a year. So people, regardless of where they live, will get that assistance.

                Given the modelling shows that the hardest hit areas from the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax will be regional Australia, because that is where the mining, the manufacturing and the agricultural jobs are, what has the government got to hide by not releasing any modelling of the impact of a carbon tax on regional Australia? Why won't you be upfront and at least answer one question, something which you have not done thus far?

                    Senator, why don't we have a look at what the mining industry are investing, have a look at how the investment has grown year on year over the last three years, in the context of a debate around a price on carbon. I would probably have a look at where the hard cash is, where the numbers are, rather than rely on Senator Joyce telling everybody that mining was going to—

                       We have released an enormous amount of modelling. The reality is no amount of modelling released by the government will ever alter the position of those opposite, and they should stop pretending to people that they actually care what the modelling says. The modelling says we will have more jobs. The modelling says we will have a bigger economy.

                         I thank the senator for his question. I just indicate to the Senate that, far from seeing the low-carbon economy as a threat, I take the view that this is an enormous opportunity—an enormous opportunity to modernise manufacturing, to refocus manufacturing and to generate jobs for Australian manufacturing. The government is absolutely committed to ensuring we are able to modernise industry in such a way as to produce jobs. The government is committed. This government is committed, as we have seen by carrying the legislation today, to a comprehensive package of measures not just to assist households and communities but to assist industry, to assist workers and to assist regions and to ensure that, through the Clean Energy Future package there is some $20 billion worth of assistance so that our industries are able to modernise, are able to front up to the challenges of the 21st century and are able to secure the jobs for the period ahead.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Our job is to work with manufacturing, and we will. This government will be working with manufacturing to ensure that we have the ability to face up to these challenges squarely. There are phenomenal opportunities. Rather than being a threat, this is a huge opportunity to put Australia at the forefront of economic modernisation. To ensure that we are able to seize these opportunities, the government has provided $20 billion worth of assistance.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Those opposite that campaign against these measures have to also come clean and say they are prepared to withdraw $20 billion worth of assistance from Australian industry, from Australian workers and from Australian jobs. What we have seen here—

                            Absolutely. Universities and research agencies are right on the front line in terms of assisting industry to deal with these great transformations that are facing this country. Scientists in Australia and researchers in Australia can look to the government for a 43 per cent increase in the level of support for science and research. The

                            and all our major science agencies can look to this government for a level of support unparalleled in the history of the Commonwealth. We understand just how important science and research is to develop the capabilities to ensure that we have those high-skill, high-wage jobs in this country, so that we can modernise our firms, so that we can—

                                I am pleased to direct the senator's attention to the Commercialisation Australia grants I have announced this week. These are grants that back up people who want to back themselves. They confirm that Australians are willing to invest in themselves and they are willing to ensure that they have a stake in the future. Green Distillation Technologies from

                                is one example. They are building a pilot plant to turn old tyres into oil, carbon and reclaimed steel. Theirs is the sort of technology looking to ensure that we are able to reduce Australia's dependence on oil imports. We see the sort of technology that gets old tyres out of landfill and into more productive use. That is the sort of message that we want to sell to the world.

                                  I thank the senator for her question. It deals to a great extent with the same issues that her colleague asked previously. As I have explained, the government has put in place a very significant set of assistance whereby nine out of 10 households will receive some assistance through tax cuts or payment increases; about two out of three households will get payments or tax cuts that cover their entire average impact; and about four million households will get an extra buffer with assistance that is at least 20 per cent more than the average price impact.

                                  In addition, there are a range of benefits and opportunities for regional Australia under the package. The Carbon Farming Initiative will enable farmers to benefit. Obviously the carbon price does not apply to agricultural emissions, but there are opportunities through the Carbon Farming Initiative. We are also investing, as the Senate would know, to unlock the potential of clean energy in our regions in solar, in wind, in geothermal—all investments that are about clean energy jobs.

                                   , I raise a point of order on relevance. I specifically asked about the Regional Structural Adjustment Assistance Package. It is on page 59 of the
                                   <i>
                                    Securing a clean energy future
                                   </i>
                                   . I wanted to ask about the modelling that had been done to ensure that $200 million was going to be enough to cover those regions that are acutely affected by the carbon tax.

                                     It is a little embarrassing, isn't it, because there is so much assistance to regional Australia that this government is providing. They do not want to hear about the budget and the investment in hospitals and schools in regional Australia. I thought you represented regional Australia, Senator. Don't you want to hear about the investments there? You want to just ignore them. You want to pretend that this is a carbon price that is being put in without regard whatsoever to over $4 billion being invested in regional Australia—

                                      , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister outline the criteria that would define those regions that have experienced 'acute impact' as a result of Labor's carbon tax? Given the impact of a carbon tax on the dairy industry, for example, will those regions reliant on that industry be able to access this assistance and this package?

                                       There is $200 million of structural adjustment assistance that is available, as the senator says, to support regions that remain strongly affected by the carbon price. This is over and above the very significant assistance that I was going through earlier. I understand this is to be delivered by Mr Crean, but I will check that that is the case and come back to the Senate if that is not correct. I will provide more information. Obviously the bills were passed today, so I am not sure we would have done guidelines on funding in the last hour and a half or couple of hours, but I will certainly come back to the senator if there is—

                                          , I ask a further supplementary question. How does the government plan to monitor the impact of its carbon tax on regional Australia so the assistance package that my questioning has been about can be provided directly to communities in regional Australia? Can the minister guarantee that no Australian who lives in the regions will be worse off as a result of the Gillard Labor government's carbon tax?

                                           I just indicate that I believe that this is a matter that Minister Crean will administer, but I will confirm that. I understand that, in the course of administering this program, there will be monitoring of regional impacts to identify those regions which may require assistance in addition, if I may say, to the comprehensive assistance which is provided through the Jobs and Competitiveness package and the Energy Security Fund. So there is a lot of assistance in place.

                                           I am asked about guarantees. What I would say is this: the senator is actually in a position to guarantee that she will impose a higher cost on the people who elect her. That is the position of the National Party and the Liberal Party. Their policy will, in fact, cost the people who elect them more. To achieve the same environmental outcome, you will have to tax people more and you will have to take back tax cuts and pension increases that the government is funding through pricing pollution.
