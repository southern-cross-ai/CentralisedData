         The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The $1.1 billion announced on 17 October 2011 will be funded under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements (NDRRA). NDRRA funding has been appropriated in the 2011-12 budget and forward estimates.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2). The intent of the NDRRA is to support State and Territory governments in their relief and recovery efforts as well as provide financial assistance to restore essential public assets damaged by an event. This funding is not a new policy commitment.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The Strengthening Grantham initiative will be funded under NDRRA. Funding has been appropriated in the 2011-12 budget and forward estimates.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) A special appropriation was not made for the Strengthening Grantham initiative. Funding was provided under the NDRRA. The Department played no role in identifying Grantham for the relocation initiative.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) The identification and promotion of disaster resilience projects is primarily the responsibility of the State and Territory governments.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
          The Government
         </a>
         has not received any other requests to fund similar projects in other towns under the NDRRA.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6). Refer to answer for question 5.
