         The government, as colleagues would be aware, is committed to reducing the social harm caused by welfare-fuelled alcohol and drug abuse, and gambling, in areas with high levels of welfare dependency.
        </p>
        <p>
         The cashless debit card program we commenced in Ceduna in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         on 15 March 2016, and legislation permits the continuation of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
          CDC
         </a>
         in this site until 30 June 2019. The trial was co-designed with community leaders in Ceduna to best meet local needs. The local member, I should acknowledge—the member for Grey—was vital in getting this card rolled out in Ceduna. Less money being spent on alcohol, drugs and gambling means there is more available to help families pay for the essentials—for food, for clothing and for bills. The effects of alcohol and drug misuse are long-lasting and extensive. Individuals living in families where substance misuse occurs are more likely to come into contact with the criminal justice system, be diagnosed with a mental illness and experience poverty.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the introduction of the CDC in Ceduna, there has been a decrease in alcohol related hospital presentations, including a 37 per cent reduction in the first quarter of 2017 compared with the first quarter of 2016. Monthly apprehensions under the Public Intoxication Act of South Australia were 54 per cent lower between March 2016 and June 2016 compared with the same period in 2015. The number of people supported by specialist homelessness services in the Ceduna region decreased by 42 per cent in the quarter since implementation of the CDC, and I'm sure these are things that all colleagues would welcome.

            has also been operating in the East Kimberley region of WA since 26 April 2016 and the Goldfields region since 26 March 2018. In the current three sites, all working-age welfare recipients are on the CDC program. As at 21 August 2018 there are approximately 5,200 active CDC participants across Australia.

            I'm pleased to report that earlier this week the government passed, with the support of crossbench colleagues, legislation to expand the CDC trial to Hinkler. I again want to thank crossbench colleagues for their support for this measure and their willingness to listen and respond to the Hinkler community. The Bundaberg and

                 Across all three existing sites, and indeed in the fourth site, there is overwhelming community support. In the Ceduna region, in the senator's state of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  South Australia
                 </a>
                 , the local mayor, Allan Suter, has said:

                <p class="italic">
                 It is the best initiative I have seen in this field and it has made our community safer, particularly for families and drinkers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 With the recent expansion of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
                  CDC
                 </a>
                 , it's fair to say that those opposite have given in to inner-city Green-Left perspectives, and they have withdrawn support for further expansions. This is despite communities in the Goldfields and the Hinkler region calling for the introduction of the CDC as a circuit-breaker to the significant social issues that they're experiencing. This government will continue to listen to local communities. This government will continue to do everything it can to improve the outcomes of people who live in those regions.
