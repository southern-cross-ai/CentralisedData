        My question is to Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Does the government believe that exported Australian uranium helps in the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions?

         I thank Senator Johnston for his question. As the senator would know, currently the export of uranium from Australia is permitted, and we have very large exports of uranium. The question of its impact on greenhouse gas emissions around the world is perhaps a separate issue.

           I am not quite sure what the point of the question is. The reality is that there are a number of suppliers of uranium in the world. We sell into the uranium market. We sell in strict accordance with the international safeguards for the sale of uranium. We sell in accordance with those international commitments and we only sell to those who are party to those international arrangements for the satisfactory use of that uranium. The uranium is sold into a global market and our share in that market varies according to the various market factors.
          </p>
          <p>
           Some countries have a need for nuclear energy to meet their energy demands. We as a Labor government in this place have a policy position where we do not support using nuclear power as part of Australia’s energy sources. We will continue to look to use more renewable energy in addition to our efforts to move to clean coal technology. So we do not see nuclear power as an option for Australia, and I think currently that is also the opposition’s policy—but I have been confused in the past as to whether you are pro nuclear power in this country or not. It seems to have gone back and forth.
          </p>
          <p>
           But clearly other countries make their energy decisions based on their own needs. Countries such as France, which has very little alternative, went to nuclear power many years ago. Other countries are making decisions based on their own resource needs. I know China is using a combination of hydro, coal and nuclear and is looking to develop a variety of sources. We sell uranium into those markets. The decisions about what energy sources they seek to use are questions for them. But for us the issue is: we market our uranium and sell into international markets based on strict international safeguards and we will continue to do so.

            and Water, representing the Prime Minister, endorsed the policies of Labor in WA, which include the banning of mining and export of uranium. Given that the former antinuclear activist, the current Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, last week approved of the expansion of the Beverley uranium mine in

            , isn’t this further evidence that Labor is hopelessly divided on the development of a national uranium mining policy and how Australia can contribute to the reduction of global emissions?

             I thank Senator Johnston for his question and his continuing effort to fight the WA state election in the Senate chamber. I am sure it will prove just as unsuccessful as on previous occasions. To correct the record, I actually represented the Prime Minister at the launch, not Senator Wong, but I did have the pleasure of sitting next to her. They chose her as the speaker, though, because she is much more eloquent than me, and she gave a very interesting and encouraging speech.

             national policy provides for states to make their own decisions about how they develop their uranium reserves.

             government take a different view. That is a view that they are taking to the election, and one can at least give them credit for being very clear with the public about their position.
