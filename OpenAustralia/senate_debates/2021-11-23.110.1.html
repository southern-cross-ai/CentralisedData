         The Prime Minister does believe that as we implement the national plan towards reopening, which the Prime Minister took to the national cabinet and worked with the states and territories on to get them to make commitments consistent with that national plan, and as we achieve some of the highest levels of vaccination in the developed world—more than 91 per cent of Australians have now had a first dose and more than 85 per cent have now had a second dose—that we need to work through the different stages in that national plan. The different stages in that national plan chart the course towards normality—normality as it was before COVID.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yes, that's knowing that of course vaccination and differing health protocols will require us to continue to manage and work with COVID. The Prime Minister, I and all members of the government urge every single Australian to go and get vaccinated. That is what everybody should do. But we want to make sure as well that in terms of the cafe owners, small business owners and staff working in retail across the country that all those individuals are respected in terms of the engagement they will have going forward in working in, living and operating businesses in one of the most heavily vaccinated countries in the world. That means that they should be free to operate in accordance with the laws of the land but that they also should be free in terms of not having undue, longer term and more-onerous-than-is-necessary restrictions based upon them in terms of how they enforce operations in their business or what they do in their business.
        </p>
        <p>
         Indeed, that is why the national plan charted those different stages. And as we get the highest possible levels of vaccination in this country we should be looking to move into those final stages. We should be looking at the pathway into those final stages. That of course is the case here in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         , one of the most highly vaccinated jurisdictions in the world, and I have no doubt that is the case we're seeing in terms of where

           As opposed to today, in September Mr Morrison said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … let's be clear about what the plan says. When you get to 80 per cent, what it says is domestic restrictions on vaccinated persons should be lifted. We're not talking about willy-nilly movement of people who are unvaccinated …
          </p>
          <p>
           But now he says that restriction should be lifted at 80 per cent for unvaccinated people to get a cup of coffee in a cafe in Brisbane.

               Obviously, this was a supplementary so I assume the question draws on from the primary question, which was in relation to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                New South Wales
               </a>
               . I note that New South Wales is not at 80 per cent vaccination. New South Wales is at 92 per cent double-dose vaccination and 94.4 per cent first dose vaccination. So New South Wales has indeed well and truly exceeded that 80 per cent target in relation to the national plan. That is why we welcome the fact that the New South Wales government has been able to make further commitments, in terms of reopening, that have enabled us as a Commonwealth government to take additional steps and make commitments in terms of reopening, including our international borders, with the announcements made this week in relation to enabling visaholders to return to Australia. Those steps in the national plan are possible because of the very high vaccination rates that have been achieved—vaccination rates well in excess of what Senator Ayres quoted then.

                  I think, if the senator cared to actually look at what Premier Perrottet has announced in terms of the different steps in relation to
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                   New South Wales
                  </a>
                  , there are indeed further steps in terms of New South Wales's opening up that are being pursued and are being undertaken. That is New South Wales operating in accordance with the scientific evidence of the national plan. This is just it: our government, at every stage, has sought to provide leadership in closing the international borders, leadership in sharing the health advice, leadership in terms of mandating vaccines where they're necessary for the highly vulnerable in aged care, in disability care and in high-care health settings—we've recognised all of that—and also leadership in terms of developing a scientifically underpinned national plan for reopening, which is something very few countries in the world have had the opportunity to do. We have. We did. We are now seeing it implemented, and that is to the great benefit of the Australian people.
