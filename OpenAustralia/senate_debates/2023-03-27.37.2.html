                            Minister, last week the Senate agreed without dissent to the coalition's second reading amendment to the national health amendment bill, which called on the government to urgently intervene to ensure Fiasp remains permanently available on the PBS for the 15,000 Australians who rely on it beyond the six-month funding cliff. Considering this, when will the government announce to these 15,000 Australians that permanent, ongoing and affordable access to Fiasp on the PBS has been agreed to by the government?

People voted for Labor governments because Labor governments are focused on tackling the issues that matter to Australian people. People voted for Labor governments who are focused on their needs as opposed to the internal party fights as those opposite continue to do.

                                            We welcome the Minns Labor government. We will be working with the Minns government, in the same way we work with all state and territory governments, as we address the cost-of-living challenges people are facing as the result of a decade of Liberal and National neglect. We will support all state and territory governments to deliver support for Australians based on need as opposed to the colour coded spreadsheets that the former Liberal-National government relied on. And we will work with all state and territory governments to make Australians' lives better, because that's exactly what Labor governments do.

                                               (—) (): I thank Senator Sheldon, once again, for his very perceptive question about the links between the new Minns government and the Albanese government. The Albanese Labor government has been delivering meaningful outcomes for Australians over the last 12 months. In just 10 months, we've made childcare cheaper, we've made medicines cheaper, we've got an increase in the minimum wage, we've got a pay rise for aged-care workers, we've created 180,000 fee-free

We've delivered so much that I can't list it all in just the minutes I have in this answer. But Australians can rest assured—

                                                 Thank you for the very informative response. Unfortunately, many of the Albanese policies which are designed to tackle the cost-of-living pressures and make Australians' lives better become the subject of political games in this place. What messages does the minister have for those who are putting internal party divisions and political pointscoring ahead of delivering outcomes for Australians?

                                                  I thank Senator Sheldon for his question. I've noticed this issue too, Senator Sheldon. Sadly, many Liberal and National Party members and senators spend their time fighting within their own party. They spend their time seeking to score cheap political points.
