         I thank Senator Reynolds for her question. On Friday we mark
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
          White Ribbon
         </a>
         Day, which is the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
          International Day
         </a>
         for the Elimination of Violence against Women. This year marks the 13th consecutive year that White Ribbon Day has been celebrated in Australia and of the White Ribbon campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the White Ribbon breakfast this morning the Prime Minister spoke of the role that we all have in changing the attitudes that create and sustain the endemic culture of violence that we do see in our community. As he said, not all disrespect results in violence against women, but all violence against women begins with disrespect. I, too, want to acknowledge that there are men in Australia and indeed globally who also are subjected to violence. This can also never be dismissed.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to attitudes, senators will be aware of the $30 million Commonwealth funded, with the states, 'Let's stop it at the start' campaign. This campaign is all about Australians taking personal responsibility by showcasing the links between violence and disrespect. The campaign itself was based on extensive research which shows that when influential adults, whether they are parents, family members, teachers or coaches, say or do things that reinforce the stereotype of disrespect they are listened to and then those things are implemented in some cases by young adults.
        </p>
        <p>
         The three-year campaign is now into its six month and the response has been overwhelming. Between April and June of this year it was
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">
          YouTube
         </a>
         Australia's most-watched advertisement and it has now had in excess of 36 million views. It received the YouTube board leadership award and has been shortlisted for a number of advertising honours. Almost half of influencers have seen the campaign, and the feedback is that those who have seen it have then taken action as a result of the campaign and changed their own personal attitudes.

           Before I do, I would just like to say—and this probably should have been a point of order—that when the minister stood up one of the senators opposite made a highly derogatory comment to the minister about her appearance. I think particularly on this subject on this day to refer to her as a zebra, in fact, is highly inappropriate, as it would be at any time.

And we have implemented specialist domestic violence units and health justice partnerships around Australia which are already assisting 534 clients with 1,400 services.

                   Will the minister please update the Senate on today's announcement of the expanded role of the new eSafety Commissioner and the introduction of civil penalties for non-consensual sharing of intimate images?

                    Minister Fifield and I today announced the appointment of a new Children's eSafety Commissioner, with expanded responsibilities, to take a lead role in combating the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, often known as 'revenge porn'. Online safety expert Julie Inman-Grant has been announced as the new commissioner and will commence in January. The office will also be renamed the Office of the eSafety Commissioner, taking out the word 'children' quite deliberately, because this reflects the office's expanded responsibility for online safety issues affecting adults.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As part of a comprehensive range of measures to combat the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, the commissioner will also now develop a new online reporting tool which will allow victims to report incidents as well as access immediate and tangible support. We are also conducting a public consultation process on proposed civil penalties targeted at both the perpetrator and the host site.
