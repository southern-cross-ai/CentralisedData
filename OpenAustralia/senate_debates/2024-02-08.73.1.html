        When Ella Dixon's parents decided they would emigrate from the Philippines to regional Australia when Ella was a small child, I'm sure they had no idea just how much that decision would shape her life and career in adulthood. That decision, which was the same decision as is made by thousands of migrants every year, was a defining moment in Ella's life, and she has made it her mission to ensure others have a positive experience upon their arrival in Tasmania. For the past decade, Ella has been at the helm of Launceston's Migrant Resource Centre North, shaping the experience of migrants settling in the region and the state. Each year,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC" rel="nofollow">
         MRC
        </a>
        North provides extensive support to around 500 migrants who settle in northern Tasmania. Recently, Ella announced that she would be stepping down from her role, and on behalf of the northern Tasmanian community I want to take this opportunity to thank her for her considerable contribution.

        As I have said in this place before, skilled migration is good for regional communities, and I'm sure the northern Tasmania community has grown in diversity and productivity as a result of the large numbers of migrants who have moved to our state to work and to raise a family. Their positive transition to life in Tasmania has been made smoother as a result of the lived experience, passion and empathy of Ella Dixon. Ella had an extensive career in the public service prior to joining MRC North. She will now move on to her new adventures, but I have no doubt that Migrant Resource Centre North will continue delivering that same incredible support and service to the migrant community under the guidance and leadership of the new
