         I thank Senator Reynolds for her question. The Turnbull government is committed to countering violent extremism in our region. Our overseas development assistance is a very valuable tool in this regard. Recently we announced a new policy development approach to countering violent extremism, which will act as a very good guide in the delivery of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ODA" rel="nofollow">
          ODA
         </a>
         as well as assist us to make better decisions in this area to ensure that the ODA that we deliver is appropriate and targeted at times when it needs to be delivered in sensitive ways.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are currently supporting
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVE" rel="nofollow">
          CVE
         </a>
         initiatives in Indonesia, in Pakistan and in the Philippines. Violent extremism in our region creates major problems. It harms our regional security; it undermines our efforts to support economic growth, stability, and poverty reduction; it disproportionately affects developing countries, with serious economic consequences; and it prevents the participation of women in society and in decision-making. Of course, it exacerbates conflict and undermines the ability of those people seeking to deliver humanitarian and development assistance. Australia has also been a strong advocate for changes at the international level so that we can ensure that our overseas development meets the contemporary challenges the world is now facing. We supported the changes in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         rules which make non-coercive efforts to counter violent extremism eligible for being counted as overseas development assistance. We have also endorsed

            I thank Senator Reynolds. We have increased our support to international mechanisms. For example, we have given $3 million to the Global Community Engagement and Resilience Fund since 2014 to strengthen resilience against violent extremism; we have contributed to the establishment of a Commonwealth secretariat
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CVE" rel="nofollow">
             CVE
            </a>
            unit, with the contribution of $2.5 million; and we are promoting new ways of cooperation, including through a global counter-terrorism forum. In this financial year, for example, Australia will provide funding in practical ways in our region, for example, to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asia_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
             Asia Foundation
            </a>
            , to conduct research on developing best practice to better guide our aid and our aid spending on CVE in the Asia-Pacific region, and also other small-scale funding to discrete, carefully targeted CVE projects in Asia.

              <p>
               Developing countries are the hardest hit by violent extremism, and indeed over 95 per cent of terrorism related deaths have occurred in developing countries over the past 15 years. The promotion of stability in our region is at the heart of Australia's overseas development assistance. It is important that violent extremism undermines our basic development goals. It harms economic growth because it means that fewer people can escape poverty in those countries. It prevents women participating fully in society. It destabilises governance efforts, complicating the delivery of services on the ground. It facilitates the illicit movement of drugs, money and arms, thereby weakening security in those countries. It means that development agencies cannot do their work on the ground. And, of course, it contributes to political instability.
