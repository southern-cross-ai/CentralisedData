           The family law system in Australia has been developed over decades and generally operates effectively in what is an extremely difficult area of law. While all legal frameworks should be subject to ongoing review and reform where the need for improvements are identified, there is no basis for a root-and-branch review of the entire family law system in Australia as proposed by this motion.

           The less adversarial trial—
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAT" rel="nofollow">
            LAT
           </a>
           —approach was introduced into the Family Court in 2006 by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law" rel="nofollow">
            Family Law
           </a>
           Amendment (Shared Parental Responsibility) Act 2006. The enactment of that legislation followed the 2003 House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report and a trial conducted in the Family Court at about the same time, known as the Children's Cases Program. This LAT approach is mandated in division 12A of part VII in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_Law_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Family Law Act
           </a>
           . It applies to all child-related proceedings and in financial matters by consent. The LAT has been a highly significant departure from the traditional adversarial trial.
