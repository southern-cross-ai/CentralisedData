        ator KENEALLY (â€”) (): I rise to speak on behalf of Ali Sina Yousofi, aged 19, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Druitt" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Druitt
        </a>
        in

        , as part of the inaugural
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Voice
        </a>
        in Parliament Week. These are Ali's words:
       </p>
       <p>
        '"What is my vision for Australia in 20 years?" was the question for the speech, but I want to ask those who will implement these changes: "What kind of environment do you envision for your children in 20 years?"
       </p>
       <p>
        'It is hard to envision the future. Maybe I am uncreative, but I know it starts with you and I today. My name is Ali Sina Yousofi and I am 19 years old. I study medical science at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTS" rel="nofollow">
         UTS
        </a>
        and I am a resident in Mount Druitt, New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        'It is fascinating how advantageous it is to be an individual not from Afghanistan in terms of getting a visa faster. It is captivating to witness how long it takes a visa to be granted to someone from Afghanistan but funny how little it takes for someone who is not. It's funny how I was thinking whether I wanted to address the long period it takes to finally be an Australian citizen and enjoy its advantage or whether I wanted to be a voice for my community, whose families' lives are in danger, deprived from basic human rights, and to actually be granted those visas they've been waiting years for.
       </p>
       <p>
        'I wish nothing but for the reconnection of families and loved ones. I kindly ask those in power, who will have a family to go back home to every day, who will kiss their children goodnight every night, to allow my community here the same privilege of having a family to go home to. I am a voice of many and I hope this little voice was heard.'
       </p>

        Thank you, Ali. Thank you for your words today, and thank you for sharing them with this parliament.
