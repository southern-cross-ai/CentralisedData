           The government will not be supporting this motion. We are happy to offer the senator a detailed briefing on the status of cultural heritage reforms if he is interested. We are happy to speak to him about the process that was started by his colleague the former minister for the environment. It is being conducted in partnership with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           organisation that the Liberal Party originally contacted to provide advice, and it builds on a parliamentary inquiry that was chaired by the Liberal member for Leichhardt. This process is in its early stages. We are conducting a thorough and thoughtful consultation. We will be consulting with business, farmers, environment groups and others as we go. Everyone will have the chance to have their say. We do not believe this is an efficient use of departmental and parliamentary resources, when the briefing offer remains open. We're very happy to discuss this situation with the senator whenever he is ready.

            The question is that general business notice of motion No. 296 standing in the name of Senator Duniam be agreed to.
