           The Morrison government is continuing to deliver on its commitment to establish the Commonwealth Integrity Commission. On 2 November the government released exposure draft legislation for the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIC" rel="nofollow">
            CIC
           </a>
           . Nationwide consultation on the legislation will occur until March 2021. The government's draft legislation is properly designed and properly funded. There has been $106.7 million in new funding allocated to the CIC, which will have powers stronger than a royal commission. The CIC will have broad jurisdiction over the public sector, including members of parliament, and will lead Australia's successful multiagency anticorruption framework. By comparison, the Greens' National Integrity Commission Bill 2018 (No. 2) has fundamental flaws that could result in wasteful duplication and individual injustices. The bill was not supported by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee when it considered the bill in April 2019.

              I support this motion concerning the need to create a credible and effective integrity commission. The integrity commission, once established, must offer the features as identified by the Centre for Public Integrity, which I firmly support. I've also had the opportunity to see the government's recently released draft Commonwealth Integrity Commission bill, and I note that in its present state it requires considerable amendment prior to receiving full support.
             </p>
             <p>
              A sound integrity commission would maintain a broad jurisdiction to investigate corrupt conduct within the public sector with strong investigative powers. It should be empowered to hold public hearings whenever it is in the public interest to do so. This is fundamental to the operations of an effective integrity commission. The commission should be able to investigate corruption independently, on its own initiative, even if that's based on tip-offs from the public, and the referral process should be broad. There should be no limitations on the possible findings of corrupt conduct of parliamentarians or public servants. The bill must be able to operate retrospectively so as to deal with recent alleged anomalies in the conduct of persons managing the
