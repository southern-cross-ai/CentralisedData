                   It's interesting that Senator McKenzie chooses to remind everyone of what Mr Morrison was like! But what I would say is this—first, on the tennis. I hope that you are very careful about who on your side has gone to major sporting events, because I can say to you that I remember a lot of Liberal Party ministers with a lot of good hats at the

                      Were that you did ask me that question, Senator McKenzie, because I would have treated that question with some respect. But, no, you want to make a partisan point. You want to make a partisan point about the tennis. Let me say this: stronger futures ended in July 2022. There was no plan on the part of the previous government to manage the transition. We have listened to community and we have provided additional resources to—

                         I'm asked now about the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CDC" rel="nofollow">
                          CDC
                         </a>
                         . I would make a few points. First, in relation to what we are seeing in the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
                          Northern Territory
                         </a>
                         , it is distressing, it is deeply worrying and it is devastating for communities, and that's why we're acting. That is why we're acting. That is why the Prime Minister, after consultation with the Northern Territory government and after consultation with Ms Dorrelle Anderson, has made a decision with the support of the cabinet to provide $250 million worth of additional funding for support. It is a reminder of how much all governments need to do to address the intergenerational disadvantage which we are seeing.
