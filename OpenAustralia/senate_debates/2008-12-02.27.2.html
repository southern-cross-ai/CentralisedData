         Reasons for Urgency

       <p class="italic">
        In the 2008-09 Budget the Government announced the establishment of the BAF, EIF and HHF by 1 January 2009.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        has also announced that these Funds are part of its nation-building agenda to help shield Australians from the global financial crisis.  This package of bills gives effect to those decisions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is highly desirable that this package of bills be passed as soon as possible to ensure that the Government meets its publicly stated commitment to establish and accelerate the implementation of the Funds by 1 January 2009.  Passage of the bills will permit funds to be invested and made available for critical infrastructure priorities in the areas of transport, communications (including the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the bills are not passed in the 2008 Spring sittings, the Funds and their governance structures will not be established, delaying critical infrastructure funding and investment.
