         I thank Senator Day for his question. I congratulate him on his first question and also I thank him for providing me with notice of the question. It was a bit of a bonus receiving a suggested answer as well! I say to Senator Day that it comes as no surprise that you should ask a question about this topic, given your life-long commitment to creating jobs and your concern for the young of Australia, especially of your home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         . As to your list of 12 activities, I think I could tick off about nine of them. I will let you guess which three I am not able to tick off.
        </p>
        <p>
         In direct response to the honourable senator's question, this government is concerned about creating the environment where there can be jobs the young people. So the overarching effort of the government is to create the environment the job creation. The reason for that is that a life on welfare does nobody any favours, especially those who are the recipients of the welfare. That is why the government has adopted recommendations from the former Labor government's review of the fair work laws to clarify the intention of individual flexibility arrangements, to provide more flexibility to workers, to approach their employer and, just so those opposite understand, in Labor's own explanatory memorandum these arrangements were in order to meet the genuine needs of the employee and employer. We did say at the last election that we would not take our policies further than the 38-page policy document and, therefore, we do not too intend to go as far down the track as the senator has suggested.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Given rising levels of unemployment in Australia and, in particular, tragically high levels of youth unemployment in my home state, over 40 per cent in some areas, will the government please allow those young people who want to to opt out of the Fair Work Act and allow them to enter the workforce on their own terms if they so choose?

           There is no doubt that unemployment is a social scourge. What is more, youth unemployment is an even worse social scourge. That is why I can understand Senator Day's concern, a concern I share with him.

                 There was a point of order raised. One of the reasons, Senator Gallacher, we cannot hear ministers answering questions is the noise in the chamber. Senator Abetz was absolutely within the standing orders. He was addressing the question and the microphone was picking up his voice. Senator Abetz, you have the call.

                  . I share Senator Day's concern about the scourge of unemployment, especially the scourge of youth unemployment. The Fair Work Commission is currently undertaking its four-yearly review of modern awards, and I trust the commission will carefully consider the employability of young people.

                  They did show common sense with the after-school minimum hours decision in the retail sector, and I would invite them to also consider their decisions and the impact on youth employment. I also remind the senator that shortly we will have a

                  review into the whole Fair Work regime.

                   , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the clear emergency that now exists with respect to youth unemployment, for those young people and their families who wish to, will the government please allow those young people to fund their own job subsidy by allowing them to work at rates of pay and under terms and conditions which—

                          The Labor Party's reaction to a senator's first question is indicative of the lack of courtesy shown all week during question time.

                          I agree that there is a youth unemployment emergency. I believe that things may get worse, and that is why the economy needs to be fixed. That is why we need to get rid of the carbon tax; to undo some of the damage that has been done over the past six years. In your home state of

                          , Senator Day, and in my home state of Tasmania, the youth unemployment rate is simply unacceptable. That is why we are seeking to build a stronger economy.
