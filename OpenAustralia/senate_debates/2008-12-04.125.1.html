           , I do have a supplementary question to the minister who is responsible for the manufacture of automobiles in Australia. My supplementary question is this: given the 22 per cent collapse in new car sales last month revealed today, what action will the minister take to address the fact that the Green Vehicle Guide, which he seems to know nothing about, is being used by two state Labor governments—

                You would have thought that more attention would be paid, Senator Minchin, to asking serious questions. We now have a situation in Australia where we have a new government with a commitment to the automotive industry, a commitment which has been demonstrated with a $6.2 billion package, a government which has produced the most comprehensive industry package of any government in the history of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                 Commonwealth of Australia
                </a>
                . We have a situation where the industry is facing acute challenges all around the world, and we have acute challenges being faced in this country by the automotive industry, but the truth of the matter is that the automotive industry in this country, despite the constant attempts to denigrate that industry by the opposition, is actually doing so much better.

Given the $13 million grant to Ford for its Geelong engine plant upgrade, can the minister confirm whether the upgraded engine produced there will achieve the 5.5 rating or better on the Green Vehicle Guide website, as required of the Tasmanian and Queensland governments for their car fleets?

                     hybrids and all sorts of things may be interesting but they bear no relevance whatsoever to the specific question about the Geelong Ford engine plant to which the minister has provided a grant. The question related to whether those new engines would achieve the 5.5 rating required by the Queensland and Tasmanian state Labor governments.

                       What I was saying is that the actions of this government have led to decisions and investments in the automotive industry—significant new investments in the case of Geelong Ford, where we now have a situation where the Euro 4 straight-six engine will continue to be built in Geelong, reversing a decision that had actually been taken under your government, Senator Abetz, to close the plant. The effect of this has been to see some 1,300 jobs—

                        , I raise a point of order in relation to direct relevance. A very specific question was asked and that was whether or not the upgraded engine would achieve the 5.5 rating. The answer is either ‘yes’ or ‘no’—or, as I suspect, ‘don’t know’.

                         , on the point of order, notwithstanding that of course the trial has not finished—it will continue on; this is not its last day—what Senator Carr was doing was answering specifically in relation to the question about the Geelong engine plant. That is the question that was asked and Senator Carr was on the point—the quite narrow point—about the Geelong plant. In fact, the previous point of order that was taken was attempting to draw Senator Carr back to the Geelong plant. Senator Carr is on the Geelong plant and I humbly submit there is no point of order.
