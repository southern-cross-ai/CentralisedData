       <p>
        Respect and acceptance have long been core components of Australian culture, regardless of an individual's sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status. Recent events in my home state of Victoria have made it evident that, shamefully, not everyone subscribes to our shared Australian values. Some only seek to disgracefully promote hate, bigotry and division, including some people in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud to be part of a Labor government committed to celebrating diversity. Since coming to government, we have introduced considerable measures to improve protections for trans and gender diverse people in all parts of life, because every Australian deserves dignity and respect. Last year, the Albanese Labor government moved to ensure trans, gender diverse and intersex workers are protected from determination under the Fair Work Act and promote equality of access to the same protections as any other worker who experiences workplace discrimination. We are sticking to our election commitment to platform the voices of LGBTIQA+ Australians in the next census. We also know that LGBTIQA+ have poorer physical and mental health outcomes and face more barriers when accessing the healthcare system. Stigma, discrimination and, at times, violence, exacerbate existing hurdles and make it that much harder for trans and gender diverse people to receive the health care they need and deserve.

        Earlier this month, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldPride" rel="nofollow">
         WorldPride
        </a>
        , the Albanese Labor government unveiled a new national action plan and a $26 million investment towards health equality, Australia's biggest ever investment in LGBTIQA+ health. As part of this momentous announcement, our government will establish an LGBTIQA+ advisory group and ensure that LGBTIQA+ Australians are listened to and included in the development of the national action plan. This government is committed to celebrating difference for all members of our community.
