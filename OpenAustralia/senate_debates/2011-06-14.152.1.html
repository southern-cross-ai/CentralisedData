       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Can breakdowns be provided detailing:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        ;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the current anticipated annual recurrent costs to operate the new detention centre at Northam; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the nature of the work required to be completed to provide accommodation for the 1500 male detainees that the Government has announced are to be housed at the new detention centre at Northam.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) What contracts were formally let for this work as at 28 February 2011.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Is the Northam Detention Centre on schedule to be completed and operational on the date announced by the Minister on 18 October 2010; if not, why not.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) What specific construction work has been completed at the Northam Detention Centre since its establishment as a detention facility was announced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Why was the necessary planning to build a detention centre at Northam not done prior to the Minister making a public announcement on the 18 October 2010 that Northam was to receive 1500 male detainees.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Is it the fact that the detainees destined for Northam will not be housed in the existing army barracks but will be housed in a separate specially constructed camp.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) (a) What is the estimated cost of the construction program as at February 2011; and (b) will additional funds be required to be budgeted for to complete the construction program; if so, how much.

         The Minister for Immigration and Citizenship has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1)    (a) The budget was originally set at $164.5 million but the reduction in client numbers announced on 9 May 2011 is expected to provide savings of about $40 million. (b) There are too many variables to provide an accurate figure on operating costs at this stage.(c) Clearing, site preparation, construction and commissioning.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Contracts were let with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GHD" rel="nofollow">
          GHD
         </a>
         for project management services and with Wilde and Woollard for quantity surveying services. Southern Fencing was engaged to repair the boundary fence.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The completion date announced on the 18 October 2010 was indicative only; completion is currently projected for October 2011. Since preparation for construction began, more detailed studies have identified the extent of bedrock, requiring design alterations. Further design alterations have been commissioned to meet environmental requirements and there will be longer than anticipated lead times to bring services to the site.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) Site preparation including clearing has commenced.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) On 18 October 2010 the Government made a decision to construct a facility at Northam. Until that point the Department did not have authority or appropriation to begin construction preparations. Preliminary site assessments had been undertaken to determine whether a facility could be constructed on the site.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) (a) The budget was originally set at $164.5 million but the reduction in client numbers announced on 9 May 2011 is expected to provide savings of about $40 million. (b) No.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) Single males who would have moved to Northam at the end of March will be accommodated elsewhere across the detention network until the facility is complete.
