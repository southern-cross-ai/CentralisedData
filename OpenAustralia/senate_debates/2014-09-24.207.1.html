         Mr President
        </a>
        , I have three motions of the Procedures Committee to deal with. I seek leave to make a very short statement in relation to the three of them before I seek to formally move them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Mr President. Decisions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Procedure Committee
        </a>
        are a very serious business. It is the internal procedures of the Senate that enable senators to actively involve themselves appropriately in the debates in this chamber and give them the protections and the opportunity to do so. When the Procedure Committee recommends change it is generally after long and lengthy consultation and consideration. The Procedure Committee is of the view that these changes, which I will move shortly, will streamline a number of the internal procedures in the chamber and ultimately will allow more time for senators to participate in debate. As I said, it takes a long time to consult and to negotiate with senators from different parties and on the crossbench to get to a broadly agreed position, and I am happy to say that that is the point where we are at.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have only been the chair of the committee since 7 July, so I particularly wanted to recognise you, Mr President, Senator Parry, for the work that you did over the last two years in bringing these changes together and going through that very tedious time-consuming but absolutely necessary process. On behalf of the Procedure Committee we thank you and I am here to take the glory, so to speak, by moving the motions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The last point I will make is that we do intend to have these as a trial basis, after which senators can consider the results of the changes to the procedures. The Procedure Committee will then review the feedback from senators and make further recommendations to the Senate about the appropriateness to continue with those procedures.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:

           Thank you very much. I appreciate the indulgence of the chamber. I wanted to rise to oppose this particular tranche of changes, particularly subparagraph (f) on the issue of Tuesday nights open-ended adjournment. I think it is a very valuable, and has proven to be a valuable, outlet for senators to express their views on a whole range of issues. I am very disappointed to hear that it is being pushed through over a long period of time. I think it is fundamentally against the interests of the chamber to adopt this. Senators should have the opportunity to speak on adjournment. I think it is a joke to suggest that we have an open-ended adjournment on a Thursday night that is the equal. Many of us have families that we have to return to, and catch planes on a Thursday night. The whole point of Tuesday night is to allow us all to have an equal opportunity. I rarely take the opportunity to speak on adjournment but I actually believe that senators are entitled. We have one opportunity on a Tuesday evening, traditionally.
