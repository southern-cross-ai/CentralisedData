       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There are two supplementary additional estimates bills this year:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation
        </a>

         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        No. 6.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The supplementary additional estimates bills seek appropriation authority from parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        . These funds are sought in order to meet requirements that have arisen since additional estimates. The total appropriation being sought through the supplementary additional estimates bills this year is a little over $390 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Turning now to Appropriation Bill No. 5, the total appropriation being sought in this bill is $250.3 million. This proposed appropriation arises from: changes in the estimates of program expenditure; variations in the timing of payments; forecast increases in program take-up; reclassifications; and from policy decisions taken by the government since the last budget.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I now outline the major appropriations proposed in the bill.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government will provide $34.7 million to the Department of Broadband, Communications and the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The government will provide the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs with $112.6 million. This will provide funding for the Family Support Program and will give organisations earlier access to funds essential to the continued delivery of services under this program.
       </p>

        The government will provide the

        The remaining amounts that appear in Appropriation Bill No. 5 relate to estimates variations, minor reclassifications and other minor measures.

        APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 6) 2011-2012
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Appropriation Bill No. 6 provides additional funding to agencies for:

       <p class="italic">
        The total additional appropriation being sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2011-2012 is $140.5 million, the more significant amount of which I will now outline.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Health and Ageing will receive $119.9 million in this bill. This relates to a re-appropriation of operating appropriation as capital appropriations for

        The remaining amounts that appear in bill 6 relate to estimates variations, minor reclassifications and other minor measures.

       <p class="italic">
        I would like to turn now to the General Drawing Rights Limit for the nation-building funds, which specify the maximum limit on payments from the funds in a financial year exclusive of
