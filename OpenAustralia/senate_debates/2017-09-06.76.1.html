          My question is to the Minister for Regional Development, Senator Nash. Yesterday the minister begged senators to ask her questions about issues important to the Australian people, including, 'What is the coalition government doing to improve energy affordability?' Can the minister confirm that, under the coalition government, wholesale electricity prices have doubled?

           In terms of the specific number, I'm not entirely sure what Senator Cameron is referring to. I am not confirming that. What I will confirm is that it has taken this coalition government to focus on energy reliability and affordability. We have a track record in this area, unlike those opposite. When we look at, say, the Labor state of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           , to see what has happened there on energy reliability and affordability, it is the worst state.
          </p>
          <p>
           I may just run through for those opposite what the coalition government are doing on energy reliability and affordability. We are expanding the

             This is on relevance. I did not ask what they were doing. I simply asked whether it was true that, under the coalition government, wholesale electricity prices have doubled. That is the policy question and the minister should answer that.

              The minister did answer that by saying that she did not have the quantum to give you. So she has answered the question. She has been directly relevant. The minister is enhancing her answer, which ministers are allowed to do.

               Those opposite may know that the Prime Minister has recently met with energy retailers. I must commend the Prime Minister for the work that he has been doing with those energy retailers to ensure that our consumers have the best plans available. Around two million Australians have been contacted or will be contacted to ensure that they are on the best available energy plans.
              </p>
              <p>
               This is in contrast to what those opposite have been doing, which shows an absolute lack of commitment to providing reliability and affordability for the Australian people when it comes to electricity prices. We are putting downward pressure on gas prices. It's taken this government to put policies in place to ensure that we have that downward pressure on gas prices. Unlike when we look at the comments from Mr Butler from the other side, of course, showing the previous track record of the Labor government is less than positive when it comes to gas prices, it is the coalition government that's going to deliver on reliability and affordability for energy for the Australian people.

                 Almost three months ago, the Finkel review recommended the establishment of a clean energy target, a move energy generators say is necessary to reduce upward pressure on energy prices. Can the minister confirm that the coalition government has still not been able to agree on the clean energy target?

                      for her assistance and for being so helpful. I was merely pointing out that, while I'm very happy to take the question, indeed, about an issue that's very important to the Australian people and that the coalition government is delivering a solution for, it's simply not my portfolio. My understanding is that Finkel himself said that the response would take up to six months, and we are on track to do that.

                         I can tell the senator what's important to the Australian people. What's important to the Australian people is making sure, as I've said, that we have affordable and reliable energy. There is probably nothing more important to the Australian people at the moment than knowing that they're going to be able to afford their electricity prices.

                         I'll tell you what else is important to the Australian people—making sure that we've got a strong and sustainable regional economy.

                            My question is for the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Energy. Today the Prime Minister said that there's been 'a colossal failure in the planning of our energy system', and we Greens absolutely agree. It's hardly a surprise when the government's destroyed the long-term price signal; slashed the Renewable Energy Target with the support of the Labor Party, turning away international clean-tech investors; and created enormous uncertainty in the energy sector. Given that Malcolm Turnbull's energy plan now consists of nothing more than extending the life of a polluting coal plant when even its owners want to shut it down, why isn't this just another colossal failure in the planning of our energy system?

It's a report that highlights the fact that those risks have come about because—as indeed Dr Finkel himself highlighted in his work—the stability in the market has been undermined by an excessive reliance on renewable energies and by a loss of those steadying influences of base load power and the way in which they interact with the energy systems.

                             I invite Senator Di Natale to take a look at the AEMO report to actually see very clearly what it says and the indication it makes about the importance of maintaining stability in the system. It's why one of the early recommendations of the Finkel review that this government has acted on is to provide certainty around the closure of major base load generators. It's why we want to keep those major base load generators in the system for as long as possible. So, yes, it is why we want to keep

Its clear preference is an ambitious national plan for more renewables, embracing the modernisation of the grid and accelerating the uptake of new technologies like storage, smart software and demand management. Why won't the government adopt this plan and rule out spending one cent of public money on extending the life of the Liddell coal-fired plant?

When there is a supply shortfall, the consequences for households and businesses are real. Our government is working on the delivery of Snowy 2.0, which can provide reliable energy into the system. But that will take time. It's important that, in delivering these things, we keep maximum reliability in the system, which is where extending the life of something like Liddell—

                                     The potential gap in supply following the closure of the Liddell plant would have been more than filled by renewable energy like solar and wind if it wasn't for the Labor and Liberal parties slashing the 2020 renewable energy target. Given that they created this mess, why won't they fix it by making sure we have more renewable energy in the system and adopting

                                      Base load despatchable energy—base load energy that's there when you need it, as you need it—is not solar and wind, as Senator Di Natale neatly summarised it; that's not at all the case. It is about how you guarantee the energy is there when you need it. For all the good things about renewables, you cannot guarantee solar and wind will be there when you need them.

It certainly won't be fixed by your narrow solutions.

                                            My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Energy, Senator Birmingham. Particularly given your response to Senator Di Natale about a state government who closed down a base load power station and then had to commission filthy, polluting, diesel generating capacity to make up for the shortfall, can the minister update the Senate on what the Turnbull government is doing to put downward pressure on power prices and ensure stable and reliable electricity for all Australians?

                                             I thank Senator Fawcett, from my home town of
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

                                             . As I was just referencing to Senator Di Natale, and it's important to Senator Hinch, who indicated that he wanted to hear the answer, the threat to energy security and reliability in states like South Australia and Victoria—and across
                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

                                             if Liddell were to close—is a real threat. That is why we've been getting on as a government with focusing on how it is we enhance reliability in the system and issues of affordability that flow from that.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             It's why, as a result of the state-wide blackout that our state faced last year in September, we made sure emergency measures were put in place: at least two synchronous generators must be running at any given time, given the unreliability that comes from the wind generators within the system in South Australia. It's why we've also taken action to ensure that a new generator-reliability obligation is in place to ensure that intermittent sources of generation have an appropriate level of backup in place to guard against blackouts. It's why we've taken the action, in relation to energy security obligations, to provide necessary support services around frequency control and ancillary services and inertia—again, to deal with the issues that come from having a higher reliance on intermittent sources of energy rather than on base load dispatchable power sources. We want to make sure as well, as I indicated in my previous answer, that large generators have a minimum period before closure. Ideally, we want to extend the life of those large generators to get maximum use out of the investment, maximum reliability into the system—again, to keep prices down.

                                                  It's remarkable the interjections coming across here from Senator Cameron who seems to be taking great delight in the concept that the Liddell plant might close. I heard Mr Fitzgibbon on radio this morning saying he'd love it if the life of Liddell could be extended; he'd love to see those jobs survive. While he was being cynical about it and while he was saying that he didn't think it could happen, he at least was positive about the prospects of saving those jobs. Senator Cameron seems to be wishing them away even faster than 2022.

At a cost of $110 million, the diesel generators will be fired up using 80,000 litres an hour of diesel—80,000 litres an hour of diesel is apparently what's going to be required to keep the lights on in our home state. That, of course, is not acceptable. It's why as a government we're investing in smart solutions, sustainable solutions, long-term solutions and making the market—
