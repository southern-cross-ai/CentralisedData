        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. I refer to the Attorney-General's decision to wait three days to advise parliament that the Monis letter had not been provided to the

         Thank you very much indeed, Senator Sterle. I like having questions from you, Senator Sterle, you are a rough diamond but a gentleman. Senator Sterle, this is the position as I tried to explain to one of your colleagues earlier in the week. On the Thursday of the first week of estimates certain evidence was given to Senate estimates, in particular by a deputy secretary of my department in relation to the so-called Monis letter. On the afternoon of Monday of the second week of estimates I was told by the secretary of my department that it appeared that there was doubt about the accuracy of that evidence, so I immediately asked him to conduct an urgent inquiry within the Attorney-General's Department to establish the facts. He came back to me 72 hours later, early on the Thursday afternoon, and told me that the inquiry that I had asked him to conduct had established to a certainty that the earlier evidence was wrong. I immediately corrected the evidence that had been given. I immediately corrected it by having a written correction actually hand-delivered to the secretariat so as to ensure that the secretariat had that correction in good time for opposition senators to ask me questions about it before the Senate estimates committee adjourned, and they did.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the Attorney-General confirm that since coming to government you have defended the rights of bigots, spent $15,000 on taxpayer-funded bookshelves, forced the communications minister to clean up your metadata mess, forced the foreign minister to clean up your

              You have given me a lot of material to work with, Senator Sterle, but let me focus on the last, because that is far and away the most important thing you have said. The parliament was misled. The parliament was misled by the Deputy Secretary of my department on the Thursday of the first estimates committee and by me, inadvertently. And when the fact that incorrect evidence had been given to the Senate committee on the Thursday was confirmed, I immediately corrected the record, as did she.
