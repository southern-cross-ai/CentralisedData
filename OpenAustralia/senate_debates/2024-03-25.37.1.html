        I rise today to speak about my friend Sue Rees, a woman who has spent years creating opportunities for girls and young women in Tasmania. I first met Sue while I was at high school when she tutored my year group in deportment and social skills—yes, I do remember walking with a book on my head! I was so pleased to hear that Sue was awarded a much-deserved

        Deportment might seem an old-fashioned concept in today's world; however, Sue Rees has helped prepare thousands of women and girls to approach life with confidence, through almost 50 years of mentoring. Sue's deportment and modelling classes go beyond what it means to wear the latest styles or walk a certain way. Her students, including my daughter, leave her courses standing taller—literally and figuratively—and striving for even bigger life goals than they previously imagined. Her aim has always been to help young women reach their full potential, after experiencing similar training and encouragement herself.

        A model throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Sue took the opportunity to combine her love of modelling and travel with small business and purchased the Phyllis McDonald Deportment School in 1975 and later changed it to the Sue Rees Modelling and Deportment Academy. Besides the deportment and modelling classes Sue has run for nearly five decades, she has organised hundreds of fashion shows, judged Fashions on the Field events throughout the state and served as state manager and national director and producer for Miss Teen Australia. Further, Sue initiated and coordinates a strong support and networking group for women known as the

        and is also a board member of the Tasmanian Turf Club and has previously worked in business development and guest relations at Country Club Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations, Sue, on being awarded for your outstanding contribution to our community. I, like so many other Tasmanian women, thank you for your life's work and dedication.
