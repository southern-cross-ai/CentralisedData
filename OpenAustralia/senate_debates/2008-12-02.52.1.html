        The review of the Defence Annual Report is an important task and an opportunity for the defence subcommittee to inquire into a broad range of Defence issues as part of the process of accountability of government agencies to parliament. The defence subcommittee takes this responsibility very seriously.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This year, the defence subcommittee selected a broad range of issues for examination at public hearings held on 10 July 2008 and 29 August 2008. The major topics included the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Topic two JSF examines the Joint Strike Fighter (F35); the background of the project, the progress to date and cost estimates. The issue of future air combat capability was also raised with the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        The committee would like to thank all of the individuals and organisations that participated in this review of the Defence Annual Report 2006-2007. We would also like to express our ongoing appreciation to the men and women of the ADF for the outstanding work that they continue to do in Australia and around the world.

        Finally, the committee would also like to thank the families for the support they provide and the sacrifices they endure, to enable our service men and women to contribute to Australia’s security.
