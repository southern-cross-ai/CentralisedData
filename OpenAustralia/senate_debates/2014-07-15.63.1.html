           What I would say in response to Senator Bullock's question is that this government absolutely supports the consumer protections that matter to consumers. What we do not support is the additional unnecessary red tape, which pushes up the cost of advice for consumers and which was imposed on consumers and on small-business financial advisers at the behest of union-dominated industry funds. In all of the submissions to the Ripoll inquiry, which looked at Australian financial products and services, there was only one submission that recommended, for example, this requirement that clients of financial advisers should keep re-signing contracts to their advisers on a regular basis. And guess who that was? Guess who made that recommendation out of more than 400 submissions? It was Industry Super Australia. And guess what? After Industry Super Australia was successful in convincing Minister Shorten to impose that additional bit of red tape, guess what else they negotiated?

             They negotiated a carve-out for themselves from the exact same requirement. Small business financial advisers have to comply with a bit of red tape that was imposed on small business financial advisers at the behest of industry super, and industry super gets themselves a carve-out from that exact same requirement so that they do not have to comply with it. They are providing advice, general and personal advice; they are charging for that advice without disclosing how much they are charging; they are not allowing people to opt out of that advice and they are not required to impose opt-in. What we are saying is cut the red tape that is unnecessary, keep the consumer protections that matter, keep the requirement to act in the best interests of the client, keep the ban on conflicted remuneration—

              , I ask a supplementary question. I refer to comments this morning by Naomi Helpern, one of the victims of the Timbercorp collapse, who said, 'We know of about 300 people who are poised to lose their homes. Many more will go bankrupt and others will be left in crippling lifelong debt. And that is why it is really important that these dilutions to the FoFA reforms are disallowed.' Minister, is Naomi Helpern right?

               I feel for this lady and I feel for any victim of bad financial advice. But guess what? You can impose as much red tape as you like. That is not going to prevent crooks from being crooks. We have to ensure that we have a robust but efficient regulatory system in place. We have to ensure that we have a system where people can have access to high-quality financial advice they can trust and which is affordable. We have to take action whenever things happen that should not happen. We have to make sure that we fix problems as they emerge. Even the toughest bit of red tape is not going to stop somebody bad from doing something bad. That is the big lie that the Labor Party is propagating. They are trying to use the cover of these sorts of events to essentially—

                , I ask a further supplementary question. Given the overwhelming opposition to the government's plans to water down the reforms by consumer groups and victims of financial advisers, does the minister agree that these regulations have left customers more and not less vulnerable to dodgy financial advice?

                 No, Senator Bullock, I do not agree with that. The government is keeping all of the consumer protections that matter. After things like the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storm_Financial" rel="nofollow">
                  Storm Financial
                 </a>
                 collapse, after some of the events that Senator Bullock is talking about, there was actually a bipartisan inquiry which was chaired by Mr Ripoll—a good man and now the shadow minister for financial services, but a good man nevertheless. It was a bipartisan committee with a bipartisan set of recommendations. We supported all of the recommendations that came out of that inquiry. But Mr Shorten, as the Minister for Financial Services in the last Labor government, thought that he should go a couple of steps further. He thought that he should go further than what was recommended by the Ripoll Inquiry because he was being pushed into doing so by the vested interests of industry super funds. This has got nothing to do with trying to prevent further victims of bad financial advice. We are keeping the improvements that matter. We are keeping the requirement to act in the best interests of clients. We are keeping the ban on conflicted remunerations. What we are getting rid of is all the bad red tape which does not make a difference.
