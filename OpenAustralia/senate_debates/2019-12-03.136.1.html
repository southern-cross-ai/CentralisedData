         Australian Government
        </a>
        welcomes the Committee's report and its recommendations to support the responsiveness of Australia's regulatory system to the needs of the digital economy, and the cyber resilience of Australia's trade-focused business sector.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
         The Government
        </a>
        supports the direction of all the recommendations, noting that work is already underway to address them.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises that new technologies are transforming Australian industries, workforces and communities. Our ongoing success depends on our ability to harness technological advances to improve existing businesses, create new products, services and markets, and enhance daily life.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also recognises that a cohesive and coordinated approach to digital economy policy is necessary to enable businesses and citizens to take full advantage of an increasingly globalised and digitised world. This is why the Government released the digital economy strategy, Australia's Tech Future (Rec. 3 of the Committee's report) on 19 December 2018.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government developed Australia's Tech Future in consultation with a wide range of businesses, community groups and academics, integrating input and feedback from agencies responsible for issues related to the digital economy. There is substantial work on the digital economy occurring across all sectors, including trade. The digital economy strategy will improve the coordination and cohesion of digital economy policy and awareness. The Government will continue to work with key stakeholders, including state and territory governments to discuss, coordinate and collaborate on activities to strengthen Australia's tech future.

         The Committee
        </a>
        recommends that the Australian Government as a matter of priority, creates a single portal of information, with particular regard to exporting digital goods and services, including information about the development of digitally native processes.

        The Australian Government supports in principle this recommendation.

        The Australian Government notes that a single portal of information for businesses already exists ­business.gov.au. The portal is a trusted one-stop shop for small business with relevant links to specific exporting information (Austrade), customs information (

        The Government will consider expanding trade-related information on business.gov.au to include exporting digital goods and services.

        <i>
         Recommendation 2
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4.76 The Committee recommends that the Australian Government, as a matter of priority, creates a single window trading system, with particular regard to exporting digital goods and services. This single window must be developed with a focus on interoperability to ensure rich data flows can be maintained and transmitted across borders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports in principle this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government is already committed to a single window through its obligations under the World Trade Organisation Trade Facilitation Agreement, which entered into force in
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        February 2017. Australia already has a "customs" single window, the Integrated Cargo System (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICS" rel="nofollow">
         ICS
        </a>
        ). The ICS enables electronic reporting of legitimate physical goods that move across Australia's borders.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Department of Home Affairs is leading an agenda to transform and modernise trade that flows through Australia's international supply chain (e.g. air cargo, sea cargo and international mail). This agenda aims to create a future international trade system for Australia that is seamless, digital, interoperable, automated and user-friendly. This system would be underpinned by an enhanced single window for international trade for physical goods only.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As digital goods and services are currently not subject to customs treatment at borders, the ICS and future single window are not relevant to digital goods and services.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4.78 The Committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to take future workforce needs into account in Australia's education system, from school through to tertiary education.

        The Australian Government is committed to ensuring Australia's education and training system remains well-functioning in supplying industry skills needs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia already produces a wealth of reliable information about the labour market and takes account of this when shaping policies, including education and training policies, to reduce skills imbalances.' The Australian Government is developing a framework for forecasting long-term skills needs including digital skills, to help prepare Australians for the changing labour market.

        As part of the Australian Government's More Choices for a Longer Life Package announced in the 2018-19 Budget, the Government is investing $17.4 million over four years into the Skills Checkpoint for Older Workers Program (the Program) to provide up to 20,000 eligible Australians aged 45-70 with advice and guidance on transitioning into new career opportunities.

        The Program uses individually tailored assessments and referrals, to provide workers with advice on how best to use their existing skills in the workforce, or identify opportunities for upskilling. It can also refer participants to educational and training opportunities to assist with transitioning to a new role in their current industry or switching to an entirely new career. From 1 January 2019, older Australians are also able to access up to $2,200 (

        4.81 The Committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to support a permanent moratorium on duties for data flow.

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government supports this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It has been the Australian Government's long-standing position to support a permanent moratorium on customs duties and to advocate this position in the WTO. Australia views the WTO moratorium on customs duties on electronic transmissions as applying to all goods and services transmitted electronically, and we do not see any benefit in WTO members applying customs duties on these. Any move to apply customs duties would increase the costs of goods and services purchased online and may act as a disincentive for business and consumers to engage in e-commerce.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government believes the moratorium acts as a driver for growth in e-commerce as it maintains liberalising trading outcomes and provides predictability for businesses and consumers. This supports our ambitious trade agenda and ensures Australian businesses have the opportunity to access key international markets.

        The Australian Government supports in principle this recommendation.

       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government understands that adopting a technology neutral approach to policy and regulations will enable businesses to adopt approaches that best suit their business model and consumer preferences. It will also ensure that regulators can readily respond and adapt their oversight to take account of innovation and development of new technologies.

       <p class="italic">
        For example, in data policy, the Government is committed to ensuring that all new systems adopted by its agencies "support discoverability, interoperability, data and information accessibility and cost effective access to facilitate access to data." This is reducing barriers to data sharing and access.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government will continue to address barriers to the digital economy through our trade agreements and our engagement in international fora. This includes pursuing trade rules that facilitate e-commerce and promote data flows across borders (including by limiting data localisation requirements), while providing adequate protections for consumers and ensuring sufficient public policy space.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In doing so, Australia will also continue to emphasise the importance of technological neutrality and interoperability including, for example, in developing rules on electronic authentication, electronic signatures and legal frameworks governing electronic transactions (as noted in the response to Recommendation 6 above).
