        The bill gives effect to measures in the 2007 Budget to provide extra assistance for certain older Australians, carers and members of the veteran community. The first and second measures involve one-off payments being made to certain older Australians and certain carers. The third measure provides a one-off compensation payment to certain veteran and civilian prisoners of war interned in Europe during

        or their surviving widows or widowers. The fourth measure increases the amount of funeral benefits payable in respect of veterans. The fifth measure increases the rate of veterans’ special rate and intermediate rate disability pension. The sixth measure extends backdating periods in relation to war widow/widower pensions.
