        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGowan" rel="nofollow">
         McGowan
        </a>
        has betrayed Western Australia by backing the Albanese government's radical shake-up of the industrial relations system. Mr McGowan should be telling Mr Albanese and Minister Tony Burke that they should immediately exempt the mining and resources sector from this disastrous legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr McGowan knows that Western Australia relies on this sector like no other state in the nation. He made much of how this sector kept Australia afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Western Australians accepted being cut off from the rest of Australia for so long because they knew how important it was to keep the mining and resources sector going throughout COVID-19. Mr McGowan, as we know, loves the revenue as well as the jobs this sector provides for WA. In fact this year's WA state budget highlighted the huge contribution the sector makes to WA coffers, with a cumulative contribution of $12.58 billion, and the sector provides over 65,000 direct full-time jobs in Western Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr McGowan needs to take note of the recent comments made by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
         BHP
        </a>
        Chief Executive Mike Henry, who said there is no case for multi-employer bargaining in the mining industry. Mr Henry quite rightly points out that the current approach in the industry has been working well, and workers in the industry are paid well. He also says, and he is right when he says, Australia's global competitiveness will be harmed by aspects of the bill that risk flexibility and give rise to increases in industrial action. Then we have the

        boss, Simon Trott, who says the legislation will be a handbrake on mining and the wider economy and a handbrake on economic growth, productivity and wages. Mr McGowan should stand up for Western Australia and our mining and resources sector and condemn this radical legislation.
