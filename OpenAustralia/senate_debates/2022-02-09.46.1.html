        On 1 February last year Burma's pathway to democracy was abruptly interrupted by a military coup. Australia has always maintained, publicly and privately, its very serious concerns about the coup. We've done this directly to the regime, in ministerial meetings and embassy statements, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Asia_Summit" rel="nofollow">
         East Asia Summit
        </a>
        and at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Human_Rights_Council" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Human Rights Council
        </a>
        . By the end of last year there were 65 calls from our foreign minister to international leaders. We've suspended Australia's limited bilateral defence cooperation arrangements and redirected our development assistance away from regime entities. We've contributed $25 million to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on disaster management. We've provided COVID-19 support to the tune of $6 million and a further $4½ million to support other infection-control initiatives. Australia's funded humanitarian partners are working diligently to ease the pain that now is afflicting many Burmese people.

        If the
        <i>
         Economist
        </i>
        magazine is to be believed, there's room for optimism. In its most recent edition, it said the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Unity_Government" rel="nofollow">
         National Unity Government
        </a>
        has:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … taken pains to show that it is listening to its critics. It is stuffed with young people and ethnic minorities, and says it makes decisions by consensus. It has symbolically repealed the constitution, which was enacted by a previous junta in 2008, and promised to forge a federal state and to grant Rohingyas citizenship …
       </p>
       <p>
        as well as to approach these future matters in a conciliatory and inclusive tone. There is much to be optimistic about with regard to Burma, but thus far the ASEAN process has not lived up to expectations. My strong view, having spoken to many Burmese people across our country, is that Australia must maintain its vigilance. Australia must maintain a strong voice in making sure that everything is done to free Burma of this military regime.
