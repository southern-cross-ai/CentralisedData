        I would like to take the opportunity to note that that was perhaps the last contribution that we might hear in this place from Senator Storer. I know it's just a little over a year that you've been in this place, Senator Storer, and perhaps you haven't grabbed as many headlines as other people who sit down at the end of the chamber. However, while I wish you had voted with the Labor Party on every occasion, I think it's really important to note that your contribution to this place has reflected an incredible work ethic and a genuine and professional manner of communicating with all of your colleagues. Your thoughtful contributions to debate have really added to the work that we have done here in the Senate. Your final speech, still doing the work, standing up for what you believe in and putting forward your thoughts as part of the national debate for the historical record of the nation, is worthy of comment. I think you have been an embellishment to the chamber in the time that you've been here, and I wanted that recorded and noted.
