        My question is to the Minister representing the Assistant Minister for Education, Senator Payne. Can the minister advise the Senate what the government's reaction is to the Auditor-General's decision to examine the former government's Early Years Quality Fund?

         I particularly welcome this question from Senator Eggleston. The government itself also absolutely welcomes the Auditor-General's decision to go ahead with an examination of the Early Years Quality Fund, the EYQF, because another independent report that will really show the absolute disgrace that the EYQF was will be very beneficial for the Australian people. It was a $300 million fund to supplement the wages of long day care workers for two years. But what might not be immediately apparent to everybody is that the way Labor designed the EYQF was that only 15 per cent of childcare staff in Australia would be eligible—15 per cent. So, in

             Let me just say that again: there are 1,348 childcare centres in the entire state, and only 26 in line to receive EYQF funding. It has every hallmark of every Labor initiative—poorly planned; poorly executed. So, after we came to government, PricewaterhouseCoopers undertook an independent review of the EYQF. They found that it was never going to achieve its objectives. Quite simply, it was a tool for United Voice. Now, there is a surprise—a tool for the trade union movement! There were claims of inappropriate behaviour by United Voice, including things like staff in centres being told by union reps that unless they joined the union they would not get EYQF funding, and they would be letting down everyone else at their centre—that is the way they work in the childcare sector. The Auditor-General has extensive and appropriate powers. He can access documents and information which were not available to the PwC review, and I look forward to the tabling of that report in the spring session.

                 Be careful what you wish for, Senator Sterle! It is obvious to everybody that across the sector there is very broad support for the nationwide standards of excellence and improved recognition for the crucial role the sector plays in developing our youngest Australians. But you cannot take on reform like the National Quality Framework, the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NQF" rel="nofollow">
                  NQF
                 </a>
                 , and not back it up. You have to have solid and complementary policies. You have to recognise the issues that are facing the industry today, and you have to take it to where it needs to be tomorrow.
                </p>
                <p>
                 When you misspend government funds, like those opposite were so expert at doing, it means that parents and childcare centres have to come up with the difference. Surprise, surprise, that drives up costs for families. In fact, under the previous government, the chamber might be interested to know that across the country childcare fees went up by 50 per cent during Labor's six years in office. For some people, that was around $70 a week. That put child care out of reach of very many young families. It impacts on our productivity.
