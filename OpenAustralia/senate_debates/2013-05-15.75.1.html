        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Wong. The minister would be aware that market reaction to the budget was negative with the Aussie dollar quickly falling half a cent within a few hours. It slipped below 99 cents. I ask whether the minister is aware of this comment by

             Last time I looked, Senator Macdonald, the rating agencies were relevant to the market and the question was about the market. Senator Sinodinos's questions are far more sensible than your interjections. I will talk a bit longer if you would like, because I love it when you try and shout me down. I will keep talking. In terms of the structural budget position, I look forward to the coalition abolishing one of the so-called great policies of the Howard government era which is the baby bonus, which was trumpeted by those opposite but of course does continue to detract from the structural position of the budget. They oppose the budget's previous savings measures because the member for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
              North Sydney
             </a>
             was rolled by Mr Andrews. As yet, we have not heard from them what their position is, so I look forward to their response on that issue. Of course another important structural save—which is contributing to disability care—is the means testing for the private health insurance rebate, also opposed by those opposite. If they want to fund disability care, I look forward to them telling Australia what they will cut instead.

              This budget further weakens key vulnerabilities of the Australian economy in the eyes of the ratings agencies. It attacks one of our perceived historical strengths of ‘high fiscal flexibility’ and pushes us closer to the edge of the

Page 31 of Budget Paper No. 1 says the government's medium-term fiscal strategy is to achieve budget surpluses on average over the medium term. How can the Australian people trust the government, given that the government is expected to deliver large budget deficits for seven consecutive years?
