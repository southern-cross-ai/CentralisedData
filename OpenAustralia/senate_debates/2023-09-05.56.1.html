        Last week, I had the pleasure of visiting Emerald Secondary College in Melbourne's beautiful outer-eastern suburbs. Close to the iconic

        line, Emerald Secondary is a fantastic campus with several hundred students. I spoke with the year 11 and 12 legal studies classes about their curriculum, including my work in the Senate, how laws are made and the ever-fascinating Senate committee process. We spoke about how, in a year when Australians will vote on the referendum to enshrine an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament, the legal studies classes have a unique opportunity to experience democracy in action. The students' curiosity about the referendum process and the Voice to Parliament proposal was great to see. For a senator, there is nothing better than seeing our young people engaging in government and democracy, even if most of them can't vote yet. I also want to give a shout-out to the Parliamentary Education Office. On my visit to Emerald school, I took some of the resources provided by the Parliamentary Education Office, including a set of mini Constitutions as well as books which step out what the Senate is and what we actually get up to in this place. I can report back that they went down a treat, in particular the mini Constitutions, which I was surprisingly asked by the kids to autograph. You never knowâ€”perhaps one day they may be worth something! Good luck to the year 12 legal studies class at Emerald, who are now only days away from the beginning of their exams. The advice I gave them as they finish their formal school journey is a philosophy I've mentioned a few times in this place: you're never too old to learn new things, and take every opportunity in life that comes across to you. Thank you again to the Emerald school for having me. I look forward to coming back to catch up again soon.
