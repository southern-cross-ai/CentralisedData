        My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        . It relates to the provision of infrastructure to support youth diversionary programs to combat petrol sniffing. Can the minister inform the Senate whether the government has allocated or plans to allocate resources for youth programs and infrastructure for those communities in the northern part of the central region who have recently become part of the rollout of Opal fuel?

         As I recall this program, we initiated that in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
          Alice Springs
         </a>
         and there was a plan to roll that out further in relation to Aboriginal communities. The extent of the Opal fuel initiative is one that I will check on and get back to Senator Siewert. It is something that we are concentrating on because it is very important in relation to Indigenous health and the prevention of substance abuse.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think there was a report recently which dealt with the prevalence of petrol sniffing and substance abuse on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APY" rel="nofollow">
          APY
         </a>
         lands, which may be what Senator Siewert is referring to. Opal unleaded fuel is applied to 16 communities in these lands and has played an important role in reducing petrol sniffing in the region. A recent health survey shows more than a 80 per cent reduction in the prevalence of petrol sniffing across the APY lands since the last survey in October 2004. That is certainly a positive indication but not something that we take as being the final answer. There is still work to be done in relation to this issue. The survey highlights the fact that only a few school-age children have been experimenting with petrol sniffing since October 2005. That is a positive indication because it demonstrates a lack of uptake—that is, new entrants, if you like—into the cohort of young people who are petrol sniffing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Certainly the government is committed to a long-term approach to addressing petrol sniffing. A total of $91.2 million has been provided over five years to tackle this very issue and $42.7 million of this funding will be used to support the continued rollout of Opal fuel. Already 69 remote Indigenous communities across Australia are using Opal fuel and 24 roadhouses and other participants are supplying Opal fuel, which is of course a very important aspect when you consider the geographic locations of these outlets. If there is anything further I can add to that I will advise the Senate accordingly.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. I am particularly interested in the regions where the Opal rollout has been recently expanded and the infrastructure there. I would like to follow up by asking a question about the current situation in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
           Alice Springs
          </a>
          both in terms of the easy availability of premium fuel and in terms of what diversionary programs are being made available within the town and the town camps. Is the minister aware that Aboriginal youth are still buying premium unleaded fuel directly from some petrol stations in Alice Springs? What is the minister doing to ensure that there are some stringent provisions in place for the purchase of premium unleaded and that service stations are accountable for inappropriate sales of premium?

           </a>
          </small>
          <p>
           In relation to that second part of the question, premium unleaded fuel and diesel will still be available in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Springs" rel="nofollow">
            Alice Springs
           </a>
           . We have asked fuel companies to take steps to secure premium to ensure that it is not misused and certainly the government would encourage all Alice Springs residents to support the rollout of Opal fuel and to recognise that it is safe for vehicles that were designed to be driven on regular unleaded fuel. In relation to the expansion of the program, I understand that the new region in the East Kimberley and the expanded Central Desert region will also get access to the various components announced in the 2006-07 budget measure, which involved just in excess of $55 million.
