        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Cormann. Following the disastrous result for the Liberals in the Victorian election, Victorian shadow Attorney-General John Pesutto said, 'My advice to our federal colleagues is, if you haven't already had enough lessons, you ought to look at Victoria and learn the lessons that we're seeing tonight.' Has Mr Morrison heeded Mr Pesutto's advice? If so, how?

         I thank Senator Singh for that question. I've got to say that I'm touched by how concerned the Labor senators appear to be about the welfare of the Victorian Liberal Party. It's good to see that a Labor senator from Tasmania is out here expressing her concern about the future successes of the Liberal Party in Victoria. Let me just say, as I said in response to a number of questions earlier, that of course we always very carefully consider the results of elections around Australia, including and in particular the election on the weekend in the great state of Victoria. Of course we will carefully consider the lessons learned. We are very conscious of our responsibility to the Australian people to win the next election to continue to implement our plan for a stronger economy and more jobs, which will help ensure that families around Australia have the best possible opportunity to get ahead, because we understand that the alternative is the disastrous, recklessly high-taxing, antibusiness, politics of envy, socialist agenda of Mr Shorten, which would make all Australians poorer, make Australia weaker and make it harder for Australian families to get ahead. We take our responsibility to be competitive at the next federal election very seriously indeed. Of course we will consider very carefully what the Victorian people told us on the weekend and we will make judgements accordingly.

           Hopefully the government is learning the lessons outlined by John Pesutto. One Liberal source has described the Victorian election result as a bloodbath, warning that it was a shot across the bow for the federal Liberals and that 'if the Feds continue meandering they will suffer the same fate'. What action will Mr Morrison take to ensure his government stops meandering and avoids the fate of the Victorian Liberal Party?

            I'm not surprised that Senator Singh is asking me about the Victorian Liberal Party. She wouldn't want to ask me about the Tasmanian Liberal Party, because of course at the last election that the Tasmanian Liberal Party competed with the Tasmanian Labor Party—I'm just trying to remember what happened—that's right, the Hodgman government was returned. I think the Australian people can see what is happening here. We've got a Labor Party that is getting increasingly cocky. We've got a Labor Party that believes they've already won the next election. I would just gently remind you of 2001. We will do everything we can to be in the strongest possible position to win the next election. Talking about people taking views in relation to political parties, we know that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
             Paul Keating
            </a>
            has no confidence in Mr Shorten, because he is quoted as saying that Labor has lost the ability to speak aspirationally to people and to fashion policies to meet those aspirations. Of course that is absolutely right.

              Former Liberal Vice-President Greg Hannan has said, '
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
               The Liberal Party
              </a>
              needs to focus on voters and stop focusing on itself.' When will the Liberals stop fighting amongst themselves and start fighting for Australians struggling with cuts to services, spiralling costs of living and stagnant wage growth?

               When it comes to the economic record, what I would point out again is that Labor in 2013 left behind a weakening economy, rising unemployment and a rapidly deteriorating budget position. Today our economy is stronger, our economic growth outlook is better, employment growth is much better, unemployment is well below where it was anticipated it would be, wages growth has started to pick up and the budget is in a stronger and improving position. It is no wonder that Labor had to give this question to a senator from Tasmania, because they had run out of senators from Victoria to give questions to. Where is Senator Marshall talking about unity and cohesiveness inside political parties?
