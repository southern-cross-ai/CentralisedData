         Thank you, Senator Hutchins. It is such a good question, you will probably get more before you leave. The federal government returned fairness and balance to the industrial relations landscape in Australia when we introduced the Fair Work Act. We introduced that act after lengthy consultations with all industrial parties because we understand that the industrial relations system must provide a fair framework for both employers and employees. The Fair Work Act provided a balanced framework for delivering fair and productive workplaces, and at the heart of the system is enterprise bargaining based on the principle of good-faith negotiation. I am pleased that thousands of employers and their employees are getting on with the business of bargaining under the Fair Work Act.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a party fails to bargain in good faith, both the union and the employer can ask Fair Work Australia, the independent umpire, for assistance in dealing with a bargaining dispute. In stark contrast, the legislation being introduced by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government seeks to undermine the checks and balances this government put in place and to deny public-sector workers the rights enjoyed by all other Australian workers. Their bill seeks to treat those government workers in New South Wales as second-class citizens.

             Liberal Party bill requires New South Wales Industrial Relations to enforce government policy declared by regulation relating to wages and conditions of employment not just for New South Wales public-sector workers but for a broader definition including teachers, nurses and firefighters. While the current focus of the bill is on capping pay rises, it allows the government to unilaterally set the wages and conditions of all its public-sector employees. It reduces the independent umpire to a rubber stamp for the government wages policy, regardless of what the policy dictates. New South Wales workers will be second-class citizens with no rights to an independent umpire.

                New South Wales
               </a>
               legislation is likely to be in breach of a number of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILO" rel="nofollow">
                ILO
               </a>
               conventions, because it denies employees the right to collectively bargain, the right to participate in discussions about their conditions of employment and the right to access an independent tribunal. The fact that the New South Wales bill provides that wages can be determined unilaterally by government and imposed on workers would seem to be a clear breach of those conventions.
              </p>
              <p>
               Labor understands that both good-faith bargaining and access to an independent umpire are fundamental components of a fair and balanced system of workplace laws, features that have long been at the heart of Australian industrial relations systems. The New South Wales legislation fails this test. For thousands of New South Wales workers there will be no sitting down at the bargaining table. There will be no opportunity to argue their case on its merits before an independent umpire. They will be second-class citizens denied basic industrial rights as a result of the New South Wales legislation.

                 , but I must say that, until today, those opposite have been silent. This is the first time we have heard from the coalition on this legislation. If the coalition were genuine, they would be expressing their concern about what Premier O'Farrell is doing. They would be standing up for hardworking Australians, defending their rights to be part of a bargaining process and defending their rights to have access to an industrial tribunal.
