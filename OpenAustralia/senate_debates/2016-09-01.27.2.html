               industry super fund and what it has done with the case of a deceased young fellow who would not have had his claim paid. That is why I am moving to have life insurance in this and to have an inquiry into that very issue. I have crossed the floor before. Senator Dastyari is aware of that. You would not come with me in June last year—the 24th, I think it was—Senator Dastyari; probably you were lacking leadership from Beijing or something and that is why you would not join me in that appeal. For years I have stated where I stand on this: I want a royal commission. But let us have a proper royal commission not a cover up royal commission. That is the point I make and that is why I will not support this motion now.

                    The government does not support a royal commission into the banking and financial services sector, because a royal commission would not benefit consumers or the Australian economy. Whilst the government has proactively sought to reform Australia's financial sector, Labor when in government sat idle and oversaw scandal after scandal. In fact, most of the notable scandals and collapses happened on Labor's watch, when the Leader of the Opposition was the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, including financial planning scandals at the

                       Just in support of this motion and in response to Senator Williams, I say that we are joined today in this place by a number of victims of bank scandals—victims of the financial services industry. I have just spent an hour with these people—they join us here in this chamber—listening to how their lives have been affected and to how they seek the response that only a royal commission can give.

                       And only a royal commission that you, Senator Williams, have been arguing for, for some time. The response from the government has been completely inadequate. Listen to the stories of those people whose lives have been affected, whose houses have been lost, whose retirement savings have vanished, whose businesses have folded and who have been arguing for years—eight to 10 years, for some people—for some sense of justice. This is what this motion seeks and that is what a royal commission will find.

                          Under the Constitution, the Australian government has responsibilities for the regulation of both banking and insurance. I want to point out to the chamber and especially to you, Senator Williams—I first, of course, recognise that you have called for a royal commission into financial misconduct for some time, and I respect that—that the banks are now vertically integrated. If we have an inquiry into the banking system, that includes the insurance markets. Most banks own financial services companies, including insurance companies. So the motion put by Labor I support, because it will encompass the areas of your concern. As far as forestry managed investment schemes go, those of us who were on the inquiry who recommended for a royal commission—that would also encompass the banking system, because the banks finance the finance companies and places like Timbercorp. They are all included. I would urge you to support this motion today.
