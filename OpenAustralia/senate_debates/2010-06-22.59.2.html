         I indicated that we would oppose this matter. I still maintain my opposition but recognise that I do not have the numbers in the chamber, so I will not be calling a division in respect of it. I also recognise that it is preferable to losing a Wednesday morning; so it is best I say no more.

            Regardless of what the honourable member has to say, it would have been appropriate for us to be told about this happening tonight. We presumably do not have the numbers to alter it, but I think it would have been more appropriate, if the issue is considered important, if better notice were given to the Senate than this ambush motion that we are facing now.

             Could I clarify a couple of comments made by Senator Brown and indicate the reasons. This matter was listed for tomorrow, and there was some suggestion that we would be taking up time tomorrow, an hour and a half of government time, although we were giving it back at the end of the week. If we did not debate this tonight or tomorrow, the matter would not have an opportunity to go to the House of Representatives and then be returned to us. There would not be time for the House of Representatives to consider the matter.
            </p>
            <p>
             In relation to Senator Brown’s specific matters about lack of consultation, we did not realise this course of action was going to be open to us until just after question time. I did phone Senator Siewert. I understood that you were all in the party room. I was directed from Senator Siewert’s office to Senator Ludlam’s office. I spoke to Senator Ludlam’s office and got provisional agreement. I then spoke with Senator Ludlam when he arrived in the chamber a while ago. Senator Ludlam, in fairness, indicated he was not supportive of this taking place in any event but if it was a matter that was going to take place he would wish to speak to the motion. This is the only way we can fit this in this week and that is why we have done this. We gave the Greens as much advance warning as we gave the government and as we had ourselves. You will probably see that I have just hastily written out the notice of motion that I have just read to the chamber. With those words, we are assisting the government to facilitate their business time during the week and we want this to be debated. We understand that the Greens do not want it to be debated, but we gave them as much notice as possible about the intention to debate this matter this evening.

                     Senator Brown indicated that he had not been informed; he may not have been.

                     were notified as soon as we possibly could; it was not an ambush in that sense. Then I had the courtesy to speak to Senator Ludlam about this also. So I wish to place that clearly on the record: it was not a nonconsultation; there was consultation with the Greens.

                        Senator Brown used the word ‘consultation’. Senator Parry, being told a couple of minutes before the vote is put that you have the numbers and that it is going to go ahead with or without us is not consultation, in my book. Regarding comments about not wanting the debate to be had, I will cover very fully in my comments, if and when this vote is put and the debate occurs, exactly why I believe the debate is occurring at the wrong time and for the wrong reasons. I will save those comments for then. Telling us that you have the numbers and that it is going to go ahead is not consultation, in my view.
