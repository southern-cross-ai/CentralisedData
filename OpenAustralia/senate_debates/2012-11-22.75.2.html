        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Bob Carr. Given the minister's extensive dealings with foreign heads of government, does he agree that a head of government can create a climate that is conducive to corruption, through their choice of ministers and a lack of diligence as the custodian of ministerial probity?

         I am delighted to answer the question, and I thank the senator for it. I do not know as a general rule, but I can only speak about my 10 years heading a government in

         , during which time I can assure the Senate that there was never a single finding of lack of probity or propriety against me or my ministers—not one. Moreover, there was not even an allegation in all those question times over 10 years—all those question times in the bearpit of the New South Wales parliament, regarded as the toughest in Australia. There was not even from the state coalition in opposition all those years, day after day of question time, a single allegation against me on the grounds of probity or propriety.

           , I rise on the point of order to make the point that the question, in my view, did not actually go to the minister's responsibilities as the Minister for Foreign Affairs in this chamber and if the opposition seek to use question time to try and smear people, rather than direct questions on policy to the minister, they will get the sort of reply they are getting.

                I might say the senator over there was making a grovelling apology for inaccuracies she relayed to the Senate. She got up yesterday to do it and I have never seen a more grovelling or embarrassing apology from the senator there: 'Oh,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
                 Mr President
                </a>
                , I'm sorry I said this. Oh, I got this wrong. Oh dear, I got this wrong.' I didn't even read her speech, so goodness knows what other inaccuracies would come to the surface if anyone actually read it.

                   , my question was very specifically in relation to if Minister Carr were asked a question by a foreign government, in his capacity as foreign minister, as to whether he would vouch for the integrity of those he chose. Would he do so? Mr President, people who have served as ministers in government, state and federal, do not cease to exist. They engage in business activities and not-for-profit activities, in Australia and around the world, and it is quite probable that the foreign minister would be asked about the integrity of these individuals at some point by foreign governments.

No wonder they got him to ask it after her performance yesterday, when she had to back off and apologise and withdraw. I might say, Senator, that I accept your apology. Because it was given with a teary-eyed regret, it would be ungallant of me not to.

                       , I was providing some background observations to the Senate because I cannot see how it applies to my portfolio. I have had many discussions with heads of state and heads of government, and in all these discussions Australia's reputation as a place of good governance has been reinforced implicitly and sometimes explicitly. I think all senators can unite in pride at the reputation that this country has for good government. That is my best effort to relate that jumbled and muddled and embarrassing question to any matter I have dealt with. But I do hope that questions continue to be as well researched and as tested by the Leader of the Opposition—

Or would it be more appropriate for the foreign minister to stand aside until corruption investigations into the government he led are concluded lest foreign governments question the seriousness with which the Australian government views allegations of corruption in public office?

                             , I have a point of order on relevance. The question to Senator Bob Carr was very specific as to whether he felt that his role as Australia's face to the world was compromised by the fact that ministers in his government are currently being investigated by the
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_Commission_Against_Corruption" rel="nofollow">

                             . Australia seeks to advise foreign governments in relation to corruption issues, and they quite rightly look to how the Australian government deals with allegations of corruption and how seriously it takes them.

                              There is no point of order. The minister is answering the question. The minister has 19 seconds and, as I said at the outset, the minister needs to respond to the question in so much as it applies to the portfolio.
