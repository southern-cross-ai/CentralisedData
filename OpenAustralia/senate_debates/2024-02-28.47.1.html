        This weekend is the Dunkley by-election. The loss of Peta Murphy has been felt deeply in this place. Peta left a great legacy behind. She was a champion of her local community, and I'm so glad I've had the opportunity to spend time with the wonderful Jodie Belyea, who is working so hard to continue that Labor legacy in her own way. Jodie is a fantastic woman. She's a fighter for her community. She's lots of fun and she is a Frankston local through and through.

        passed our cost-of-living tax bills last night and from 1 July, every single Australian taxpayer will receive a tax cut, including 70,000 taxpayers in Dunkley. The teachers at

        will get a tax cut. The retail workers at

         Bayside Shopping Centre
        </a>
        will get one too. Every single worker will get a tax cut on 1 July. Importantly, this includes every single woman workerâ€”100 per cent of taxpaying women across Australia, including 100 per cent of taxpaying women in Dunkley. We are delivering better outcomes for women, something that I know Jodie cares about so much. Her good friend Peta Murphy did too. Dunkley, I know that Jodie will be a fantastic local member and representative for you. She cares for her community and she's willing to fight for it. Jodie, we are so excited for you. I know that you're going to make us all proud.
