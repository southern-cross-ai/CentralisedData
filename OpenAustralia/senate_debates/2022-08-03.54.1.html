        Before I start, please note this is not my first speech. I rise to express my support for the Uluru Statement from the Heart and to express my support for voice, for treaty and for truth. I acknowledge the Ngunnawal and Ngambri elders and knowledge holders who have paved the way for those here now, for those proudly following in their footsteps and for those yet to come as custodians and owners of country. I also acknowledge that my home and electorate office in

        The Uluru Statement from the Heart calls on all of us here elected to this parliament to rise to the moment to accept the hand stretched out to us by the

        people. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's history-making speech on Saturday has given us a path to approaching this work with humility and hope. Like our Prime Minister I believe there is room in the hearts of Australians for the Uluru Statement from the Heart.

        voice is simple. Let's engage in good faith. Let's live to the Australian values of decency and fairness. A constitutionally enshrined voice to the parliament is significant and practical reform to get long overdue outcomes for First Nations people. This government is looking to bring people together, not to divide them. A First Nations voice on First Nations matters. It's not that difficult. It's not too much to ask for. It's the least we can do. This work will help to close the gap and make our nation stronger. It's time to get this done together.
