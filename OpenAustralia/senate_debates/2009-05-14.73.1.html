        Section 53 of the Constitution is as follows:

       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Powers of the Houses in respect of legislation

        53. Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate

        may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.

       <p class="italic">
        The Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.

       <p class="italic">
        The Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Except as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The effect of these amendments is to enlarge the class of persons who could receive increased compensation. The amendments are covered by section 53 because the amendments could result in an increase in the amount covered by the standing appropriation in section 90D of the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988.

        The Senate has long followed the practice that it should treat as requests amendments which would result in increased expenditure under a standing appropriation, although this interpretation is not consistent with other elements of the established interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution. This has nothing to do with the introduction of bills under the first paragraph of section 53.

        If it is correct that these amendments increase the number of individuals eligible for death benefits payable from standing appropriations, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that the amendments be moved as requests.
