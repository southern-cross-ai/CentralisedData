        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Minister Ludwig. Can the minister please outline to the Senate the importance to trade of Australian agriculture? Can the Minister inform the Senate of any recent examples of the government's strong trade practices?

         I thank Senator Furner for his question. Australia is a great trading nation. We do have a proud history of trading in agricultural products on the world stage. Last year, Australian farmers exported $30 billion worth of products all around the world. Australian products are world class and Australian farmers are world class. That is why we compete in the global market. The best interests of Australian farmers who want their products being brought to market all around the world are served by ensuring that international trade is open and equitable and is enforced. Australia's membership of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WTO" rel="nofollow">
          WTO
         </a>
         , a rule based global-trading regime, has been at the heart of our success as a trading nation. The enforcement of WTO rules has benefited Australian agriculture products and producers right across.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is worth noting that, through a science based import risk assessment, the Howard government approved the importation of pig meat from all countries into Australia, salmon from all countries into Australia and table grapes from the United States and Chile into Australia. Through the WTO, Australia has had many wins, including improved market access for lamb in the United States, removal of unfair beef imports and marketing practices that impacted on Australian exports to Korea, which paved the way towards a fourfold increase in beef exports and improved market access to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
          EU
         </a>
         for Australian sugar which, the Aust­ralian Sugar Alliance commented, 'demon­strates WTO rules do work'. The Gillard government strongly supports the Australian farmers, growers and producers and their ability to sell products right around the world. This means the government will always support sensible policies that protect Australia's biosecurity and also protect Australia's ability to participate in the global market.

           may be interested to know that there is much support for Australia's strong trading relationship—an active role in the

           Ms Julie Bishop, the shadow foreign minister, said on 19 August to the

           We remain committed to the WTO rules-based framework to Australia honouring its inter­national obligations. I am going to ensure that we don't deviate from that.
          </p>
          <p>
           Despite this support, there has been no shortage of attempts by the Liberals and the Nationals to risk Australia's trading relationship and risk the livelihood of the very farmers they are supposed to represent. The most recent of these was the ill-conceived and protectionist bill prepared by Mr Cobb that could have put at risk $110 million worth of sugar we send to

             and not simply close the shutters between Australia and the rest of the world. It is clear that the biggest risk to Australia's agricultural trading relations is the Liberal-National party coalition. There is nothing more that the self-professed weathervane will not sell, including Australia's farmers and industry. Nowhere is this more starkly apparent than with the palm oil issue. The position of the opposition on this matter would see $150 million in compliance costs on industry. This cost is borne by industry and it would be to the benefit of only Mr Abbott's cheap political stunt. That would add to the regulatory burden of the industry. For Australian farmers, growers and producers, the most troubling aspect of the opposition's position is that, if passed, it could be—
