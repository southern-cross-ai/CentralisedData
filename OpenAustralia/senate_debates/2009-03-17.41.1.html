        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. I would like Senator Ludwig to explain to the Senate how the government’s workplace policy, and particularly the unfair dismissal rights it contains, balances rights in providing greater security for employees and flexibility for employers.

         I thank Senator Pratt for her excellent question. What the Rudd government stands for are fairness and flexibility for Australian workers and employers, unlike those opposite. We are balancing the needs of employees, unions and employers to ensure that Australia is as competitive and prosperous as possible during these difficult economic times without compromising workplace rights.

             Order! Senator Ferguson has raised 194(1) and 194(2) in respect of the question that has been asked. I rule that there is no point of order. I refer you to the previous rulings that have been given by the chair on this matter. You will find that my predecessors have ruled consistently that there is a fairly liberal approach—if you read
             <i>
              Odgers
             </i>
             , you will find that—to the way in which this has been interpreted. There is no point of order.

              As I was outlining, the Labor government’s approach to unfair dismissal rights includes covering small businesses with fewer than 15 employees, an extended period of 12 months before small business employees can make an unfair dismissal claim and, of course, the development of a small business fair dismissal code. We reject the Howard government’s definition of a ‘small business’—100 or fewer employees—because we are getting the balance right. We are getting the balance right with Forward with Fairness. We are getting the right balance to ensure that employees do have flexibility and fairness in the employment sphere. On 24 November 2007—

                        would in any way mean that a matter relating, for example, to industrial relations or unfair dismissals, as in this case, would not be subject to questioning at question time. What is off limits—and you and your predecessors, including former distinguished President Senator Ferguson, have consistently ruled this—is such matters specifically being addressed. It has always been interpreted liberally—that is, with a lowercase l, Senator Macdonald, not an uppercase L—as long as specific legislation and its provisions have not been referred to. I respectfully suggest that if Senator Macdonald does not know that, and I rather think he would, Senator Ferguson certainly does, because he consistently ruled that for the whole time he occupied the chair which you are occupying now.

                         On the point of order, I make no different a ruling than I did before. My predecessors have consistently ruled on this matter that it is in order for such questions to be asked. And the anticipation rule, if you read

                         . You will find that it is where questions go to specific clauses of the matter that is before the chamber that those questions will be ruled out of order. But, in this instance, it is a general question and I will allow the question to remain.

                          I thank Senator Pratt for her supplementary question. Before the 2007 election Labor published a comprehensive workplace relations policy. We sought and received a mandate for this policy, and now the Liberal Party is opposing it.

                          employees at businesses with up to 100 workers could be dismissed for any reason without any right to challenge their sacking. Now those opposite want to reject that, want to ignore the mandate that was given to Labor to be able to pursue fairness and flexibility in the workplace.

                           , I rise on a point of order. I would ask you to take this matter away and come back with a ruling to the Senate. The minister just then in his answer specifically canvassed an amendment that has been circulated in the chamber, which highlights the points that my colleagues Senator Ferguson and Senator Macdonald made—that the supplementary question was on a specific issue in relation to unfair dismissals. The minister has now canvassed a specific amendment. Surely, that must be out of order, even on Senator Faulkner’s analysis.
