        My question is to the Minister for Defence, Senator Johnston. I refer the minister to the government's unfair pay deal for our service men and women. Given that the Prime Minister has now bowed to public pressure and partially backed down to reverse cuts to Christmas leave, food and motor vehicle allowances, is it not time that the minister picked up the phone to tell the Prime Minister to back down fully and to stop the real pay cut for ADF personnel?

         Given the length and breadth of the mess we are dealing with, can I tell you, we have to keep working at trying to resolve the fiscal position, Senator, which your party bequeathed to us. As announced by the Prime Minister this morning, the government has notified the independent Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal that the changes to allowances are not supported by the government and that they should be discontinued. This results, firstly, from the fact that we have an ongoing good and close relationship with Defence Force personnel. That is something that those over there could never conceive to say because when they were in power all they did was bludgeon them and rip money out of the Defence Force budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         After a long period of discussion with Defence Force personnel, we have resolved to look at mitigating the effects of what has been left to us by the former Labor government. Let me reiterate: the government has been talking to and listening to Defence Force personnel, particularly the lower and middle ranks, and has come to this equitable resolution.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to the fact that almost 60,000 people have signed a petition calling on the government to improve the unfair pay deal to ADF personnel. Will the minister prove that he is a doer and not just a talker and ensure that ADF personnel do not suffer a real pay cut?

I refer the minister to the Prime Minister's press conference when he named five coalition MPs who have lobbied him for a fairer pay deal for ADF personnel but did not name the minister. Given the importance of this issue to ADF personnel, why has the minister not lobbied for a better deal and why was he not invited to the Prime Minister's press conference?

                  In complete contrast to the disconnect in the day-to-day activities in Defence in the previous Labor government between Defence Force personnel and the two prime ministers, I do not need to lobby our Prime Minister. He knows what is going on in Defence, as do I. We work at these issues together and, may I say, we have an extremely good relationship with Defence Force personnel.
