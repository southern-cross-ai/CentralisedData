        asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister in the Senate upon notice, on 9 July 2012:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Are ministers required to furnish the Prime Minister or her department with statements of their interests; if so, when did the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Bob Carr) do so.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) When did the Prime Minister become aware that Senator Bob Carr had retained his shareholding in his private company, R.J. Carr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pty_Ltd" rel="nofollow">
         Pty Ltd
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Has the department been asked to provide advice on whether Senator Bob Carr's retention of this shareholding is consistent with the Prime Ministers Standards of Ministerial Ethics; if so: (a) when was this request made; (b) on what date was this advice provided; (c) what was the advice; and (d) will the Prime Minister make this advice public as per clause 7.4 of the Standards of Ministerial Ethics.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Has the Prime Minister or any member of her staff discussed this issue with Senator Bob Carr; if so: (a) on what dates; (b) what was the outcome; and (c) was Senator Carr advised to dispose of this shareholding or that he could retain this shareholding.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Did a spokesperson for the Prime Minister tell the Australian Broadcasting Corporation
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        program that, Minister Carr has fully complied with all of his disclosure obligations in relation to this matter and that the Prime Minister is satisfied that Minister Carr's arrangements are consistent with the standards of ministerial office; if so, on what: (a) advice; and (b) authority, was this spokesperson acting.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Is the Prime Minister aware of Senator Bob Carr's insistence in the Senate on 27 June 2012 that because this company is dormant his retention of this shareholding is entirely consistent with the standards of ministerial ethics.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) As of 27 June 2012, had the Prime Minister sighted the advice on which Senator Bob Carr is relying; if not, has the Prime Minister subsequently sighted this advice and if so, when.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8) Is Senator Bob Carr's retention of his shareholding in R.J. Carr Pty Ltd consistent with the Standards of Ministerial Ethics; if not, has his refusal to relinquish this shareholding constituted a prima facie breach of the Standards of Ministerial Ethics.
