          Yawurugun Janu buru Rubibi. I am from Broome. Ngayu nilawal Djagun. My name is Djagun. Ngayu Banaga wamba. I am a Banaga man. I acknowledge with respect the traditional owners of this country, the Ngambri and Ngunuwal people, their elders and their emerging leaders and I thank everyone who has made me welcome here.

           Western Australia

          s with dedication and vigour. I come to this upper house, the Senate, very mindful of the traditional role of this place to represent the views of the states. I know that at times our views in the Senate may challenge those of the House. I pledge myself to negotiating any differences with respect and courtesy.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am committed to working closely with our Labor team, led by our leader
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">

           Torres Strait

          and the House are now becoming more representative and inclusive of all the peoples of Australia. It is a positive step along our road to have Aboriginal people participating directly in the process of making Australian law. This was not the case at the time when our founding document, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Constitution
          </a>
          , was drafted. The only two express references in the Constitution were section 127 and section 51(xxvi), and both related to our exclusion—a situation that lingered in the constitutional landscape of this nation until the 1967 referendum.
         </p>
         <p>
          The presence of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Australians" rel="nofollow">
           First Australians
          </a>
          , who occupied this continent for millennia, in this great land was disregarded. Something that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Stanner" rel="nofollow">
           Bill Stanner
          </a>
          in his Boyer lectures referred as to as:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          …a cult of forgetfulness practised on a national scale.
         </p>
         <p>
          Clearly, there is work to be done to address this, with constitutional recognition of the First Australians being an important step in this process. I look forward to the report of the Referendum Council and working with the 45th Parliament on this very important task.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am a proud member of the Yawuru people of Broome. In the Yawuru language from around Broome there are three key concepts from the Bugarrigarra which shape our ways of knowing and understanding. These concepts will inform my work here, as they have formed my being. They are: Mabu ngarrung,a strong community where people matter and are valued; Mabu buru, a strong place, a good country where use of resources is balanced and sacredness is embedded in the landscape; Mabu liyan, a healthy spirit, a good state of being for individuals, families and community. Its essence arises from our encounter with the land and people.
         </p>
         <p>
          These concepts are not newly minted. They come from the time before time began. We call this the Bugarrigarra—from when the earth was soft and yet to be moulded and given its form by the creative spirits. The Bugarrigarraencompasses the time well before Western philosophy, religion and laws existed or travelled to our lands in ships.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 2006, after 12 years of litigation, the federal court recognised the native title rights of the Yawuru, and therein acknowledged the existence of our laws and customs under Bugarrigarrain Australian law. The Yawurunow hold some 530,000 hectares of land in and around Broome. Much of the Yawuruland is held under exclusive native title. Other parts are non-exclusive title. However, native title rights are vulnerable to the principle of extinguishment, which has the effect of returning native title rights to our lands and waters to terra nullius or Crown land.
         </p>
         <p>
          When the Federal Court handed down its determination in 2006, the Western Australian state government appealed the decision. But two years later the full bench of the Federal Court upheld the original decision. During and following the appeal, formal negotiations were undertaken between the Yawurupeople, the state government of Western Australia and the shire of Broome. In February 2010, these good faith negotiations led to a native title agreement signed by all the parties and registered with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Title_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
           Native Title Tribunal
          </a>
          in August 2010.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ILUA—the Indigenous land use agreement—settled some key matters of land tenure and governance for the state and for the Yawuru people. The agreement provides a basis for building economic opportunity in our shared, cosmopolitan world subject, of course, to market factors and opportunities. The agreement-making process and the agreement itself help both communities to face up to the unfinished business of our place, of our country and of our status within the confines of the act. They do not settle, however, fundamental matters of colonisation and dispossession. It is not a panacea, applicable in every case, but shows that local and regional agreement-making is achievable and can be mutually beneficial.
         </p>
         <p>
          It has refreshed our spirit, our liyan. It enabled us to move on from the many mistakes, poor policies, ignorance and outright racism that have bedevilled us in the past. We now come to the table in our own right: respected as legitimate stakeholders, whose rights can no longer be bypassed, ignored or simply extinguished without compensation. It is one model of agreement making I can commend, while recognising such a model cannot be adopted in all parts of our diverse country. Its limitations are that it does not deal with the claims of sovereignty that many Aboriginal people argue has never been ceded or surrendered. The basis for settlement remains contested since the discredited legal fiction of terra nulliuswas exposed in the High Court Mabodecision.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a senator from Western Australia, I will work with my parliamentary colleagues in this place and elsewhere in shaping the social and economic future of our state and the nation as a whole. I am especially focused on the needs of those who live in the regional and remote parts across this great land of ours, particularly in Western Australia. I firmly believe that to be successful in this endeavour we must ensure at all times the full and active engagement of all of our people. I will be working in this place to: make sure that fewer Aboriginal and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
           Torres Strait Islander
          </a>
          Australians are locked up in our prisons; help develop northern Australia, in partnership with regional communities, industries and Aboriginal people; build consensus on changing our constitutional framework, recognising the need for meaningful discussions with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples on a treaty or treaties; and ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians and their organisations are key decision makers and empowered partners in programs to transform the current levels of injustice and bureaucratic domination.
         </p>
         <p>
          In joining my fellow senators, I acknowledge and welcome those of my colleagues who are also new senators. We have become good schoolmates in Senate school. Some, though, have been elected on platforms which I will undoubtedly find challenging. I will not be averse to argument and debate on these issues. This place is, after all, the sanctuary of free speech. The debates will, however, need to be informed by the fundamental principles of respect for the diversity and richness of our various cultures in Australia, and the recognition of our shared humanity. We know, as a fact, that some Australian legislation in the past was founded on outmoded patterns of thought and belief. Our laws have, at times, been based on ingrained paternalism and racial superiority, denying our shared humanity. Such mindsets justified repeated acts of greed that grabbed the lands of our people without negotiation, settlement or compensation—and at times at great human cost, with many lives being taken or cut short. Those laws built bureaucratic systems and processes that controlled the lives of our people; stifling life choices; creating the sorrow, pain and anguish of children ripped from the arms of their mothers.
         </p>
         <p>
          My family, along with most Aboriginal families, carry this pain in our recent history. I was born before the constitutional changes of 1967. I was hiding in the long grass in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
           Northern Territory
          </a>
          town of Katherine and watched my age-mates being taken by welfare and police. In Katherine I also watched in fear as white people were bussed in to the town hall meeting, where they vented their hatred and anger against Aboriginal stockworkers for walking off
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_Hill" rel="nofollow">
           Wave Hill
          </a>
          Station and for demanding justice and equal wages. The Australian law at that time was unarguably founded on a social outlook that was highly ethnocentric, even racist. Many of the laws were genocidal in intent, application and consequence. The same moral compass justified the American laws that mandated racial segregation in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
           US
          </a>
          before the civil rights movement. Such views and laws led to the horrors of Soweto and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robben_Island" rel="nofollow">
           Robben Island
          </a>
          and even the hate crimes of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazi_Germany" rel="nofollow">
           Nazi Germany
          </a>
          . These systems of laws and regulation shared the same legal, intellectual and moral parentage. These laws and regulations cannot be permitted to emerge once more in our precious democracy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our Australian democracy evolves and grows as our nation matures. In times past, people of a different race, a different colour, a different religion, a different sexuality were subjected to exclusion, oppression or discrimination under the laws made in this place. Such laws cannot and must not return to this place. I want to work with all of you in building an Australian nation that is characterised, as it is said in Yawuru, as Mabu ngarrungu—a strong community; Mabu buru—a strong place, a good country in which all Australians of all backgrounds, religions and ethnicities have a life influenced by Mabu liyan—a healthy spirit with the good feelings and sense of worth that comes from mutual respect and balance.
         </p>
         <p>
          All of us, regardless of race, culture or gender, share a strong identity as Australians wanting to build a common, tolerant and prosperous future together. If we work to find what we have in common rather than what divides us, I believe that we can be better people; we can build a better Australia; we can build a better place for the next generation together.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to express my deepest thanks to my family—and some of them are here today—my friends and the many supporters who have assisted me on my journey to this place

I acknowledge respectfully the women who have taken on leadership roles for our people—women such as

         </p>
         <p>
          In closing: I was privileged last month to be at the 50th Anniversary of the Gurindji walk off by the stockmen and their families from Wave Hill Station near Katherine in the Northern Territory. The Gurindji, led by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Lingiari" rel="nofollow">
           Vincent Lingiari
          </a>
          , walked off in protest at poor working conditions and living conditions on the station, but at the core of the strike was a fight for land justice, for equality, for recognition of a people's right to their law, to freedom, to justice and a fair go. Their stance was proudly supported by the union workers of Darwin and by many non-
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians" rel="nofollow">
           Aboriginal Australians
          </a>
          from across Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          When Gough Whitlam handed the title to the Wave Hill pastoral lease back to the Gurindji in 1975, he poured dirt from the country into the hands of Vincent. At the time, Prime Minister Whitlam said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I want to acknowledge that we Australians still have much to do to redress the injustice and oppression that have for so long been the lot of black Australians.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I want to promise you that the act of restitution which we perform today will not stand alone – your fight was not for yourselves alone and we are determined that Aboriginal Australians everywhere will be helped by it.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          All Australians everywhere have been lifted by this powerful moment of moral truth and justice; a moment that made Australia a better place, the kind of country we want to be.
         </p>
         <p>
          Vincent's reply to the Prime Minister was in Gurindji, translated as:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Let us live happily as mates, let us not make it hard for each other.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was a testament to his strength, his resilience and his generosity of spirit. After a century of theft, of violence, of dehumanising exploitation, of structural and institutionalised racism, of a stolen generation policy, genocidal in its intent and its impact, this leader was ready to move forward to build a better place. Vincent held a vision for his people's freedom—a vision based on fair treatment, getting country back and getting people back on country. His vision was for equal wages, for a self-sufficient, independent, economically secure and culturally grounded community free from oppression and degradation. This vision was never fully realised, but it remains a worthy vision for us all.
         </p>
         <p>
          In this Senate, I want to work with my fellow senators to help to build a better country, a better place, a strong, just and inclusive Australia. I look forward to our work together.

             Mr President
            </a>
            , I start by congratulating you on your re-election. I have to say it is terribly gratifying to have a Tasmanian in charge!
           </p>
           <p>
            I a m sure that so many who have gone before me have found it i s an incredibly difficult task to put satisfactorily into words the great honour and privilege it is to be elected to represent one's fellow Australians in this place.
           </p>
           <p>
            We ha ve had a long election campaign and then a long wait for the result s, under the ne w Senate counting rules. I have to be honest and say that it sometimes felt , as I imagine it did for most Australians, like this day would never come. But that long campaign — the endless hours on the road, knocking on doors and getting to know Tasmanians right across the state— gave me the opportunity to reflect on just why I am doing this and what this amazing and humbling honour actually means to me.
           </p>
           <p>
            I come from a spectacular state. I come from a state of which there is much to be proud. As the sixth generation of Duniams living on the remarkable island of Tasmania I have a deep affection for that place and a strong commitment to doing what I can to ensure that its future is strong for the generations that follow us.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Tasmanian people, much like the place itself, are a resilient people. Our state, like many other parts of this country, has been dealt its fair share of bitter blows. But , every time our community is dealt one of those blows, true of the Australian fighting spirit the Tasmanian community picks itself up and works hard to get back on track. In my short life, I hav e seen it many times — where communities pitch in together to h elp out those in need, where no- one is left behind.
           </p>
           <p>
            And we have faced pa rticular challenges in Tasmania, b e it the tragedy that unfolded at
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur" rel="nofollow">
             Port Arthur
            </a>
            in 1996; the 2013 bushfires which devastated t he small community of Dunalley; the sudden and destructive floods we saw across Tasmania during this year's election campaign; or, indeed, in my childhood home on the north - west coast of Tasmania where , one after another , major employers slowly left town. First the Tioxide pigment factory closed. Then the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APPM" rel="nofollow">
             APPM
            </a>
            paper mills were downsized and eventually closed. Each of these closures was bad in itself, taking hundreds of jobs out of our small community, but the direct consequences for so many other medium and small businesses which rely on big factories saw thousands of jobs go.
           </p>
           <p>
            But, every time, the people of my home state always come together, looking at ways to help those in need and ways to redefine themselves so they can take the next set of challenges head- on. It is this resilience, this fighting spirit , of my fellow Tasmanians that inspires me. From some of the most remote and disadvantaged communities to our cities, most people are willing to work hard , and want the best for our state.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want for my three children, now the seventh generation of my family living in Tasmania, and for all of their generation, a future they can look forward to —a future where opportunities exist to do things that previous generations have not been able to i n employment, in education and in lifestyle—a nd a reason to make your life in Tasmania, rather than seek opportunity elsewhere.
           </p>
           <p>
            Tasmani a already has so much on offer: a mazing natural wilderness, including some of the most spectacular fores ts and breathtaking coastlines; world-class produce, like our fish, meat and dairy products, or our increasi ngly famous cool-climate wines; and its innovative people, throughout our multi- campus university, research centres and small start-up businesses. Tasmania already has the critical elements for a strong future and economic growth. The challenge is in harnessing those elements, maximising them and creating opportunities for the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            The key to this—as many in our home state would know—is, in my view, the need to tackle the endless departure of young people from our state to take up life elsewhere. Indeed, we should also be doing what we can to entice back those who have left, and we need to let people from other parts of the world in on the secret. Tasmania is a great place to come and live, to work, to raise a family and to develop your potential.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a father and as a young Tasmanian myself, I see this as one of the key challenges facing our state. One only needs to look at the demography of our state to understand the need to tackle the problem I am talking about. Tasmania has the greatest percentage of people over the age of 65 of any state or territory in the country. Indeed, between the years 2000 and 2015, that percentage increased from 13.5 per cent to 18.3 per cent. By comparison, the percentage of people in Tasmania aged between 24 and 35 dropped by 5.5 per cent over the same period. This leaves that age group the most under-represented in our state by a long shot. These are alarming statistics and only reinforce the need to address this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            If we work to a goal where a greater share of the population is at an age where they will be coming into the workforce and contributing to our economy, we will start seeing an improvement in Tasmania's ability to provide essential services and—dare I say it, for the benefit of my
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Western Australia
            </a>
            n colleagues—help contribute more to the national economy.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I have mentioned, since my endorsement I have had the honour of meeting many compassionate, intelligent and hardworking Tasmanians who, in the course of their everyday lives, are doing their bit to enhance our state's future for the next generation. These people share my desire to see a Tasmania where more young people can and will choose to stay, to find a job, to buy or build a home, to start a business or to raise a family.
           </p>
           <p>
            As I have already said, Tasmanian produce is high quality and becoming world renowned. As a result, the Tasmanian brand carries with it a premium that the world is willing to pay for. Agriculture to our nation is a vital industry, and it is certainly no different in Tasmania. Fundamentally, it sustains and nourishes us. Economically, it is often a major employer in rural and regional communities. It is an industry where there is employment and investment potential, particularly for our more remote communities, which so often miss out.
           </p>
           <p>
            But like so many other primary industries, the real challenge is in trying to find the next generation of people able to take on the farm. The high cost just to purchase a farming operation is something that prohibits almost any aspirational young farmer from getting him or herself onto the land. The exception, of course, is if you are already on the family farm.
           </p>
           <p>
            During the campaign, I had cause to meet with successful young Tasmanian farmer and business innovator
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_McShane" rel="nofollow">
             James McShane
            </a>
            , along with his wife, Tahnee. James was the President of the Rural Youth Organisation of Tasmania and is a strong advocate for the agriculture sector in our state. James and his wife discussed with me at length the need to find ways to get younger people onto the land, and they confirmed that there was no shortage of young farmers wanting to make a start. The key question was: how do we enable these younger people to get a foot in the door and overcome the hurdle of cost?
           </p>
           <p>
            James's suggestion revolved around the willingness and ability of young farmers to consider leasing a farming operation. This would enable young people to get onto the land, start a farming business and work toward eventual ownership of the farm. Simple though it may sound, he also believes there is a need for the government to assist in directing traffic and providing safeguards around such an initiative. I believe this idea has significant merit and would be a positive step in enabling a younger demographic to live in, and contribute to, our rural and regional communities.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to mention another sector of the economy: the manufacturing sector, which across our nation has faced some serious challenges. Competing in global markets is difficult against many low-cost competitors from other parts of the world. Tasmania, like many other parts of the country, has had a strong history in manufacturing. Even to this day, we are still home to some world-leading and innovative manufacturing operations, from the boutique to larger operations with international markets. However, like the rest of the country, we need to compete to survive.
           </p>
           <p>
            I had the good fortune of spending some time with one fellow involved at a grassroots level in the local manufacturing scene in north-west Tasmania. His name was Brett Cleary. Brett indicated to me that he had observed over the years a pattern of local businesses importing components and items for the repair and maintenance of their operations from overseas. This importing took place when items of an identical nature and quality were able to be manufactured right there on the north-west coast and, indeed, at a far cheaper rate than the imports. As Brett explained to me, this happened simply because there was no knowledge of the local option. These smaller local manufacturers had limited means of promoting their wares against larger overseas suppliers. He believed there was a need to somehow promote the fact that local manufacturing options could supply what local consumers were after—right there, on the doorstep, at a competitive price. His suggestion was to facilitate a central point where local manufacturers can link up with local buyers.
           </p>
           <p>
            Of course, a local community is not going to be able to produce everything it needs within that local community, but if there is a chance that it can be done then we should support that and enable local manufacturers to thrive and, in turn, employ local people. By enhancing the chances of local innovative manufacturing operations through simply connecting manufacturers with consumers, we are retaining jobs in our community rather than needlessly sending them elsewhere. This could provide new and sustainable jobs for younger people—jobs that might just keep them in our communities.
           </p>
           <p>
            These are just two examples of suggestions made by other people to me during the election. I am not talking about things that I have come up with or ideas that I have had. I know no-one here has a mortgage on good ideas; no-one has all the answers.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
             If I
            </a>
            thought I had all the answers, I am pretty sure I would be told very soon that I was wrong. This is an illustration of the importance of getting out, staying in touch with our community and understanding what will work to fix local problems. I see the most important part of my role is to listen to my community and to work with them on suggestions and ideas they may have for our future. This is the good thing about a strong community: people can work together, share ideas and reach a good outcome. Additionally, good ideas and good policies do not need to be complex. In fact, it is my belief that they should not be. Simple, practical policies do not have to involve large bureaucracies and mountains of paperwork to actually achieve results. The two examples of great ideas that came from listening to my community are ideas that do not require massive machinery of government to make them work, yet they are ideas I believe will yield great benefits for the community. I look forward to continuing to work with the people I have mentioned and the Tasmanian community on trying to bring to life these and other positive ideas for a stronger future in my home state and other parts of the country.
           </p>
           <p>
            Being able to do this, to take up the ideas of my community in this place and within government, is the benefit of our system of parliamentary democracy. Every day we need to give thanks for the simple fact that we are blessed with free democratic government. Australia is one of the few countries in the world that, since our Federation in 1901, has continuously enjoyed stable and fair democratic government.It is easy for those of us who have known nothing else to take for granted the amazing benefits and freedoms we have living in a democracy.We can have a say over the future of our country. Indeed, it is entirely up to us when we at the ballot box cast our vote on election day.We can openly express dissent in the government.We can form alternative political parties for a specific cause or community.And we can do all of these things without fear of repercussions, punishment or persecution.
           </p>
           <p>
            As is true of many Australian families, my family is no stranger to involvement in democratic institutions. My late grandmother,

            . Sadly, she was unsuccessful but then, perhaps having seen the light, subsequently ran again as an Independent. My own mother, Mary Duniam, is current ly the d eputy m ayor of the Waratah-Wynyard municipality —a force of nature in her own right, supported so wonderfully by my amazing father, Roy.

           <p>
            But , for me, the true value of democracy really only became clear when I met my wife, Anisa, and her family. Anisa's family sought political asylum in Australia having come from Albania, a country that for approximately 46 years was brutally ruled by a communist dictatorship that oppressed its people in the worst of ways. Over the 15 or so years that I have had the honour of knowing my parents-in-law, I have heard firsthand just how evil that regime was and how lucky they feel to be here in Australia, enjoying all the rights, privileges and responsibilities of democracy. Just them saying that to me, and knowing how they cherish those rights, really brings it home.
           </p>
           <p>
            Both of my parents-in-law came from families classified by the regime to be anti-co mmunist and so, of course, the Communist P arty not only viewed all the family members, including the children, with suspicion, but also took any opportunity to punish them. For instance, my wife's maternal great-grandfather, Fran Mirakaj, was ordered to denounce his Catholic faith and instead pledge his faith in the dictator. His refusal to do so resulted in him being tortured to death in ways that do not bear explaining.

           </p>
           <p>
            T hen there is the story of Sute Bashar, my wife's great - aunt who, because of her anti-communist ties, was imprisoned with her three young sons for over 25 years. While Sute eventually was released from political prison, sadly only one of her children joined her in freedom . The other two, too young to express an opinion in any way, never survived the ordeal.
           </p>
           <p>
            I could go on, but the point I want to make is that I draw a true appreciation of democracy from the experience of my wife's family. They fought hard and sacrificed a lot for what we have and , sadly, what we take for granted. This is also a key reason that I identify as a Liberal : the protection of freedoms in our society.
           </p>
           <p>
            Underpinning our strong democracy is a need for respect —respect for one another's views and indeed respect for the outcome of a democratic process. I hope that, with the significant and sensitive debates we have coming up, we can all show respect for one another and our individual views.
           </p>
           <p>
            The values, the views and the priorities I bring to this place have been built around what I have learnt in my life so far. A thoughtful man once said that the seven crimes of modern society were these: w ealth without work ; p leasure without conscience ; k nowledge without character ; c ommerce without morality ; s cience without humanity ; w orship without sacrifice ; and, perhaps above all, p olitics without principle. My own guiding principles come from my own hardworking parents, from the experiences relayed to me by my parents-in-law and from my own personal beliefs and life experiences to date. It is those things that will inform the decisions I make —nothing else and no - one else.
           </p>
           <p>
            No election is possible without the help of many. Across Tasmania and across the nation thousands of volunteers, because of their firm beliefs in the Liberal cause, went out en masse and campaigned for a Liberal victory. I wi ll never forget the support our party membership in Tasmania has shown to me. I a m honoured also that some of those volunteer s have flown from Tasmania to join me today , i ncluding Jim and Judy Bowler, who first helped me out shortly after I moved to Hobart for u niversity by renting me a house. I have to say that I must have ma de a good impression , because they ended up renting their house to five very unruly university students, yet they are still here supporting me today! So thank you. Some of my dearest friends are also here: Nick, Jane and Dan, to name a few. Thank you so much for your unending support.
           </p>
           <p>
            Over the years I have had the opportunity to work with many amazing and committed people : Brad Stansfield, Don Morris, Kate Raggatt and Sandy Wittison , among scores of others I cannot even begin to name today. Their commitment and loyalty to the cause cannot be questioned. These people will remain friends I wi ll have for life , and to them I say: y our invaluable advice and guidance will always be appreciated.
