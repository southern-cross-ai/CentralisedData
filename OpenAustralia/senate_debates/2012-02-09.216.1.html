        <p class="italic">
         (1) Please refer to the 19 October 2011 Supplementary Budget Estimates Question on Notice 17 for a full list of meetings, dates, locations and attendees.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) As stated in the 29 June 2011 Ministerial Media Release on reforms to the Projects of Concern system, the Minister for Defence Materiel conducts the Projects of Concern summits with Defence and company representatives to ensure individuals are being held to account for the progress of remediation efforts. Discussions at the summit cover all aspects of project activity and remediation, and are commercial in confidence.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) As also stated in the June Media Release, an action from each meeting is for the

        <p class="italic">
         (4) The meetings are not held in an open forum. Attendance at each meeting is restricted to Defence and company representatives directly involved in the project. This allows commercially sensitive activities and contract obligations to be discussed freely.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
