        My question is to Senator Evans, the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Australia has a very strong record of working to ensure stability and security in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        . As such, events this week have disturbed everyone in this chamber. Will the minister therefore update the Senate on the security situation in East Timor, given the assassination attempts on President Jose Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao and the present condition of President Ramos-Horta? I note that, with bipartisan support, the government has responded by deploying an additional company of ADF personnel and additional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        officers to East Timor. Will the minister further outline to the Senate the role of our ADF personnel and AFP officers in ensuring a return to order and security in East Timor?

        <p>
         I thank Senator Minchin for the question. I think I speak on behalf of the whole Senate when I say that the events in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         over the last few days are very distressing. The attack on the democratic leadership of that country—the attempt to assassinate its two most senior leaders—makes it a very dark day for East Timor. Both Prime Minister Gusmao and President Ramos-Horta are good friends of Australia, and a lot of senators in this chamber will know them personally and will have worked with them over many years.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australia government is resolute in its support of both the people and the democratically elected government of East Timor at this time of challenge. The Prime Minister has indicated that he will visit East Timor later this week to discuss the situation with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
          East Timorese
         </a>
         government and security forces. It is obviously important that calm prevail in East Timor. To that end, the arrival of Australian police and defence forces should help. I will come back to that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand that President Ramos-Horta remains in a serious but stable condition, and senators would be aware that the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Stephen Smith
         </a>
         , travelled to Darwin on 12 February to convey the Australian government’s support directly to family members of the President.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 12 February, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         deployed a company to Timor-Leste as part of the government’s response to the 11 February attacks on President Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Gusmao. The Army continually maintains a company group ready to move at short notice for such contingencies. The status of this readily deployable company is rotated between different formations at different bases so that troops can be rested. The government is prepared to do what it can to support the East Timorese government. The various contingents of defence and police personnel will assist in restoring stability in that country. I hope that will help see a return to normality and the progress of the East Timorese democracy, which is obviously very important for the future of that country.
        </p>
        <p>
         East Timor is a good friend of Australia and we have got to be a good friend to them. We are hopeful that by our support at this time we can ensure the continuation of peace and democracy in East Timor.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. The opposition supports the government’s actions to date. I note there are reports today that mention criticisms from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
           East Timor
          </a>

           UN

          force immediately following the shooting of President Ramos-Horta. Can the minister provide details on the actions of the UN force in the immediate aftermath of the assassination attempt?

           I do not have a detailed brief on what the actions of the
