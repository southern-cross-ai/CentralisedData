        Response
       </b>
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Presiding Officers are aware of the need for staff of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security to have appropriate security clearances as stipulated in the Intelligence Services Act.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Due to staff movements at the commencement of the 42nd Parliament, for a period of several months the staff dedicated to the committee included only one suitably cleared staff member. Clearances for other staff were completed by August 2008. Currently there are six employees of the Department of the House of Representatives which supports the committee with the required level of clearance and one in the process of upgrading an existing clearance to the required level. All staff dedicated to this committee currently have the required security clearances.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       It is considered that this is sufficient to support the foreseeable needs of the committee and reasonable contingencies. The
       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_of_the_House" rel="nofollow">
        Clerk of the House
       </a>
       advises that the situation will he monitored and, if necessary, action taken to ensure the work of the committee is not inhibited. In particular, steps will be taken to ensure that staff to serve the committee in the next Parliament are identified as early as practicable and any necessary security clearance processes arc commenced at the earliest practicable date.
