        My question is to the minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Senator Cash. I refer to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise that the government would require all Commonwealth-funded projects worth more than $100 million to undergo a cost-benefit analysis. Can the minister confirm that the government has agreed to pay $1.5 billion to the former Victorian Liberal government for the

             East West
            </a>
            Link, I can confirm that the Australian government is investing over $7.6 billion in infrastructure projects in Victoria from 2013-14 to 2018-19. The Australian federal government and the Victorian government signed a national partnership agreement which includes the construction of the East West Link and a $3 billion Australian government contribution to the project. I would have thought that was actually a significant contribution by the federal government.

                   , I rise on a point of order on relevance. It was a very simple question, and the question was whether the minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure could confirm that the money was paid without an assessment of the business case or the project's cost-benefit ratio. That is the only question, and she has consistently avoided that question.

                       , I ask a supplementary question. I ask the minister again: did the government agree to pay the $1.5 billion without a business case for the project or a cost-benefit analysis? I note that the project will only return 45c to the economy for every dollar spent. How can you possibly justify advancing $1.5 billion on the last day of the financial year and yet claim a budget emergency?

                              It is $1.2 billion not to build a road, and the next question will be, why doesn't the Commonwealth government invest more in Victorian roads.

                               , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that we have a Prime Minister who is happy to trade submarines for votes, is this project not just another example of a government that ignores due process and diligence in order to advance its own political interests?

                                No, it is not. This government is committed to ensuring that there are jobs in place for Victorians. Unlike you on the other side, this government is committed to ensuring that taxpayers' money is spent appropriately. How can you possibly, as a senator for Victoria, come into this place and actively justify your state government handing back $1.2 billion of Commonwealth money because it does not want to build a road? I am sorry,
