          ACCI

         report is only a partial analysis, Senator Boswell. It is based on a sample of just 11 businesses in only a small range of small and medium sized enterprise sectors. It also assumes that small businesses have already implemented all energy-saving and efficiency measures available to them, which means that it has a tendency to underestimate savings from energy efficiency opportunities and overestimate the costs.

         businesses will benefit from the measures that the government has already announced, on 4 May—that is, a one-year delay to the start of the scheme and a $10 fixed price. The energy efficiency and other complementary measures are also built in to a whole range of budget measures across a range of portfolios. It is also important to appreciate that the government is providing some $2.7 billion for a Climate Change Action Fund which will support industries, small businesses and community groups. The government is also providing some $200 million this financial year through the

         to help businesses and other community groups actually prepare for the introduction of the scheme, and there will be a range of measures to underpin that. It is a pity that the coalition feel that they can run and hide from these issues by failing to pass this legislation. It is a pity that the coalition think that they can avoid their responsibilities by constantly adjourning discussion of these issues.

            I find it highly amusing when Senator Boswell seeks to lecture us about our relationships with the trade union movement. I find it extraordinary that the group in that corner—including of course Senator Boswell with his long interest in the meat industry, and in particular his direct involvement with trying to undermine workers’ conditions in the meat industry and his direct involvement in pursuing the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
             Work Choices
            </a>
            options that he has throughout the last 12 years of the previous government—would now seek to lecture a Labor government on its relationship with the trade union movement. What I do know is simply this: every trade unionist in this country understands the importance of climate change and is concerned to ensure that appropriate action is taken to mitigate the costs of climate change. Every decent trade unionist in this country understands the costs of climate change.

                Senator Boswell, again, has got it all wrong. This is a government, a government of which I am very proud to belong, which has provided some $2.75 billion to assist industry to deal with issues relating to climate change. The costs of inaction are much much greater than the costs of action, Senator Boswell—a simple proposition you have failed to understand. The costs of inaction will be much greater in terms of the impact on jobs and on business opportunities, on the economy and on the prosperity of this nation. In particular, the persons who will most bear that burden will be the weakest and the poorest members of our community. The failure of the coalition to face up to their social responsibilities means that the workers and small business people are the ones who will carry the burden of your failure.
