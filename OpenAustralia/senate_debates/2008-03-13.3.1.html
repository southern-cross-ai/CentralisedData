        notes the study published in the Australian and New Zealand Journal of Public Health (Vol. 31, Issue 6, pp 551-7, December 2007) by Yazahmeidi and Holman, School of Population Health, University of Western Australia, ‘A survey of suppression of public health information by Australian governments’ which found that:
        <dl>
         <dt>
          (i)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          just under one-third of academics had witnessed the suppression of health information by Australian governments in the past 5.5 years,
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (ii)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          more than one-fifth had experienced such events personally,
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (iii)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          no state or territory in which the survey took place was immune,
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (iv)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          governments most commonly hindered research by sanitising, delaying or prohibiting the publication of findings but ‘there was no part of the research process beyond their reach’,
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (v)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          most of the affected researchers believed that their work had been targeted because it drew attention to failings in health service delivery, uncovered bad news about the health of a vulnerable group, or pointed to a harmful exposure in the environment, and
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (vi)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          in most instances the government agency seeking to suppress the health information succeeded and, consequently the public was left uninformed or given a false impression; and
         </dd>
        </dl>

       <dt>
        (b)

         <dt>
          (ii)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          adopting a charter by government health agencies and research and academic institutions that supports the independent role of health researchers in evaluating the health system,

         <dt>
          (iii)
         </dt>
         <dd>

         <dt>
          (iv)
         </dt>
         <dd>
