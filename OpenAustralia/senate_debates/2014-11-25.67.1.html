        My question is for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson. Will the minister inform the Senate how the Department of Veterans' Affairs and Defence are working together to educate current and ex-serving personnel about mental health support and the services that are available to them?

         I thank Senator Fawcett for his very important question and acknowledge his longstanding interest. I am pleased to inform the chamber that today I am launching a video that will remind serving members that, while they may not need help or access to services now, they may need assistance in the future, and there are many avenues available to them to pursue.
        </p>
        <p>
         This video stresses that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
          DVA
         </a>
         and Defence have a shared responsibility to look after serving and ex-serving personnel and their families now and into the future. The video is just one of many activities being rolled out as part of a campaign to fully engage the Defence and veteran communities and their families by providing them with information on the support and services available to them. In particular, the video provides details of non-liability health care, whereby many ex-serving men and women can get treatment for depression, anxiety,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
          PTSD
         </a>
         , and substance or alcohol misuse without having to lodge a claim or link their condition to service.
        </p>
        <p>
         This launch will take place at the second meeting of the Prime Minister's Advisory Council on Veterans' Mental Health, otherwise known as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMAC" rel="nofollow">
          PMAC
         </a>
         , which is taking place today. This video was one of the recommendations of the military compensation review with further engagement and awareness of what benefits are available. The aim of the video is to reinforce to current serving members that, no matter what stage of your career you are at, it is DVA and Defence's job to look after your family now and into the future, and is a reminder also that Defence looks after your health treatment when you are serving and, when you are discharged, DVA provides early access to health and support services. Both DVA and Defence have shared responsibilities, which both the assistant minister and myself take very seriously.

           S has been exploring ways to improve awareness of the services it provides to veterans and their families. The VVCS has a prominent online presence, including a modern website and Facebook page. Today, it also announced the Support When You Need It campaign, which is targeted at those who have recently separated from the ADF to encourage them to contact the VVCS in tough times and to utilise the counselling and support services available to them. VVCS counsellors have an understanding of military culture and can help to address concerns such as relationship and family issues, anxiety, depression, anger, sleep difficulties,

A particular outcome of the first meeting was the development of a peer-to-peer forum designed to bring together a wide range of organisations and individuals who are able to provide support to our veterans and their families. I am pleased to advise senators that this important forum, supported by both my department and the
