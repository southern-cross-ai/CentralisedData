         I thank Senator Lundy for her question and for her ongoing interest in this area. Yesterday’s announcement that Telstra and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         Co. have reached a financial heads of agreement is a historic moment for the Australian telecommunications sector. It will be remembered as the moment the Australian government and the industry joined together to revolutionise the telecommunications sector in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         The discussions between Telstra, NBN Co. and the government have been complex and at times very tough. This agreement provides us with a clear pathway to take Australia from the copper age to the fibre future. It also provides us with a clear pathway towards reforming the telecommunications sector to achieve structural separation—a significant and long overdue microeconomic policy reform that will unleash a new wave of competition and innovation in Australia. This agreement paves the way for a faster, cheaper, more efficient rollout of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         with faster take-up. It means that taxpayers will benefit because the overall cost of building the network will be reduced and there will be higher take-up rates and revenue for NBN Co. A greater proportion of the NBN rollout will be underground, with less overhead cabling, and Australia’s largest telecommunications company, Telstra, will become a participant in the rollout of the NBN—

           will transform the structure of the telecommunications sector to once and for all unleash genuine competition and innovation for the benefit of all Australian consumers and businesses. It will lead to cheaper and faster broadband for all Australians. Yesterday’s agreement involves a progressive migration of customers from Telstra’s copper and cable networks to NBN Co.’s new, wholesale-only fibre network, plus the reuse of suitable Telstra infrastructure, including pits, ducts and backhaul fibre. In effect, once the NBN rollout is complete and Telstra has completed the migration of its customers to the NBN, Australia will be served—

                  , on a point of order: I asked the minister a very specific question—that is, whether he could guarantee that a deal with Telstra would be finalised before the election. I did not ask him to go through the wish list that he is trying to roll out, which is all no talk and no action.

                   I have two matters to raise regarding the point of order. Firstly, the last matter raised—which was simply a reiteration of his question—is impermissible, and the senator should be pulled up for that because it is not a point of order. The first matter raised by Senator Cormann was relevance. The minister has been relevant to the question. The question was about

                   Co. and Telstra’s heads of agreement that was announced yesterday. That was the answer that the minister had been dealing with. Of course, the minister has been comprehensively dealing with that and has not fallen outside that. So I humbly submit that the minister has been directly relevant to the question asked.

                     rollout. But there is more work to be done. The heads of agreement provides a framework for the development of more detailed contracts towards a definitive agreement, which will involve greater specification of the arrangement. This step is typical and common for most commercial transactions. It would not be possible to reach a final agreement without this step—

                                                I guess what really irks those opposite is that they were incapable of reaching an agreement with Telstra when they were in government. They had 18 failed broadband plans—I know 18 sounds like a lot but it was indeed 18—including that dog that Senator Macdonald continues to hanker after, called OPEL. OPEL defied the laws of physics. They had 18 failed broadband plans and they want to turn back the clock.
