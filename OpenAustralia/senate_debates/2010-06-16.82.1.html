        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Wong. Is the minister aware of the report issued today by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley" rel="nofollow">
         Morgan Stanley
        </a>
        which demonstrates that under Rudd Labor’s new tax on mining the $20 billion

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        would have ‘no economic value’ and, further, ‘would be unlikely to be developed’? Doesn’t this analysis, independent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
         BHP
        </a>
        Billiton or the mining industry, demonstrate that this new tax will make it harder to gain the investment necessary to get new projects off the ground?

         , just as I am aware of a range of commentary in relation to many other projects. One of the things that has characterised this debate is that there have been a number of claims made publicly which subsequently have been found to be taken with a grain of salt. I refer particularly to Mr Palmer, who is quite a public figure these days, and also to comments made by Xstrata which subsequently had to be clarified. As a

           Mr President

          , I raise a point of order. It goes to relevance. The minister was asked whether she was aware of a named report, a report by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Stanley" rel="nofollow">
           Morgan Stanley
          </a>
          issued today. That was what the question was. She has not gone close to it. She is not even being relevant, let alone directly relevant. If the minister does not know about it, she should be honest enough to admit it.

            Mr President
           </a>
           : if Senator Brandis were more honest with the issue he would have put the whole question, because it was about more than simply the report itself. It also went to discussion within the report about a $20 billion
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Dam" rel="nofollow">

Those opposite cannot pick and choose a part of the question and seek only to have that part answered or to have that part answered first. The minister has a minute to provide a full answer to the entire question. The minister was continuing to be relevant to the whole question that was asked.

             As I said at the outset, I was aware in broad terms of a range of claims in relation to
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Dam" rel="nofollow">
              Olympic Dam
             </a>
             . I am aware, for example, that Mr Abbott stated on 21 May that
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
              BHP
             </a>
             had said that the $22 billion expansion of Olympic Dam could not go ahead. We then saw Mr Kloppers, who I think is known to most people, say on 26 May: ‘At the moment, it is not frozen. We are carrying on.’ So it is quite clear that Mr Abbott was prepared to say something significantly further than what at that time was in the public arena.

             We know that the opposition in relation to this tax reform debate stand on the side of those opposed to tax reform. They oppose tax reform, they oppose a reduction in the company tax rate, they oppose tax breaks for small business and they oppose increased superannuation for working Australians. But what we know they stand for is the interests of a few.

              , that Rudd Labor’s new tax on mining ‘threatens the viability and hence the longevity of our steel business’? Can the minister provide comfort to the people of Whyalla that the government will not be imposing its new tax on the raw materials used in steel production that are essential to keep OneSteel’s plant open?

                           We are determined to proceed with tax reform because it is the right thing for the nation and the right thing for the economy. We want to build a stronger mining sector but ensure we share the proceeds of the mining boom more fairly. So you go out there, Senator Birmingham, and you tell

                            My question is to the Assistant Treasurer. I refer to the cover-up by Mitch Hooke and the Minerals Council of Australia as to how much money they are prepared to spend in the political campaign against the mining boom tax—rumoured to be $100 million. I ask the minister: is that money tax deductible?

                             Thank you for your question. I have seen media reports that the mining industry is to spend a figure of up to $100 million on its advertising campaign to defeat the legislation on the resource super profits tax. I have seen those reports. Whatever the figures are, they are certainly very substantial. The issue of the tax deductibility of the costs of the mining industry’s advertising campaign is an interesting one. It has not had much, if any, attention that I can recall in the media. Spending up to $100 million on a political campaign to defeat the government’s proposals is obviously a significant level of expenditure. I note that the effective company tax rate in the mining sector is 17 per cent.

                                The company tax rate in Australia is 30 per cent, so it is certainly true that the tax rate of the mining sector, compared to other sectors of the Australian economy—it is a matter of fact—is on the low side at 17 per cent. Ultimately, the issue of the deductibility of perhaps up to $100 million is a matter for the tax commissioner, but I note there is a fair degree of precedence in this area that would allow them to claim their massive advertising campaign as a deduction.

                                 , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer. Is this industry which gets a fuel tax credit of $1.7 billion that other sectors of the economy do not share therefore in for a windfall $17 million to $30 million remission in taxes through this campaign? Is it therefore clear that that is money that will not be available for schools, hospitals and other infrastructure for the Australian people?

                                  Obviously you have highlighted a further tax concession that is available for the mining industry. It is available to other sectors, but certainly the mining industry make extensive use of that concession to reduce the overall level of the tax they pay. As I have already mentioned, the effective company tax rate in the mining sector is 17 per cent, which is very, very considerably less than the full company tax rate of 30 per cent. As I was saying, in the past when companies have funded advertising campaigns or funded their respective industry associations—so it is not just a matter of a company spending the money directly but also through the conduit of an industry association—that has frequently been allowed as a tax deduction. So, presumably, the effective company tax rate of some 17 per cent at the present time would drop lower after they claimed the cost of their advertising.

                                         What we have is a situation where the mining sector want to defeat the proposed resource super profits tax. They are against paying a fair share of tax, and they are going to reduce their already-low level of company tax by claiming it as a deduction. They are going to claim the advertising campaign as a deduction and reduce their currently effective 17 per cent company tax when the headline rate is 30 per cent. That is one of the reasons this government intends to introduce a resource super profits tax on the future profits of a resource owned by the Australian people.

                                            That is right; we will have Senator Bernardi quoting Chavez in support of his argument. We know that those opposite are opposed to tax reform, and they will trawl, apparently, the world in order to try to find evidence to support their scare campaign. As I said previously, we on this side are supportive of tax reform. We believe that a profit based tax is more sensible and more economically efficient. In fact, you may recall there was a range of submissions to the Henry review, including some from the mining sector, which reflected that. We also believe that the Australian people should get a reasonable share of the income from the resources, which are not renewable, which they own, and we want to invest that to strengthen the economy—

                                              I will take that interjection. I somehow do not think they are watching us in Chile, although they might be watching other things. What I will say is this: this is about tax reform for the future. We know that we on this side are about building a stronger economy for the future. We know that those on the other side are about a scare campaign and the interests of a few. I think that, over time, we will see the Australian people exposed more and more to the shallowness of the campaign by those opposite.

A question about the effect of Australia’s competitive advantage as a result of this tax in the context of remarks made by the Canadian finance minister does not admit of an answer that begins with the words, ‘Let us consider the member for Dickson’s investment strategies’. Plainly, the minister is treating the Senate and the questioner with contempt.

I am sure he does not have that view really. What the minister has been doing is answering the question. The minister has 44 seconds remaining to provide an answer to the question. The question was very broad in its frame and the minister was providing an answer relevant to the question that was asked. I humbly submit there was no point of order.

                                                      I was referencing Canadian mining companies. Cameco has fallen two per cent since 4 May, Tech Cominco has fallen six per cent since 4 May and London Mining has fallen by 18 per cent since 4 May. These figures do, I think, go to exposing the opposition’s scare campaign for what it is. It is a scare campaign from an opposition bereft of policies about the future.

As a result of the stimulus package, against which you voted, we have seen unemployment in Australia at levels which are reasonable given the economic crisis that we faced. Remember, you voted against that package. We on this side stand for jobs; we on this side stand for investment in the future—

Can the Assistant Treasurer inform the Senate how the government is putting in place a responsible and fair plan to improve the superannuation and retirement outcomes for all Australians? I am sure Senator Bernardi will be fascinated by the answer.

There are four initiatives in the tax package, which is being funded by the resource super profits tax, in the area of superannuation. We will be gradually increasing the superannuation guarantee to 12 per cent. That will assist in—

In estimates, from which you were absent for most of the period, the evidence given was that the cost to government of the superannuation guarantee will be about $3.6 billion. That is the cost to revenue as a consequence of the superannuation guarantee change, so there is a cost to government and that is what in part the resource super profits tax is to fund.

Low-income earners at the moment pay a contributions tax of 15 per cent; many do not pay any effective income tax. So we are going to cut the tax for 3½ million low-income earners. We are extending the $50,000 superannuation contribution cap for those with a balance below half a million dollars who are over 50. Also, we will be ensuring that older workers currently in the workforce over the age of 70 and up to the age of 75, for the first time, will receive superannuation. At the present time, it is not a requirement that they receive superannuation. Thirty-three thousand employees will benefit.

The superannuation measures will increase the superannuation savings pool by some $85 billion over the next 10 years—$85 billion in additional savings. These are savings that do not just benefit the individual and, obviously, increase their retirement income; they also benefit the broader economy, because the bulk of the $85 billion extra in savings that will flow from superannuation will be reinvested back in the Australian economy. So it serves a dual purpose: higher retirement incomes for the individual and building a stronger Australian economy—an already strong Australian economy being made stronger as a result of the increased investment dollars that predominantly flow back into the Australian economy.

As I said in answer to an earlier question, there is only one tax policy that the Liberal and National parties have, and that is to increase company tax. Their one and only tax policy is to increase company tax from 30c to almost 32c. They have no policy to reduce company tax, very obviously. They have no policy to assist small business. They have no policy to reduce tax on small business. They have no policy to reduce tax on superannuation—none whatsoever. Their only tax policy is to increase company tax and to ensure that the broader Australian economy is less competitive than other advanced economies. It will be less competitive than other advanced economies because they intend—they proudly boast of their parental leave policy—to raise billions of dollars by increasing company tax.

We have also said that it is a tax that would cut in above a reasonable rate of return; we have made that clear. There are also mechanisms within the policy which are intended to assist companies which are more marginal. In fact, one of the arguments in favour of a profits based regime as opposed to a volumetric based regime—leaving aside the specific debate on this tax—has always been that it would be a more fair way to levy taxation on the sector and that it would mean that those who earn more profit would pay relatively more tax than those who earn less. Therefore, as a matter of logic, that would mean that there would be companies at the marginal end who are likely to pay less under a profits based regime than under a volumetric regime.

I asked a very specific question of the minister: whether the government stood by the statement that state royalties would be refunded. Yes or no? Does the minister stand by the statement that more marginal mining ventures will be better off because state royalties will be refunded?

It would in fact be lower for some companies—that is, those companies who are less profitable—than the current regime. It is also true that the Treasurer has outlined that we are consulting in relation to the implementation of this regime, including transitional arrangements. That has been made public. We will continue to do that sensibly.

They do not want to be reminded that they were a party against economic stimulus at a time when this nation’s economy needed it, at a time when this nation’s workers needed it and at a time when this nation’s companies needed it. They were against providing stimulus to the economy and now they want to come in here and pretend that they care about employment. I think the Australian people know which party voted for stimulus.
