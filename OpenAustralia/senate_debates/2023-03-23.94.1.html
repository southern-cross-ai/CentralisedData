        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Senator Watt. Across the country, state governments are proposing actions to limit gambling because of the harm it causes to children and the community. Reflecting this, the Greens in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        are taking a policy to the election on Saturday of phasing out pokie machines from pubs and clubs, introducing a mandatory cashless gambling card and creating a pokies super tax and reparation fund for affected communities. However, it's up to the federal government to ban gambling advertising, which is something that is supported by 70 per cent of Australians. Minister, will the government move to ban gambling advertising anywhere and anytime, in the same way as tobacco advertising was banned years ago?

         T (—) (): Thank you for giving us an election manifesto from the

         Greens. I'm not sure, Senator Rice, whether you were here yesterday when I pretty much answered an identical question from Senator Pocock. I could refer you back to my answer of yesterday, but I'm happy to go through it again today.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no doubt that the Albanese government recognises the importance of gambling promotions being presented in a responsible manner. We know the Greens know a little bit about gambling because we know who their donors have been. We also recognise that there is ongoing community concern about the harms associated with online gambling, including advertising material, and it is timely for the parliament to consider what more should be done to address this issue, and I hope that we can rely on the Greens' support despite their large donations from gambling interests. This is why we have established an inquiry into online gambling and its impacts on those experiencing gambling harm.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I mentioned yesterday, the online gambling inquiry is being conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Policy" rel="nofollow">
          Social Policy
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Legal Affairs
         </a>
         , which has been very capably chaired by Peta Murphy, one of our fabulous Labor MPs. The committee is considering the effectiveness of current gambling advertising restrictions on limiting children's exposure to gambling products and services—including through social media, sponsorship or branding—among a range of other issues. Of course, the government will consider the committee's recommendations when it releases its final report.
        </p>
        <p>
         The current rules relating to the scheduling and content of advertisements on television are contained in the co-regulatory broadcasting codes of practice. Those codes are developed under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 by industry groups in consultation with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Communications and Media Authority
         </a>
         . There is some work to be done here. The Albanese government is on the job. There's a House committee on the job, and we look forward to seeing its recommendations.

           Thank you, Minister. So, in terms of a ban, at this stage it's a no. Minister, it was a Labor government that refused tobacco donations and introduced changes to tobacco packets that protected people and reduced harm. Will you commit to refusing gambling donations and taking action to protect people from gambling harm?

            Again, I'm rather surprised that the Greens are choosing to use a question about whether we will ban the very kinds of donations that the Greens have been receiving. You're asking a Labor government to ban you from taking donations from the gambling industry. Is that what this is about?

                Sorry, President. I'm just so surprised that the Greens are asking us to stop them from taking the donations that they have been taking for a number of years from the gambling industry. Let me remind you, Senator Rice: in 2022 the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Greens" rel="nofollow">
                 Queensland Greens
                </a>
                accepted almost $500,000 in donations from a highrolling gambler, despite pushing for a ban on political donations from the gambling industry. In 2019-20 the Queensland Greens MP Mr Berkman had been critical of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
                 LNP
                </a>
                and Labor for accepting donations from gambling interests, but the highest donation in an election year in Queensland in 2019 was indeed to the Greens from Mr Turpie.

                    I haven't started the question; I'm just correcting the record. Minister, it is clear that what is needed at a federal level is a national gambling regulator, including to tackle the harm caused by online gambling, which is national and international. Will the government introduce a national gambling regulator?

                     (—) (): As I said, the House of Representatives is conducting an inquiry into these matters at the moment, and I look forward to its recommendations on what we can do about what is a very serious issue. But I'm interested to note that Senator Rice seems to be enunciating that the Greens' position is that they don't support gambling donations from companies, but donations from individual highroller gamblers are fine. Does that mean that every time we hear the Greens say that we should ban donations from coal and gas companies it would be okay for the Greens to take donations from

                     don't like it when they're held to account, and Senator McKim is chief among them. You come in here and mouth off constantly about what other parties should do, but the very minute your own hypocrisy is exposed, all you want to do is shout people down. You are a joke, you are hypocrites and you're finally being exposed.
