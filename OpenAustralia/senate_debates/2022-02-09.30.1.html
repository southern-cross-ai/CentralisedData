        I speak as a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia. It's now seven months since I delivered a speech reminding senators and people listening at home of the significance of our flag, a flag that flies proudly above our parliament on a strong support that stands equally above the Senate and the House of Representatives, reminding all of us, in both chambers, that we serve the people. We do not serve large, globalist banking corporations; we do not serve trade union bosses, who are often a business of their own these days, devoid of relevance to union members; and we certainly do not serve large foreign multinational pharmaceutical companies. For seven months, I have been ending my speeches with the reminder that we have one flag, we are one community and we are one nation. In this time of great division in our beautiful country, it is becoming harder and harder to live up to the principle that we are one nation. We must put aside division and accept competing viewpoints.
       </p>

        On Monday, I went outside to address a group of everyday Australians who have come to Canberra to protest the policies of this parliament. They quite rightly expected to be able to speak to their elected representatives to share their concerns, and so I did my job and I spoke with them. The results were, to be honest, mixed. I heard many different opinions and I saw many different flags. It's obvious to me that there are some—a very, very small minority—who are misleading and inflaming opinion to gain power for themselves.

        will continue to take positions that are based on facts and data, not fabricated, false internet myths. If those of us who oppose tyranny are unable to unite among ourselves, how can we win public opinion? And win we must.

        It has been said that 200 years ago a judge by the name of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Woodhouselee" rel="nofollow">
         Lord Woodhouselee
        </a>
        made an astute observation: 'A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the majority discovers it can vote itself largesse out of the public treasury. After that, the majority votes for the candidate promising the most benefits, with the result that democracy collapses, because loose fiscal policy is always followed by dictatorship.' For many years, I considered that human nature acts out of self-interest, not just for oneself but for those we love—our family and community, our species. Willingly imposing a dictatorship on those we love seemed contrary to human nature. Surely, I thought, there would be a point where the public would realise, 'We are on a path to dictatorship,' and change direction. Well, we're already being controlled. To change our direction, we must be unified. We must be tolerant and forgiving. Our future is not one of retribution, anger and hate. Our future must be unity, forgiveness—and I mean true forgiveness—love and strength. These are the qualities that create a community.
       </p>

        Those assembled outside today have reached their point of awareness. The millions who've attended freedom rallies around Australia have reached their point of awareness. Sadly, this parliament has not. I have never been more nervous for the future of this beautiful country than I am right now. It's clear that we may be approaching the end days of democracy, as predicted 200 years ago—not from the peaceful, respectful, loving protesters but from this parliament and from state parliaments. We're witnessing the controlled demolition of not just our treasury and our democracy but our community. We're on a path to a soft dictatorship 'for our own good'. Nothing about this is for our own good.

        Our grandparents enjoyed abundance, freedom and personal sovereignty. These things do not feature in the conversation being advanced by this parliament. Husband has been turned against wife, parent against child and one sibling against another. Our young are being seduced into a world of selfish hedonism that begets apathy towards family and community. Women are being erased, replaced with offensive language such as 'uterus owner' and 'birthing parent', forced to compete against biological men to make clear the new debased status afforded them by the brave new world of globalist groupthink. This is evil. Government dependence is treated as a right, as though it were somehow noble to live off the hard work of others. We're being led into a world where the middle class no longer exists, only a financial elite and their nomenclatura, a pampered and privileged administrative class tasked with carrying out the instructions of the globalists, the elites. High-paid corporate and diplomatic 'thankyou jobs' are clearly on offer to politicians who've expended their political capital to implement globalism.
       </p>

        Meanwhile, everyday Australians have no such escape. Life for so many, including those I met on Monday out front, means working harder and going backwards. During COVID, the world's richest billionaires have seen their wealth increase by $3 trillion while the wealth of citizens has gone backwards by the same amount—stolen; it was robbery. COVID has represented the largest transfer of wealth in human history—nakedly. Everyday Australians have less while billionaires have plenty more.

        This parliament is responsible for destroying the Australian economy, destroying small business, destroying lives and destroying hope. The media, major global pharmaceutical companies, globalist banks, political donors and health bureaucrats have the same owners—

        , Vanguard and

         State Street Corporation
        </a>
        , amongst others. These funds invest the wealth of the world's richest crony capitalists and now control wealth equal to one-third of the world's gross domestic product,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        $25 trillion. In Australia, this wealth has been invested to create controlling interests in Australia's largest companies—retailers, banks, media and pharmaceutical companies. As a result, crony capitalists now control our country. And parliament and government serve their interests; they don't serve the people. Under this parliament, awaiting everyday Australians is a future that's nothing more than 18th-century feudalism with a public relations budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        What never gets mentioned is that democracy is not part of the so-called great reset. What awaits is something the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        calls stakeholder governance. Unelected, unrepresentative corporations and their nomenclatura will decide how we live our lives. Parliament will be reduced to debating and passing resolutions that have no legal standing, and this is exactly how the

        works right now. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        parliament is analogous to putting a plastic steering wheel on the back of the driver's seat of the family car so your children think they're driving. This is our future under the globalist philosophy that now dictates the actions of the Liberals, the Nationals, the Greens and Labor. We the people are not in control. We are deluded into feeling we're in control.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it comes to COVID, there's no sitting this one out. Recent events have made it clear everyday Australians do not have to be interested in politics for politics to be interested in them. During COVID, small businesses who carried on running their business the way they always have—serving their communities, not discriminating on the basis of race, religion or medical status—are under COVID restrictions, COVID measures. They're being sent broke, their owners fined or, worse, arrested. Politics came for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shortly, Australians must decide. Do you remain prisoners in your cities, states and, now, quarantine camps? Do you remain prisoners of media driven fear, or do we forge a path of freedom born of personal responsibility and inclusion? Inclusion—it's ironic how that word has been reinvented to mean the majority accepting the viewpoint of a small and noisy minority as a device to move society further and further towards a single world view. Senator Chisholm from the Labor Party moved a motion in support of doing exactly that only yesterday. With his matter of urgency, Senator Chisholm was kind enough to show us where Labor, the once proud
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        , would take Australia. For public order, the senator said, dissent must be suppressed. The world view which our parliament now advances has the fundamental assumption that people cannot be trusted to behave in the best interests of their community and so must be treated as convicts—not as citizens—robbed of free choice and, implicit in that, robbed of freedom itself. Freedom is written in inverted commas by our media, who are promoting an agenda of hatred and division on behalf of their billionaire owners.

        are compliant because totalitarianism excites the political Left. Tyranny and socialism go together like the words 'rare' and 'side effects'—inseparable, relentless, evil. Christmas, Easter,

        —had to be extinguished because they offer a chance to renew the bonds that unite us as a family, as a community and as a nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The time for people to trust the government is over. It's now time for the government to trust the people. This, the people's house of parliament, must stand in defence of the values that forged this country. The war on family, on community and on Christianity must end in this sitting, for we will be convicts no more. We have one flag, we are one community and we are one nation.
