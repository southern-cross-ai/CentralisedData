        The committee is considering schedule 1, item 11, moved by the opposition, on sheet 5969 revised. The question is that the amendment be agreed to.

         I move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 5969 revised:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2)    Schedule 2, item 4, page 15 (after line 23), after paragraph 21A(1)(a), insert:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (aa)    employ or engage only an agent who is:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (i)    a Qualified Education Agent Counsellor who has completed the Education Agents Training Course or a recognised equivalent as specified in the regulations; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (ii)    a member of a professional body for education agents if such a body has been specified in the regulations in relation to the area in which the agent operates; and
        </p>
        <p>
         I previously explained what we are seeking to achieve with the amendment. The opposition is of the view that education agents should at least have a requirement to receive training and be aware of Australian requirements regarding matters such as attendance, work permits, migration et cetera—in fact, that there ought to be a more professional approach than is currently the case. With those few words, I commend the amendment to the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Question negatived.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perhaps I could get some clarification about the status of the Greens’ amendment and Senator Xenaphon’s amendments in light of the fact that neither the Greens nor Senator Xenophon are in the chamber at present.

          Thank you for that clarification, Madam Chair. I will not be moving those amendments on their behalf. This will be my final contribution. Yesterday, during the second reading debate, I asked some questions as to the current financial situation of the

          Assurance Fund. The last piece of information available to the opposition was to 31 December 2008. In that year the fund lost, from memory, $1.3 million. The last piece of information was that there was about $1.8 million in that fund at the end of 2008. Given the events of last year, could we get some indication from the government as to the current circumstance.
