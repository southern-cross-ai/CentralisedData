        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Senator Kim Carr. Can the minister outline to the Senate what the government is doing to help hardworking families ensure their children get a decent education and a fair go in life?

         ) ( ): It is not too late for the opposition to join with the government and celebrate the Senate's passing of the government's schoolkids bonus initiative. It is not too late for the opposition to join with the government in recognising that the prosperity of our people rests upon our national investment in education. It is not too late for the opposition to join with the government in understanding that education unlocks inequality by opening up opportunities for individuals. And, as a result of that opening up of opportunities, it of course opens up opportunities for this whole country. So it is not too late for this government to try to persuade the opposition—not that we will ever give up on that—of how important it is to help parents ensure that their kids do the very best that they possibly can at school. Our people deserve nothing less. This parliament ought to come together and assist parents in getting the very best out of the education system that is possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why this government has provided $2 billion for a schoolkids bonus for families. It is an important investment in the education of the people of this country. So, despite the opposition's resistance, 1.3 million families will see money in the bank, twice a year every year, to help them ensure their kids get the very best education they can. That is $410 each year for a child in primary school and $820 each year for a child in high school. That means 2.2 million Australian kids will see the benefits in terms of assistance with their laptops, textbooks and after-school activities.

           I thank Senator Polley for the question. This is a government that understands that a good education begins at home. That is why we are backing schoolkids bonus, with an increase in payments for 1.5 million families. All families who are eligible for family tax benefit A will benefit from this measure. That is of course additional support of up to $600 a year. That is on top of the Household Assistance Package and a new supplementary allowance, which will also be available to boost family budgets.
          </p>
          <p>
           Labor are not just about supporting parents; we are also about supporting teachers, carers and of course schools. Over the next four years this government will be investing a record $22.3 billion in early childhood education, more than tripling the investment made in the last four years of the Howard government. We have also doubled the amount of funding for school education, with an investment of $65 billion over the current funding period. This is real investment—

             Now that the Senate has passed the schoolkids bonus legislation, we will be able to see the

              Department of Human Services
             </a>
             deliver those payments to eligible families across the country. They will do so to a very high standard, something we have come to expect of this department. The schoolkids bonus will be paid in two instalments at the start of each semester, beginning in January next year. Of course, that is when parents need the money most. Because a lot of kids were missing out on the education tax refund, it will be paid out in full to all eligible families by the end of the current financial year. That means $409 for a primary school kid and $818 for a high school kid, to be delivered within weeks. This is practical assistance for families. I call upon those opposite to publicly support this measure, because you know that this is the sort of measure that a family needs to provide—
