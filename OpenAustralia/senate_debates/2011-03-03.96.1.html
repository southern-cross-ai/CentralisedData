           As the good senator perhaps should know, the thing that investors do need is certainty. If he engaged in this debate with a modicum of a sense of the public policy requirements, he would know that what business is seeking is certainty.

             As I was saying, what the senator should be aware of is that the business community, the investment community, do seek certainty across the board in policy areas but certainly, critically, in the context of carbon pricing. If he had taken the time along with the government of engaging with business, he would know that there are a range of different views about how this should be constructed, what the architecture should be, but there is a deep concern about the ongoing uncertainty associated with carbon pricing. The government is very aware of that and does believe that providing certainty in this area is important to making sure investment decisions that have long-term outcomes can be made. We are very concerned to ensure that investors, particularly, for example, in the electricity generation sector, have the capacity to make those investment decisions with policy certainty. So that is why we are working through with the multiparty committee a mechanism to price carbon. There are a range of issues about the design of that mechanism. The Minister for
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
              Climate Change
             </a>
             and Water has been clear about the processes associated with discussing those. The government is engaging with business to do that. We will continue to do that. Unlike the opposition, we will not try and foster uncertainty by saying before they see anything that they are going to overturn it in future and by fostering the sort of fear-mongering and scare-mongering that they do.

                   Perhaps I need to say that again, because Senator Macdonald clearly is not interested in what the electricity sector has to say: investors need ‘an equitable and enduring greenhouse gas emissions price signal’ and ‘this can only be achieved through bipartisan policy agreement.’ We would welcome the opposition actually approaching this issue with a focus on what is right for the nation, a focus on sensible public policy, but regrettably they have been lacking. Regrettably all they wish to do is to run a no campaign, a fear campaign and a scare campaign on this important policy issue.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Given that investment analysts are already advising that the carbon tax represents a significant disincentive to invest in Australian companies, is your claim that a carbon tax will be good for the economy simply bluff and spin?

                          This is an economic reform that is about transforming Australia’s economy in the most efficient way. If you look back through our history at a range of economic reforms which were about transforming our economy, you will see there were times when people said that this would be the end of industry—when we went through the arguments about trade liberalisation, about floating the dollar, those important economic reforms.

                            Thank you, Senator Sherry—of course, superannuation. We heard those voices—some on the other side—saying this was the end of the world. Perhaps in five or 10 years time, when we have had a carbon price, when investors are pricing that into their long-term decisions, as this country moves to a cleaner energy, low-pollution economy, people might look back on Senator Bushby’s question and think really how backward looking it was.
