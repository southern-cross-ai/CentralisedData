        We have taken the opportunity in this Budget to prepare an Explanatory Memorandum for each of the Budget appropriation Bills. For past appropriation Bills, the Budget Papers and Portfolio Budget Statements have explained the appropriations broadly. However, the clauses in each bill and the changes to the provisions have not been explained in detail. The Memoranda explain the clauses in the Bills in detail and, in particular, the changes made for 2008-09 compared to previous appropriation Bills. This is the first occasion on which a Government has prepared Explanatory Memoranda to explain the appropriation Bills. It also supports the Government’s policy to increase the disclosure of information on government financial management.

       <p class="italic">
        Budget Paper No. 4 provides information on appropriations that are expected to be required in the budget year. As part of the Government’s Operation Sunlight program to increase the transparency of the Budget, Budget Paper No. 4 also contains two new tables. The first outlines estimates of expenses for each special appropriation Act by agency and the second is a register of all active special accounts operated by each agency.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Details of the proposed appropriations are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill, the main features of which were outlined in the Budget Speech delivered by my colleague, the Treasurer, on 13 May 2008.
