        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Wong. Over the last two years, the Albanese Labor government has worked to help bring
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_Assange" rel="nofollow">
         Julian Assange

        home. Just last month, the Prime Minister said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … enough is enough. There's nothing to be served by the ongoing incarceration of Mr Assange. And we continue to work very closely to achieve that outcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the foreign minister please advise the Senate on what the government is doing to support Mr Assange?

         I thank Senator Urquhart for the question, given that the Prime Minister has just responded in the House to a question on Mr Assange. The Prime Minister and I have been very clear. Mr Assange's case has dragged on for too long. Over the last two years, the Albanese government has advocated for him to come home. That advocacy has been led by the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister has been very clear about the priority he gives to Mr Assange's case. He has been supported in that by the Attorney-General and me, and by the relentless work of senior diplomats and others. We want to be in a position to see Mr Assange reunited with his family in Australia. Mr Assange has legal proceedings scheduled in the United States. Obviously, it isn't appropriate for me or anyone to comment on ongoing court proceedings. What I can do is acknowledge that there are many here in parliament who have advocated for Mr Assange to come home, as have supporters in Australia and around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since we came to office, the Albanese Labor government has been working to bring Mr Assange's case to a close. The Prime Minister has led these efforts and has personally raised Mr Assange's case at the most senior levels, including with President Biden and Prime Minister Sunak. Similarly, the Attorney-General, and I, as foreign minister, have raised Mr Assange's case, as I've said in this place, with American and United Kingdom counterparts. Australian officials—in particular, Ambassador Kevin Rudd and

            Over the last two years, the Albanese government has worked to support Mr Assange and his family. This included advocating for due process, for humane treatment, for medical care and for legal representation—just as we do for all Australians who are detained overseas. As foreign minister, I have met with members of Mr Assange's family and legal team on a number of occasions, as have Australia's
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">

            </a>
            to the United Kingdom and our Ambassador to the United States, as well as our hardworking consular team in Canberra.
           </p>
           <p>
            For several years, Mr Assange declined Australian government consular visits, but last year, at my request, our High Commissioner to the United Kingdom met with Mr Assange and has done so on a number of occasions since. We will continue to provide consular assistance to Mr Assange.

               I thank the senator for that question. I know that there are many around the world, and in Australia, who have passionately advocated for Mr Assange and I recognise those parliamentarians who have been part of that advocacy.
              </p>

                Julian Assange
               </a>
               Home Parliamentary Group co-conveners travelled to Washington and they advocated for the incarceration of Mr Assange to end. That is consistent with the position that has been articulated by the Albanese government and that we have been very clear on. We have consistently stated that there is nothing to be served by the ongoing incarceration of Mr Julian Assange.
