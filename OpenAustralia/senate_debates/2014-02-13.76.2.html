        My question without notice is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Victorian government has been shamed into taking action on

        and Labor. I note that the Prime Minister sought to justify the Commonwealth government's refusal to provide support for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPC_Ardmona" rel="nofollow">
         SPC Ardmona
        </a>
        by referring to the profits of the parent company, Coca-Cola Amatil. He said: 'Why should the Commonwealth taxpayers give money to a $9 billion company that made a $215 million after-tax profit in the last six months? It doesn’t make sense.' Why is the government providing $16 million to Cadbury, whose $62 billion
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        parent company, Mondelez, this morning announced an annual profit of $3.9 billion? Why does supporting SPC not make sense but giving money to a company that is eight times more profitable—

         If one were to listen to the question from Senator Carr it would appear that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
          Daniel Andrews
         </a>
         has succeeded where

         has failed. And I will allow him to consider that for some period of time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me also make this observation: this deal with the Victorian government—and let me say that is a matter for the Victorian government and for the Victorian people—their contribution now of $22 million I understand, will guarantee the company staying. I just observe that a request had been made for $50 million—$25 million from the federal and $25 billion from the state—but now it appears that $22 million from the state will guarantee everything and keep everything in place.

         In relation to Cadbury, I am more than happy to indicate to the honourable senator what the fundamental difference is, and I trust that my Tasmanian Labor Senate colleagues listen very carefully to this answer, because—

                    , I ask a supplementary question. The Prime Minister has made a statement that Tasmania is a 'special case'. When it comes to industry policy he said this was due to the low wages and high unemployment. Can the minister explain why

                    </a>
                    Ardmona in Shepparton is not also a 'special case', given that the average wages are lower than in Tasmania and unemployment is higher? Given that under this government Australia's unemployment rate has now risen to a 10-year high, isn't the entire country rapidly becoming a 'special case'?

                      The Prime Minister was absolutely right when he said that Tasmania was a special case. After 16 years of state Labor government, the last four years of which have been a Green-Labor government in cahoots with a federal Labor-Green government, the Tasmanian economy now suffers. Mentioning the unemployment rate, Senator Carr: it is the highest rate of unemployment in the nation, of 7.6 per cent. That is the Labor legacy; that is the Labor-Green legacy, and that is why we say to the Tasmanian people that they have done half a job in electing a federal Liberal-National Party government, and they can do the other half of the job on 15 March by electing a majority Liberal government to get the economy back on track and to allow jobs growth to occur. Senator Carr says that the unemployment figure occurred under our watch, but it is under their budget and economic mismanagement that we got those figures.

                       is just another case in the pattern of deceit that has followed from the Abbott government? How does its grants to Cadbury or to Huon Aquaculture meet the government's criteria, which were outlined by the Treasurer today, of providing an essential service?

                        Tasmania clearly is a very special case. Senator Carr has mentioned that and the Prime Minister has mentioned that. The reason that it is is that it has had its economy driven into the ground by 16 years of Labor, the last four years of which were Labor-Green governments. They have destroyed the Tasmanian economy so that it now suffers from the worst unemployment rate in the country. And, what is more, on all the CommSec economic indicators Tasmania lags at the very bottom of the table except on one statistic, and that is unemployment.

                        We are committed to seeing that changed. We want to see it changed and that is why I invite those opposite and the Greens to vote with us to get rid of the carbon tax, to get rid of the mining tax, to get rid of the green and red tape and to re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission—that is our plan.
