        , Minister Farrell. Australians rightly celebrate when we lead the world. We are rightly proud when we punch above our weight on the world stage in many things. But leading the world in gambling losses on a per capita basis is not something to celebrate. Australians lose some $25 billion every year gambling. Does the government agree that we need strong and decisive action to protect children and vulnerable people from the harmful effects of gambling and gambling advertising?

         I thank Senator Pocock for his question and his courtesy in giving us some advance notice of that question. You rightly set out the amount that Australians lose each year through gambling, and that obviously is a very significant amount of money. The government is concerned about the impact of gambling on children, and we've done a number of things since coming to government in this respect. The government recently established a parliamentary inquiry into gambling and its impact on gambling harm. One of the key focus areas of the parliamentary inquiry is considering the effectiveness of current gambling advertising restrictions, particularly on limiting children's exposure to gambling products and services, including through social media. I am aware of gambling-like games, for instance the video games that include loot boxes and social gaming, and they're of concern to many community members. Work is being done on this issue and will obviously be part of the focus on the parliamentary inquiry that I referred to earlier. The office of the eSafety Commissioner has a guide on its website for parents about gaming, including those games with gambling-like elements.

           An ABC investigation last year revealed the gambling industry has donated $80 million to political parties over the last 22 years. Given what we know about gambling and its effect on society, does the minister believe it is still appropriate for any political party to accept donations from industries that make profit from gambling?

            Again, I thank Senator Pocock for his question and the information that he has provided to the Senate. The Labor Party is very seriously interested in the reform of the electoral process, and we've sent a number of recommendations to the parliamentary committee that looks after the issue of electoral funding, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Some of the things that I have proposed, as the minister responsible in that area, include reducing the threshold levels for the disclosure of donations. At the moment, the figure isâ€”

               Again, I thank Senator Pocock for his concern in this area. I actually didn't finish my previous answer, unfortunately, and I'll just say that one of the things that we're proposing to do in that space is real-time disclosure of donations.
              </p>
              <p>
               On the issue you raise about harm to children, we have set up an inquiry, as I mentioned in one of my earlier answers. I would hope that you and other members of the Senate who have got an interest in this area will take the opportunity of that inquiry to bring the sorts of issues that you've quite rightly raised here today to the committee so that the committee can look at these issues and deal with them in a sensible fashion.
