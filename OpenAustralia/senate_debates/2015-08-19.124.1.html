        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table an explanatory memorandum, and I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in
        <i>

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The speech read as followsâ€”
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <i>
         Marriage Equality Plebiscite Bill 2015
        </i>
        will require a national plebiscite on the issue of same-sex marriage, to be conducted at the next general election.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill will determine the timing and question of a plebiscite that will enable electors to indicate their views regarding the issue of marriage equality.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This Bill proposes the question "Do you support Australia allowing marriage between 2 people regardless of their gender?".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The sponsors of this Bill share the view that the Parliament should enact specific legislation to direct the question and other machinations of a plebiscite on the issue of marriage equality in Australia, rather than allow these important matters to be determined solely by the Government.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bill outlines that there will be compulsory voting in this plebiscite and that it should be held at the same time as the next general election. This choice of timing would significantly reduce the cost of holding the plebiscite.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The issue of funding for both the 'yes' and 'no' cases is dealt with in this Bill, such that Commonwealth funding will be provided as set out in the
        <i>
         Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984
        </i>
        , specifically subsection 11(4). This means only the basic materials containing arguments in favour of and opposed to the proposed question would be distributed to electors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the result of the plebiscite affirms support for marriage between two people regardless of their gender, the Bill affirms it is the intention of the Parliament that this change be legislated within six months of this result being determined.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The sponsors of the Bill share the view that it is essential for the Parliament to legislate to determine the question and other important parameters of a plebiscite on marriage in Australia. For this reason, I/we call on the Senate to support this Bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted; debate adjourned.
