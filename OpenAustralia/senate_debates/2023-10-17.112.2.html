        Today, approximately 20,800 Australians live with serious spinal cord injuries, often the result of very traumatic accidents. These injuries have a devastating impact on the quality of life and the health of not only these individuals but also their families, and they also take a toll financially. Around a quarter of those affected today are on the

        </a>
        , which costs just under $1 billion per year for those people.

        Traditionally, spinal cord injuries were considered a life sentence, with little hope for functional and quality-of-life improvement. Fortunately, today organisations like SpinalCure Australia are making remarkable developments in this field of research. I've had the great privilege of working with and supporting SpinalCure for several years now. Their Project Spark is an innovative research initiative focusing on neurostimulation. This technology has the very real potential to restore meaningful levels of feeling and mobility, which would significantly enhance the quality of life for those with spinal cord injuries and those who love and support them.
