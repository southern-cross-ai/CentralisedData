        [by video link] My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Colbeck. In late June the Prime Minister said in response to the Delta COVID-19 outbreak in Sydney, 'I commend Premier Berejiklian for resisting going into a full lockdown.' Does the Morrison government stand by this commendation?

        </p>
        <p>
         As has been said on a number of occasions, there is no rule book to this pandemic. We know that new variants will come and they will change the way that we have to approach the pandemic. We will continue to meet those challenges. Australians can be confident of that. But the thing that we need to concentrate on right now is to continue to increase the pace of the vaccine rollout. That's where the government's focus is, that's why we've released the plan that we have to allow the economy to reopen, that's why we are increasing the number of points where Australians can access vaccine and that's why we are working with the New South Wales government to increase the capacity in those areas of concern in New South Wales. We will continue to do that. We will continue to meet the challenges that this pandemic throws up to us all. We will continue to support Australians as they need to be supported and we will continue to increase the capacity of Australians to get access to a vaccine because we know that is one of the most important pathways towards a more normal life for all Australians.

            [by video link] The Morrison government will continue to act on the health advice in support of the management of this pandemic. We will continue to work with the states and territories to support them with their management of the pandemic, as we have done all the way through, through the formation of the national cabinet and the decisions that have been made there. The advice that we have received in respect of the management of the current outbreak in Sydney with the delta variant is that the lockdown is appropriate. It needs to be appropriately managed because of the speed at which the delta variant works. Of course having appropriate management of the local community and the lockdown also removes the possibility of longer lockdowns, which would have an even worse economic outcome. So we will continue to work in—

                New South Wales

               are decisions of the New South Wales government. They have responsibility for those matters under their public health responsibilities. It is absolutely tragic that we've lost a further 15 lives to this current outbreak, to this new variant, and I extend my condolences to every one of those families that are involved in that loss of life. But the suggestion that the vaccine rollout is responsible for this current outbreak is simply not true. I reject completely the premise of the question that's been put to the parliament.
