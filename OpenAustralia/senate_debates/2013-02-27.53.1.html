        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Ludwig. I ask: given that the evidence shows the government has made a complete mess of the treatment of royalties in the

         MRRT

               , is dealing with that part of the question that I can deal with, which goes to the MRRT. What I cannot do—which I will take on notice just to ensure that the interjector who is supporting the Greens understands where I am going, because he is apparently too slow to understand it. I will take that part on notice, because I do not have any prior knowledge as to what meetings Mr Ferguson might or might not attend. So I will take that on notice, but there were other elements of the question that I can answer, which it seems to me that Senator Ian Macdonald is too thick to follow.

                   No. Order on both sides! Before we get into that: Senator Macdonald got up and used the word himself. That is the difficulty that I am now placed in. I would encourage all senators to show the due respect for each other that is warranted in this chamber.

For the sake of consistency, Mr President, if I cannot call Mr Wayne Swan a dope—a self-evident proposition, Mr President—then I do not see how Senator Ian Macdonald can be allowed without objection to be called dumb.

                        , I recognise your words, and I am always happy to withdraw if I have overstepped the mark. One of the difficulties in the question is that I know that Mr Ferguson goes to a range of meetings. It is on the public record that he was at meetings. The question never went to which meeting, which is the part I will take on notice. The other part, of course, is dealing more broadly with the

                         , I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for taking on notice whether or not the minister responsible for resources and energy was actually at a meeting that determined the tax. Can the minister confirm that, even when mining companies arrange their affairs to pay no tax, royalty credits can be stored by corporations to be used to offset the paying of tax in future years? If so, can the government tell the Australian people through the Senate how much this design flaw of the tax is costing Australia in lost revenue over the forward estimates?
