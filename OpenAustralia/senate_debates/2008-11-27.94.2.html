       <p>
        I want to make some remarks in relation to the
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/S653" rel="nofollow">
         Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008
        </a>
        . This bill seeks to strengthen the legislative framework relating to sponsorship of noncitizens coming to work in Australia under what are commonly called 457 visas. It is important legislation, given its focus. It is important because 457 visas have proliferated since they were first introduced in 1997-98. In the first year that they were introduced, 30,880 visas were issued, and in 2007-08 the figure rose to 110,570 visas. So there has been a fourfold increase in the use of these visas over the period of time in which they have been available.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Queensland, my own state, they have consistently constituted about 17 per cent to 18 per cent of the visas issued nationally—8,000 in 2006-07 and 9,800 in 2007-08. There are currently 19,000 employers making use of 457 visas and they are spread very widely throughout the economy, largely in the professions and also in the trades. The largest categories in my own state, I note, are in the health and medical professions—nurses and particularly medical practitioners. So the health professions in particular, in Queensland at least, have taken full advantage of the opportunities presented by the 457 visas. With numbers so large, it is clear that there is a need to strengthen the legislative framework under which they operate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The opposition supports this objective and, indeed, it supports the general thrust of the bill. We do have some concerns, however, and, in voicing these concerns, I suppose it is important that I draw attention to the fact that there has been some argument that the 457 visa process has been abused. It has been argued that there has been some bad behaviour in relation to these bills. Before the Senate committee, an argument was put by the representatives from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
         CFMEU
        </a>
        that there were several instances of abuse that could be noted, although the evidence seemed to be a bit vague as to the nature of these abuses. The statistic that arrests my attention is that, over the period of 1997-98 to now, something in the vicinity of 340,000 visas have actually been issued, and there seems to be a relatively small number of abuses that have been recorded. This is not in any way an avalanche of abuses. There has not been rampant contempt for the rules under which the visas have been issued. So I think we should be cautious about accepting the claims that are being made in the public domain, particularly on behalf of the union movement, that this system is in need of substantial change. But there is a need for greater regulation, and the opposition supports that proposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        The particular concern that I have about it is the kind of legislative technique—if I can describe it in that way—which is being used in relation to the way in which this bill has been introduced. Several witnesses before the Senate committee drew attention to the fact that, whilst the bill laid out a framework of activity, it provided little detail as to the nature of the obligations which employers, and indeed employees, might be obliged to undertake in the future, and these details were going to be provided in the regulations. Mr Kessels from Fragomen, who gave evidence before the committee, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What we are all doing is sitting around making submissions and discussing a bill which is essentially just a framework, but the real substance that is going to make the real difference is unknown at this stage, and that is the fundamental problem.
       </p>
       <p>
        I agree with that proposition. I do think it is a fundamental problem. Mr Kessels’ evidence was by no means the only evidence following that particular line. In fact, there were many witnesses who came to the committee who expressed precisely the same kind of concern about the structure of this piece of legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The difficulty here is that we have no clear idea of the nature of the regulations which might be provided. To say the least, in my view, this is an undesirable way of proceeding. I suppose that there is a possibility that when the coalition was in government we may have, on a few occasions, taken this particular course of action. There may have been occasions when we took this course of action, but I do not necessarily approve of that course of action either. So I do not think that the government can take any comfort from the fact that this may have been a way of proceeding in the past. If this were a trivial matter then we might let it pass through, but we are actually talking about the rights of people and we are talking about issues which are fundamentally important to the way in which we manage businesses and the way it affects our economy. These rules and regulations, when they eventually emerge, could in fact have quite a profound impact on both employers and employees. But we do not have, as Mr Kessels said, any real clear idea about how onerous they may well be when they are turned out.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        committee noted that there were a range of concerns. I will not deal with these in detail other than to note that the committee drew attention to the problem of penalties and the enforcement regime that might apply in the regulations. It drew attention to the sanctions that might apply for breaches and, in particular, to concerns about the inspection regime. It also drew attention to what I think are two rather more significant issues. The first of these is the onerous obligations that could well be imposed upon employers as a result of the new regulations. Under these new regulations, it seems that employers will be required to undertake responsibility for costs such as for the education of children, travel and airfares, medical care, and licences and registrations for professions and trades et cetera. All of these have a capacity to impose considerable additional burdens on businesses. For some sponsors, some organisations, some enterprises which already make considerable use of 457 visas, these could be very onerous obligations indeed, particularly for small businesses. We ought to be careful about the consequences of these regulations and the kinds of imposts that we are going to be placing on businesses, particularly small businesses, especially in the economic climate we now find ourselves in.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second major concern I have is in relation to retrospectivity. We in the coalition have never been enthusiasts for retrospectivity in legislation. It is not entirely clear how retrospectivity might apply in this particular bill, but it seems likely under the framework and the structure that exists that, when the regulations are promulgated, the new obligations will apply to existing 457 arrangements. Employers who have entered into an arrangement with a new employee under a 457 visa might suddenly find themselves hit with very large additional responsibilities which could affect the costs and bottom line of their enterprise. We ought to be very careful about imposing these kinds of imposts on small businesses. I am encouraged by the fact that it seems that the government intends that there be widespread consultation in relation to the new regulations. That is indeed encouraging. Of course, we will look to see that that actually takes place and wait to see that that undertaking is discharged.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding, I just want to make a broad point. There is a great deal in this legislation that is taking place under the regulations and a great deal of which we, at this stage, are unaware. We can speculate and we can guess, but until such time as we see it written down we have absolutely no confidence that this will not in fact impose new and deeply onerous obligations on employers. Whether it is as a result of incompetence, inadvertence or design, we find ourselves in a situation where this kind of legislative technique has been applied in an area which is of very great importance to the economy. I trust that it is not the intention of this government to proceed in this way in relation to much legislation in the future. It seems to me to be a highly undesirable way to deal with matters of considerable importance to employers, to people with small businesses in particular, and to those who might come to Australia on short-term arrangements. We will look forward to the regulations when they appear. We will be giving them close scrutiny, and we hope that there will not be any great surprises in those regulations.

          </i>
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I am pleased to support the Migration Legislation Amendment (worker protection) Bill 2008 This legislation is designed to introduce a new framework for the sponsorship of non citizens seeking entry to Australia.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The legislation is a timely and necessary response to the problems associated with the operation of the 457 visa program.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The government is determined to strengthen the integrity of the program and to ensure that workers who come to Australia to assist this nation build for the future are treated with fairness, dignity, and equity. This will be achieved through four main measures:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Providing the structure for better defined sponsorship obligations on employers and other sponsors;
          </li>
          <li>
           Improving information sharing across all levels of government;
          </li>
          <li>
           Expanded powers to monitor and investigated possible non-compliance by sponsors; and
          </li>
          <li>
           The introduction of meaningful penalties for sponsors found in breach of their obligations.
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p class="italic">
          The use of temporary visas, particularly 457 visas, has increased dramatically over the last few years.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This increase is a direct result of the Howard government’s failure to develop a strategic approach to building the skill base of Australia.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Widespread skill shortages have been an impediment to the improved productive performance of this nation and are a clear example of the failed economic policies of the previous government.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The government is determined to build a sophisticated national skill development programme and reduce reliance on temporary overseas labour to build the nation.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This is why we are investing $19.3 billion in education and training.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This $19.3 billion commitment is an investment in Australia’s future.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          We will invest $1.9 billion over five years to fund up to 650,000 new training places.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          These training places will be the engine that drives personal skill development and lifelong career progression.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          While the government’s policy will increase the skill base of our country, significant progress on reducing skill shortages will take time.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This means Australian industry will continue to seek access to the 457 Visa systems.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Given the global economic crisis and the inevitability of Australia being caught up in the worldwide economic downturn there is a high probability that the future use of 457 visas will decline.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Nevertheless, the need to treat all workers in a fair, dignified and acceptable manner is fundamental to the governments approach in this legislation.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Contributions in this debate from the opposition point to a minority of companies being engaged in unacceptable conduct towards 457 Visa holders.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It seemed to me that the plight of migrant workers was being reduced to a statistical analysis.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This is unacceptable to the government.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is illuminating when you analyse the statistics used by the opposition to defend the 457 visa system.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Senator Fierravanti-Wells argues that only 1.67% of sponsors were found to have breached their sponsorship obligations.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Given that Senator Fierravanti-Wells also points to the fact that nearly 19,000 employers use 457 visas then approximately 317 employers are breaching their obligations.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          In my view, this understates the problem as many workers are fearful of reporting breaches due to intimidation from employers.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          317 could be the tip of the iceberg.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Even on the opposition `s own figures thousands of workers are being exploited.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          If one migrant worker is exploited then that is one worker too many.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          If one migrant worker is killed or injured as a result of employer exploitation then that is one worker too many.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          If one migrant worker is denied equal pay for work of equal value then that is one worker too many.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          If one migrant worker is intimidated then that is one worker too many.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          If one migrant worker believes Australia is a bad place to work then that is one worker too many.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I note the opposition claim that the union campaign of opposition to 457 visas had been over sensationalised by the media.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Far be it from me to defend the media however it is fare and reasonable and in the national interest to report the death, injury, exploitation, and intimidation of any worker including migrant workers.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I have had personal experience attempting to assist 457 visa workers who have been outrageously exploited.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The problems with the system have also been documented by the Victorian Magistrates Court, the Victorian Workplace Rights Advocate, and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Human Rights Commission
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Visa Subclass 457 Integrity Review conducted by the industrial relations expert Barbara Deegan also raised major issues with the programme.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Australian human rights commission documented numerous examples of the exploitation of workers on subclass 457 visas. Issues raised by people making complaints include:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           Not being paid overtime
          </li>
          <li>
           Working longer hours or days than non-Visa employees
          </li>
          <li>
           Limited access to sick leave and dismissal if the Visa holder takes sick leave
          </li>
          <li>
           Dismissal because the Visa holder was pregnant
          </li>
          <li>
           Dismissal for taking leave to care for a sick spouse or child
          </li>
          <li>
           Overcharges on rent or other expenses organised by the employer
          </li>
          <li>
           Sexual harassment
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p class="italic">
          Despite the predictable opposition by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Chamber_of_Commerce_and_Industry" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry
          </a>
          to the changes in this legislation, other employer groups such as the Motor Traders Association of Australia noted their “in principle support to strengthen the integrity of the subclass 457 Visa procedures, while ensuring smooth access by employers” they go on to support “the principles of fairness that underpin the subclass 457 Visa regime”
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Queensland government stated that “the support of the Queensland government for the 457 Visa programme is contingent upon a clear understanding that it does not undermine Australian employment opportunities, wages or working conditions”
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Minerals Council of Australia “strongly support the need for the system to be operated with integrity so that all parties have confidence that Australia remains internationally competitive in facilitating Labour movement whilst at the same time safeguarding employment and training opportunities for Australian workers and protecting overseas workers from exploitation”
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The New South Wales government “supports the Australian government’s efforts to reform the employer sponsored temporary migration program. These reforms should ensure the program is flexible and responsive to the needs of Australian employers, while respecting the rights and dignity of employer- sponsored migrants and ensuring transparency, accountability and integrity in the administration of the program”
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The Deegan report has formulated a range of recommendations (67 in all) that go to the problems with the 457 visa system and proposed resolution to the problems.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">

          <p class="italic">
           I commend this bill with its intent that it will better protect foreign workers from improper practices by Australian migration sponsors.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I note that the bill aims to make changes to sub class 457 temporary residence visas to provide greater flexibility in Ministerial approval of group sponsorships, improved information about sponsor responsibilities, increased powers to explore non-compliant sponsors and harsher penalties.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I will not take up more time of the Senate going through the specific mechanisms by which this will be achieved. However, I have a number of points on which I would like clarification from the Minister in the committee stage.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Firstly, this bill sets up a framework in which regulations will be developed to enable the bills broader goals. Could the Minister please provide information on the nature and detail of these regulations as they currently stand?
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Secondly, I note that red tape, requirements for quantifiable training programs and external training providers can make sponsorship onerous for smaller and niche businesses. In what ways will these changes, if any, will these changes make it easier for these businesses to become approved sponsors?
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Finally, I note that medical examinations and English testing can produce significant delays in departmental processing of individual applicants and suggest that these new provisions are to reduce some of these delays. Is this an accurate interpretation? And if so, what measures does the Minister plan to reduce these delays for all 457 visa applicants?
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           With these things in mind, I support the second reading of this bill and look forward to the Minister’s response in the committee stage.

            I rise today to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The bill is a welcome move in proving a more robust framework for temporary working visa arrangements, particularly for workers on 457 visas.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            457 visas have been a very contentious part of Australia’s broader immigration system. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Greens
            </a>
            have always had serious concerns about the scheme while recognising the policy intent behind it.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It is a scheme that needs to balance a genuine need for skilled workers in certain industries and occupations with protection for those workers. There is also a need to ensure the scheme does not provide a disincentive for the provision of training opportunities for workers in Australia.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            This is a difficult balancing act. In the past we believe the balance was not met. We along with many others were concerned that 457 visas were becoming the first option for employers, often resulting in workers being exploited.

             Bill provisions
            </b>
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The bill before us today is a start in beginning to address some of the problems of 457 visas.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The bill addresses four key areas:
           </p>
           <ul>
            <li>
             Expanded powers to monitor and investigate employer non-compliance with the 457 visa scheme;
            </li>
            <li>
             A framework for punitive penalties for employers found to be in breach of their obligations
            </li>
            <li>
             Improved information sharing between government agencies to improve compliance; and
            </li>
            <li>
             A redefined sponsorship obligations framework for employers of 457 visa workers and a range of other temporary work visas
            </li>
           </ul>
           <p class="italic">
            The improved compliance regime, inspectorate powers and information sharing provisions are welcome. It is always the case that the integrity of a scheme such as this depends as much on compliance than on the standards to be complied with.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We support the provision setting out the investigative powers to monitor workplaces and conduct site visits to determine whether employers are complying with the redefined sponsorship obligations and making those powers similar to the powers of workplace, inspectors under the Workplace Relations Act 1996.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We expect sufficient resources will be provided by the Department to ensure that the compliance framework is effective and those sponsors that do try and exploit workers will be discovered and investigated.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We further support the instigation of a civil penalty regime with fines of up to $33 000 as well as the ability to cancel an employer’s approval as a sponsor or bar them from making applications for approval as a sponsor for a period of time. We believe a civil penalty regime is entirely appropriate for the breaching of sponsorship obligations.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Some concern has been raised from the business community about the transitional provisions of the bill extending these measures to existing 457 visa sponsors.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greens" rel="nofollow">
             The Greens
            </a>
            support the transitional provisions and the application of the new compliance regime, powers of inspectors and information sharing laws applying to current sponsors. We also support any new sponsorship obligations made by regulation to apply to current visa sponsors and workers.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">

             Lack of regulations
            </b>
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The main concern we have with this bill is that it provides for sponsorship obligations to be made by regulations but we have not yet had a chance to consider what the Government believes those obligations should be.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It would have been preferable to debate this bill in the context of draft regulations.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            I ask the Minister to guarantee that he will release an exposure draft of the regulations, particularly those establishing the sponsorship obligations, before they are finalised.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            While the regulations will be disallowable, a disallowance is a blunt instrument for dealing with details and these regulations will be full of details. An exposure draft on the regulations will allow a debate on the details.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            I would also like to take this opportunity to draw the Senate’s attention to the United Nations Convention on the Protection of All Migrant Workers and their Families. It is not a Convention Australia has signed but it does lay down the basic rights of migrant workers. Particularly with respect to workers rights issues, we would expect the Government to take the Convention into consideration.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The convention holds that migrant workers should be afforded basic human rights such as not being held in slavery or servitude or be required to perform forced or compulsory labour; that migrant workers have freedom of expression and freedom of religion; that migrant workers shall to be subject to arbitrary or unlawful interference with their privacy or be arbitrarily deprived of property - all pretty non-controversial I would think.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Equally with respect to employment it should be non-controversial to apply these Convention standards - that migrant workers shall be treated equally in respect of remuneration, and other condition of work such as overtime, hours of work, rest breaks, holidays with pay, health and safety and termination of the employment relationship.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">

             The Convention
            </a>
            also states that migrant workers have the right to medical care and that the children of migrant workers have the right to access education.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We urge the Government to take into account the Convention and consider a “rights based” approach to protecting temporary workers.

           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            A rights based approach is particularly important if the seasonal worker program will be covered by this bill in the future.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We are unclear at this stage whether it is the Government’s intention for the seasonal worker program to be governed by this legislation. The framework certainly suggests that it should be, with regulations being able to establish different obligations for different visas, and with the enforcement and compliance regime.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The Greens are not opposed to the trail of a seasonal worker scheme but we are concerned to ensure that the exploitation of 457 workers that has occurred is not repeated again.

            </a>
            when in welcoming more robust regime of obligations, reporting, regulation and enforcement, it also indicated:
           </p>
           <dl>
            <dt>
            </dt>
            <dd>
             “it remains our position that the fundamental issues that must be addressed relate to the reintroduction of labour market testing, mandatory payment of market rates and employment of 457 workers on collective agreements.
            </dd>
            <dt>
            </dt>
            <dd>
             We believe that these reforms would remove the motive and capacity of employers to use 457 workers in circumstances other than those where a legitimate skills shortage exists. They would also mediate the inherent vulnerability of 457 workers attributed to the direct link between the employment relationship with a single employer and the right to stay in Australia to work. Failure to address these questions will leave in place the source of the current problems.”
            </dd>
           </dl>
           <p class="italic">
            The submissions to the Deegan Review and the Discussion Paper provide a useful summary of the problems encountered by many 457 visa workers and point to issues that the Government needs to address.

             Wages and costs
            </b>
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The issue of wages for 457 workers is important for a couple of key reasons. Appropriate wages ensure that migrant workers are not exploited but they also mean that the temporary worker scheme is not used to undermine wages for other workers.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We welcome the increase in the Minimum Salary Level made recently but we question whether the

             MSL
            </a>
            formula is the most appropriate way of dealing with wages. We would like to see a requirement for salaries to be at market rates. The 457 scheme must be about bringing in needed skilled workers, not cheap labour.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The Greens are also inclined to support requirements for sponsors to pay travel costs, costs associated with recruitment migration agent services and registration or licensing fees. We also believe there is a strong case for sponsors to pay for income protection and medical expenses or health insurance for visa holders.

           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It is not just through low wages that temporary migrant workers can be exploited. There is no question that there have been and are 457 visa workers who have exploited. The trade unions have played an important role in exposing these situations such as appalling accommodation, unjustified deductions from pay, workers doing work they are trained for.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Most significantly we recognise that many 457 workers, especially those working in the semi-skilled jobs, are vulnerable to threats of deportation.

            A final important matter I wish to touch on is skills and training. The 457 visa program is specifically designed to allow temporary workers with skills not readily available to employers. The program needs to be carefully directed to areas with genuine skills shortages and to ensure that 457 visas do not become a substitute for local skills development.

            While we recognise that no matter how fast we can train people up, some industries will continue to need temporary workers. The engineering profession for example demonstrated the shortage could not readily be made up though local training —we just aren’t graduating enough engineers.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            But the government needs to make sure that employers are also investing in the local workforce for long term sustainability. We support obligations on employers to demonstrate a commitment to education and training for the long term.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Similarly, the Greens support a requirement not to use 457 workers as strike breakers. This goes against the intention of the program and could undermine the local workforce exercising their democratic rights.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            These are some of the matters we expect the regulations setting out the sponsorship obligations to address.

             Conclusion

           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            On a number of the issues I have raised today I wish to seek some clarification from the Minister.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The Greens believe the 457 visa program cannot be an easy or cheap alternative for employers. We support the measures in this bill to improve the integrity of the scheme and in particular the compliance framework.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We would have preferred to have debated this bill having had an opportunity to consider draft regulations. The obligations on sponsors that the regulations will contain are pivotal to the future integrity of the scheme.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            The Greens will be considering the regulations carefully and as I mentioned before expect the Minister to provide an exposure draft and open them up to appropriate debate and scrutiny.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Despite the lack of regulations the Greens are prepared to support this bill now given the other elements of the bill relating to a stronger compliance framework will apply to current sponsors of 457 workers.

            <p class="italic">
             This bill was introduced to the Senate by Senator Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship to provide for better protection of migrant workers in Australia.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The amendments before the Senate today arose out of a review of the 457 visa program which the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudd_Government" rel="nofollow">
              Rudd Government
             </a>
             announced earlier this year.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The subclass 457 or Temporary Business Entry visa was introduced by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Government" rel="nofollow">
              Howard Government
             </a>
             in August 1996 to provide temporary relief for businesses suffering from skills shortages.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Under the 457 visa, an employer can sponsor an overseas worker to work in Australia on a temporary basis.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The 457 visa was intended as a stop-gap measure —not a substitute —for the shortage of skills in Australian industries.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             However, the explosion of 457 visa applicants in recent years is symptomatic of the failure of the Howard Government to address Australia’s skills crisis.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             In the first year of the visa program’s operation, 1997-98, there were just over 30,000 visas granted.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             These figures include eligible secondary applicants – or family members living in Australia with the primary applicant for the period of their stay.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The number of visas granted has steadily increased over time, but appears to have increased dramatically in the past three or four years.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             By 2005-06 the number of 457 visas granted had reached just over 70,000, up from 48,000 the previous year.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             In the year to June 2008 (the year just gone) a massive 110,000, of what are now known as Temporary Skilled Migration Visas, were issued.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The rapid growth in 457 visas is symptomatic of the Howard Government’s failure over its twelve long years in office to plan for the skills needs of Australia.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             While they were raking in masses of revenue off the back of the resources boom, they had plenty of opportunity to invest in the skills and qualifications of Australians.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Instead they allowed Australia’s skills crisis to continue unchecked.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The Rudd Government, on the other hand, is serious about addressing the skills crisis.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             One of the roles of government is to forecast the skills needs of the country and to take steps to skill our workforce so that Australia’s skills needs can be met first and foremost by Australian workers.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The Rudd Government will give priority to training and skilling Australian workers so that our own workforce can meet the skills needs of industry.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             We will work to ensure that Australia’s workforce has the capabilities necessary to fill as many Australian jobs as possible.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             This is why we announced in the May Budget that we would make a $19.3 billion investment in education and training to provide employment opportunities for Australians.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             We have committed to this investment for the future because we recognise that skills are a vital element in a productive economy.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Having said that, we recognise that developing qualifications takes time and so, therefore, will not meet the immediate skills needs of industry.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Consequently - we support the 457 visa program as a temporary measure to meet short term skills shortages.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             But a program for temporary overseas workers should not end up becoming a long term response to Australia’s failure to plan for its own skills needs as it was under the previous government.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The other unfortunate side effect of the 457 visa program has been the mistreatment and exploitation of workers.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             While the vast majority of employers do the right thing, the Rudd Government share concerns, with others, about the incidence of employer breaches in the subclass 457 visa program.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             There were 1353 employers formally warned and 192 sponsors formally sanctioned in 2007-2008.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Comparatively in 2006-2007 there were only 95 sanctions and 313 formal warnings - so you can see that this government is acting to protect these workers.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Australia cannot take pride in its 457 visa program until we take serious steps to combat the human misery visited on overseas workers by some unscrupulous employers.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             I quote Senator Evans who recently stated:
            </p>
            <dl>
             <dt>
             </dt>
             <dd>
              “The temporary working visa scheme is only sustainable if the community is confident that overseas workers are not being exploited or used to undermine local wages and conditions”.
             </dd>
            </dl>
            <p class="italic">
             This is what the bill before the Senate today seeks to address.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             On 28 August 2007 the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">
              Sydney Morning Herald
             </a>
             reported three deaths of workers sponsored on 457 visas.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             In two of the three cases, the workers were undertaking menial labouring work instead of the skilled work they were brought over for.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             They had also complained to their families that their working conditions had been a lot tougher than they were told to expect before they came to Australia.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             In the third case, the worker was killed by a tree while operating a chainsaw—a job for which he had no previous experience.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             All three left behind families including wives and children.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Clearly employers are breaching their obligations under the temporary skilled migration program if they expect overseas workers to engage in work that do not employ the skills they were apparently brought over for.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             However, it is one thing to have reasonable obligations for sponsors of 457 visas, it is another entirely to have the monitoring and oversight to effectively enforce those obligations.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The workers referred to by the Herald’s article may have survived had they felt confident to complain about the conditions they were employed under.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             These cases reveal an unfortunate feature of the 457 visa program which is the vulnerability of workers to exploitation.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             This vulnerability has been exposed in various court cases.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             For example fifteen 457 visa holders employed by Hanssen Pty Ltd signed unapproved
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workplace_Agreements" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Workplace Agreements

             for which their employer failed to provide information statements.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The workers did not speak up for fear of deportation and their employer exploited that fear.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             A similar vulnerability was identified by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Magistrate" rel="nofollow">
              Federal Magistrate
             </a>
             in the case of Zefirrelli Pizza Restaurant, who underpaid employees on 457 visas.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             There have been other examples where visa holders who question the actions of their employer have been dismissed and then deported as an example to other workers to ensure their compliance.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             When we hear about cases of workers on 457 visas who got justice because one of them was brave enough to complain to the authorities, it really should make us wonder how many more cases go unreported.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             As I said in my speech on Fair Work Australia, there is no greater financial or human cost in workplace relations than the failure to have effective

             arrangements.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             Such arrangements rely on the ability of workers to raise complaints and issues.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             457 visa workers cannot raise

             &amp;S concerns if they are silenced by fear.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             OH&amp;S is especially important for 457 visa workers as they tend to be employed in high-risk industries such as construction, manufacturing and mining.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             This is why the temporary skilled migration scheme needs proactive monitoring, why workers need to be made aware of their rights, and why employers need to have their obligations enforced with penalties that provide an effective deterrent.

            <p class="italic">

            </p>

            <p class="italic">
             Of course the Rudd Government recognises that reform is overdue and we are leading on it.

             On 18 April 2008, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Evans, established an independent integrity review into the 457 subclass visa.

             The bill will allow for greater information sharing between the Department, the sponsor and the visa holder allowing all three parties to be better informed of each others’ circumstances.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             There will also be provisions for information sharing between Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to facilitate a whole-of-government approach to compliance.

             Provisions in the bill will amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953 to allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information to the

            <p class="italic">
             The bill will introduce a better regime for monitoring compliance with the obligations of the visa.

             New inspector powers will be granted modelled on the workplace inspector powers in the Workplace Relations Act 1996.

             The bill will also improve the framework for sponsorship, setting out obligations for approved sponsors in Regulations that for the first time will be enforceable by law.

             The Regulations will be developed in consultation with stakeholders and finalised in the coming months.

            <p class="italic">
             The Regulations will establish a process to vary an approval so that an approved sponsor does not have to go through the whole sponsorship process again just to seek a variation to their sponsorship.

             The bill introduces a range of provisions to better protect temporary overseas skilled workers. It includes:

            <ul>
             <li>
              improved monitoring powers,

             <li>
              the introduction of civil penalties for sponsors who breach obligations,
             </li>
             <li>
              clarifying sponsor obligations and ensuring they are enforceable under the Act, and
             </li>
             <li>
              greater information sharing between governments and Government agencies

             This reform process is central to maintaining the integrity of Australia’s temporary skilled migration regime and restoring community confidence in the protection of the rights of overseas workers.

            <p class="italic">
             While these reforms are important and necessary, the Government is open to advice and feedback on further reform.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             The Rudd Government has therefore established a Skilled Migration Consultative Panel comprising representatives from State and Territory governments, the business community and other industrial stakeholders.
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             This Panel will consider proposals for temporary skills migration reform and advise on their impact on business, the Australian workforce and the broader community.

             The Rudd government has worked to strengthen the integrity of the temporary skilled working visa program by:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>
              As of 1st August this year increasing the minimum salary level for subclass 457 visa holders (for the first time in two years) and that applies to existing visa holders.
             </li>
             <li>
              Appointed an Industrial Relations Commissioner, Barbara Deegan to review the integrity of the current subclass 457 visa program with the aim of better protecting overseas workers.
             </li>
             <li>
              This report will be referred to the Skilled Migration consultative Panel which is made up of industry, union and state government representatives.
             </li>
             <li>
              And introduced the Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008 which has four main provisions:

             I would like to congratulate the Minister on his initiative in bringing this reform proposal to the Senate and for the sake of 457 visa holders throughout Australia I urge all Senators to support it. Thank you.

              I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important piece of legislation.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              In my first speech, I wished the Leader of the Senate and Immigration Minister well as he attempted to untangle the mess that the previous government made of our immigration system.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              In particular, I highlighted that the exploitation of workers under 457 visas still needed to be resolved.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I pointed out that, unless all workers in Australia enjoyed the same rights and entitlements, even those whose licence to stay here is only temporary, our immigration system would be undermined
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The Australian public, and Australian workers in particular, need to be assured that the immigration system is not being used as a backdoor way to undermine Australian working conditions
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I am pleased the work needed to restore faith in our immigration system is now underway through this bill and other work forthcoming.

              is a positive reform that will help put a stop to unscrupulous behaviour.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It will help put an end to the exploitation of workers, who arrive in Australia with skills that assist our economy to grow, but who experience abuse and mistreatment.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It will put an end to the unplanned and unregulated explosion of the Subclass 457 visa program.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It will help ensure that Australian workers wages and conditions are not undermined.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This is particularly important in these times of economic uncertainty
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              457 visas are, in and of themselves, not the villain in this picture.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              457s were originally brought about to address the widespread skills shortages.
             </p>

               Western Australia
              </a>
              has particularly benefited from the skills that temporary workers have brought to our state and our economy.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The resources boom has provided employment for many, particularly in WA.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              And still more skilled workers were needed.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              But as we know, this was partly because the previous government had failed to invest in skills development, in long term education and training.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Addressing the skills shortage is a priority for the

             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              We are addressing the skills shortage - not only by fixing up the 457 visa program - but also through the provision of $19.3 billion in education and training opportunities in the 2008-09 budget.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">

               The Government

              has committed an investment of $1.9 billion over five years for up to 630,000 new training places.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              We’re building the skills and knowledge for the jobs of the future.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The subclass 457 visa program has benefited employers by providing access to migrants with ready skills that have helped businesses to grow.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It has also given some temporary migrants the opportunity to work in Australia:
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               to use and develop their skills;
              </li>
              <li>
               to earn good wages; and
              </li>
              <li>
               to enjoy good working conditions.
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p class="italic">
              But that hasn’t been not the case for all temporary migrant workers.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Increasing demand for skilled workers, particularly over the last five years, has put pressure on the 457 visa program.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The scheme has grown rapidly.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It has expanded to include lower-skilled occupations
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              And this expansion has brought with it many temporary workers with lower levels of English language skills.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This context has led to increased exploitation and abuse of workers under the scheme.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Workers have been exploited in a number of ways - including being underpaid and not paid at the correct salary level and even not being paid at all.

             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Cases like that of the company Aprint.

               In September
              </a>
              last year, this company withheld $93,000 in wages from four Chinese 457 visa workers.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The workers were made to work more than 60 hours a week.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              More than ten thousand dollars was taken from their wages for lawyers and travel fees.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The company was fined $9,240 for breaching the Workplace Relations Act.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              But amazingly, the company was not subject to any penalty in relation to breaches of their obligations under the 457 visa scheme.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Recently, I met with a group of Filipino workers who are currently in Australia on 457 visas.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I heard their stories of exploitation.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              One group of workers told me they were required by their employer to live in one house.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Rent was deducted from their wages for the privilege of living in this house.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              They were not free to move to other, more suitable or cheaper accommodation.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Two of the workers wanted to move out.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              They wanted to live in different accommodation.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              They wanted choice over this critical aspect of their living conditions
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              But after repeatedly requesting that the company stop deducting rent from their wages, they were told that the house they were living in was owned by the company, and therefore, that rent deductions would not be stopped.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This is not an isolated case, there are many others just like it
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The union advocated on behalf of these workers, and finally, they were paid back the amount of rent that was deducted from their wages.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Before this union advocacy, they had no choice, no options and no say.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This kind of exploitation has led workers, their unions and many employers to raise serious concerns about the integrity of the program.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              What such examples of exploitation make clear - is the need for penalties to be applied to unscrupulous employers.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              And this legislation does just this.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Labor is committed to ensuring that employers know their rights and responsibilities under the scheme and act accordingly
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The government is also committed to making sure that local workers do not lose job opportunities to workers on 457 visas.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Employers must abide by conditions that make sure that we keep providing employment and training opportunities for Australian workers.

              $19.6 million has been allocated in the 2008-2009 budget by the Rudd government to improve the processing and compliance aspects of the 457 visa program.

             <p class="italic">
              This is of critical importance because it will allow for more trained officers who will be able to conduct site visits to make sure sponsors are complying with their obligations.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              These inspectors will be able to
             </p>
             <ul>
              <li>
               Inspect the premises;
              </li>
              <li>
               Interview people
              </li>
              <li>
               Require that sponsors produce particular documents, and
              </li>
              <li>
               Copy documents
              </li>
             </ul>
             <p class="italic">
              Sponsors who do not cooperate with a written request to produce a document may face up to 6 months imprisonment.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The exploitation of workers through not paying wages or paying incorrect wages will be dealt with by penalties such as fines of up to $33,000 for companies that breach their obligations.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The bill will also improve information sharing across government to make sure that the correct salary is being paid to workers.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Again, this will help put a stop to the exploitation of workers.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It will also provide clarity in relation to the obligations of employers and other sponsors.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This includes providing clarity on the time period within which a sponsor must meet their obligations and the way in which the obligations are to be satisfied.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              And these obligations will be, for the first time, enforceable by law.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Sponsors who have already been approved may not need to go through the whole process of seeking sponsorship approval when they want to vary their sponsorship.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This will make the whole sponsorship approval process much more efficient.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              So this legislation will be good for employers and it will be good for workers.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It is the first step in the process of rectifying a system that contributed to the exploitation of workers under the previous government.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              But there is more to be done.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I was pleased to meet with workers on 457 visas recently here in parliament and with delegates from the AMWU, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANF" rel="nofollow">
               ANF
              </a>
              and the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
               CFMEU
              </a>
              about this issue.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Through this delegation and through individual meetings with visa holders I have heard that there is a real need to improve access to health and community services for workers and their families.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Employers should not be able to direct workers as to whether seek medical attention.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              As the AMWU points out – imagine a situation where a worker is sick and needs medical treatment but pressure is put on them not to attend health services by the employer because of the cost.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              That is not an acceptable situation for any worker.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Many of these workers, and the families that sometimes accompany them, live in isolation.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              For some, their world is limited to the workplace –
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Even their accommodation is dictated by their employer
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              But more than that, workers are even isolated in the workplace, isolated from fellow workers who are Australian residents
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              457 visa holders should have the right to collectively bargain their wages and conditions alongside their work colleagues who are Australian residents.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              They should not, as some do now, experience fear and intimidation when trying to find out what their rights are.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              They should not, as some do now, experience fear and intimidation when they want to talk to other workers about their pay and conditions.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              They should be in a position, as all Australian workers should be, to feel confident that contacting their union will not bring with it retribution of some kind.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This workplace isolation is compounded by the isolation that families of 457 workers experience.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Those that are fortunate enough to have their families with them sometimes feel cut off from their communities and from services they should be able to access.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              I note there are some very successful programs operating in my home state of WA to break down the isolation experienced by temporary migrant workers and their families.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The AMWU has been successful in working with community organizations and particular groups of workers to develop social networks, so that this isolation can be broken down and workers can get to know their rights.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The government knows there is more work to be done.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              That’s why earlier this year the Minister for Immigration appointed Barbara Deegan to conduct a broad review of the integrity of the 457 visa program.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Ms Deegan’s report clearly states the complexity that 457 visa holders and their sponsors face.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The report details the ways in which 457 visa holders are exploited and the way in which the system, through rapid growth and long term neglect has perpetuated this.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The report paints a way forward including replacing Minimum Salary Levels which visa holders are currently paid under with a fairer market rate system for all workers earning under $100, 000 per annum.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Lack of information about rights and obligations by 457 visa holders is a common theme through the report.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Giving information to workers about their rights can lead to ending exploitation.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Recommendations such as giving information to new applicants regarding realistic pathways to permanent residency such as skill and English language requirements.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              And providing clarity around the right to end their employment and seek work with another employer.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This is to stop insidious situations in which workers feel they cannot speak up about poor and unsafe work practices in case it jeopardizes their application for permanent residency.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The report also recommends that employers be barred from taking money from workers as a result of the worker gaining employment with them and from deducting wages for the payment of any agent.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The report made an important recommendation on the issue of fair pay. Arguing that 457 visa holders should be paid the same as the Australian workers they work alongside.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              This is in the best interests of these workers, equal pay for the same work. Such provisions will also help ensure that employers don’t seek to bring in 457 workers just because it is cheaper, but will only do so when there is a legitimate shortage of appropriate labour. In the current economic climate in an uncertain labour market this is vitally important.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Stopping the exploitation of workers, making sure they have access to information about their rights and making the system run more smoothly and efficiently is the first priority.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              And for that reason I commend this bill to the Senate.

               that will lead to some much needed reform of Australia’s migration policies. My office deals with many constituent enquiries surrounding migration and these enquiries are rarely solved quickly, but require much research and time. Often these enquiries are about reuniting family members, finding employment or gaining citizenship, all situations that can cause significant stress.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Under the previous Government, Australia’s immigration policies were cause for international condemnation, particularly our detention policy. Many people - even Australian citizens - were kept in detention for years, despite posing no danger to the community and children were also trapped in those environments.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               This destructive detention scheme caused much pain to many and cost taxpayers a lot of money. The
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudd_Government" rel="nofollow">
                Rudd Government
               </a>
               is working to change all this and is working to reform the system to take a risk based rather than punitive approach to detention policy.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               This government is committed to protecting our nation from the potential dangers posed by some unauthorised arrivals or unlawful non-citizens, but we are also committed to treating people with dignity.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               We are not putting our country’s security in jeopardy as we make these changes; we are simply putting the concept of human decency back into Australia’s immigration policies. Labor does not believe that we can only protect our nation at the expense of other’s rights and quality of life.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Government" rel="nofollow">
                The Government
               </a>
               is still maintaining mandatory detention for those unlawful people who are not Australian citizens and who present an unacceptable risk to the community or who repeatedly refuse to comply with their visa conditions. Unauthorised boat arrivals will still be subject to mandatory detention for health, identity and security checks. But let me be clear that we will only use detention centres as a last resort and for the shortest practicable time.
              </p>

               The Joint

                Western Australia
               </a>
               with the inquiry and these experiences have given me a deeper understanding of the system. The issue of immigration is always an emotive one and detention centres are something that people are extremely passionate about, one way or the other; this was evident in the 133 submissions received by the inquiry.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The committee has held public hearings in Darwin, Christmas Island, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The information presented by witnesses at these inquiries is often moving and always informative.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The inquiry so far has proven to be very beneficial to the Government and I thank everyone who has taken the time to take us around detention centres, appear as witnesses and make submissions. We are making informed decisions as we move Australia forward.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I am pleased to note that these moves forward haven’t gone unnoticed. Earlier this month the

               The Citizenship Test is another

                Howard Government
               </a>
               policy that caused great distress to my constituents last year. They visited and phoned the office asking many questions with much confusion and fear in their voices. The Rudd Government has also expressed its concerns about the structure and content of the test. For this reason we recently conducted an independent review to determine its fairness and effectiveness.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               On Monday, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans" rel="nofollow">
                Chris Evans
               </a>
               tabled the report resulting from this review. The review found that while 99 per cent of skilled migrants were passing the test, almost one fifth of those who come to Australia as part of the Humanitarian Program are not. This shows that the test is acting as a barrier between people and Australian citizenship, not equipping them for citizenship as intended.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The Review Committee’s central recommendation is for the legislative requirement to have an “adequate knowledge of Australia and of the responsibilities and privileges of Australian citizenship” be linked to concepts and information people need to understand in order to make the Pledge of Commitment. This recommendation is supported by the Government.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Another reform that the Government has made is the abolition of the temporary protection visa regime, a regime which actively prevented refugees from being able to rebuild their lives. The regime denied refugees the entitlements and security of permanent residency, despite our international obligations. Not only was this a further stain on Australia’s reputation but it also entirely failed to serve its claimed purpose.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Evidence shows that the temporary protection visas did nothing to prevent unauthorised boat arrivals, in fact, numbers actually increased not long after the introduction of the regime.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               This treatment of refugees was disgraceful. It is important that we treat these people with respect and recognise the varied benefits of accepting others into our country, including filling skills shortages. The resources boom, low levels of unemployment, and the failure of the previous Government to invest in the education and training, have contributed to skills shortages across the country.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Labor has tackled these skills shortage which were ignored by the Howard Government for so long. In May we released a Budget that invests $19.3 billion in education and training to ensure we continue to provide employment and training opportunities to Australians.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Budget" rel="nofollow">
                The Budget
               </a>
               outlined the Government’s commitment to invest $1.9 billion over five years to fund up to 630,000 new training places. These new places will skill Australians for the jobs of tomorrow and close existing skills gaps.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               While this investment into the education and training of Australians for the future is crucial, we need to take action that will give us immediate results too.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Over the last five years Australian employers have increasingly turned to the temporary skilled migration program to bring in the skilled workers they need. The
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudd_Labor_Government" rel="nofollow">
                Rudd Labor Government
               </a>
               has eased the pressure on employers by adding an extra 31,000 skilled migrants to the 2008-09 migration program.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               We have recognised that this record 30 per cent intake increase could put strain on a department already struggling with demand, and so we are working to tighten up processing procedures and improve servicing standards.

               In light of the current economic situation, the numbers of skilled migrants coming in may change. The migration program is designed to fill positions that can’t be filled locally and Minister Evans is working to better target the program to the areas most in need, including;

               While making amendments to existing programs, the Rudd Government has looked at new ways to assist Australian employers. The Australian horticulture industry reports that up to $700 million in fresh produce is left to rot because of the unmet demand for low skilled workers. We have developed the

               We have also taken action to reform the 457 visa program and this bill will take that reform even further. The previous Government allowed the 457 visa program to run without sufficient safeguards to prevent the exploitation of temporary skilled foreign workers or the undercutting of wages and conditions of Australian workers. Many stories emerged of 457 visa holders being exploited. One case which then

              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               So he was being paid a further $20,000 less than what the visa said he was going to be paid and of course once the twelve months was up and he’d repaid the debt, he was immediately terminated without cause. The economy desperately needs access to temporary skilled labour, but this is only sustainable if the community is confident that temporary overseas workers are not being exploited or used to undermine local wages and conditions. The Rudd Government is committed to improving the 457 visa scheme, whilst protecting the rights of overseas workers along with the employment opportunities of our own citizens.

               On the seventeenth of February this year we announced a package of migration measures designed to help alleviate Australia’s skills and labour shortages and ease inflationary pressures including:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                adding 6000 places to the general skilled migration program;
               </li>
               <li>
                expanding the reciprocal working holiday visa program for young people;
               </li>
               <li>
                allowing working holiday makers who work for at least three months in the construction sector to apply for a further working holiday visa; and
               </li>
               <li>
                appointing an external reference group to advise how temporary work visas could contribute to the supply of skilled labour.
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="italic">
               The Government has made great progress in positive immigration policy reform, and the bill before us today is the next step in that reform process. The Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill makes amendments to the
               <i>
                Migration Act 1958
               </i>
               . The aim of these amendments is to enhance the framework for the sponsorship of non-citizens seeking entry to Australia.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The new framework will strengthen the integrity of temporary working visa arrangements, including the existing Subclass 457 visa program.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               This will be achieved through four main measures:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                providing the structure for better defined sponsorship obligations for employers and other sponsors;
               </li>
               <li>
                improved information sharing across all levels of government;
               </li>
               <li>
                expanded powers to monitor and investigate possible non-compliance by sponsors; and
               </li>
               <li>
                the introduction of meaningful penalties for sponsors found in breach of their obligations.
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="italic">
               Let me go through these in more detail. The bill proposes to amend the Migration Act to provide that the Migration Regulations 1994 may specify the obligations to which particular classes of sponsor will be subject, together with when those obligations apply and how they may be satisfied. These obligations are not specified in the bill as a high degree of flexibility is necessary for the program to operate effectively over time and there will be a need to prescribe additional obligations as more visas are brought in with the new framework. If the obligations were written in this bill, it would make putting additional obligations in a very slow and difficult process.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Though the obligations have not been written, I can say that when prescribed in the Migration Regulations, they will:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                lead to effective and efficient identification of non-compliance - this could be done for example by obliging sponsors to cooperate with monitoring by the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
                 Department of Immigration and Citizenship
                </a>
                ;
               </li>
               <li>
                discourage inappropriate use of temporary skilled visa programs - this could be done for example by obliging sponsors to reimburse the Commonwealth for location, detention and removal expenses should the visa holder abscond; and
               </li>
               <li>
                provide an effective price signal to encourage the hiring and training of Australian citizens and permanent residents; and, most importantly protect overseas workers from exploitation.
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="italic">
               The current provisions for the disclosure of information have proved insufficient for effective and efficient operation of the temporary skilled migration program. For example, the Department cannot at present lawfully collect contact details of Subclass 457 visa holders from larger employers for the purpose of providing those visa holders with information about their rights and entitlements in Australia.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill will rectify this by expanding the range of circumstances in which the information may be shared between the Department, the sponsor and the visa holder. These amendments will ensure that the three parties involved in the program will be adequately informed of each others circumstances.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The bill will insert new provisions which amend the Taxation Administration Act 1953. These amendments will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information, if the tax information relates to a visa holder, former visa holder, approved sponsor, or former approved sponsor. This will allow the Department of Immigration and Citizenship to confirm with the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
                Australian Taxation Office

               what taxable salary is being paid to visa holders.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The third main measure is another move designed to increase the protection of our workers from overseas. Amendments proposed in the bill will give specially trained employees of the Commonwealth the power to monitor compliance with program requirements, including the redefined obligations. These officers will be known as Inspectors and will be appointed by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Inspectors will be able to conduct site visits as well as request relevant documents from sponsors in writing within specified timeframes.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               The powers of these Inspectors will include:
              </p>
              <ul>
               <li>
                inspect the premises;
               </li>
               <li>
                interview any person;
               </li>
               <li>
                require the production of documents; and
               </li>
               <li>
                copy such documents.
               </li>
              </ul>
              <p class="italic">
               The final measure I wish to discuss is the introduction of penalties. Current administrative sanctions have failed to encourage compliance in all circumstances. The amendments proposed in the bill introduce a civil penalties framework to actively discourage non-compliance.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               This will allow civil legal action to be taken against sponsors who are found in breach of the redefined obligations found in the Migration Regulations. The maximum penalty per offence, which will be determined by a Court taking into account all relevant circumstances, is $6 600 for an individual and $33 000 for a body corporate. It is hoped that these penalties will encourage sponsors and visa holders to meet their obligations so that this system can be as fair and effective as possible.
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               Migrants play an important role in our country and they deserve to be treated as equal to Australian citizens. This bill will work towards that equality by ensuring that the working conditions of sponsored visa holders meet Australian standards. I commend the bill to the Senate.

                This bill includes amendments which will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information of visa holders, former visa holders, approved sponsors, or former approved sponsors to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship in order ensure correct salary levels are being paid to all visa holders.

               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                As an important initial measure, this government introduced a wage increase of 3.8 per cent as of October this year. This increase comes after a two year freeze on the wages for 457 visa holders under the previous government.

               <p class="italic">
                In June 2007 the previous Government introduced a Bill that included provisions which:
               </p>
               <ul>
                <li>
                 tightened the monitoring and sanction provisions that applied to 457 visa holders;

               </ul>
               <p class="italic">
                This was the previous Government belatedly attempting to address stories and examples of abuse of the 457 visa system.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Many of these abuses and cases of exploitation of workers were being characterised by commentators as “horror stories”. Yet in the face of these horror stories, the previous government did not prioritise the legislation and the bill was not passed before the 2007 Election.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Even still, a total of 192 sponsors were formally sanctioned and a further 1353 employers were formally warned in 2007-08. This compares with 95 sanctions and 313 formal warnings issued in 2006-07.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                Examples of the horror stories involving 457 visas include the situation that arose with the company Dartbridge Welding.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                This matter attracted a great deal of national media attention when it arose in late 2006. Dartbridge Welding recruited approximately 40 welders from the Philippines.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                The welders were charged a $3,000 recruitment fee by a Filipino recruitment firm. They were also charged high levels of interest on this debt. Upon arrival in Australia, the welders were immediately taken to a bank and were presented with direct debit authorities to sign to give the employer and recruitment company the right to directly debit funds from the welders bank accounts.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                The welders were placed in houses on the western outskirts of Brisbane, and charged $175.00 per week for rent, medical insurance and transport. The employer placed 8 people in each house, with two per each bedroom. The first job the welders undertook at Dartbridge was the fabrication of their beds.
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                The workers were subjected to a great deal of verbal abuse and threatening behaviour by the owner of Dartbridge. Following contact with the

                 AMWU

                the welders joined the Union. Three of the most outspoken welders were dismissed from their employment.

                2007, Mr Yu Tu Chuoan of Aprint, withheld $93,000 in wages from four Chinese 457 visa workers. Mr Chuoan made the four work more than 60 hours a week and deducted more than ten thousand dollars from their wages for lawyers and travel fees.

                Chuoan was fined $9,240 for breaching the Workplace Relations Act. He was not subject to any penalty in relation to breaches of his obligations under the 457 visa scheme. Under this legislation this will no longer be the case.

                 The bill makes clear that if the sponsorship obligations are not satisfied, the department may impose one, several or all of the sanctions on the approved sponsor (or former approved sponsor). For example, if an approved sponsor was not paying the minimum salary level (

                <p class="italic">
                 The program has begun to attract greater numbers of tradespeople, as well as more workers from non-English speaking nations such as India, China and the Philippines.

                <p class="italic">
                 With greater communication difficulties and lower levels of education, this growing group of employees has been at much higher risk of exploitation by unscrupulous employers.

                <p class="italic">
                 Sadly, under the watch of the former Howard Government, exploitation became a scourge on the scheme.

                <p class="italic">
                 Initially denying any problems with the 457 visas, then defending her department by virtue of the fact it could not properly monitor the scheme, the former minister ultimately ordered a stop on the public release of information about the program in 2006.
                </p>
                <p class="italic">
                 However, through the media, the Australian public began to hear about employers who were undermining local wages and conditions by bringing in 457 visa workers.

                 By June last year, the then Minister for Immigration

                <p class="italic">
                 However, stakeholders were not properly consulted in this process.

                <p class="italic">
                 This failure meant many of the system’s shortcomings were not identified, let alone acted upon.

                <p class="italic">
                 Of the changes that were made, some were too heavy-handed, resulting in an increase in red tape across the scheme—even for the majority of employers who had been doing the right thing.

                <p class="italic">
                 Overall, it was a case of too little, too late.

                <p class="italic">
                 The program needed a real overhaul, not just some minor tweaking.

                 And we need the confidence of stakeholders at home if we are to engage employers to take up the economic opportunities the scheme offers.

                <p class="italic">
                 One important element in the attempt to gain the confidence of the major players is wages.

                <p class="italic">
                 And in the 2008/09 Budget, the Rudd government gave real and meaningful backing to its commitment to improve the temporary skilled migration program by allocating $19.6 million towards that end.

                 Ultimately, the Subclass 457 visa system needs to be streamlined and transparent if we are to prove its integrity to the Australian people.

                 And it must not allow the exploitation of the overseas workers it seeks to attract to employment in Australia.

                <p class="italic">
                 In order to achieve these necessary advances, we have begun analysing and addressing stakeholder apprehensions with the scheme.

                <p class="italic">

                  I rise today to speak on the Migration Legislation Amendment (Workers Protection) Bill of 2008. I have taken an interest in this legislation and this area since I was heavily involved as the Deputy Chair of the

                  </a>
                  on Migration into the inquiry into 457 temporary visas conducted last year.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  That inquiry, “Temporary Visas, Permanent Benefits,” served as a wakeup call to a number of us about the 457 visa scheme. While we maintain that the highest priority must be placed on providing Australians with job opportunities and training, the simple truth is that the labour shortage and the skills crisis meant that for a number of businesses it was necessary to get hold of labour as soon as possible. The 457 program should never overshadow the need to develop the training and skills of working Australians.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  That is where the 457 visa program comes in. By providing temporary skilled migration, it allows Australia to continue its economic development without being handicapped by a lack of skilled labour. It was designed to address areas of skills shortages within Australia. However, as the skills crisis has deepened, the needs of the labour market demand has changed. The scheme has begun pulling in a larger proportion of people in trade level occupations, as well as increasing numbers of workers from non English speaking countries. These particularly include the Philippines, China and India.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  It is now recognised that workers in occupations below the professional level and from non English speaking backgrounds are at much higher risk of exploitation, particularly in the areas where we have traditionally seen industrial relations problems.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  During the inquiry we travelled all across Australia and heard some horror stories about mismanagement of employees, exploitation and quite frankly disgusting treatment of a number of foreign nationals brought here to work under the 457 scheme.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  We heard from unions about workers too scared to talk to the Department about their mistreatment, or even more appallingly forbidden to talk. Even worse we heard about how some of the workers, lacking in basic English skills, were completely unable to function in Australia.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  We heard that some migrants who came here on the 457 program were being exploited in slave like conditions and weren’t being paid the minimum agreed wages. We heard the sad case of Pedro Balading from the Philippines. Mr Balading came to the

Not only was he lied to about his job and duties, but he then faced the indignity of his wages being garnished for his living expenses.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  There was also the case of Mohammed Nayem who came here from Singapore who was forced to work 50 hour weeks, paid for 38 hours a week and then had $100 forcibly deducted from each pay packet as rent for his room – a converted office that he shared with five other men.

                  I was truly shocked at the level of abuse of the scheme that was occurring. These abuses convinced me at the time that the Scheme, required serious reform if it was to continue.

                  It is vitally important that these reforms are passed in 2008. We have consistently demonstrated our commitment to improving the integrity of the 457 visa program over a number of years and here is tangible proof of that commitment.

                 <p class="italic">
                  For those in the Chamber who may be unfamiliar with this program, the 457 visa program is designed to allow overseas workers to enter Australia for a period of four years and to work in skilled occupations.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  The scheme has increased four-fold in the last four years with around 110,570 people currently on the scheme in Australia.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  In June of last year, the previous Government introduced a Bill that was belatedly aimed at addressing some of the problems that we had noticed in the 457 program. However that Bill was never debated and not passed prior to the previous Election. The Minister at the time,

                   Kevin Andrews

                  put forward these changes too late, and in a heavy handed way which meant that everyone involved in the scheme was caught up in extra red tape.

                 <p class="italic">
                  The Rudd Labor Government recognises that the ground here is shifting and that the role of the temporary skilled migration programme is changing. In order for Australia to remain competitive in the global labour market it is essential that we offer a robust, streamlined and transparent temporary migration program.

                 <p class="italic">
                  That is why we have put forward this bill. That is why we have already introduced a number of reforms aimed at improving the 457 scheme.

                 <p class="italic">
                  The bill applies to all temporary worker visas. It doesn’t matter if you are an occupational trainee or a medical practitioner you will be covered. This measure was brought down in part to stop employers simply moving employees between visa classes to avoid the bill’s provisions.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  The bill also now applies to visas that are issued under labour agreements. This is another common sense solution to stop employers simply moving their employees onto a different agreement.

                 <p class="italic">

                  One of the major issues that we found in the Migration Committee investigation was the lack of proper information sharing between Government agencies. Often it was more than a case of the right hand not knowing what the left hand was doing, and it led to serious breakdowns in communication which disadvantaged workers.

                  We have introduced new inspector powers which can be used to monitor employer’s compliance with their obligations. They are modelled on the powers given to inspectors in the Workplace Relations Act of 1996. They allow officers of the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations to carry out the following functions.

                 <p class="italic">
                  In addition to these changes, the bill will allow the Commissioner of Taxation to disclose tax information if the information relates to a visa holder, former visa holder, approved sponsor or former sponsor. This is at the discretion of the Minister for Immigration and will allow the Department to confirm details with the Tax Office with regard to salary and other allowances payable to visa holders.

                 <p class="italic">
                  Of course we are aware that it is important that measures to provide oversight to 457 visa holders must be implemented quickly. That is why existing business sponsors will be subject to the sponsorship obligations from the date the bill commences. All existing undertakings will be replaced by the new provisions of the bill.

                  This is necessary, not only to safeguard workers as I stated earlier, but also to maintain the integrity of the program. Without an abrupt cut off date, a situation would be created where some workers in a workplace were subject to the new monitoring and inspection powers and others were not. This is obviously not an ideal situation for anyone.

                  As I stated at the outset of my speech, my previous involvement with the Migration Committee has given me some background on the issue of the 457 Visa program.

                  The 457 Scheme is something that serves a worthwhile purpose, however it is so important that it is used properly. The

                 <p class="italic">
                  That is why in the 2008 Budget the Treasurer announced that the Rudd Government is making a $19.3 billion investment in education and training to ensure that we continue to provide employment and training opportunities for Australians. However we realise that investing in the education and training of Australians will not meet employers immediate skills needs.

                 <p class="italic">
                  That is why it is imperative that we restore public confidence in the 457 Visa programme. It is in everyone’s interests to have a robust and transparent scheme in place. A loss of public confidence in the 457 scheme can translate into a loss of popular support for the scheme and will act as a barrier to employers to take up the economic opportunities that the 457 visa scheme offers.
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  The challenge for this Government is to prove to the Australian people that the 457 visa program has integrity and that it is not undermining Australian wages and conditions.

                 <p class="italic">
                  That means that it is used to cover up legitimate skills shortages and not as simply an avenue for cheap unskilled labour.

                 <p class="italic">
                  That means that those who come here under the scheme receive every opportunity to report poor treatment instead of being condemned to slave like conditions.

                    The Migration Legislation Amendment (Worker Protection) Bill 2008 amends the Migration Act 1958 and seeks to enhance the framework of the sponsorship of noncitizens to enter and work in Australia with the objective of ensuring the working conditions of 457 visa holders meet Australian standards and the costs of sponsorship are more fully identified and met by the sponsor.

                    is supportive of the overall objectives of the legislation, believing that a framework for sponsor obligations is necessary but understanding that we have grave reservations about lack of availability of the regulations attached to this Bill. I understand that draft regulations are to be made available in the first part of 2009, and of course these will define the operation of the framework.

                    While the framework in the Bill is supported by the Coalition as a further evolution of the obligations of sponsorship which the Coalition introduced through the Migration Amendment (Sponsorship Obligations) Bill in June 2007, a serious problem lies in the delay of the production of the regulations by the

                    The Rudd Labor Government has also proposed that sponsors not be allowed to use temporary overseas labour during periods of lawful industrial action or to influence enterprise bargaining negotiations. This could have very interesting interpretation challenges.

                    The framework refers to a new system of compliance and monitoring work. We need to be concerned that employers and sponsored visa applicants are not frustrated by greater red tape burdens.

                   <p class="italic">
                    There are also proposals that 400 series temporary work visas which have not required sponsors in the past, eg for those staying for less than three months, may in future require sponsors who will also need processing and monitoring. The Rudd Government will need to ensure that this does not put even greater pressure on the capacity for the Department to deliver efficient processing of applications for this group of visas and undermine the high regard in which the Australian migration system is held. It is important that the accessibility and flexibility of this programme is maintained whilst ensuring its integrity is maintained.

                     This is an important piece of legislation. It was drafted in the first instance by the previous government and was not introduced in time before the last election. It has changed, but the basic policy intents—remedying some of the deficiencies in the arrangements surrounding sponsorship and dealing with sponsors who fail to do the right thing via sanctions and inspection regimes—were issues considered by the previous government. They took a decision that they needed a legislative response, because there have been restrictions on the capacity of the

                     to ensure the integrity of the system. My great concern as a defender of the temporary migration program is that it has been seriously undermined, and public confidence in it has been seriously undermined, by the exposure of cases of abuse of overseas workers. That represents a small number of incidents in terms of the overall program, but it is not an insignificant number. I would say to the Liberal senators who tried to suggest that the union movement’s concerns were not warranted: you are wrong—dead wrong. We have had serious problems and, as you know, the previous minister—

                       I always put it in context, if you look at my speeches. I appreciate the opposition’s support on the bill, but the legislative impetus for this came from the previous minister because of his concerns. If you look at what he did in areas like the
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
                        IT
                       </a>
                       and meat industries, you see that he responded—in a fairly ham-fisted way, in my view—to concerns that he had about the exploitation of workers in those industries. This is not something that is unique to me as minister.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       There have been serious issues of abuse. They are in the sorts of areas where you see industrial relations problems. The industries where there have been problems are the industries where you have problems with exploitation more generally. We have had examples, like the exploitation of cooks in the restaurant industry in Canberra, which have had to be dealt with. There are concerns. My consistent position has been that you can only defend the scheme if you make sure it has integrity. You can only allow it to work for employers who do need the skills if you ensure its integrity. This is about making sure we have the balance right in that regard, and it will give us the ability to ensure that it does have that integrity and that we can weed out the small numbers of sponsors who fail to do the right thing.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Regarding the question of consultations, unlike under the previous minister, who announced changes without any consultation—major changes in this area and major changes, more broadly, in the migration area—this consultation has been exhaustive. It started with me appointing an employer reference group, which has three representatives of industry, led by Mr Coates, whom Senator Trood may well know and who is senior executive and chairman of Xstrata. They looked at the 457 system and how we might make it more responsive to employers’ needs. On receiving that report, I implemented all but two of their recommendations. One which I did not implement was changing the name of the program, but I would like to do that at some stage. I think the program has seen a vast improvement in its responsiveness to employers and the processing of applications. If you talk to employers using the scheme, you will find that they are very complimentary about the changes and what those have meant for allowing them to access the scheme.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       That was one point of consultation. The second was that I appointed the industrial relations expert Mrs Barbara Deegan to conduct an integrity review of the program, and she has spoken to hundreds of people throughout Australia and consulted with all the key groups. I released her report a matter of weeks ago. We also had a discussion paper that went to possible reforms that would be part of the regulations for this legislation. Again it was public, and again it received submissions—more than 80 were received. All of that is to be considered as part of the drafting of these regulations by the Skilled Migration Consultative Panel I established, which includes four members of senior industry bodies like
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCI" rel="nofollow">
                        ACCI
                       </a>
                       , AiG and the Minerals Council, four union representatives and four representatives of the largest state governments. All are engaged in the process of getting the issues and integrity of the 457s right.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       Senator Trood made a good point which is the key to all this: the scheme grew very quickly, and the public policy settings around it have been inadequate to cope with the growth not because of the numbers but because of what has happened in terms of the skill classifications and countries of origin. Under the scheme originally, we were bringing in highly trained medical professionals, engineers et cetera—people with obvious qualifications going into high-paid jobs sponsored by large companies. There were no problems with that. From an immigration point of view, I just want to know that they have a passport, a visa and no criminal history. Whether they get $250,000 or $300,000 from
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">

                      <p>
                       But with the expansion of the program we have seen the skill level come down so that we have a lot of people coming in at tradesman level. We have also seen the source country change. Source country change is important because we have people who do not have English as a first language, some of whom have very little English at all. That is where the exploitation occurred. People from China, the Philippines and India, lacking the English-language skills, have been brought in by labour hire firms into industries with sometimes poor

That was recognised by the former minister. I think it is broadly recognised in the parliament. This is about getting the right public policy settings around it. It is not about increasing costs to employers—I do not want to make the scheme such that it becomes prohibitive. Equally—

                              We have done a lot of consultation because we want to get it right. They say to me that the former government never talked to them like we do about the detail of these things. I am constantly talking to industry about it. We have to get the balance right. We want to be clear, though, that we want 457 workers to be more expensive than Australian workers, because we do not want people to employ overseas workers in preference to Australian workers—a principle that the previous government used to articulate as well. One of the major requirements out of the Deegan report is about market rates of pay. We have the situation now where some overseas workers coming into the country are paid less than their Australian counterpart—that is, there is an incentive to use a foreign worker over a local worker. I do not think anyone in here would endorse that. The market rates argument is very important and will be central to any reforms.

                              I also want to pick up another point that Senator Trood made, although I do not want to go on for too long. The discussion paper deliberately raised the gamut of issues, including education costs because these are actually starting to impact on state education systems. In Queensland—your own state, Senator Trood—we suddenly had an influx of a large number of workers who then had kids who went into the public schools, which did not have the facilities to cope. Most of the rural communities are very glad to have them, because a lot of those towns are dying. They are very welcoming and there have been some really great stories about all of that.

                              At our primary school, which my youngest son has now left, they have now got 40 overseas students who do not speak English. But they have got no

                              teacher. The teachers are finding that the resources to cope with those students are not there. The P&amp;C association has recently paid for the six-month employment of an ESL teacher because the teachers have been finding that they have not been able to give enough attention to the other students—a real problem that comes as a result of having overseas workers. It is not irrelevant; it is a cost to the taxpayer and a cost to the state education system—costs that have got to be considered. Personally, I am not going to look to lumber employers with those costs. We cannot pretend that we are not going to have a public policy debate about those because there is not an issue. There is, and state governments are raising it with me because the larger the number of overseas workers the bigger the drain on their resources.

                                That is right. Some of them are the biggest users, Senator, but this is complex. That is what I am saying: it is complex. So the discussion paper picks up all those issues. As I have said, there is an enormous amount of consultation and discussion going on around these changes. The Skilled Migration Consultative Panel are going to have the draft regulations referred to them. They will not agree on them all—I am sure of that—but we will have this process, the arguments will be held and in the end the government will have to make a decision.

                                I know there has been interest by Senator Xenophon and the Greens in this issue of regulations. I have made it clear that I am happy to distribute the draft of the regulations earlier in the year before they are introduced. I am happy to do that for the Liberal opposition and

                                so everyone sees the draft and everyone can give feedback. But I absolutely reject any suggestion that there has not been consultation about all this, and I am happy to compare the consultation on these measures with that on the former minister’s more substantive measures which were just announced.

                                There is a serious attempt here to tackle an emerging problem about the public policy parameters around the temporary skilled migration program. There are more emerging, quite frankly, as the economy turns down a bit. I appreciate the support from around the chamber. As I said, I will make draft regulations available to people before they are introduced and they will certainly go to the industry’s Skilled Migration Consultative Panel. Hopefully, at the end of this we will have a good outcome. Obviously it will not be agreed upon by all, but I think we will have regulations that provide integrity to the scheme, which has been under pressure, and protect overseas workers but ensure that Australian workers are protected from overseas labour undercutting employment opportunities for Australians. That is the right balance that we have got to get. I think that when we come to the draft regulations we will be able to get that balance right. I thank the Senate for its support for the bill.
