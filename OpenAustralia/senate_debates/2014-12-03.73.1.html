          International Day
         </a>
         of People with Disability is marked every year on 3 December, and can I acknowledge the cross-party motion that was passed here yesterday. It is, from the Australian government's point of view, supported by and coordinated through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Social Services
         </a>
         . The day is a great opportunity to celebrate the contributions made by people with disabilities in their communities across Australia. I am very happy to see so many colleagues sporting the lapel badge to mark this important day.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think senators will be very pleased to know that this year a record number of events are being held across Australiaâ€”nearly 1,000 events have been registered, which is the highest number of events in the 22-year history of the day. There are an incredibly diverse array of events to mark the occasion. There is an inclusive surfing event in

         ; an online disability employment forum here in Canberra; and something that will be of interest to Senator Mason, I am sure, a monster disco in Melbourne! There is also a wheelchair basketball in

         and much more.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is encouraging also to see business getting behind the day, with a number of workshops, conferences and forums taking place. We have also had great success with the first Lights up for People with Disability initiative, which will see buildings and structures in most states and territories light up in the day's colours of blue and orange.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government and indeed all senators encourage Australians to join in today's celebrations and to consider what we as a community can do to ensure that people with disability have full access to economic opportunity.

           One of the prime mechanisms to better support people with disability to achieve their economic goals, their employment goals and their social goals is the introduction of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. As you would know,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
            Mr President
           </a>
           , this seeks to put the power in the hands of the individual. An individual is assessed for the needs that they have, they are given an entitlement commensurate to their needs, and then they can take that to the service provider of their choice. I would note that, obviously, if as a person with a significant disabilities you are getting the daily supports that you need, you will be in a much better position to contemplate entering the workforce. I think that is one of the great benefits of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. Again, as I often do, I want to acknowledge the staff of the National Disability Insurance Agency and the

           for the incredible effort that they are putting into make the

            <p>
             Thank you, Senator O'Sullivan, for the series of questions. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
              NDIS
             </a>
             was fully provided for in the last budget. Over the forward estimates there was a full accounting and provision for the NDIS. I think it is worth, at a time of particularly robust exchanges in this place and what is probably a little bit of a fraught week, to reflect that the parliament does come together and does function on occasion. The NDIS is a manifestation of that, and I think that is something that the parliament can be well pleased with.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is also important to note that the NDIS cannot do and was never designed to do everything in relation to people with significant disabilities. The National Disability Strategy is also very important. That provides that all levels of government have a responsibility to make sure that people with disability have the access and opportunities they deserve.
