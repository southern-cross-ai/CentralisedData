        My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. What is the revised total cost of corporate tax cuts over the 10 years from 1 July 2018, both legislated and proposed to be legislated by the government?

         I thank Senator Wong for that question. The medium-term cost for the unlegislated component of the enterprise tax plan currently before the Senate is $35.6 billion over the period from 2016-17 to 2027-28. The projected cost of the unlegislated component of the enterprise tax plan in 2027-28 is around $9.8 billion. There is no new measure in the budget. As Senator Wong would well know, measures in past budgets do not get recosted.
        </p>
        <p>
         But let us just talk about the Labor Party tax policy, because the Labor Party, based on past costings, want to impose $220 billion in higher taxes on the Australian economy, which will send investment overseas, lower growth, lead to fewer jobs and higher unemployment and, as we get higher unemployment, lead to lower wages. So how much additional tax is the Labor Party going to impose on the Australian economy? Have they updated the costings of their $220 billion tax hit on Australian workers, Australian savers, Australian pensioners and Australian self-funded retirees? Every Australian who moves will be on the receiving end of a tax hike from the Labor Party.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government believe in the opportunity for all Australians to get ahead. We believe in encouraging and backing hardworking Australians. We believe hardworking Australians deserve the best possible opportunity to get ahead, so we will continue to pursue policies of lower taxes where we can and where that can be responsibly afforded within the budget. We know that Australia's success depends on the success of individual Australians. We understand that the success of all Australians depends on the efforts of every individual Australian doing their best and working hard, and they deserve to be rewarded for their efforts.

           My supplementary question is again: what is the total cost of corporate tax cuts over 10 years from 1 July 2018, both legislated and proposed to be legislated by this government? This is the charade we went through in the 2017 budget and the 2016 budget when they wouldn't give us the cost. Then they wouldn't give us the revised cost. We are asking for the revised cost, given the budget handed down last night, of the plan.

            I refer Senator Wong to the budget papers, which show the expected company tax receipts over the forward estimates. That is provided in the usual way. As I've indicated to Senator Wong, the medium-term cost of the unlegislated component of the enterprise tax plan, which is currently before the Senate, is $35.6 billion over the period from 2016-17 to 2027-28.

                   Clearly Mr Shorten thinks that a business making more than $2 million is a big business. Clearly Mr Shorten thinks that every Australian working in a business with a turnover of $2 million is part of the big end of town. Mr Shorten is dishonest, he is deceiving the Australian people and, if he ever were to become Prime Minister, all Australians would be worse off, lose their jobs and end up on lower wages.

                     Why do this minister and the Prime Minister believe it is appropriate to refuse for three years in a row to tell the Australian people, until it's dragged out of them, the cost of their big company tax cut giveaway to big business? Why does it have to always be dragged out of them, while they're kicking and screaming, how much money they want to give to the big end of town?

                      On this side of parliament, we care about the opportunities for hardworking Australians to get ahead. Nine out of 10 hardworking Australians work for a private sector business. If we continue to disadvantage the businesses that employ them, compared to businesses in other parts of the world, we put their jobs at risk and we put their future wages at risk. There won't be any wage increases because the Labor Party wants to keep a high tax on people's jobs by putting Australian citizens at a disadvantageâ€”

                         Senator Cameron, that was part of the question. The minister has been directly relevant. I might say, even with Senator Cormann's rather loud voice, it was getting difficult to hear his answer. I called order in the chamber on my left. There are opportunities to ask further questions and debate it after question time.

                              : Senator Wong is clearly not interested in the answer to the question. She asked a question and she is actually talking to her people.

                                No Australian government, including the government that Senator Wong was part of for six years, provides a running update on legislated budget measures. They are reflected in the budget estimates as appropriate and the information is there for all to see.
