         I just ask the minister whether the government is still persisting with the 3 pm closure in view of the fact that the legislation listed for when the telecommunications legislation amendment is completed is quite lengthy. I anticipate there will be quite some debate on it. I indicated yesterday that I understood the coalition will be moving amendments in the Territories Law Reform Bill which I am not sure that the government will accept. They voted against them in the other House. I again refer the minister to my amendment yesterday to have the sitting of the Senate continue until such time as that legislation was dealt with.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the government seriously want to get those bills through, and I assume they do, the fact that they are on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notice_Paper" rel="nofollow">
          Notice Paper
         </a>
         for the last day of sitting and the fact that there will be debate and amendments moved and, I assume, voted on means one of two things: we are not going to finish them or, alternatively, the government with their lackeys in the Greens will again gag debate on those pieces of legislation so that Senator Brown and a couple of other Victorian Labor members can get down to Victoria to baste in the media spotlight for the Victorian election.

              I will be eagerly watching to see if they are here. It will be interesting to see. We heard such pious comments from Senator Brown yesterday about the need to sit, so it will be very interesting to see whether Senator Brown is still here at 3 pm when the rest of us are. I heard a rumour that Senator Hanson-Young might be pursuing her leadership ambitions by getting down there too and getting her share of the spotlight on the television. But perhaps I wrong them both, and if I get a chance to say it at three o’clock and they are both here I will apologise to both of them because you can never believe rumours in this place.
             </p>
             <p>
              But I do seriously ask the minister in closing the debate on this motion, should no-one else want to speak: what is the plan for today? Do you want these bills through? If so, can I suggest that you adopt the amendment I used yesterday, and that is that the Senate rise as soon as all of those bills have been dealt with, whenever that is. That will be a real test for Senator Brown and Senator Conroy, another Victorian. Perhaps we will be debating them at 11 o’clock tomorrow morning. That would be interesting if Senator Brown and Senator Hanson-Young could not be there. That is an alternative I urge upon the Manager of Government Business, that we do retain the Senate until such time as the particular piece of legislation is dealt with.

              Here we go, the Labor-Greens alliance having a bit of a chat again. For those who cannot see it and who might be listening on this last day of parliament, we have Senator Brown and Senator Evans, the Labor-Green alliance, the Labor-Green coalition, in furious conversation over there, working out how Senator Brown can get down to Melbourne in time to play the media—

                 I take Senator Siewert’s intervention. I had not realised that Senator Ludlam and Senator Kroger were leaders of their respective parties. There is a slight difference with a couple of senators having a bit of a chat at the back of the chamber. I am surprised they are not listening intently to what I am saying but there is nothing to stop them having a bit of a chat. It is quite different when you have the

                   It is timely you mention that. Senator Brown said that to me yesterday: ‘Where is your Christmas cheer? I am full of Christmas cheer.’ I said, ‘I thought Christmas was a Christian greeting.’ Anyhow, I will let that pass.

                       I talk English. I urge Senator Bishop—Senator Ludwig; how could I forget Ludwig coming from Queensland—I urge on Senator Ludwig my amendment that extends the sitting of the Senate today until such time as that deal is done. Alternatively, I would just like Senator Ludwig’s confirmation that it will be gagged through so that that legislation can be dealt with.

                        As is normally the case, normal pairing arrangements will apply from this side and I suspect from the opposition and the Greens. In terms of the remaining program for today, I am confident that we will discuss the program to ensure all business is completed with the opposition and the Greens and Senators Xenophon and Fielding to ensure that we complete the program at a reasonable hour, by 3.30.

                           Normally pairing arrangements are never mentioned in the chamber as such and I would like Senator Ludwig to explain what he means that normal pairing arrangements will be continued today. My understanding and my negotiations and discussions with the Government Whip are that we are back to our standard five pairs plus leader. I want this clarified—Senator Ludwig has raised this. It was the normal five plus one plus an additional pair for a senator who got sick yesterday, which is the way we transact business in relation to pairs. And we will not be pairing the Greens per se; the pairs for the Greens will be coming from the Labor Party allocation. I want that to be very clearly understood by the chamber.

                            just say that Senator Ludwig was replying to the contribution from Senator Macdonald to try to ease the tension in the chamber and get us back on track. He was just indicating there were normal pairing arrangements; that senators were able to leave. He was making no comment on the specific arrangements. We appreciate the cooperation we have had from the coalition on pairing, which we always cooperate well on. He was just making that point and suggesting that we ought to get on with business; that, in terms of the management of the program during the day, normal discussions will occur and we will work our way through the remaining business and that we all perhaps just get on with the job rather than try to incite trouble.
