        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Senator McKenzie. In the minister's letter to Senator Hanson committing to bringing forward the delivery of the dairy code of conduct, the minister said, 'I'm planning for that to happen by December 2019.' Yesterday the minister mentioned in passing, in an answer to a question, that the code 'is on track to be in place by 1 January 2020.' When was the decision made to delay implementation of the code from December to January?

         for your sudden interest in the dairy industry. We, on this side of the Senate, have long stood with our dairy farmers and our dairy industry to seek to assure that they have a sustainable and profitable future and that future generations of Australians can enjoy safe, nutritious dairy products produced right here in Australia. And it is why, at the last election, we committed to introduce a mandatory code of conduct on the back of the egregious behaviour of the milk processors against our dairy farmers, following the step-downs and clawbacks by Murray Goulburn and Fonterra back in 2015.

             . That $22 million of additional support actually addresses the reason why our dairy farmers are doing it so tough—the increased fodder prices, increased electricity prices and increased water prices, which are putting incredible pressure on the input costs for our dairy farmers despite them getting a historically high farmgate price from the processors.
            </p>
            <p>
             In terms of bringing the dairy code forward and our election commitment to deliver that by June 2020, we have always been public in our statements that we will deliver the code as quickly as possible, because we know that right now milk processors are attempting to sign our dairy farmers up to contracts of in excess of five years, so, the sooner we can bring that in the better. But I've also said, we won't be introducing a code—

                    My point is that, as a political party, we talk all the time about how we hold the supermarkets to account with what they're actually paying our producers. Senator McDonald and I have been in conversations about that. Senator Canavan and I have been in conversations about that. A raft of National Party MPs and senators are actively engaged in working out how we can better evolve competition laws in this country.

                      member for Lyne, Dr Gillespie, has warned that the minister's draft code dudded farmers, and he refused to rule out a leadership tilt over the issue. Is the minister confident her dairy code of conduct will satisfy Dr Gillespie?

                      <p>
                       Thank you again, for your question. I will repeat what I have often said in this place and publically: this is not my code of conduct and it is not our government's code of conduct; it will be the dairy industry's code of conduct.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       There are eight unique regions of dairying in this country, each with very unique challenges and opportunities. The mandatory code of conduct to govern their relationship with the processors has to be fit for all. So it is not up to

                       or Susan McDonald or Perin Davey to devise a code of conduct that we think suits us. It is for us as a government to deliver a mandatory code of conduct that delivers for the dairy farmers in this country and actually assures them of a transparent model for dealing with their processes.

                      <p>
                       David Gillespie has been a strong advocate for a broader trading platform—a transparent trading platform and quite an innovative model of trading milk—which the dairy industry itself is examining. As I've said, we've put the draft code out for consultation and we're now dealing with the feedback.
