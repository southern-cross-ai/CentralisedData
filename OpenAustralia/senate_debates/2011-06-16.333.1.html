        <p>
         The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) As at 27 April 2011 the department had a total of 724 employees.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) As at 27 April 2011 16 departmental staff had voluntarily identified as having a disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) In my department a disability plan, a workplace diversity statement and a reasonable adjustment policy have been developed and implemented with the aims of ensuring that people with a disability are recruited, supported and retained. Actions that have been undertaken include:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) an independent audit of the recruitment processâ€•to ensure that it does not discriminate against people with disability
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) the establishment of a disability contact officer
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) actively encouraging people with a disability to apply for positions
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) the reasonable adjustment of recruitment processes (when required)
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) becoming a silver member of the Australian Network on Disability
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (f) encouraging the use of JobAccess and disability employment providers
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (g) the creation of the disability section of the department's intranet site. Providing managers and staff with access to a range of information, resources and support available to assist with the employment of people with a disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The retention strategies in place focus on developing an inclusive culture and providing support for staff with a disability. Actions implemented in my department include:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) the establishment of a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senior_Executive_Service" rel="nofollow">
          Senior Executive Service
         </a>
         (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
          SES
         </a>
         ) officer as the Disability Champion
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) access to a mentor specifically for staff with a disability
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) options for reasonable adjustment of duties
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) the provision of assistive technology on request
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) access to flexible working arrangements
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (f) raising awareness with staff generally about the implications of living with disability
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (g) celebrating relevant events such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
          International Day
         </a>
         of People with Disability.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) Career planning for all staff in my department is incorporated into the performance management process.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) No, there are no specific targets for recruitment and retention.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) Recruitment strategies are focused on encouraging people with a disability to apply for positions and ensuring that they are not disadvantaged by the recruitment process. Given the size of the department it would be administratively costly and impractical to put in place the type of initiatives that would support reaching targets.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Retention strategies are focused on promoting a culture that is supportive and inclusive of people with disability. At present there is very low turnover of staff with a disability in my department and a target is not necessary.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (7) The disability plan, a workplace diversity statement and a reasonable adjustment policy have been implemented to support staff with a disability. Measures that have been implemented as a result of these plans and policies include:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) access to diversity and harassment contact officers
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) the establishment of a Senior Executive Service (SES) officer as the Disability Champion
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) access to a mentor specifically for staff with a disability
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) options for reasonable adjustment of duties
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) the provision of assistive technology on request
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) There are currently no new policies, plans, strategies or initiatives being developed.
