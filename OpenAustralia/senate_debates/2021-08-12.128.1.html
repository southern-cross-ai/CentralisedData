        Every day, Australians wake to a country deeper in crisis, a crisis caused by Mr Morrison's character. Cases of COVID are spreading and they are spreading through an Australian population that is mostly unvaccinated, and too many Australians are unvaccinated because Mr Morrison didn't act until it was too late to get vaccine deals and he didn't do enough deals. And then, when he got found out, he tried to make the excuse that it's not a race.

        remains in protracted lockdown, which Mr Morrison pressured the

        It's long been said that character is destiny, and, as long as Mr Morrison remains Prime Minister, Australia's destiny is weighed down, held back by his character. We saw it in the bushfires. He said it didn't matter that he went to Hawaii because he didn't hold a hose. And we see it now: it doesn't matter that he stuffed up the vaccine rollout because it's not a race. He always leaves it too late and then all he offers are excuses, or he blames someone else, or he just dodges the issue, and it is Australians who suffer the consequences. Australians are owed more, and they deserve better from a government.
