          Climate Change
         </a>
         Cooperation, which was announced by the Chinese government and my colleague Ms Bishop on behalf of the Australian government yesterday. The government reaffirmed its commitment to real and effective action on climate change. At the centre of the government's response to reducing emissions is the $2.55 billion Emissions Reduction Fund. The MOU signed yesterday with Mr Zhu Zhixin, vice-chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission, is an example of our readiness for constructive engagement with major partners to address the challenge of climate change. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDRC" rel="nofollow">
          NDRC
         </a>
         is China's primary economic planning body. It is a powerful player in China's economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         The MOU was first signed by Foreign Minister Downer in 2004 and has developed to include an annual ministerial dialogue and regular officials meetings. Under the MOU, the Chinese and Australian governments have conducted ongoing dialogue on a wide range of issues, including energy efficiency, technology cooperation, agriculture, climate change science and, most recently, collecting and managing greenhouse gas emissions data. No matter what ambitious emissions targets you aspire to and the policies or laws you introduce to reduce our greenhouse emissions, you must be able to measure and account for them in a reliable way. Our work with China is helping to set up the systems that are required to do that and to guarantee Australia's compliance with its obligations.

           It is very important indeed. As Prime Minister Abbott said, if I may quote him: 'The Australian government accepts the science of climate change and is committed to reducing Australia's carbon emissions by five per cent below 2000 levels by 2020.' China is the world's largest emitter, contributing around one-quarter of all emissions. Australia accounts for about 1.3 per cent of global emissions. China's emissions are currently around 20 times as large as Australia's annual emissions. China also consumes almost 50 per cent of the world's coal, and that is expected to increase. We know from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
            US
           </a>
           -China announcement the other day that China's emissions will continue rising for the decade ahead before peaking in or around 2030. By contrast, Australia's electricity demand and emissions are falling. We are committed to working with China on emissions reduction.

             Yes, Senator Ruston, I can.

              The Chinese

             value Australia's experience in the collection and management of greenhouse gas data. They are interested in learning from the experience we have gained from the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting System that was introduced by the Howard government in 2007. One project that is coming to a conclusion involves the development of methodologies for the calculation of emissions in four sectors where Australia has particularly valuable experience. Those sectors relate to oil and gas and coalmining. A new project the government is now finalising is to help four provinces in China develop emissions reporting systems for use by companies that will have to report on their emissions. Australia will continue to do its bit to work with our partners, including our Chinese partners, in taking strong and effective action on climate change.
