        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Housing and the Minister for Homelessness, Senator Farrell. Following a decade of inaction and delay by the former coalition government, we have seen homeownership become increasingly difficult for many and homelessness on the rise. Ensuring all Australians have access to safe and affordable places to live is critical. Can the minister explain how the Albanese government's housing reforms will improve housing outcomes for Australians experiencing or at risk of becoming homeless, and what are the implications if it is further delayed?

         I thank Senator Polley follow for her excellent question. I know she's deeply concerned about the issues of housing and homelessness in her home state. Turning around the lost decade of inaction on the issue of housing and homelessness under the opposition will require a coordinated and ambitious housing reform agenda to address our nation's housing challenges.

         This is exactly what the Albanese government is doing. Central to our plan is the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. That will help—

           I will, Senator Watt. It will help to deliver new social and affordable rental homes for people that need them, a guaranteed ongoing pipeline of funding for social and affordable rental homes. The 30,000 homes the fund will deliver in its first five years are just one part of the Albanese government's ambitious housing agenda. The returns from the fund will also deliver $100 million for crisis accommodation for women and children, $30 million to build housing and services for veterans and $200 million for the repair, maintenance and the improvement of housing in remote Indigenous communities.

             It is a lot of money, Senator Watt. But imagine the difference this fund and these homes will make to people at risk of homelessness in this country. We on this side of the Senate want to actually deliver homes for Australians who need them. This isn't a campaign tool for us. This isn't about doorknocking. This is about real people, those Australians facing homelessness. The coalition and the Greens should stop playing politics and get out of the way, so that we can get on with the job of delivering homes—

                Yes, I can, Senator Polley. I can answer that question, because the Albanese government believes that everyone deserves a safe and secure place to call home. From the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund, we will deliver 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes, with 4,000 properties for women and children fleeing domestic and family violence and older women on low incomes who are at risk of homelessness.
               </p>
               <p>
                The returns from the fund will also fund responses for people in urgent need. These include $100 million for crisis and transitional housing options for women and children, and $30 million to build more housing and fund services for veterans who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness. We are committed to ensuring more Australians have a safe and affordable place to live and to reducing homeness.

                   Yes, I can, because tenants are a valued and important part of our communities, and renting has been getting tougher and tougher. We hear their concerns and we're acting to address them. The Albanese government is delivering the first substantial increase in Commonwealth rent assistance in over 30 years. The national Housing and Homelessness Ministerial Council has been tasked with developing a proposal for National Cabinet on the options to strengthen renters' rights. Of course, the answer to rental stress is a sustained boost in the supply of homes to rent and a substantial investment in new social and affordable housing. This is exactly what the Albanese government is doing. If the Greens can put aside their grandstanding and political games and put the Australian people first, the Housing Australia Future Fund will be the largest boost to social and affordable rental housing in a decade.
