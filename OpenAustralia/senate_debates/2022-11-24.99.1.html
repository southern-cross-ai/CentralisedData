        I rise to speak on behalf of Harrison Mather, a 17-year-old school senior and proud resident of Moncrieff in Queensland. He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What is democracy without integrity? Integrity is the core foundation of trust between the elected and the electors. A lack of integrity erodes the trust in our democratic institutions, and in the very principles our great nation was founded upon.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Public trust in our government is at an all-time low and falling. 85% of Australians believe federal politics is plagued with corruption (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australia_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         The Australia Institute
        </a>
        ). Whether or not this is the case, this level of public distrust is a critical issue which directly threatens our democracy and which must be resolved.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Parliamentary integrity should not be an oxymoron, but an assurance to the country. Australia needs an anti-corruption watchdog. We need a federal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
         ICAC
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We're fortunate enough that the vast majority of our public servants are sincere and hard-working politicians, who have dedicated their lives to serving this country. Nonetheless, a federal ICAC would serve to protect integrity, preserve public trust and to weed out the small number of corrupt politicians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I speak for myself, my friends and if not all young Australians when I say, we want to have faith in our governments. We want to have faith in our politicians. We want integrity to be reflected in the actions of our nation's leaders, not merely their words.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need a federal ICAC.

         I rise today to read a speech written for the

          Raise Your Voice

         campaign by Gabrielle Colloff, a young retail worker and proud member of her union and my union, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SDA" rel="nofollow">
          SDA
         </a>
         . Thank you, Gabrielle, for writing this important speech about what our new parliament should accomplish and for your work in supporting your colleagues as a union delegate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Here are Gabrielle's words:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Retail workers are essential workers. The fact is, retail workers are the backbone of our economy. Australia must step up and protect the people who are our front line, the workers who keep the nation running, before it's too late.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Too many retail and fast-food workers are being abused at work, verbally and/or physically. Enough is enough. Everyone has the right to a safe work environment.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As challenges continue to unravel after the pandemic, now is the time for our society and economy, as well as our government and businesses, to show retail workers that they are a valued part of our nation.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In order to rebuild our society, the government must invest in maintaining and nurturing our workers, thus creating a safe work environment free from abuse.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Unions are only a small step towards achieving this, so it is vital for the government to continue supporting its workers. We must give them the respect they deserve.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Retail workers have always been essential, but now it is impossible to ignore. Time after time, retail workers are not being considered; instead, they are being taken for granted.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Doesn't the health and wellbeing of 1.5 million retail workers deserve attention, Australia?
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Retail workers consistently face job insecurity, staff shortages and customer abuse.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         It's time, Australia, to stop saying retail workers are essential and start treating them as essential.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank Gabrielle for her words and her advocacy. It has been an absolute privilege to bring her voice into the Senate today.
