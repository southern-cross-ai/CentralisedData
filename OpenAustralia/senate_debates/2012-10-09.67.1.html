         I thank Senator Sterle for his continued interest from the West in the deregulation of the wheat industry. In answering this question let us put some facts on the table which those opposite seem to have ignored. The Howard government started the transition to a deregulated wheat export industry in 2006. This was supported by Labor in opposition. The industry has been well prepared for this transition. In 2008 the Liberal Party supported the final steps in the deregulation of the wheat industry and Labor has outlined since then a plan to remove the last elements of administrative regulation. In two years time, with the passage of the bill and the implementation of voluntary code, the wheat industry will be fully deregulated. This is the position that the Labor government put forward in 2008 and the position that those opposite supported then.
        </p>
        <p>
         But those opposite seem to have forgotten what they said in 2008. Those opposite are putting forward the view that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEA" rel="nofollow">
          WEA
         </a>
         needs to remain to continue to perform the functions that it has never had. The coalition has repeatedly suggested that the WEA assess quality of wheat—false. The WEA has never assessed quality of wheat. These are commercial arrangements between commercial entities. Those opposite have declared that the bill cannot pass unless the WEA's oversight of competition remains. Again, this is false. The WEA has never had oversight of competition. This is and will remain the responsibility of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition has also asked that the WEA remain to provide market information—again, false; the WEA does not provide market information nor has it ever. It is currently provided by commercial arrangements and entities that are in the marketplace.

           I thank Senator Sterle for the supplementary question. This morning we heard from the opposition leader about wheat deregulation recommendations by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Productivity Commission
           </a>
           . He said, 'We support deregulation but there's got to be a managed transition.' He went on to say there are three very important issues that need to be properly addressed by the industry and the government before deregulation can take place—that is, the issue of access to ports, the issue of market information and the issue of quality control. None of those matters is performed by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEA" rel="nofollow">
            WEA
           </a>
           . The Mr No of Australian politics cannot support an amendment that deregulates a market unless he can agree with the National Party demands for more regulation! That is the position we are going to end up with. It is a disgrace that the Liberals cannot control the National Party to ensure that we can have a deregulated labour market. These are fundamental issues. The doormats have got one victory up. They have got a victory on more regulation in the wheat industry—

             I thank Senator Sterle for his second supplementary question. Of course, the biggest risk to deregulation is—shock, horror—those opposite, the Liberal Party. They want to oppose the removal of red tape. They want to oppose the removal of regulation. They want to add costs to industry. So it has been a backflip.

              You have actually joined the Greens, by the sound of it. You want to reregulate the industry. You want to provide more costs and red tape to those exporters across the wheat industry. It is quite surprising, quite frankly, for you to be arguing this position and, quite frankly, it is all because you opposite lack leadership. Your opposition leader has mismanaged this debate completely. What you have done is allow the doormats from the National Party to roll you over and agree to reregulating the wheat industry.
