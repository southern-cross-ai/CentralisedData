           Today I'm moving amendments to three schedules within the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
            Social Services
           </a>
           Legislation Amendment (
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_Reform" rel="nofollow">
            Welfare Reform
           </a>
           ) Bill 2017. Amendments to two of these schedules, 6 and 10, will just postpone their start dates. These schedules relate to closing widow allowance for new entrants and ensuring that new claimants of unemployment payments connect more quickly with employment services. Amendments to the start dates for these measures are necessary due to the bill not passing before the planned 1 January 2018 commencement date.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm also moving amendments to schedule 15, which relates to the targeted compliance framework. The amendments would prevent ParentsNext participants from receiving four-week penalties for refusing to accept or voluntarily leaving work. While these penalties are appropriate when looking for work as a condition of receiving income support, ParentsNext participants are not required to look for work as a condition of receiving payment. This is because ParentsNext is a pre-employment program rather than an employment program. It connects parents of young children to services in their local community and helps them plan and prepare for employment by the time their children start school.
          </p>
          <p>
           The amendments also address an unintended consequence of schedule 15 of the bill, identified through the implementation design process. The new compliance framework will always apply for noncompliance with mutual obligation requirements, including failure to attend an appointment with a provider noted under section 63 of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
            Social Security
           </a>
           (Administration) Act. However, this section is also used by Centrelink to notify income support claimants and recipients of broader administrative requirements, such as providing documents to Centrelink, and should be dealt with through other mechanisms, rather than the compliance framework. This amendment will allow the most appropriate response to be used, depending on the nature of the failure.

            The Labor Party will be supporting these amendments. That being said, we consider them as only very, very minor improvements to the regressive things that are in schedule 15. We are moving our own amendments to schedule 15 which we hope will be successful. Indeed, if they're not successful, we will vote against schedule 15 as a whole. Therefore, I will now speak to our alternative amendments to schedule 15 so that the chamber can consider those and I will also highlight some of the issues with schedule 15.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are very much seeking to reinstate waivers and the discretion for the departmental secretary and employment service providers when assessing demerits and financial penalties. We note that the schedule as a whole changes the compliance framework for income support recipients to mutual obligations and participation payments. We also note that, as a two-phase framework, the first phase attributes demerit points to jobseekers who fail to comply with their obligations. If a jobseeker accrues up to four demerit points within six months, the government is seeking to assess them and put them into an intensive phase. In the intensive phase, there are three escalating penalties or strikes. For the first strike the recipient loses a week's payment; for the second strike, they lose two weeks; and, for the third strike, there is a cancellation of that payment and a four-week exclusion from re-application.
           </p>
           <p>
            In noting that we support the amendments that are before us, because they make some tweaks, I would also seek to ask some questions about the schedule as a whole. Under the current system, we see 72,000 financial penalties applied each year. Can you highlight for the chamber what, under the proposed system, that will be?

             In terms of the targeted compliance framework in schedule 15, the Labor amendment introducing broader discretion to the targeted compliance framework would actually retain one of the ineffective features of the current compliance framework which allows providers to effectively ignore noncompliance when the jobseeker has no reasonable excuse. This results in inconsistent and unfair application of penalties. The National
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
              Social Security
             </a>
             Rights Network acknowledged this in its evidence at the Senate committee hearing, stating that the new framework:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             … deals with a range of problems in the existing system. They include an arbitrary levelling of penalties depending on a provider discretion …
            </p>
            <p>
             Under the new compliance framework, providers will still exercise discretion as to whether or not they find the excuse offered by the jobseeker to be acceptable, in which case no financial penalty or demerit will be applied. The appointment will just be rebooked, as currently occurs. However, they will be unable to ignore blatant noncompliance with no excuse.

              DHS
             </a>
             will also retain the discretion they currently have in relation to all decisions about applying financial penalties.

               Penalties are expected to slightly increase under the new framework, but, in contrast to the current system, these penalties will only be served by those who persistently and deliberately do not meet their requirements. The expected number of penalties is based on jobseekers' compliance behaviour under the current system, with some conservative assumptions applied about behavioural change.

                Minister, I need to check my information with you. I have it noted that, under the current system, there are 72,000 financial penalties applied each year and that, under the proposed system, that will double, not have a slight increase.

                <p>
                 I am advised, in relation to the figures I have in front of me, that there is only a slight increase. Under the current framework, the number of penalties applied in 2016-17 was 187,526. The targeted compliance framework penalties applied—estimates only, obviously—in 2018-19 will be 190,478, so that is a slight increase.

                     Yes, we do. In relation to jobseekers losing one week, the estimate is 82,619. I'm talking about jobseekers now. In relation to two weeks, it is 42,152. In relation to cancelling and losing four weeks, it is 22,403. Again, that's jobseekers. That gives you the total of 82,690.

                      I do want to make a comment on the amendments, but I thought the one-week penalties were 82,690. For the two-week penalties, it's 42,154, and then it's 22,403. But then you said, 'That makes a total of,' and read out the same number as week one. That is what I heard. I may have misheard it.

                        I take your point. So you're expecting, then, over half to go to a two-week exclusion and then half of them again. Yes, sorry; I take your point. While I'm on my feet, I will, first off, very clearly remind people where we're up to: the Greens oppose this bill. We think that there are many schedules in this bill that will have a detrimental impact on people struggling on income support. Having said that, we think this series of amendments makes things slightly better. So if the will of the Senate is not what the Greens want—in other words, the bill is supported—these amendments will make the provision slightly better, so we will be supporting these amendments.

                        also have a series of amendments to schedule 15. I'll address those when I move them. We also have a series of questions. Unfortunately, we've had a period of time now—I think it's four weeks—since we were debating this last time, and we did, I know, go over some questions. I will try not to repeat those, but I do have some more questions on the issues here which I think are probably better addressed when I go to my amendments.

                         recognises that, under the current system, Newstart and youth allowance recipients are breached and lose payment without warning. NXT believes that every person receiving a working-age payment from the taxpayer should be actively looking for work and/or addressing any barriers to work. However, NXT also wants to ensure that persons not engaging in the jobactive system are continually communicated with and given every possible chance, including a final chance, to engage with the system before losing payments. Will the minister detail how Newstart or youth allowance recipients will be provided with one further chance to engage with the system once all demerit points are exhausted?

                          Thank you for that question, Senator Patrick. A further demerit point will be added to the process which will give the jobseeker one more chance to comply. Jobseekers will still have two capability assessments before facing any penalties and will return to the start of the demerit phase if it is found that they were not reasonably able to meet their requirements.

                            The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to contacts to the Department made on or after the commencement of this item.

                            Under this amendment the current intent-to-claim provisions will be retained so as to only apply to claimants who are in vulnerable circumstances. The amendment includes an instrument-making power to allow a legislative instrument to define a vulnerable claimant for the purposes of the intent-to-claim provisions. For all other claimants the date of the claim will be the date the claim is lodged rather than the date they initially contact the department. Vulnerable claimants will be those who have a genuine difficulty in collating their documentation. These difficulties will include but not be limited to being homeless, affected by a major disaster or family and domestic violence, a recent humanitarian entrant or recently released from prison or psychiatric confinement.

                            Amendment (1) omits schedule 11, 'Removal of intent to claim provisions', and substitutes new schedule 11, 'Intent to claim provisions'. New schedule 11 retains and amends the current intent-to-claim provisions in the social security law. As I've stated, these provisions will now apply to a person in vulnerable circumstances, being a person who is included in the class of persons determined by the minister in a legislative instrument—and I've outline examples of that. This amendment will also remove the requirement for the secretary to give a person a written notice acknowledging the

                                   shows that the class of people could include people experiencing homelessness, people experiencing domestic violence and humanitarian entrants.

                                    , as I've articulated, don't support these amendments and don't support the bill or this schedule. We have deep concern that it will impact on vulnerable people, of course, but, more broadly, on people who are on income support or trying to access income support, as I articulated in my second reading contribution. The supplementary

                                    to these amendments says:

                                    However, it is acknowledged that there may be occasions when a person in vulnerable circumstances may not be able to lodge a claim or provide the required documentation in a timely manner. Accordingly, although the deemed claim provisions will no longer apply to claimants generally, these amendments will ensure that sections 13 and 14 will continue to apply to a vulnerable claimant, being a person included in a class of persons determined by the Minister by legislative instrument.

I'm deeply concerned that it won't include the sorts of vulnerable people that I support and hear from on a regular basis in my office. For example, Aboriginal people living in a remote community may not be able to access their documentation or it may take weeks and weeks to get their documentation, as we heard about in the

                                    This amendment goes some way, but it does not address the broader issues created by this schedule, where we think a lot of Australians won't get access to income support when they need it. I remember being here when we were debating the provisions around people needing to access income support urgently and the further impositions that this government put on people having to prove that they're fleeing family crisis situations and family violence. When we were debating that, it was very clear that the hurdle had gone much higher. I'm concerned that this is a continued approach by government to keep ratcheting up that hurdle so that social security, which is a right, is being made harder and harder to access. These amendments don't address those fundamental issues that are raised by this schedule. So we will be opposing these amendments and, as people know, we oppose this schedule.

                                        In relation to the rationale, the 'intent to claim' provisions were introduced at a time when claim forms were mailed to claimants, completed by the claimants and then returned by mail to the
                                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">

                                        . With the advent of technology that allows people to gather and submit documentation quickly and easily, this level of assistance is no longer necessary or appropriate. These provisions allowed leniency for claimants by effectively backdating their entitlement to payment to the date they initially contacted the Department of Human Services and indicated their intention to claim. The purpose of removing these provisions is to encourage claimants to take greater personal responsibility for understanding their payment entitlements and to submit claims in a timely fashion. But, as I have already stated, there are protections that will apply to vulnerable claimants.

                                        Claimants in vulnerable circumstances who have a genuine difficulty in providing documents with the claim will be able to complete the claim and provide the required documents after completing and lodging the claim. I've gone through the examples of vulnerable circumstances. They include crisis situations where the claimant is homeless, affected by a major disaster, affected by family and domestic violence, is a recent humanitarian entrant to Australia or has recently been released from prison or psychiatric confinement. Vulnerable circumstances may also relate to situations where the claimant is a younger person applying on the basis that it is unreasonable to live at home, is caring for someone with a terminal illness, is aged under 18 and in the care of another person, is blind, has a partner with a residential aged-care assessment or an assessment is in progress or has a partner and they are illness separated.

                                         Do the amendments address people who will have difficulty in accessing documentation who aren't specifically vulnerable but might be made vulnerable by virtue of the fact that they don't have timely access to a payment? For example, there are people who have to access identity documents from overseas or take time drilling down their Australian citizenship documentation. If you become unexpectedly unemployed and you're not used to accessing this documentation, it may take you some weeks to gather that documentation before you're able to apply.

                                          In terms of the examples of vulnerable circumstances, one of the examples I gave was 'is a recent humanitarian entrant to Australia'. But the point of your question goes to the reason why

                                          is actually getting discretion. It is so that they will be able to determine on a case-by-case basis whether a claimant is in vulnerable circumstances and unable to provide documents with the claim. The example you've given would fall directly into the determination on a case-by-case basis.

                                             In an Aboriginal community where there is no Centrelink office or there's only an agent, if somebody goes to the agent, is that classed as the date of lodgement or is it when the department gets that form? These are real-life examples of where Aboriginal people have not got their documentation. What then counts as the lodgement date? Is it when they first go to the agent or is it actually when the process gets to the department?

                                                 Sorry, I'm talking about if they haven't got the documentation but have put the application in. Very often they don't have passports; they don't have up-to-date photos. There's been a whole range of issues raised over the years. When you said 'the documentation', did you mean that giving the application itself to the agent will count?

                                                  Sorry, Senator Siewert. I'm not exactly sure we're on the same page, so if I provide you with some information hopefully you can then tell me whether or not we are both on the same page. For example, what will happen to claimants that are waiting for documentation from a third party? All claimants also have additional time—up to 14 days—to supply some third-party documents from the time they lodge their claims. Examples of these documents include medical reports when applying for disability support pension or evidence of parental income when applying for youth allowance. In relation to documents or information generally considered to be outside a claimant's control, these could be obtaining medical evidence through a report to be completed by a treating doctor or specialist, business or private trust details, or parental income. Documents or information generally considered to be within a claimant's control include: tax file number, savings account balances, employment separation certificates or proof of identity.

                                                        These amendments go to the substantive parts of this bill and the core reasons that Labor are opposed to it.

                                                        Schedule 3 provides for the cessation of the wife pension. This is not something that Labor support. We note that, of the 7,750 recipients, there are many who would transfer under this provision to the age pension and the carers payment and would be no worse off. Indeed, it makes sense to simplify payments. But I have to say that we are not prepared to see many other vulnerable women on the wife pension go backwards in their access to income support. There are 3,100 women who will be worse off and 2,900 women transferring onto a jobseeker payment. This is not a new area of social security; this has been closed to new applicants since 1995. So you have 2,900 women who will have been out of the workforce for more than 20 years who will be transferred onto a jobseeker payment. This is a pretty extraordinary thing to do to women who have had very little, if any, exposure to the workforce.
                                                       </p>
                                                       <p>
                                                        We are also very concerned about the 200 women living overseas who will no longer be able to access any income support other than the support that their spouse is eligible for. We can see that, overnight, they would be $670 worse off a fortnight. This is an incredibly perilous situation to put them into. We have here a group of low-income women who will be left with nothing to live on other than their partner's pension, many of them having been out of the workforce for a great many years. As I said before, they will have been receiving the wife pension for a minimum of 22 years.
                                                       </p>
                                                       <p>
                                                        It seems reasonable to us, in the opposition, that this group of women should be grandfathered, to avoid them facing such a significant financial crisis, the kind of crisis that comes with not only deep economic cost but also a great sense of personal distress. There are a reasonably small number of women affected; therefore, there would be a reasonably minimal cost of grandfathering them. It is indeed a cruel and unnecessary cut. In moving these amendments, I ask the government: when putting this schedule 3 forward, did you consider grandfathering the 200 low-income women who will be forced to live on nothing from 20 March 2020, and what would that have cost?

The government has paid attention to the views of interested parties and the opposition and has proposed and supported a range of amendments to this bill in both the House and the Senate which will ensure the ongoing sustainability of the welfare system.

Ceasing these payments is an important part of building a simpler system that provides more encouragement and support for people transitioning to work. The amendment proposed by the government will provide an additional payment to newly bereaved pregnant women, to ensure that no bereaved pregnant women will be disadvantaged by the cessation of the bereavement allowance.

Unemployed people aged 55 to 59 have many productive years ahead of them. This measure, complemented by new and existing assistance, will help mature-age jobseekers gain skills and find work.

                                                         In relation to schedule 10, it is again disappointing that Labor is not supporting this schedule, which changes the start date for some participation payments. We know that more than one-third of jobseekers take longer than two days to connect with their jobactive or Transition to Work provider. This measure is all about ensuring that jobseekers are connecting as quickly as they can to the services that are there to help them find a job and move off welfare.

The changes to reasonable excuse provisions are needed because it is not consistent with community expectations that jobseekers are able to repeatedly avoid their requirements due to drug and alcohol misuse while refusing to participate in treatment, despite being able to. The changes to exemptions for mutual obligation requirements will also support jobseekers with substance abuse issues to remain connected to their employment services provider and engage in suitable activities to address their barriers.

                                                         The Labor amendments to remove these changes to reasonable excuse and exemptions would simply ensure that vulnerable jobseekers with substance abuse issues are left alone to struggle with their substance abuse, rather than being supported to overcome their issues. While the government is amending the bill to remove the drug-testing trial, the government remains committed to this measure and believes that randomised drug testing can be an effective way of identifying welfare recipients for whom mandated treatment could be successful.

This results in inconsistent and unfair application of penalties. The National

They include an arbitrary levelling of penalties, depending on provider discretion. Under the new compliance framework, providers will still exercise discretion as to whether or not they find the excuse offered by the jobseeker to be acceptable, in which case no financial penalty or demerit will be applied. The appointment will just be rebooked, as currently occurs. However, they will be unable to ignore blatant noncompliance with no excuse.

On that basis, the government will not be supporting any of the Labor amendments.

                                                         Senator Pratt, in relation to your question concerning the cessation of the wife pension, you may be aware that Senator Cameron and I discussed this at the last hearing of this bill in December of last year. In relation to the questions that you've asked, I am advised that, no—the government did not consider grandfathering these women and has not costed grandfathering them, as it would create additional complexity, which would be contrary to the intent of the welfare reform bill. Most wife pension recipients living overseas will experience an estimated average loss of $457.10 per fortnight, as the majority of these women currently receive a part-rate of payment due to insufficient Australian working-life residency and/or income and assets. These recipients have access to other income sources besides their wife pension payments, such as foreign pensions and investment income.

                                                            Thank you for the question. I am advised that approximately 7,750 wife pension recipients will be transferred to another payment or no longer eligible. In terms of a breakdown, 2,250 recipients will be automatically transferred to the age pension, 2,400 recipients will be automatically transferred to the carer payment, 2,900 recipients will be automatically transferred to the new jobseeker payment at the same rate of payment and up to 200 wife pension recipients living overseas will no longer be eligible for any Australian government payment, as I've just addressed in responding to Senator Pratt's question.

Those transferring to the jobseeker payment will have their payment rate frozen until the jobseeker payment rate equals or exceeds it. Most wife pension recipients will receive an average of $457.10 per fortnight compared to $669.60, the maximum rate, as they receive a part rate of payment due to insufficient Australian working life residency and/or income and assets.

In areas of high unemployment and low expectation of older jobseekers finding employment, I understand that jobactive providers have the discretion to reduce job activity requirements for Newstart participants. Can the minister advise how this information will be conveyed to relevant Newstart recipients? For example, will the information be clear and available on the MyGov or Centrelink websites advising recipients they can seek to have their job activity or volunteering ratios changed in certain circumstances?

                                                                              </small>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               In speaking to the chamber about the amendments that we have put forward and in seeking also to ask the government some further questions, I want to highlight to the chamber what our amendments do. We are proposing to oppose the cessation of the wife pension in schedule 3, oppose the cessation of the bereavement allowance in schedule 4, and oppose changes to the activity test for 55- to 59-year-olds in schedule 9 as well as changes to the start date for some participation payments in schedule 10 and removal of the intention to claim in schedule 11.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               The government's removed the drug-testing trial. We also are seeking the removal of exemptions due to drug or alcohol dependency in schedule 13 and changes to reasonable excuse and information management in schedule 14. As I started discussing earlier in the evening, we are looking to amend schedule 15 so that there is further discretion to the targeted compliance work in schedule 15. Why are we moving necessary amendments? Well, as I have highlighted, we are particularly concerned about the cessation of bereavement allowance in schedule 4. We believe it's a cruel and unnecessary cut for people who are facing perhaps the most difficult and worst circumstances in their lives. We know that the allowance is a short-term payment for a person whose partner has died. It's paid for a maximum of 14 weeks at the rate of the age pension. So putting a person on a jobseeker payment is a very cruel thing to do, and I do not understand the logic of the government.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               I understand and, indeed, we haven't opposed the idea that payments could be streamlined, combined and put together. But the idea that people in bereavement are jobseekers is a complete nonsense. You could, for example, be a casual employee who actively works all of the time but doesn't have access to any kind of leave payments. You're quite able to go back to work after your period of bereavement, but you still actually require income support for that time of bereavement, so it is a nonsense to put someone on a jobseeker payment. They should be entitled to a proper bereavement payment in lieu of income that they would otherwise have had.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               It's extraordinary to me that the government would seek to do this, for example, to a pregnant woman who had a working spouse who died. She, too, is put on a jobseeker payment when there really is no expectation that she will be able to find work during the course of her pregnancy. It seems extraordinary to me that this is what the government is seeking to do. It is unbelievable that someone would be put in this situation, so I want to ask the government what its rationale is for cutting short-term income support to people who have lost their partners. I can see this only as a cash grab to reduce people's entitlements and people's payments. I understand you want to streamline jobseeker payments, and we're not averse to that, but the idea that people in bereavement should be categorised as jobseekers when essentially they are not—it is a period of bereavement that they're seeking payment for—is extraordinary.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               I also want to highlight the start day for participation payments in schedule 10. Again, we're opposed to this schedule. We know that, at the moment, a person can receive payment from the date they make their claim or from the first day after the end of any waiting period that they have to serve. But what the government is seeking to do here is to punish people further by pushing the start date back to when the person first has their interview with their job service provider. Now, again, I can see this only as a cash grab by government at the expense of low-income Australians who may have lost employment and need to work through issues in their life so that they can, indeed, go to their jobactive job service provider.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               But what you're seeking to do here is cut $198 million over the forward estimates. It means that people will need to wait longer for income support at a time when they're trying to find employment. Now, I know the government has said it wants to get people connected as soon as possible so that they can find a job. Well, the simple fact is that leaving people without income support does great detriment to their capacity to find work. Your appointment with your job service provider is but a very small piece of that puzzle. A primary and very important part of the puzzle is, frankly, being able to afford the bus fare to get to your job service provider. That is impossible if the start date for a person's participation payments is being pushed. So, again, we've got questions here about how long people will have to wait on average to receive income support as a result of this measure. What is the estimated upper limit and average wait time?
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               We also want to discuss with the government tonight the removal of schedule 13, which includes the exemptions for drug and alcohol dependence. This measure has been very firmly criticised by a range of providers who work with drug and alcohol dependent people. We're concerned about the way in which the schedule would prevent temporary exemptions being granted where the person's situation is wholly or predominantly attributable to drug or alcohol dependency or misuse. This includes any sickness, injury or special circumstances, such as eviction, associated with this misuse. We understand the significance of the concerns raised by health and welfare groups saying that the changes fail to recognise the incredibly complex nature of substance abuse as essentially a health condition.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               The changes negate a doctor's medical opinion in advising that a jobseeker cannot meet their requirements for a temporary period. We're concerned that this relates not just to acute episodes of substance misuse but also to the secondary health problems associated with that use. For example, someone receiving treatment in hospital for cirrhosis of the liver associated with alcohol use will no longer be able to access a medically recommended temporary exemption, as far as we can tell from these measures. Someone injured while intoxicated would no longer be able to access a temporary exemption. Recipients would be expected to satisfy mutual obligation requirements. A jobseeker's obligation or plan would take into account the jobseeker engaging in drug or alcohol treatment. So what the government are effectively asking people to do here is engage in drug and alcohol treatment so their obligations can reflect those circumstances because, if they don't, they cannot use that as an excuse to meet the normal obligations of a jobseeker. We are concerned about the way in which this is going to push vulnerable people into crisis, homelessness and crime.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               I also want to highlight in schedule 13 the special categories of exemptions that may arise because we're opposed to these changes and are moving amendments to remove them. Income support recipients can receive an exemption from mutual obligation requirements if they're unable to meet them, but the current legislation's exemptions from the mutual obligation requirements can only be granted for a special period of up to 13 weeks. We have here the special categories of exemptions that may arise, including major disruption to the jobseeker's home or a major personal crisis, including homelessness. We're seeing changes that are proposed by the government in this bill that mean that, when jobseekers are unable to meet their obligations due to drug or alcohol dependency or due to crisis circumstances that are related to that dependency, they will no longer be able to receive an exemption. This is an extraordinary thing to do to people, whether it's because of substance abuse or because someone receives a significant injury as a result of alcohol misuse on a Saturday night that means they can't go to work and need to take six months off. These aren't necessarily people who are significantly drug and alcohol dependent. We know that this can be quite common behaviour on a Saturday night.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               I also want to highlight to the chamber this evening our concerns around schedule 14, which is included in the same group of our amendments. Jobseekers can be penalised for a range of participation failures currently—this we understand—including not turning up for an appointment with Centrelink. These penalties are not applied where the person has a reasonable excuse. Schedule 14 provides that a jobseeker who uses drug or alcohol dependence as an excuse for participation failure will be offered treatment. If they take up treatment, it will count towards their participation requirements, and, if they refuse it, their substance use disorder can cause them not to comply with jobseeker requirements a second time—and, indeed, you are putting forward that their payments will be suspended.
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               We are very concerned, as experts are, that this does not in any way help people overcome addiction but instead will push them into crisis, poverty and homelessness. We see that the implementation of this schedule is expected to cost money over the forward estimates, but we are very concerned, frankly, about the money that will come out of the pockets of vulnerable people. As experts have warned, it is of no help to people overcoming addiction to remove their payments. Does the government believe this measure will increase homelessness or crime for people who have substance use issues? Why has the government ignored the advice of health experts?
                                                                              </p>
                                                                              <p>
                                                                               As I've highlighted, I've got a range of questions for government on all of these different schedules, so I might just step back to schedule 10, where I raised our concerns about the start date for participant payments, and ask the government what their expectations are around how many people will have to wait longer to receive income support as a result of this measure and how long they will have to wait. What is the estimated upper limit and average wait time?
                                                                              </p>

These changes are designed to ensure jobseekers connect with employment services as quickly as possible and are accessing the programs that are available to help them find a job.
                                                                               </p>

These delays are inconsistent with community expectations that those on income support are making all reasonable efforts to connect with employment services and find work as quickly as possible.
                                                                               </p>

Jobactive and Transition to Work providers are contractually required to have appointments available for jobseekers to attend within two business days. Where there is no appointment available for a jobseeker to attend within two business days, their income support would generally commence from the date their claim was made.

Jobseekers will no longer be able to be exempted from their mutual obligation or participation requirements where they have an illness or other circumstances affecting their ability to meet their mutual obligation requirements which is primarily attributable to drug or alcohol abuse. The measure reflects that people with substance abuse issues that prevent them from looking for work or undertaking other activities should be taking active steps to address their issues, including through appropriate treatment, rather than being exempt from the requirements.
                                                                                 </p>

We're investing $28.8 million in this measure to provide employment services to those no longer eligible for an exemption. This will support these jobseekers with drug and alcohol abuse issues to remain actively engaged in appropriate activities to address their barriers to work. For the very first time, through a related measure, all jobseekers with substance misuse issues will be able to undertake appropriate treatment as part of their job plan to meet their mutual obligation requirements.

I note that the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, along with other stakeholders, raised significant concerns about this schedule, particularly that there's no limit in the primary legislation on the matters that could be included in the legislative instrument setting out what must not be considered a reasonable excuse for participation failure. The committee was concerned that the matters that the secretary would be bound not to consider could be made so broad as to undermine the reasonable-excuse provisions as set out in the act. Is that indeed the government's real intention here—to undermine the entire principle of reasonable excuse?

But, in relation to the broader answer to your question, the alternative would be to use the primary legislation itself to specify the circumstances in which drug or alcohol dependency must or must not be taken into account. This would require the inclusion of an inappropriate level of detail in the primary legislation. Also, using a legislative instrument is preferable because it provides greater flexibility should any refinement to the policy be required. You'd also be aware that the instrument itself is disallowable, so this ensures appropriate parliamentary oversight through the disallowance process. This will ensure that the instrument does not include matters beyond the government's declared policy intent.

These are in fact the same amendments that the Greens also have on the running sheet. In my second reading contribution, I made a contribution about all these issues, but that was some time ago now.
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                     Schedule 3 relates to the cessation of the wife pension. There's a deep concern around those women who are currently living overseas who are not anticipated to transition to an income support payment and should continue to receive a payment in line with schedule 2 of this bill. That's what we think should happen. That grandfathers widow B pension recipients from changes to the applicable portability rules. We don't see why that shouldn't apply to the women who are caught up by this provision. We think it basically shows the mean-spiritedness of the government but also just how keen they are to punish people who have to rely on income support.
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                     On schedule 9, which relates to older working Australians, I will say that a number of organisations made comments to the Senate inquiry into this bill about the impact this particular measure would have on them. In fact, we got evidence about regional organisations and the impact it would have on volunteering in regional organisations. I accept that the government did make a few amendments. At the time, we did note that we thought that was a slight improvement. Nevertheless, a number of older Australians are going to be caught up here. And, particularly into the future, we know that a large number of those long-term income support recipients are those over the age of 45. I think I've said in this place before, while they say that the new 30 is 20, in fact, you go the other way; the new 45 is actually around 55 or 60, the way that older jobseekers are being treated in the job market. To think that you can be unable to get a job or be discriminated against when you're over the age of 45—that is in fact what's happening—let alone when you get to the age of 55. This is going to be a growing area, and I can hear the minister already saying, 'And that's why we need this.' No; in fact, that's why this will hurt more and more people.
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                     We are deeply concerned about the impact of that schedule, just as we are deeply concerned about schedule 10, as I have articulated previously, and the start date for some participation payments. We have deep concern about the impact that will have. Again, it's a mean-spirited approach that's more about saving money than the welfare of income support recipients. We just had a discussion about schedule 11 and the removal of the 'intent to pay' provisions. Again, there were some changes made by the government. In fact, we don't support the replacement of the schedule with the amendments that the government brought in tonight. We still don't support this approach. We don't think it's the way we should be treating people who, as I said earlier, have a right to social security in this country.
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                     Schedules 13 and 14 relate to the government's obsession with demonising people who have addictions. Addictions are a health issue. They can't be dealt with through the income support system. We have heard endlessly from experts on addiction that you need to treat this as a health issue, and you can't tackle it through the income support system. This will hurt very vulnerable people who have an addiction. It is not the way that we should be treating people who have drug or alcohol dependency or, in fact, a crisis relating to it. And before I hear those opposite say, 'You're just being soft on those who have a drug or alcohol dependency, and you don't care,' yes, we do care, which is why we oppose these two schedules. They will hurt people, not help people, with drug and alcohol dependency. This is not the way to address it. We agree that we need to help people with a drug and alcohol dependency and addiction. Yes, we absolutely do. I'll say it again: we do care. We do need to help people who have drug and alcohol dependency and/or addiction, but this is not the way to do it, which is why we oppose schedules 13 and 14. They're related. Schedule 13 removes the temporary exemptions from mutual obligation requirements for income support recipients with drug and alcohol dependency. Schedule 14 relates to reasonable excuses. Again, this is not the way you address helping those with drug and alcohol dependency. It's a multifaceted problem, it is a health problem and we do need to address those underlying causes. This will very quickly see people with drug and alcohol addiction fall off income support. There's not a doubt in my mind that that's what will happen. What happens to those people who end up out of the system with no means of support? If they do have accommodation, they'll lose connection with that and become homeless, amongst a whole range of other issues. This is a health issue and should be treated as such.
                                                                                    </p>

This schedule contains provisions which repeal the privilege against self-incrimination, subject to immunity, in relation to the use of information or documents. We believe this is a significant change and it should not be dealt with as part of this bill so we will be supporting the

While we have a large number of amendments to schedule 15, this amendment doesn't clash with our other amendments to schedule 15, and we indicate our support for that as well. They're the same as Greens amendments, so we will be supporting them.
                                                                                    </p>

We think there are alternative ways to deal with a number of issues the government has brought up. While we're not necessarily opposed to the overall creation of a jobseeker payment, we are deeply concerned with the measures to put that particular payment in place, which is why we oppose schedules 3 and 4 here. We oppose some of the other schedules, which I'll come to later, which are not included in this particular set of amendments.

                                                                                      Before the chair puts our amendments, I did just want to speak very briefly to schedule 9 of the bill—the one that relates to mutual obligation requirements for people aged 55 to 59. In doing so, I want to express my dismay at both versions—this current version and the previous version in schedule 9—that the government put forward. We know that people in this age bracket are currently required to do 30 hours of activity per fortnight to meet their mutual obligation requirements. Importantly, this requirement can be fulfilled by doing 30 hours of volunteering. I want to say in my own capacity as the shadow assistant minister for families and communities, who would therefore have responsibility for volunteering, how important this is, particularly the contribution of people in this age cohort. Of the volunteers in Australia, we have 278,000 or more who are aged 55 to 59. I want to commend Volunteering Australia for pursuing this issue relentlessly; indeed, they have secured some amendments. Nevertheless, we don't believe they go far enough. When you look at the dignity and self-worth that people get out of volunteering their time for that 30 hours a fortnight, it is of immense benefit to the community, and it's also immensely important, given the very tight employment market, for people in this age cohort. I think we saw something like one job for every six jobseekers in this kind of space, which means we really should be encouraging people into meaningful activity that supports the community, supports their wellbeing, supports their mental health and is not a futile quest for jobs that aren't there. Clearly, people can and should be able to seek work and receive all the support they need to do that, but it is simply unreasonable of the government to be putting aside the 30 hours of activity per fortnight in volunteering in order to split that so that people can do 15 hours volunteering and 15 hours looking for work. The simple fact is that will be too difficult for many people. They'll say, 'I'll have to quit my jobseeking, first and foremost,' and that will impact on their wellbeing as well as the community activities that won't be supported.
                                                                                     </p>

You will recall that that vote was tied, so that meant that it didn't stand as printed. What now stand are amendments (9) to (16), (32) and (39) on sheet 8236 revised.

We don't believe that 31-31 is a reflection of the true will of the chamber. Two senators were absent, namely Senators Georgiou and Burston, who are now here. I would ask for the vote to be recommitted, consistent with the convention, and for Senators Georgiou and Burston to be given an opportunity to explain why they missed the division.

I think the difficulty with the pairing conventions needs to be highlighted as well. You cannot seek a pair on the floor by virtue of a senator being absent through misadventure. We've heard some explanations. I'm not sure the misadventures on this occasion equate anywhere near the misadventures that I've heard about in my 20 years in this place, but we need to address the issue that pairing is not an option to deal with matters of this type.

However, the government is allowing this excuse to continue for certain recipients of apprenticeship and student payments and for recipients of payments under the Community Development Program. The great majority of welfare recipients under the Community Development Program are Aboriginal, so the government is of the view that

Why? Is alcohol and drug abuse good for Aborigines but bad for other Australians? Do Aborigines have an inalienable right to alcohol and drug abuse as a sacred natural tenet that other Australians do not?
                                                                                                          </p>

Political correctness requires that welfare for Aborigines doesn't change until self-appointed Aboriginal leaders unanimously agree to changes. Those with expertise in living well, getting a job and becoming prosperous have no say and neither do taxpayers in general. Political correctness also requires that, when we see Aboriginal welfare recipients abusing drugs and alcohol, the appropriate response is hand-wringing and self-flagellation. In contrast, when we see other welfare recipients abusing drugs and alcohol, we can be clear-headed enough to consider responses that put obligations on the welfare recipients, rather than treat them all like hopeless cases.

It is the prejudice of low expectations. Items 1 to 11 of my amendments remove the exception so that no welfare recipients can use drug and alcohol abuse as an excuse for noncompliance with welfare rules. I understand that some senators support the removal of drug and alcohol abuse as an excuse for noncompliance, while others do not. I urge both groups of senators to support my amendments. Either all welfare recipients should be allowed to use drug and alcohol abuse as an excuse, or none should.

This new regime will apply to all welfare recipients except recipients of payments under the Community Development Program. My amendments would remove this exception so that all welfare recipients are subject to the same penalty regime for noncompliance with welfare rules. The new penalty regime involves more frequent suspension of payments, more frequent loss of payments and less discretion for bureaucrats to waive these rules. Whether or not you support these tougher penalties, I urge senators to support my amendments. Either all welfare recipients should face the tough new penalty regime, or none should. I commend my amendments to the chamber.

The government will be opposing them. The government recognises that more can be done to build on the success of the Community Development Program. A tailored approach is required in remote Australia to respond to the unique challenges in remote communities, including weaker labour markets, fewer job opportunities and often difficult social conditions. Furthermore, access to the alcohol and drug services that would be required to complement the changes to drug and alcohol exemptions needs to be assessed and improved before it is introduced into remote areas.

The program needs urgent reform. We saw the latest list of penalties applied to those in remote communities. So my advice to Senator Leyonhjelm would be: join us in calling on the government to change CDP. That is a completely separate program for Aboriginal people that is disproportionately impacting on a section of our community and causing huge detrimental impacts. So, no, we won't be supporting these amendments that have the potential to cause even further harm to those people who are stuck on CDP.

The amendments specifically relate to financial hardship. As I articulated in this place in my previous amendments to the bill but also during the debate on other amendments that we've already dealt with, we are deeply concerned about the financial impact this schedule will have on the people who are going to be subject to the new compliance regime.

It needs to be amended. However, this is being done—and we had a second reading amendment about this—without a full review of the current compliance regime. As I'm sure you know—through you,

So I've moved these amendments. I urge the chamber to support these amendments, because we are deeply concerned about the impact that these changes are going to have on participants.

We did ask a lot of questions, as the minister articulated, in the previous debate on this, just before Christmas, but I do have a couple of additional questions. I'll try not to traverse the same ground.

This is unnecessary and would weaken the deterrence effect of penalties for those persistently non-compliant jobseekers who are deliberately not meeting their requirements while on payment, despite being fully capable. This would effectively be reproducing waivers, which are a significant problem with the current compliance framework and one of the key reasons why we're proposing a new framework.

This is a significant change. I have to put it on the record that I get lots of complaints about employment providers—as you'll be aware, since I raise it quite frequently during estimates—and so there needs to be confidence that employment providers are applying this very different system appropriately, fairly and consistently.

This review would of course look at the effectiveness of the framework and any unintended effects, taking into account the views of relevant experts and stakeholder groups. Further, a core role of the Public Service is the continued evaluation, as I've stated, of the programs and policies which they are responsible for implementing as well as staying informed about various stakeholder views. So there is the continuous evaluation and monitoring of the program.

This amendment relates to provisions for avoiding a reduction in or cancellation of a payment by undertaking a requirement and also addresses the cap of seven weeks, during which time a participant payment can be reduced or cancelled.
                                                                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                                                                     The eight-week compliance penalty of the old compliance regime had a very significant impact and it happened all at once. So we can appreciate what the government is trying to do in having a one-week suspension, a two-week suspension and a four-week suspension. But by the time you get to a four-week suspension from payments you've already had a three-week non-payment period. By the time you get to four, that's seven. The concern is that somebody could go through a cycle of a number of weeks of suspension. People can be almost as badly off, potentially, as they were under the old regime. We want to apply a cap to this process so it's really clear.
                                                                                                                                    </p>

This is supposed to be about improving the system. If you don't think this is going the work, how are you going to ensure that people don't end up suffering multiple periods of a lot of time off income support?

That's the whole purpose of the new compliance framework. The system is designed so that jobseekers do not enter the intensive compliance phase—the penalty phase—unless they are able but unwilling to meet their requirements. And I think that 'unless they are able but unwilling to meet their requirements' is a really important part of it.

If that jobseeker has further requirements during that fortnight, they may incur a further penalty if they do not meet those requirements. Jobseekers who face a two-week penalty or are cancelled from payment for four weeks will not have obligations and will not face further penalty during this period, as they are not receiving payment during that period. If they wish to remain engaged with employment services, they are able to do this, and they can volunteer for servicing.

It is quite literally about reforming your behaviour.

It's just not that clear-cut, and in their submission they said:
                                                                                                                                      </p>

Our … experience … has taught us that distinctions are in fact more blurred, people's circumstances do change, and many vulnerabilities go unreported. Discretion to tailor responses to non-compliance is essential to ensure that any compliance system remains humane.

I've had the experience of meeting and talking to a lot of people who have in fact suffered penalties from the current system. It is true that it's not so clear-cut either that you deliberately don't do something or that in fact you've made that clear-cut decision, 'Well, I'm just not going to comply.' There are really blurred areas here, and the system as it stands at the moment doesn't really account for or deal with those. As you said, they'll go back to zero and, because it's not all that clear-cut, they could start racking up those demerit points again and be in the same cycle and off income support again, and it could happen relatively quickly. This is an attempt to ensure that doesn't happen. What are you doing to ensure that it doesn't happen?

There will also be mandated assessments, generally, as you know, when a jobseeker incurs both a third and fourth demerit. Principal carer parents and those in disability employment services are generally more compliant than most jobseekers and, as a result, will actually benefit from the arrangements and the personal responsibility phase. These jobseekers will benefit from the new tools to manage their requirements and greater flexibility in scheduling or rescheduling their appointments.

A vulnerability indicator does not exempt a jobseeker from their requirements or from being subject to compliance action if they do not meet them, but it must be considered when deciding whether or not an activity is actually appropriate for the particular jobseeker. Identified vulnerabilities are also carefully taken into consideration when a determination is made about whether the person has a reasonable excuse under social security law and, therefore, whether a penalty or a suspension should be applied.

Under the new framework, earlier identification of barriers will allow better tailoring of requirements to jobseekers' circumstances and early referral for assessment for other existing support, if appropriate.

I understood what you said earlier, in terms of the reassessment process through the first two sets of penalties, as being as they apply. If a vulnerability is established during that process, would that mean that the penalty, whether it's one week or two weeks, wouldn't apply? How will that be handled if there's a reassessment during that time? As I said, many vulnerabilities go unreported for a variety of reasons, including issues around stigma and not having the confidence that they'll be believed.

I suppose I was going to the process after the first penalty is applied, not the demerit point—the actual one-week suspension and the two-week suspension. If they get to that point and vulnerabilities are eventually assessed, does that mean that they could not have their suspension applied?

It's helped to clarify things, but it doesn't go to the overarching question that I was asking in terms of a cap. It is possible that somebody could go through the whole process—have the seven weeks—and then go back to the start. They could have a cycle of those through the year. I've listened and heard all that you've said about the various interventions that can be made but, bearing all that in mind, it is possible they could have a series of suspensions going through the whole process—one, two, four, start again.

You'd have all the interventions et cetera that were being looked at, particularly if they've already been through the system once. That would already be flagged on their system, and providers would be looking out for that.

Is there then another flag when somebody has been through, say, three cycles of this? Instead of them rolling through, is there a process that then says, 'We're having multiple failures here'? If they've been through a series of cycles, they're going to have very little income. They're going to be existing for quite a period of time on no income. How do we support people who are going through that process if there is no cap on the number of times that they can be suspended?

That is actually what the system is targeting, because the people you are referring to are likely to be those who are consistently, wilfully non-compliant. If there are genuine vulnerabilities, these should be picked up along the way, hence quite literally the number of demerit points, review points et cetera and the scaling of the penalty to ensure that you are assisting those who do need assistance and you are properly targeting those who are gaming the system.

Quite frankly, the other compliance measures are picking up anybody who is trying to defraud the system. When they get to the four-week compliance process, you said that they can voluntary opt in—and I appreciate that—but there's nothing they can do to avoid the four-week penalty, is there? It's four weeks; that's it. They can do other reengagement activities or volunteer back into their employment service provider.
