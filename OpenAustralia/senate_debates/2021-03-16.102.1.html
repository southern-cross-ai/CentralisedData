           The opposition won't be supporting this select committee. Normally we do work collaboratively with all senators in this place around the establishment of committees and referrals to committees. We were advised by the government that they are concerned at the number of select committees that are currently operating in the Senate and at the level of work that references committees have—that select committees are perhaps filling part of the role that references committees had in the past—only to be given this motion on the
           <i>

           </i>
           . So we won't be supporting this today, based on the government's own advice that there are too many select committees at this point in time.

              I draw senators' attention to page 485 of
              <i>
               Odgers
              </i>
              , which says that back in 2009:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              … the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedure_Committee" rel="nofollow">
               Procedure Committee
              </a>
              recommended an understanding that there should be no more than three select committees in existence at any time.
             </p>
             <p>
              There are currently nine select committees. If this motion is agreed to today, there will be 10.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would point out also that there is a stipend, paid by the public, in relation to these committees. A chair receives $23,240 of additional payment and a deputy chair receives $11,620, so this is a cost to the taxpayer of $34,000. At the same time, we are paying a stipend for the references committee chairs and deputy chairs, and they seem to be underutilised. I won't be supporting the appointment of this select committee. I would support it if it were a references committee.

                 There is no doubt that we do need an inquiry into the influence of big tech in this country, particularly its impact on our democracy and our media and the way that big tech has allowed for the proliferation of far-right extremism on digital platforms in Australia. However, this motion contains language which concerns the Greens. It is language which is used overwhelmingly by the far right, including terms like shadowbanning and deplatforming. While we won't be supporting this motion today, we do remain open minded and of the view that we need to have a look at some of the impacts of the big tech sector on those areas I mentioned earlier.

                  The question is that motion No. 1054, as amended, be agreed to.
