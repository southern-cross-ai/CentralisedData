        My question today is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Can the minister please tell the Senate how the Albanese Labor government is working to ease cost-of-living pressures through strong and sustainable wage growth, rolling out a tax cut for every taxpayer, and energy bill relief for every household? I would also be interested to hear about the almost one million jobs created over the last two years, which is a record number of jobs created in a parliamentary term.

         I thank Senator Pratt for her question. She, alongside other members of the government, is working every day to deliver for Australians in the face of a cost-of-living crisis. Under this government, compared to what we inherited from those opposite, inflation has halved and wage growth has doubled. But, of course, there is much more work to do. We have to continue to tackle inflation, we have to continue to provide cost-of-living relief, we have to continue to roll out the tax cuts for every taxpayer and, of course, we have to ensure decent wages for Australian workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         A decent wage system is central to our work to ease the cost of living. Two point six million low-paid workers are getting their third consecutive pay rise, and the minimum wage is up $143 per week. There is really only one group in Australia that is opposed to that, and that is those sitting opposite. The only people who actually don't want the wage increases that workers are getting as a result of the government's reforms are those opposite. In addition, we will fund a 15 per cent wage increase for early childhood education and care workers. As the senator said also, nearly a million new jobs have been created, and Australians are earning more and keeping more of what they earn. This is a good thing because we all know that Australians are doing it tough.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is focused on how we deliver relief without adding to inflation. This includes by making child care cheaper. This includes providing $300 of energy bill relief. This includes a freeze on the cost of PBS medicines. This includes expanding bulk-billing. This includes the increase in Commonwealth rent assistance. This includes increases to paid parental leave,

         and strengthening the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct to drive down grocery prices. What do those opposite do? Well, they've voted against so many of these that Australians know they have no credibility—

           Both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have spoken about responsible economic management both now and with an eye to the future—in particular, putting forward Labor's plan for a Future Made in Australia. Can the minister please outline how the Albanese government is working to grow our economy and create good jobs, all the while setting up a prosperous future?

            can just finish off on cost-of-living relief—let's remember, every time those opposite come back in here to talk about the cost of living, that this is the lot that voted against cheaper medicines, this is the lot that voted against getting wages moving, this is the lot that voted against energy price relief and this is the lot that voted against housing help. So, whenever they come in here and talk about cost-of-living relief, we should all remember that the primary drivers of assistance to Australians—higher wages, and lower costs in a whole range of sectors—

             more to do—but, remember, what is not helpful is your opposition to it. What is not helpful is you saying, 'No, we don't want Australians to get energy price relief. We don't want Australians to get decent wages. We don't want Australians to get cheaper child care. We don't want Australians to get more bulk billing or cheaper medicines.' You have no credibility when it comes to the cost of living.

                The Labor Party, and the Albanese Labor government, are the party of decent wages. The coalition is the party of low wages—the party that believes low wages are good for the economy, remember: 'a deliberate design feature' of the Australian economy. If ever there was anything that shows the difference between the parties, it's that those of us on this side want decent wages for working people, decent wages for working Australians, and understand that cost-of-living relief must include increases in wages—that you opposed. Those opposite want low wages as 'a deliberate design feature' of the Australian economy—
