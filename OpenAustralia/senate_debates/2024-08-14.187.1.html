        There are many things about life in Australia that we may take for granted; in particular in our civil society, where we enjoy the benefits of living in one of the most robust democracies in the world. The

        </i>
        ranks us 14th globally, including us in a small and privileged list of nations that are classified as full democracies. With the many freedoms and rights we enjoy in Australia comes an important and special responsibility to lead and to promote democracy and open societies, in the world but especially in the Asia-Pacific region. That is why I wish to once again draw the attention of the

        to the situation that continues to unfold in Myanmar, or, as I prefer to remark, Burma.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been over two years since the world watched in horror as the elected civilian government in Myanmar was overturned by a military coup. Many will recall the images of a fitness instructor leading a class while tanks rolled through the very large and wide streets of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nay_Pyi_Taw" rel="nofollow">
         Nay Pyi Taw
        </a>
        behind her. It was a moment in time that encapsulated the shocking speed at which Burmese democracy was usurped by autocrats and the military. It was only hours before the newly elected parliament was scheduled to convene that the coup rolled in and veered the nation back towards the authoritarian path that Burmese people had spent decades fighting to dismantle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then, a tragic civil war has ensued between the military and a coalition of multi-ethnic democratic forces. The humanitarian cost of this war continues to unfold. It is unimaginably devastating. Over 50,000 Burmese have died—that we know of—and 13,000 of those deaths have been of children.

        special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar has stated that over 18.6 million people are in need of humanitarian aid and over 1.6 million have been internally displaced; 15.2 million civilians face food insecurity; and 7.8 million children remain out of school. There have also been widespread and credible reports of the military regime instigating war crimes, including the use of prohibited cluster munitions, deliberate massacre of civilians, sexual violence and targeted attacks on religious buildings. Christian communities particularly, but people of all faiths, have been targeted as the regime has sought to divide the country on religious grounds and consolidate its rule behind a chauvinistic ideology. These despicable attacks by the regime have led organisations such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amnesty_International" rel="nofollow">
         Amnesty International
        </a>
        and the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar to urge the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Security Council
        </a>
        to refer Myanmar to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Criminal_Court" rel="nofollow">
         International Criminal Court
        </a>
        , with cases currently ongoing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite this devastation and destruction, there remains hope for the Burmese community both in Myanmar and across the globe—indeed, for the Burmese community in our own country, including the diasporas that I work so closely with in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        . The dream of democratic rule in Myanmar can live on. In fact, an underreported reality is that pro-democracy forces have secured stunning successes on the battlefield recently, despite their disadvantage in terms of equipment and manpower. Thousands of teachers, labourers, doctors, policemen and many other ordinary people have taken up arms to join the resistance against the regime, and they've had successes in areas such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chin_State" rel="nofollow">
         Chin State
        </a>
        , the Karenni area and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachin_State" rel="nofollow">
         Kachin State
        </a>
        . These civilians turned freedom fighters are showing the world that their willingness to give their lives for a free future for Myanmar lives on, and here in Australia we should do all we can to support them and amplify their successes. Their bravery and determination are an inspiration to all of us and a reminder that the types of freedoms we enjoy in Australia are a treasure that the people around the world are paying for with their own blood, sweat and tears.
       </p>
       <p>
        At this critical juncture there's an important question to be asked, and the government needs to provide an answer. What is the Australian government doing to better support pro-democracy forces in Myanmar? What is the increased level of humanitarian support from the new Australian government? What more is it doing in forums like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        and the United Nations? That's because the Burmese in communities in Australia deserve more and, of course, because the cause of democracy deserves our support.
