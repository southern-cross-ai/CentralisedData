        In many ways Australia has taken great steps forward in the recognition of the role of women in our society and in progress towards equality between men and women. As early as 1894, women were able to vote and be elected to the parliament of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . Federally, these rights were endorsed in 1902, but it was as late as 1926 before all states recognised the right of women to be elected to parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        A conflict of the size of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        forced change to the traditional relationship of men and women and created an appreciation of the importance of women in our communities. This change reinforced the activism of women from the 1880s onwards. The Australian Women’s Suffrage Society was formed in 1889. During World War I, Norway and Denmark confirmed the right of women to vote.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Kingdom" rel="nofollow">
         The United Kingdom
        </a>
        , Germany, Czechoslovakia, Austria, the Netherlands and Canada followed soon after, at the end of World War I. However, progress has been slow. ‘Equal pay for equal work’ was not recognised until 1969. Not until 1984 was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Sex Discrimination Act
        </a>
        passed, outlawing discrimination on the basis of gender.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor government endorses the principles of equality. The recently introduced parental leave provisions are just another example.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hon" rel="nofollow">
         The Hon
        </a>
        . Kate Ellis MP recently introduced a range of measures to assist with the process of equality in our workforce. However, discussion of these measures is for another time and place. In 2006, 54.8 per cent of tertiary positions were offered to women. In 2008, 30 per cent of small businesses were operated by women and 57 per cent of Public Service positions and 36 per cent of senior positions were occupied by women, but only 12 per cent of senior private sector positions were and the percentage of women as board members was even lower. So there is still a way to go.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, today I particularly wish to recognise the organisations and women who have been added to the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women. The honour roll was created in 2005 not only to recognise the significant contribution of these women and organisations to Tasmania, Australia and even internationally but also so that these prominent women will be seen as role models by young women and encourage them and assure them that such achievements are attainable and, in fact, very desirable. In 2011, women’s organisations have been included for the very first time, to recognise the contributions that organisations have often made to the advancement of women’s issues. A further 24 women have been added. Sadly, six of these inductions are posthumously awarded. I would like to mention each of these esteemed figures but time will not allow me to fully acknowledge or give due justice to each of these inductees.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the Australian Women’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Land Army
        </a>
        , Tasmanian division, 1942-45, and the Hobart Women’s Health Centre were the two organisations recognised. The AWLA—often called ‘
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Girls" rel="nofollow">
         Land Girls
        </a>
        ’—comprised young women who volunteered to work as rural labour to offset the labour shortages on farms. The AWLA recruits initially faced reluctance and scepticism from the farming community. However, after formal farm training, the women valiantly took on exhausting dawn-to-dusk work, eventually earning great respect from the farmers they assisted. The AWLA did not receive the same recognition as other women’s services. It was only in 1985 they were able to march in Anzac Day parades, and in 1995 these women became eligible for Civilian Service Medals.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Hobart Women’s Health Centre has taken a holistic approach to women’s health and has been at the forefront of taking health issues out of surgeries and into the community. The centre acknowledges the impact of societal influences such as income, education, gender, sexual orientation and isolation on health outcomes for the individual. The centre has continuously lobbied for improved services and programs that meet women’s needs. Nutrition and body image programs, the Encore breast cancer program, support groups for endometriosis and lymphoedema sufferers, and programs for older women are examples of the centre’s work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of the 24 women inducted onto the honour roll, three have represented their communities at either state or federal level. Sadly,

        In the late seventies, the former Labor senator for Tasmania Kay Denman became a volunteer member of the Mersey Leven Community Welfare Planning Group. The group had an extensive brief focusing on social welfare issues. This led to her involvement with the inaugural committee of Mersey Leven Family Day Care, and she fought for children with disabilities to be cared for in day care facilities. This voluntary work opened up Kay’s interest in social justice issues. Kay has also been a staunch advocate for those suffering from asbestos related diseases. Having grown up in Railton, she has seen firsthand the devastating effect these diseases have on our community.
