         I thank Senator McKenzie for her question. The government is committed to doing everything that we can to create jobs. We announced our Improve the Fair Work Laws policy in May 2013, more than four months before the election. Our plan will improve business competitiveness and fairness to workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         It includes reforms to greenfields agreements which will stop rogue unions extorting unfair deals from employers—a serious impediment to national productivity and jobs. Our plan closes Labor's 'strike first, talk later' loophole in the bargaining laws that Labor refused to fix and we were promised would never occur. It clarifies individual flexibility arrangements, confirming the way Labor promised they would operate under the Fair Work Act. Employees can only trade up, must genuinely agree to the arrangements and be better off overall.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our plan will also re-establish the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Fair, productive and lawful commercial building sites are critical to Australia's competitiveness and job creation potential. After Labor abolished the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
          ABCC
         </a>
         , the bad old days in the construction industry returned: wildcat stoppages, militant protests, demands that mates be employed on projects, and an increase in disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
         I remind senators of the recent allegations of corruption within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         , including kickbacks to keep the peace, favours for crime figures and threats to kill those who are prepared to speak out against the dodgy union deals. It is time these reforms were passed so that we can facilitate jobs growth in our nation.

           Yes, I can. I can inform Senator McKenzie that, on our policy for a registered organisations commission, former Australian Workers Union National Secretary, Paul Howse, has noted: 'I have no issue with coalition policy. There should be zero tolerance for any criminal activity.'

          </p>
          <p>
           In relation to the Fair Work bill, Mr Ferguson said that the reforms are:

          <p class="italic">
           … a step in the right direction, they are really quite modest.
          </p>
          <p>
           Even Professor Andrew Stewart, who was the architect of the Fair Work Act, said it was pretty straightforward and modest.

             , however, have received no support for their criticisms of the coalition's package since we released that policy in May 2013. But now, they are still trying to demonise individual flexibility arrangements, accusing the coalition of wanting to 'strip protections for workers on individual contracts' even though the current system does not have statutory individual contracts, and we aren't introducing them.

              </a>

             <p class="italic">
              … the principle of consumers being able to access advice that helps them meet their financial needs is undermined by the existence of conflicted remuneration structures in financial advice.

              <p>
               I thank Senator Dastyari for that question. Of course Mr Murray is right, which is why we have kept, in our improvements to our financial advice laws, all the consumer protections that matter but have cut all of the unnecessary red tape which is just pushing up the cost of advice—making it harder for people across Australia, who are saving for their retirement and managing financial risks through life, to access high-quality advice. What we have done in our improvements is keep the requirement for advisers to act in the best interests of their clients. We have kept the ban on conflicted remuneration. So what the government has done is entirely consistent with the observations that Mr Murray has made and that I agree with.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have also cut all of the vested interest driven red tape that Labor imposed on the financial services sector. We have achieved $190 million in savings a year, which means that we will be able to drive down the cost of advice for people across Australia saving for their retirement. People will be able to access advice that is high quality and more affordable, which means that more of their own money will remain available for their retirement—rather than fund all of the vested interest red tape that Senator Dastyari's friends in union dominated industry funds are so keen to impose on everybody else.

Minister, noting your answer on conflicted remuneration, is the minister aware of recent allegations, from a senior Westpac whistleblower, that the minister's watering down of FoFA has put bonuses for bank staff back on the table. Minister, isn't a sales bonus just another way of constructing conflicted remuneration?

                             People can call it whatever they like. If it is conflicted remuneration, it is banned and it remains banned. I refer you to ABC Fact Check, which describes these sorts of accusations as 'inaccurate scaremongering'. Don't take my word for it; take ABC Fact Check's.
