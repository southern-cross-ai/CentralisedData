        ) ( ): I took a couple of things on notice yesterday, so I'd like to inform the Senate of the answers. In response to Senator Green, regarding the reallocation of RJIP funds in tropical North Queensland, my advice is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Industry" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Industry
        </a>
        , Innovation and Science's business grants hub provided the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Infrastructure" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Infrastructure
        </a>
        , Transport, Cities and Regional Development with the eligibility and merit assessment for each application. The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Cities and Regional Development provided its recommendations to the ministerial panel based on the merit assessment. The ministerial panel considered the recommendations and made its funding decisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor Party claimed there was electoral bias and asked the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANAO" rel="nofollow">
         ANAO
        </a>
        to look into that issue. The ANAO did specifically look at that issue and concluded there was no electoral bias evident in the assessment and decision-making process concerning funding of projects in RJIP regions.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        was not short-changed. The government recommitted funding to other key priority projects in the region, including the habitat dome and the sky rail tourism projects which the former Leader of the Opposition visited during the election campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        In response to a question asked by Senator Urquhart regarding the cafe project on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Island
        </a>
        , Tasmania, I'm advised that the reason for the co-funding exemption application was the limited capacity of this not-for-profit organisation to contribute cash funding to the project. The ministerial panel approved the original application for the cafe and other amenities. I understand the proponent, Flinders Island Tourism and Business Inc., sought a change of scope to the project as the original concept of a permanent facility was not able to proceed as the site was sold prior to funding approval and they had not been able to secure a replacement site. The request was made for each of the components: cafe, commercial kitchen, accommodation and community centre. Individual semi-permanent moveable units could then be loaded onto a truck to be transported to island events when and where required. The grant recipient was also requested to add an amenities component to the project. The units would allow for maximum flexibility to service the needs of individual events and assist in addressing a major inhibitor to growth at these events on the island. The units would supplement the facilities at the Flinders Island Food and Crayfish Festival, the Furneaux Islands Festival, Music in the Vines et cetera. Letters of support from the communities were provided to support the rescoped project. The Department of Industry, Innovation and Science's AusIndustry grants hub assessed the rescoped project in terms of job outcomes, costs and impacts on other business in the regions and approved the change in scope.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, on behalf of Minister Littleproud, I took a question from Senator Walsh yesterday around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moira_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Moira Shire
        </a>
        . My advice is that last week the government announced that a further $1 million would be provided to 122 councils which had previously received funding under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DCP" rel="nofollow">
         DCP
        </a>
        extension, as well as $1 million for six new councils. The six new councils all met the rainfall deficiency and agricultural employment reliance criteria at the end of September as part of the normal quarterly update. The government has announced a review of the DCP and is expecting the outcomes of that review before January. A range of information will be considered and that will inform the $50 million that was announced by the government last week on how that can support projects in drought-affected
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA" rel="nofollow">
         LGA
        </a>
        s across the country. Any additional councils will be announced after the review is completed. The member for Nicholls asked the minister for drought to consider exercising his discretionary powers under the guidelines. The member for Nicholls's office was advised that the minister for drought was considering his request.
