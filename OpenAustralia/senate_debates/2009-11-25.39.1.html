        , highlighting the fact that infrastructure projects currently underway from the Rudd government’s stimulus spendathon require transparency and more rigorous scrutiny. Given that the Treasurer stated in September 2008 that the government’s infrastructure would be subject to ‘rigorous cost-benefit analysis’, can the minister confirm that a cost-benefit analysis has been carried out on all of the government’s infrastructure projects?

         Thank you for that question, Senator Coonan. This issue has been canvassed extensively at Senate estimates. I know Senator Coonan has many responsibilities, so she perhaps has not been there when this has been extensively canvassed, and I appreciate that she is drawing on a recent

           , you are casting quite a slur there, Senator Abetz, and I know you do not actually mean to do that. I assure you Mr Deegan has had full opportunity to address your questions and he has done so, so I will endeavour to get for you copies of his transcript about the processes of Infrastructure Australia.

          <p>
           Let us be clear about this. The Rudd government put in place an economic package that dealt with the short term successfully—despite being opposed by those opposite—and that has medium- and long-term solutions: the infrastructure spend to deal with the medium-term situation and the infrastructure outcomes in rail, ports, broadband and roads. We are looking at all of these as medium- and long-term solutions that this economy needs and that were the subject of enormous neglect by your government. There were 18 reports, from recollection, from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
            Reserve Bank
           </a>
           that made mention of the fact that the country had infrastructure bottlenecks. Your government chose—

               , the government’s decision was subject to further consideration by Infrastructure Australia, and this was clearly stated in the budget. The government also took decisions in the budget to fund additional infrastructure projects separate to the Building Australia Fund that were considered to have merit. The decision to fund the Cooroy to Curra section of the
