        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Carr. Is it not true that the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship advised caucus that four per cent of asylum seekers who get on a boat die at sea? Given that there have been over 11,000 asylum seekers lured to Australia in the last three years, since the government dismantled the tough border protection policies of the Howard government, what responsibility do members of the government take for the approximately 440 men, women and children who were encouraged to get onto a boat and who subsequently drowned?

         I thank the senator for her question. She would be asking too much of me to reveal the details of caucus discussions. I would, however, make the following observation.

            The proposition that should surely go without question is that travelling on the voyage to Australia by way of refugee boats as a result of people-smuggling activity is incredibly dangerous, and we have far too many examples of people losing their lives on those journeys. No-one, surely, could argue with that proposition. Hence I say it is morally reprehensible to argue that we should be turning boats around at sea. It is morally reprehensible to suggest that people should be turned back in these unseaworthy vessels when we know what the incredible risks are, when we know what the extraordinary dangers are and we have the historic experience of the children overboard affair. For that policy to be pursued by those opposite is morally reprehensible. I think it is beyond belief that we have a question like this that suggests anything other than the facts. It is incredibly dangerous. It is a policy position we reject and we want to stop it. We want to stop people getting on those boats, we want to stop people risking their lives and we will do all we can to see that that happens.

             , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister explain why both yesterday and in his answer just given today he condemned the coalition for a policy of turning the boats back by towing them out to sea while he supported the very same policy when it was announced by Mr Kevin Rudd in November 2007? Is there no limit to this minister's hypocrisy and moral ambivalence?

               Australian Navy
              </a>
              about how incredibly dan­gerous such a policy position is. Further­more, this government acts on the advice of the inquiry that this Senate ran into a certain maritime incident. I further draw the attention of the Senate to the suggestion that somehow or another this government is not concerned about human rights, coming from senators who support the policy of the previous government—

                     I refer the minister to the statement by the former Prime Minister, Mr Rudd, on 23 November 2007, when he said:

                    <p class="italic">
                     "You'd turn them back," he said of boats approaching Australia, emphasising that Labor believed in an "orderly immigration system" …

                          If Mr Abbott was really in the business of wanting to stop the flow of boats, if he were genuinely interested in human rights, he would ensure that the policy position that we have offered to him was actually seriously supported. All we have heard from the opposition is that your clear intention is to not support that position.
