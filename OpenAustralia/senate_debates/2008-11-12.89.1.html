         The amendment which the opposition moves, and it is the only amendment that the opposition will be moving to the superannuation bill—if I may call it that for the sake of brevity—is in relation to the commencement date. Honourable senators will recall that earlier in the year the opposition indicated that it proposed to refer this bill and the related bills to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration. That reference took place and that consideration has since occurred.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was said by some at the time that the opposition’s move to refer these bills to a Senate committee for scrutiny was a device or a tactic to delay the passage of the bills. Those remarks by those who made them were ignorant and should never have been made. It is apparent from what Senator Wong, who represents the Attorney-General in this place, has said in her contribution to the debate on the omnibus bill that the government not only welcomed the deliberations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs but in fact decided—as is apparent from the government amendments to the superannuation bill and the omnibus bill, which we will be debating shortly—having regard to the recommendations of the Senate committee, to improve the bill in the various respects reflected in those amendments.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reference to the Senate committee was, from the point of view of both sides of the chamber, a beneficial circumstance which will result in an improvement to the bills. So it is a good thing that it happened, and the suggestion that it was done for the purposes of delay, as I have said, had no basis in fact and was ignorant.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nevertheless, because the superannuation bill was not passed before the end of the last financial year a concern arose as to the possible position of individuals who might have been beneficiaries of the bill had it been passed before the end of the last financial year but, because of the period of time taken up by consideration of the bills in the Senate committee, may have missed out. The particular cases pointed to were cases of people to whom the terms of the superannuation bill might apply who were in relationships and where, between 1 July 2008 and now, a partner in a same-sex relationship died. The opposition has always been concerned to ensure that there is nobody placed in that position. I am not aware, by the way, that in fact there is anybody placed in that position. I have made inquiries and, to the best of my knowledge, there is no-one, but we cannot be sure.
        </p>
        <p>
         I remind the Senate of what the member for Wentworth, the then shadow Treasurer, now the Leader of the Opposition, said on this matter in the House of Representatives when he spoke in the second reading debate on this bill on 4 June 2008:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The key point that I wish to make now is that if the government wishes to have the benefits of this legislation available to people who would benefit from it, were it to be law today, it could choose to backdate the effective date of this legislation from whenever it chose. We know the tax laws and laws relating to superannuation are routinely—in fact, almost invariably—made effective as of the date of announcement. And it will take some months, often many months, for them to be passed into law. There is no reason why referral to a committee should defer the granting of the benefits that both sides of this House are committed to in terms of substance and in terms of the overall objective. That would ensure that those people who are concerned that they or their partner may die before this bill becomes the law of the land can have their concern set aside, and then the focus can be on the parliament getting the detail and the drafting right.
        </p>
        <p>
         I interpolate to say that that is precisely what has happened in the ensuing months. Mr Turnbull went on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This is the challenge I throw down to the government: if you are serious about delivering justice to people in same-sex relationships then you can say, as the government, that it will be effective as of budget night, the day after the election or whatever date you choose. It is entirely a matter for the government. It is the government’s liability. It is its money. The only consequence would be that there would be an additional number of people, probably a small number, who would benefit from the additional cost in the scheme of the Commonwealth budget. Having regard to the great objective of equality and equal treatment of people regardless of their sexual orientation, the additional cost is not something that I would imagine would delay or deter members on either side of this House.
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of the opposition’s amendment is to ensure that the provisions of this act, when it receives royal assent, come into effect retrospectively, as from 1 July 2008—in other words, the commencement of the current financial year—and that, in the event that there are some individuals who, as a result of the reference to the Senate committee, might have been prejudiced because of the death of a partner to whom the provisions of the bill would otherwise have applied, then the position of anybody in that unfortunate circumstance can be secured. I wonder whether the minister, who represents the Attorney-General in this place, would be kind enough to explain to the chamber why it is the case, as I understand it, that the government has set its face against this amendment.

          I thank Senator Brandis, given Senator Joyce’s previous intervention, for clarifying what the opposition’s position is on this matter. Firstly, I confirm that the government does not support the amendment. I indicate to the chamber that the government is concerned that retrospective operation of the bill and the amendments to the relevant trust deeds would give rise to significant legal complications and that the complications could only be addressed by the enactment of various and somewhat complex transitional and consequential amendments. I am advised that provision would also need to be made for the Commonwealth to provide just terms in respect of any acquisition of property affected by the retrospective application of the amendments to ensure that the bill did not involve an impermissible acquisition of property for the purposes of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution.
         </p>
         <p>
          Further, the government is also concerned that an earlier commencement date may have adverse consequences for members of self-managed superannuation funds.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
           Can I
          </a>
          indicate to Senator Brandis that the government is proposing further government amendments—which, I understand, will be moved in the House of Representatives—for reasons which I am sure he would understand, which will enable a person who, if this bill had commenced on 1 July 2008, would have been entitled to one or more payments to make an application to the finance minister for one or more replacement payments. This amendment would deal with some of the concerns that Senator Brandis and other honourable senators have raised but would not require the amendment effected by the bill to have a retrospective effect. So I would ask senators who are putting this amendment to consider the concerns that the government has raised in relation to this amendment and to recognise that some aspects of the policy logic behind their amendment are dealt with via the avenue the government is proposing to take in relation to applications being made to the finance minister.

           Mr Temporary Chairman, through you: the reason the opposition is not satisfied with the amendments that the minister has foreshadowed will be moved in the House of Representatives, a draft of which has been circulated to us this afternoon, is that they leave people who are in the circumstances of being potential beneficiaries of this bill, arising from a death that occurred prior to now but after 1 July, entirely at the mercy of the discretion of the finance minister. It does not secure their rights. It gives them the opportunity to make an application for what would in effect be an ex gratia payment. And, in our view, if we are going to do this properly, the rights of such people should be secured rather than left to the mercy of the generosity of the government. I do not suggest that there would be any bad faith affecting the exercise of any discretion but, nevertheless, their rights are not secured. As Mr Turnbull pointed out in the speech I quoted from before, it is the most common thing in the world to make retrospective the commencement date for the operations of tax laws and superannuation laws, and we are not persuaded that that cannot be done in this case.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senator Wong referred to section 51(xxxi) of the Commonwealth Constitution as being a potential hurdle here. I am, of course, not going to compromise the confidentiality of any discussions which we, the opposition, have been party to at the Attorney-General’s office, but can I say that I understand the concern. I have considered the matter, but I think the concern is not soundly based. The concern seems to arise in particular from the possible application to this case of some dicta by the former Chief Justice Murray Gleeson in the High Court’s decision in Theophanous v
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Commonwealth of Australia
           </a>
           in 2005, when
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Honour" rel="nofollow">
            His Honour
           </a>
           allowed, in an obiter dictum remark, which was not determinative or dispositive of the case at all, for the possibility that the defeasance of a superannuation fund could conceivably be a violation of the just-terms requirement of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. But this is all His Honour had to say, at page 134 of the
           <i>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Law_Report" rel="nofollow">
             Commonwealth Law Report
            </a>
           </i>
           :
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           … I would not accept that statutory superannuation or pension benefits are inherently defeasible and that, on that account alone, their modification or withdrawal could never constitute an acquisition of property.
          </p>
          <p>
           That is all His Honour said. And that seems to be the basis upon which a concern has been expressed among those who advise the government. But might I point out—and Senator Wong will understand this perfectly well—that merely for a judge to say that the defeasance of a fund ‘could never constitute an acquisition of property’ is a very different thing from saying that to create a legislative scheme whereby, conceivably, a claim could be made on a fund which would, in the circumstances of this case, be a de minimis claim—even in the event that there were anyone who would be a potential claimant on a Commonwealth superannuation fund as a result of the death of a partner between 1 July this year and November of this year—would not be regarded as the defeasance of that fund. Nor does His Honour say that it would be an acquisition of property from the fund on unjust terms. He merely says that he is not prepared to say that the modification or withdrawal could never constitute an acquisition of property.
          </p>
          <p>
           I understand why governments, particularly when they seek legal advice, operate on the precautionary principle—that is entirely proper—but I must say, Senator Wong, that the degree of caution being exhibited by the government in relation to the possible application of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution in this case to a Commonwealth fund in relation to the miniscule, if any, class of potential claimants is, I think, a concern so little grounded in any likely adjudication of this issue that it ought not to stand in the way of the government doing the right thing and commencing the operation of the legislation from 1 July.

            Senator Brandis, I do have regard for the position you have taken in relation to this bill. But I have to say, in relation to doing the right thing, that for the opposition to lecture the government about delay in enacting these rights is really quite extraordinary—after so many years of government, and after the fact that these bills were delayed as a result of the opposition having difficulty with its own position—as it is for Senator Brandis to come in here and essentially criticise the government for not wanting, for very good policy reasons, to support a retrospectivity amendment which, in large part, is being put by the opposition as a result of their own delay and inaction on this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Brandis, I appreciate that you are a lawyer and I appreciate your views about the legal position in relation to the acquisition issue. I make the point that I raised a number of issues in relation to retrospectivity, of which that was one. For example, the adverse consequences for members of self-managed superannuation funds was also an issue raised. We do believe that there are legal complexities which would arise from the passage of this amendment. On this issue I would invite senators to consider that we are debating legislation which we regard as being overdue. This is really not the time to be introducing amendments, when the minister in the chamber has indicated very clearly that these particular amendments, in our view, would create legal complexity in terms of these reforms. For those senators who are genuinely seeking the passage of these reforms, I would invite consideration of the avenue that the government is proposing, whereby application could be made, and would be enabled to be made, to the finance minister.
           </p>
           <p>
            Senator Brandis commenced his remarks by saying that such payments would be within the discretion of the finance minister. That is the case. That is precisely what I indicated the nature of the amendments would be. But I again say that the government’s view is that the retrospective operation of the bill and the amendments to the trust deeds would give rise to significant legal complications. We are proposing an alternative mechanism by which, I suppose, unfairness might be remedied. We would ask that senators in the chamber consider that approach rather than supporting an amendment which, in our view, may have significant legal complications as well as unintended consequences.

             I do not want to prolong this, but can I just say four things very briefly in reply. First of all, we are not accusing the government of delay. We are accusing the government of offering a less satisfactory mechanism—one which, as the minister concedes, does not secure the rights of potential claimants but leaves them at the mercy of the exercise of a ministerial discretion. Secondly, with respect, Senator Wong, when you yourself thanked the Senate committee for the work that it had done, and when you are about to propose extensive amendments inspired by and informed by the deliberations of that committee, which it is plainly the government’s view will improve—

                 Excuse me, Senator Wong. May I finish? The only reason this legislation was referred to the Senate committee was so that it could be looked at and the Senate committee could make recommendations for its improvement. In many respects the government has adopted those recommendations, so in the government’s own view the process has improved the bill. So it does not really lie in the mouth of the government to say that this was about delay. Thirdly, you referred to self-managed superannuation funds, Senator Wong. This had nothing to do with self-managed superannuation funds. These are Commonwealth funds.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Fourthly, the government can take its legal advice from those who advise it. The opposition will take its legal advice from those who advise it. The opposition has considered the matter. The opposition has had the benefit of briefings from the minister’s office. So, without trespassing upon the confidentiality of those discussions, we are aware of the matters which are informing the thinking of the government. It is our considered view that the potential legal difficulties of which you speak are fanciful, that the application by the government of what I call the precautionary principle in this case has been taken too far and that the parliament may confidently proceed to pass the opposition’s amendment secure in the knowledge that it will not compromise the legal validity of the bill.

                  The government disagree with the legal opinion that Senator Brandis just gave us. I ask senators who care about actually ensuring the passage of this legislation whether they want to take a risk on the basis of Senator Brandis’s legal advice to the chamber. In relation to the self-managed superannuation funds, as I understood the amendment—and perhaps I misunderstood—schedule 4 of the amendment deals with the

                  (S) Act, so that obviously extends beyond the Commonwealth superannuation funds sector. That was the basis of my indication previously.

                   The Senate has long followed the practice that it should treat as requests amendments which would result in increased expenditure under a standing appropriation, although this interpretation is not consistent with other elements of the established interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution.

                   This amendment omits the previous schedule 1 to the bill and replaces it with a new schedule. It effects a number of amendments to the content of that schedule, and I can specifically indicate those now. I will not go through all the items, because they are quite numerous, but I can if senators wish me to. A number of items in the schedule now refer to ‘a marital or couple relationship’ rather than ‘a couple relationship’. Items (6), (7), (26) and (27) will adopt the term ‘husband or wife or partner’. Items (9) and (29) will refer to regulations made under the Acts Interpretation Act rather than those made under the Judges’ Pensions Act. Items (10), (12), (13), (14), (18), (30), (42) and (47) will refer to ‘a child’ within the meaning of the Family Law Act rather than the ‘product of the relationship’ definition of a child. Further, items (5), (14), (16), (26), (46) and (52) of schedule 1 to the bill as introduced are no longer required as a consequence of the new approach to the definition of ‘a child’ and do not have equivalents in the amended schedule.

                    The opposition supports these amendments. In fact, most of the amendments to which Senator Wong has just referred arise from recommendations 1 and 2 in the additional comments by Liberal senators in the October 2008 report into the bill of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, where Liberal senators recommended firstly, by recommendation 1, that the separate status of marriage be preserved and recognised—the government has conceded that point, and I thank them for doing so, though I regret that the issue was ever raised in the first place—and secondly, by recommendation 2, that the bill be amended to remove references to a child as the product of the person’s relationship. Once again, this is a concession by the government to the recommendations of Liberal senators, and we welcome it.

                            On the broader issue, which I assume is the issue raised in your contribution, I again reiterate the government’s position. The government has a clear view that the provisions of the
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_Act" rel="nofollow">
                             Marriage Act
                            </a>
                            are retained. The government has a clear view—which was made clear prior to the election—that marriage is a union between a man and a woman. We do not regard the removal of discrimination, as set out in this bill, as in any way undermining the institution of marriage; it is about the removal of discrimination. I am advised that ‘relationship’ in this context is the common understanding of the term, not a statutory definition.

How long does it have to go before a relationship is a relationship?

                                  The advice I am given is that the approaches taken by the courts in interpreting notions of ‘de facto relationship’ in various other aspects of law would also apply in these circumstances. Again, I indicate I am not advised that there is any specific statutory definition in relation to this provision.

                                   So what do I rely on for the definition of a relationship, seeing there is no definitive term for what a relationship is or how long a relationship needs to last? I think this is a crucial part in determining what a ‘partner’ is—and determining what a partner is is a crucial part of determining how this bill operates.

                                    I think the most helpful thing I can do for you, Senator Joyce, is to refer you to the definition of ‘relationship’ that is included in the Acts Interpretation Act. In the Same-Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—General Law Reform) Bill 2008, which is the bill we were previously discussing, in the second reading debate, the amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act was discussed. The de facto relationship definition contained in that bill—because of course we are discussing the superannuation bill at the moment—is as follows:

                                      No, Senator. I indicated to you that there was no definition included in relation to the provision to which you referred. What I have said to you is that, at common law, courts would have applied a range of factors, and I am advised that the sorts of factors that would be applied would include the factors which are included in the definition under the Acts Interpretation Act, to which I have referred you.

                                        Government amendment (4) omits previous schedule 2 to the bill and replaces it with a new schedule 2. Amendment (4) effects a number of amendments to the content of schedule 2. These include the following specifically. Item 1 of schedule 2 will now insert the definition of ‘de facto partner’ into the Acts Interpretation Act. Items 2, 5, 6, 8, 13, 15, 19, 21, 24 and 25 of schedule 2 will refer to a marital or couple relationship rather than a couple relationship. Items 7 and 20 will adopt the term ‘husband or wife or partner’. Items 9 and 22 will refer to regulations made under the Acts Interpretation Act rather than the Judges’ Pensions Act. Items 10, 11 and 13, 18 and 23 will refer to a child within the meaning of the Family Law Act rather than the ‘product of a relationship’ definition of a child. Item 29 will insert a power for the Governor-General to make regulations of a transitional nature that relate to amendments made by schedule 2 or any other schedule to the act. Further, items 1, 5, 19, 20 and 29 of schedule 2 to the bill, as introduced, are no longer required as a consequence of the new approach to the definition of a child and do not have equivalents in the amended schedule 1.

                                              This amendment is designed to recognise that those people who enter into the formalised union of a registered relationship are not simply de facto partners; they are in a registered relationship. This amendment will use the term ‘couple relationship’ to refer to both de facto and registered relationships. It is not changing anything in relation to marriage. It is simply saying: let’s recognise under the ‘couple relationship’ definition that there are two different relationships—there are de facto relationships and then there are registered relationships, in which people have actually formalised their relationship.

                                               indicate the government’s response. The government has taken the approach of making extensive amendments with the intention of not only removing discrimination but also expediting this without requiring a major rewrite of a substantial amount of Commonwealth legislation. Utilisation of the term ‘couple relationship’, such as is proposed in the Greens’ amendment, would require much more extensive amendment to legislation—far more than is proposed now—and would inevitably ensure that this matter is further delayed.

                                               ’ amendment notes that the Same Sex Relationships (Equal Treatment in Commonwealth Laws—General Law Reform Bill) 2008 will require consequential amendment to omit ‘de facto partner’ and to substitute ‘partner of a couple relationship’. Again, this would require extensive amendment of many pieces of government legislation. I am advised that this would create a number of implementation problems, particularly in relation to tax legislation, where the term ‘partner’ is used in another context. I am also advised that using a term other than ‘de facto relationship’ would be inconsistent with the terms used in the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Bill 2008.

                                                I thank the minister for clarifying the government’s opposition to this amendment. I would like to point out that all we are doing is amending the current definition proposed in this bill by the minister in the Acts Interpretation Act. It is simply saying that we recognise registered relationships, which is already in another part of the government’s bill anyway. I do not understand why we would not simply tighten it up and ensure that, if we are going to support registered relationships, we give them some type of status next to de facto relationships under the umbrella term of ‘couple relationship’.

                                                 When various pieces of legislation are amended, there are often consequences for a whole range of legislation. We are very happy to provide a briefing on this issue if you wish but I invite you to recognise that amending one act, in and of itself, does not necessarily mean that consequential amendments are not then required for other legislation. In the context where we are amending some 68 pieces of Commonwealth legislation—for example, the general law reform bill—there are obviously consequences for various amendments that may be moved in this chamber. I encourage the Greens to be apprised of those consequences when considering the amendments they are putting to the Senate. In fact, you actually even note the consequential amendments that would be required in your own amendment. I reiterate that the use of the term ‘couple relationship’ would require extensive amendment to legislation. That is, in part, because the term ‘de facto relationship’ has been the key by which this antidiscrimination measure has been put. The advice I have is that the approach you are proposing would create problems in various pieces of legislation. Not only would it require further and more extensive legislative amendments but it would also create specific problems in relation to tax legislation. Also, it is inconsistent with the term used in the Family Law Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Bill 2008, so I invite you to reconsider the amendment.

If that is the case, if you do not support that, I understand. If you do support that, why didn’t the government propose these amendments long ago?

                                                     This amendment is in relation to recognition of overseas formalised relationships. I refer back to the point that the government’s own proposition supports section 22B of the Acts Interpretation Act, which is dedicated to registered relationships in Australia. What we are trying to do in amendment (3) is to say that if we are prepared to recognise those relationships in Australia then we should be prepared to recognise those that are registered overseas as well. This amendment will allow the government to prescribe types of relationships created in a foreign country under local laws as recognised as a type of registered relationship under the Acts Interpretation Act and in other locations.

                                                      It is the case, and I think that I referred to this in my summing up of the second reading debate, that the bill does not explicitly recognise overseas relationship registration and civil unions. As I also said in my summing up, the fact of such a relationship, whether a civil union or registered relationship, will make it easier for a same-sex couple to prove the existence of a de facto relationship. For example, evidence of an overseas civil union or overseas registered relationship may demonstrate a mutual commitment to a shared life for the purposes of section 22C(2)(f) of the Acts Interpretation Act. It would also clearly be relevant to the reputation and public aspects of the relationship for the purposes of section 22C(2)(h). It is the case that government policy in relation to overseas civil unions does have to have regard to the position of the government and to the requirement in the

It has been central to the opposition’s position throughout this debate that our support for this legislation is based, among other things, on the proposition that nothing in it challenges the established status of marriage as an institution between a man and a woman. The amendment proposed by Senator Hanson-Young does challenge that proposition, at least in a limited fashion. For that reason, the opposition is opposed to it.

                                                          I want to clearly put on the record that the final move towards the dissolving of the concept of marriage would be just about there if this amendment were to go through. Therefore, I fervently disagree with it. I think that I reflect the views of many of my colleagues in that, although I would not for one moment say that I reflect the views of all of them. However, for the record, I would like to know what the substantive differences are between the term ‘relationship’ as we have now proposed in this bill and what marriage actually is.

                                                           I wonder if what we are now getting in the Senate is an argument that perhaps would be better off in the opposition party rooms. I am happy to respond, but it seems to me that we are having a debate that really is a debate between you and your party colleagues, with respect. The government have made it clear that our view is that marriage is an institution between a man and a woman. We made that clear prior to the election. That is also the way in which marriage is described under the

It has been, as I have said before, central to our support for this legislation that it does not impinge on the status of marriage. Senator Joyce and I and every last member of the opposition are united in that view and in our opposition to this amendment.

Government amendment (5) replaces items 1 to 17 of the previous schedule 3 to the act. Amendment (5) effects a number of specific amendments. I will go through these sequentially. Items 5, 9, 12, 15 and 16 of schedule 3 refer to ‘marital or couple relationship’ rather than ‘couple relationship’. Items 10 and 11 adopt the term ‘husband or wife or partner’. Item 13 refers to regulations made under the Acts Interpretation Act rather than under the Judges’ Pensions Act. Items 2, 3 and 14 refer to a child within the meaning of the Family Law Act rather than the ‘product of the relationship’ definition of a child.

This is, once again, an amendment that was largely inspired by the recommendations of the Liberal senators on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into the bill. It is a beneficial amendment in recognising the status of marriage and appropriately describing children. For those reasons and for the reasons I indicated before, which I will not reiterate, we will support it.

Government amendment (6) omits the previous schedule 4 to the bill, replacing it with a new schedule 4. Amendment (6) effects a number of amendments to the content of schedule 4. These include items 1, 4, 6 and 10, which will harmonise the approach to the definition of ‘spouse’ in the bill with that of the general law reform bill. Items 1, 4, 6 and 10 repeal the definitions of ‘spouse’ in relevant acts to be amended and substitute a new definition. The new definition will expand the ordinary meaning of ‘spouse’ in the amended acts to include, first, ‘another person, whether of the same sex or a different sex, with whom the person is in a relationship that is registered under a law of a state or territory prescribed for the purposes of section 22B of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 as a kind of relationship prescribed for the purposes of that section’ and, second, ‘another person who, although not legally married to the person, lives with the person on a genuine domestic basis in a relationship as a couple’.

                                                                Items 1 and 8 refer to a child within the meaning of the Family Law Act rather than the ‘product of the relationship’ definition of a child. Items 9, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 will insert the new approach to recognition of family relationships developed for the general law reform bill into the SI(S) Act, the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. Items 14 and 15 repeal, respectively, section 65(6) of the SI(S) Act and the definition of ‘relative’ provided in section 70E(4) of that act as a consequence of the insertion of a general definition of ‘relative’ for the SI(S) Act by item 11. Item 16 inserts application provisions in relation to the amendments to the SI(S) Act. Item 17 introduces a transitional provision in relation to part 8 of the SI(S) Act and item 20 inserts an application provision relating to the commencement of amendments to the Family Law Act made by the family law amendment bill. This will allow the new definitions of the Family Law Act to apply for the purposes of amendments made by this schedule referring to that act.

Amendment (4) asks the private sector funds to, within 60 days of the commencement of schedule 4, provide a report as to whether they will adopt the new definition of de facto relationship, which would involve giving the same entitlements to same-sex couples as to opposite-sex couples. It is simply about allowing individuals and punters the information so they can vote with their feet.

Section 36A(1), as proposed by the amendment, refers to a ‘private sector fund’. I am advised that a private sector fund is defined in the SI(S) Act and, broadly speaking, covers all super funds that are not public sector super funds. A ‘private sector fund’ includes self-managed superannuation funds. This amendment would therefore also need to specifically exclude self-managed superannuation funds. There are approximately 400,000 such funds which do not report to APRA.
                                                                 </p>

As parts 1 to 3 of the bill generally commence on 1 July 2008, particularly in the light of the amendment that Senator Hanson-Young supports, 60 days would take us to 29 August 2008, which is clearly not possible.
                                                                 </p>

                                                                 </p>

Funds do not generally recognise couples; they provide benefits to individual members or, in the event of a member’s death, to the member’s dependants or to the member’s legal personal representative. So our advice is that funds would have difficulty complying with the proposed amendment as currently drafted.
                                                                 </p>

                                                                  What funds may also do is limit the dependants to whom death benefits, and in particular reversionary benefits, are paid. Dependants are defined in the SI(S) Act and will now include same-sex spouses. Whilst most funds will probably recognise the definition of spouse in the SI(S) Act, they may still restrict the payment of a reversionary pension to an opposite-sex spouse.
                                                                 </p>

As there are currently approximately 400,000—I understand 388-odd thousand—self-managed superannuation funds, this would cause significant logistical problems for APRA. Further, while section 36A imposes obligations on both funds and on APRA, there are no sanctions for not meeting these obligations.

But I think all of us understand the political game that is being played here. I want to be very clear. This government went to the election with a very clear election commitment to give same-sex couples the same rights as de facto heterosexual couples. That is the intention of this legislation. It is the first time in history the Commonwealth government has been prepared to do so. We are amending 68 pieces of legislation under the general law reform bill, and a range of other acts under this bill, in order to provide same-sex couples with the same rights—equal rights—as those which are provided for heterosexual de facto couples.

I want to make it very clear that, unfortunately, because we are not able to mandate private commercial funds to adopt these definitions—I would like to think that most of them will, but we cannot mandate them—and the government and the opposition are now not supporting an amendment to allow people to know, publicly, on the record, which funds do support that definition and which do not, we need to be very careful about how we report the entitlements being handed over today to same-sex couples. I think that this suite of bills is long overdue, and I welcome it. What I would like to have been able to do today is say that all same-sex couples in Australia, regardless of whether they work in the public or private sector, were guaranteed these entitlements. Unfortunately, we are not able to do that.

So a minister could not give the same guarantee, as I am advised, in relation to heterosexual de facto couples. I reiterate that the approach we are taking is to seek to ensure that gay and lesbian couples receive the same rights as heterosexual de facto couples in this as in other legislation.

I have a couple of points about it. There is the retrospectivity issue, which applied in relation to the previous amendment, that I raised with the Senate. I would also make the point that the proposal to make a fund non-complying, particularly given the 60 days of commencement, given that the amendment that the Greens and the opposition supported has actually passed, is an extremely harsh penalty. Senator Hanson-Young may be aware that when a fund is made non-complying all of its assets plus the income for the current year are taxed at the top marginal rate, which is currently 45 per cent. I also indicate that part 5 of the
                                                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI" rel="nofollow">

Broadly, a fund must knowingly breach a specified provision in the SI(S) Act, and there is a culpability test which the fund must fail. I have also been advised that the practical effect of making a fund non-complying could be that the relevant fund would become insolvent, which is obviously a significant negative policy consequence. I am happy to provide more information to Senator Hanson-Young, if she wishes, about the government’s position, but I indicate that we are opposing this amendment.

I think it is unfortunate that, despite how important this legislation is in ensuring that we go some way to ensuring that same-sex couples are given the same entitlements as opposite-sex couples in de facto relationships, we cannot guarantee this for people who have their superannuation tied up in private funds. I remind the Senate that that is almost 90 per cent of the Australian population.

I will go through the various specific amendments in that context. Items 1, 3 and 8 of schedule 5 will refer to a ‘marital or couple relationship’ rather than ‘couple relationship’. Item 4 will adopt the term ‘husband or wife or partner’. Item 5 will refer to regulations made under the Acts Interpretation Act rather than the Judges’ Pensions Act and items 6 and 7 will refer to a child within the meaning of the Family Law Act rather than a ‘product of a relationship’ definition of a child. I commend this amendment to the Senate.

Once again these are amendments inspired by the recommendations of the Liberal senators on the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the bill. They protect, by recognition, explicitly the status of marriage and they abandon the clinical description of children as products of a relationship. But for the work of those Liberal senators, these amendments would not be being moved this evening, which indicates, as I said earlier, the significance and benefit of the process of committee hearings on which the Senate resolves.
