           I thank the Senate for leave to explain why the government does not support this motion today. Let me make it clear that this government takes the health of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           seriously. The government notes, however, that in 2011-12 the former government allocated $13 million to respond to the findings of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Central Australia
           </a>
           Renal Study. It is understood, however, that negotiations by the previous government with the state and territory governments failed to reach an agreement and, as a result, $3 million was returned to consolidated revenue.
          </p>
          <p>
           In 2013-14, $10 million was allocated for projects to support dialysis in Central Australia, but again, negotiations by the previous government were unsuccessful. This government acknowledges the challenges associated with delivering dialysis services in Central Australia and remains committed to considering innovative ways to deliver services to remote communities and to ensuring that resources effectively reach those who need them. Senator Siewert has previously been informed that the funding for renal dialysis services is under consideration by this government and advice will be provided as it becomes available. This motion today is nothing more than a political stunt and the government does not support it.

              The reasons that Senator Nash outlined for why they do not support this motion are exactly why the Senate should be supporting this motion. The fact is the previous government committed a lot of money to address renal dialysis in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Central Australia
              </a>
              . Unfortunately, the lack of willingness from the previous government to invest where the states would not, and the lack of willingness for the tri-states,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               South Australia

               Northern Territory
              </a>
              , to agree to invest resources, has held up delivery of renal dialysis. The fact is that this is an urgent situation. It has been dragging on for years, which is why this motion is so desperately needed. We need to ensure that the sense of urgency is taken on board by this government to provide the infrastructure in Central Australia. It is urgently needed in Central Australia.
