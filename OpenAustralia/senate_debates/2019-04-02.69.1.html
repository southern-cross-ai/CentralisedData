        My question is for the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Birmingham. In a liberal democracy, free speech is a fundamental pillar which promotes open public discourse. However, it has been reported that the Prime Minister has said that my views have no place in Australia, let alone the Australian parliament.

          When I was recently the victim of an attack, the Prime Minister said that I and not my assailant should face the full force of the law. Does the government stand by the comments of the Prime Minister?

           Emphatically, yes. With every right come responsibilities, and with the right to freedom of speech is the responsibility to use it in a way that brings harmony to our society, that brings peace to our society and that is reflective of the broader values of our society. Senator Anning, through you,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
            Mr President
           </a>
           , the way in which you have conducted yourself in the time since the massacre occurred in Christchurch—that terrible tragedy that this Senate and the other place came together earlier today to reflect upon, to mourn and to pay respect but also to strongly condemn the actions of a violent madman who undertook that—betrays the rights you have to freedom of speech and shows a lack of responsibility in the way you have conducted yourself. The lack of compassion you have shown demonstrates, frankly, a basic lack of basic humanity. Lives were lost, families were ruined, a community was devastated and, rather than rightly reflecting upon the terrible act that occurred and the loss of life that occurred, you instead acted in a way that was inflammatory, that was divisive and that, indeed, fuels, potentially, further acts of terror and violence. In doing so, Senator, you have shown a reckless disregard for your fellow Australians and many others around the world. In doing so, you have failed the test of character I would expect of anybody who is elected to this place. So, yes, Senator, we all have the right to freedom of speech.

                I condemn, the government condemns and I am sure every one of the 75 other senators in this place condemns any act of violence against any individual. But, Senator Anning, to seek to compare the act that occurred, an act of protest in relation to an egg, with the comments you had made in relation to the loss of life that happened in Christchurch, is an appalling comparison to seek to make.

                Of course everybody ought to uphold the law. But everybody in this place ought also to be able to show some leadership.

I acknowledge and thank those opposite—and I'm sure those from elsewhere in the chamber—for their support that will come in relation to that censure motion.
