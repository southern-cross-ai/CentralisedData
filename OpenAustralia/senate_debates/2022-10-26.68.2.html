        My question is to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. Before the election, the now Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations said:
       </p>
       <p>
        People will be seeing in their bank accounts what the change of government mean s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night's budget confirms that inflation will be higher, electricity prices will be higher, gas prices will be higher, real wage growth will be lower and, under a conservative analysis, the average Australian family will be at least $2,000 worse off by Christmas. Minister, is this what Labor mean when they say Australians 'will be seeing in their bank accounts what the change of government means'?

         Order! Before I call the minister, I am going to warn the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Order, Senator Ayres! I do appreciate that people are very keen to make a contribution about the budget, for better or for worse, but I am going to ask people to do it respectfully and to do it quietly. I will not put up with a lot of interjections. I could barely hear the tail end of Senator Hume's question then, and we have just started.

          I thank Senator Hume for the question. I think Australians expect their government to deliver a responsible budget, an honest budget, a budget that deals with the economic circumstances of the time, a budget that delivers on the election commitments, and a budget that deals with and fixes the mess that we inherited from the former government—the mess in skills, the mess in energy, the debt and deficit that you left us, rising inflation, rising interest rates, a crisis in the energy markets in this country and an energy increase that you hid before the election.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australians expect honest, responsible budgeting, and that is what they got last night—delivering on our election commitments; not adding to the inflation problem that we are currently dealing with, which I am not sure any of those opposite actually acknowledges is happening; delivering on our commitments; and dealing with the waste, the rorts and the mess that was left to us by you when you were in government for a wasted decade, which in five month we have started taking action on. We are taking action on skills, on child care, on gender equality, on infrastructure, on health, on aged care and on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPL" rel="nofollow">
           PPL
          </a>
          —all of these areas that you could not have given a hoot about.
         </p>
         <p>
          That is what we are doing. We are fixing the problems that were left to us. We are delivering on our election commitments, and that is what the people of Australia expect. They also expect some honesty from their government about the true state of the finances of this country—again, things that you hid in the dodgy budgeting that was done in deals with the National Party. We are fixing all of it up.

            today, the Treasurer was asked: should Australians still expect that $275 off their power bills, particularly off pre-election prices? The Treasurer responded: 'Yes, it's in the budget.' Minister, where in the budget is that $275?

             The policy we took to the election in terms of Powering Australia, which the modelling underpinned, is in the budget. Perhaps you haven't got to that book, perhaps you haven't moved past the headlines, perhaps you haven't looked, but I can tell you: not only are we delivering on the policies that we put in place at the election but we have done more, because we inherited a crisis in the energy market, in gas and electricity, and we're fixing that.

               With all due respect to the minister, I have a point of order in relation to relevance. Senator Hume's question was very, very clear. It referred to a quote in relation to the $275 promise being in the budget. Which page is it on? I would ask that you direct the minister to the question.

                 On the point of order, I understand that the senator has now finished, but I would say to you, President, that you have previously ruled, as have previous presidents, that putting a lot of rhetoric and words into a point of order and repeating the question is not appropriate. I was pulled up many times, as you might recall. Senator Brockman is smiling at me, because he remembers that he pulled me up. So, I would ask that you do the same to the deputy leader, who continues to do that, rather than ask her own question.

                     We know that those opposite don't believe in the energy transformation that is currently happening around the world and that they're going to put their head in the sand on. But it is happening. I mean, this is partly why you got booted out—because you don't believe in climate change, right? You don't believe in it. You don't believe in the transformation. The Powering Australia plan is in the budget. I'm happy to go through the separate measures that are included in that.

                       At the government's Jobs and Skills Summit the Treasurer said, 'Our goals are just as clear: an economy where every Australian who wants a good, secure, well-paid job can find one'. But this budget confirms that 144,000 Australians will lose their jobs and that wages will be lower for longer. So, is the budget correct? Has the Treasurer broken his promise to the Australian people—just like the minister for energy, just like the minister for employment and just like the Prime Minister?

                            We are a government that wants to see wages move. I don't know whether those opposite have noticed, but we are dealing with a tiny bit of an inflation challenge at the moment! There is an issue here, which the government is responsibly responding to, and that is impacting on wages. Now, we have supported the minimum wage case. We are backing in a pay rise for aged-care workers. We have in this budget indexed community organisations so that they, too, can get a pay rise—something that you guys, when you were in government, never did. We are determined to get wages moving and to ensure that nobody is left behind. But these are challenging economic circumstances, and we will continue to work in the interests of the Australian people.

                              for the question. Last night the Treasurer delivered a responsible budget that is right for the times and that readies us for the future. The budget confronts challenges that have been ignored for too long and seizes the opportunities that won't wait any longer. It delivers on our commitments, which the Australian people endorsed at the last election, affirming their faith in a new government. Australians know that a complex combination of challenges at home and abroad is pushing up the cost of living and they know the government can't make inflation disappear overnight. But our budget delivers on cost-of-living relief that is responsible, reasonable and targeted and delivers a long-term economic dividend.

                              Our five-point plan for cost-of-living relief includes delivering cheaper child care for 1.26 million families, with 96 per cent of families with children in care better off and no family worse off. It expands paid parental leave to 26 weeks for working parents—the biggest reform of paid parental leave since Labor introduced it in 2011. We are making housing more affordable and helping more Australians to buy a home, with 30,000 affordable and social homes, delivered via the Housing Australia Future Fund returns, and an additional 20,000 affordable homes delivered under the National Housing Accord. We will cut the cost of medicines on the

                               I know it hurts your ears, but we're getting wages moving again. The $7.5 billion package helps put some money back into people's pockets, boosts productivity and grows the economy, but it's carefully targeted and careful for the times so that it avoids placing additional pressure on inflation.

                                           My question is also to the Minister representing the Treasurer, Senator Gallagher. I refer the minister to her answer to Senator Hume's question, where, in responding to the Treasurer's statement that Labor's promised $275 cut to power bills is in the budget, the minister said that the Treasurer was referring to the Powering Australia measures. Will these measures reduce power bills by $275, as Labor promised?

                                                        Thank you. We are implementing our Powering Australia plan, and you can see it through the budget. I'm happy to go through measures of it. We have our Rewiring the Nation—remember that? It's because the energy grid isn't fit for purpose. I wonder why? Ten years of a government that didn't do anything, that didn't do its job. So, yes, that's in the budget. We've got money for dispatchable storage technology, we've got money for community batteries—

You have repeated the question; you just need to stand and make a short statement. If it's about relevance, then make that statement. I do believe that the minister is canvassing a whole range of options around power bills, such as was in the preamble to your question. I'll listen to the last 18 seconds of the minister's answer and, if she's not being relevant I will direct her to your question. Minister.

So we have the community solar banks and we've got energy efficiency grants, which my colleague Senator McAllister has carriage of. We've got other programs in the budget which deliver on the Powering Australia plan. We know that delivering that will lower power prices—

As Senator Hume has mentioned, though, your budget last night confirms that by Christmas the average Australian family will be at least $2,000 worse off. Is a $2,000 hit to the bank accounts of all Australian families Mr Albanese's way of helping with the cost of living?

We can't add to inflation, and that's why we are working alongside—we don't want to make the Reserve Bank's job any harder. We don't want to fuel inflation. We know that inflation hits households on low incomes or fixed incomes harder than anyone. So we need to make sure that what we do is responsible, aligns with monetary policy, delivers on our commitments and doesn't add to inflation in the short term. That is what this government will deliver, and that is, frankly, what we must deliver.

The Australian people voted for an end to public handouts to the coal and gas industry, but Labor's very first budget is adding $1.9 billion of new funding on top of keeping the $40 billion of existing subsidies for coal, oil and gas. Why are you too poor to give cost-of-living relief to families but not too poor to give away $42 billion of subsidies to the fossil fuel sector and $254 billion in stage 3 tax cuts to the rich?

Senator Waters, we are very pleased to answer questions. I have answered multiple questions in this chamber that have been directed to the wrong minister. You say it is unprecedented. All we are asking you to do is what people are required to do in question time, which is to address the question to the correct minister in the portfolio. If you wish for assistance in that, we can provide you with that.

I find it ridiculous that the climate change minister can't answer a question about fossil fuel subsidies. But my final question goes to a windfall profits tax on coal and gas. Why aren't you proposing that, given that the whole crossbench supports it, rather than giving them handouts?

You sought not to take that. You've now asked a second question about future tax policy, which I'm happy to respond to by saying to you that the government's tax measures are as those set out in the budget.

I was very much hoping that I would be asked a question about our infrastructure budget and how it benefits regional Australia—and, funnily enough, you asked the question.
                                                                                                        </p>

That's why I'm pleased to say that last night's budget delivered a $123 billion infrastructure pipeline over the next 10 years. That is a bigger pipeline than the Liberals and Nationals ever promised, even after we stripped out the waste, the rorts and the smoke and mirrors of projects that were announced and never delivered. It's an infrastructure pipeline that will deliver in every corner of Australia. In Queensland, Senator Green's home state, over half a billion dollars will be provided.

Remember the $30 million commuter car park that the coalition announced, even though there was nowhere to build it? Then there was the absolute debacle of the Lavington Triangle at 10 times the market value—what a bargain! And that is before we get to the Inland Rail or the coal-fired power stations Canavan used to promote and never actually got to build. They promised a hundred dams and built two. They spent 10 years lying to the Australian public with funny money and colour coded spreadsheets, and it has stopped. Finally, Australians have a government they can believe in, that will actually deliver, that will stop the rorts and stop the waste.

The Australian people have had a gutful of colour coded spreadsheets, bad value for money and the shambles that this lot employed when it came to infrastructure. I've already given examples, but the list goes on.

We want to invest in infrastructure that actually matters. I've got news for the National Party and the Liberal Party: that big slushy machine that you ran for years is closed. We are going to be delivering real infrastructure that delivers real economic benefits and real jobs to our regions and our cities and, you know what, we will actually deliver.
