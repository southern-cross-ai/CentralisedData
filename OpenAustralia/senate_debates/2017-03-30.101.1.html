        . My question is to the Minister for Finance, Senator Cormann. Senator Cormann, last week veteran WA Liberal Party donor Julian Stawell wrote a stinging letter to The 500 Club, a body which raises money for conservative politicians, calling them to drop support for WA's six federal ministers over their lack of action on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        reform and other issues. In his letter Mr Stawell accused the Canberra six of being 'psycophantic to the Canberra establishment', Senator Cash.

          Sycophantic, sorry. When I looked at you I thought of psychos. Has the minister discussed with Mr Stawell his concerns about the minister's failure to advocate for his home state? You led with your jaw, Senator Cash. I could not help it.

           The short answer is: no, I have not. The second part of the answer is that Liberal members and senators from

            Western Australia
           </a>
           are very strong advocates for the great state of Western Australia. The first thing we did after the most anti-WA government in the history of Australia, the Gillard Labor government, which gave us the anti-WA mining tax and the anti-WA carbon tax and which created chaos and dysfunction at our borders with illegal boat arrivals as far south in Western Australia as Geraldton—if

             <p>
              Of course on coming into government the first thing we had to do was repair the mess and the damage that the most anti-WA government in the history of the Commonwealth had done to our great state of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Western Australia
              </a>
              . We had geniuses on the Labor side. Former Treasurer Wayne Swan—remember him?—delivered a mining tax that was designed to hit the WA mining industry for six. He thought it was going to raise millions of dollars. He spent all the money he thought it was going to raise and more and created massive uncertainty in Western Australia at the worst possible time. It is this government that got rid of it. It was the Liberal members and senators from Western Australia who repaired the damage that Labor did.

                     Firstly, it is a free world and the gentleman is of course entitled to his views. Secondly, while all ministers in the national government bring their respective perspectives as citizens in their respective states and representatives of their respective states, they do have a responsibility to take a national perspective on things, and that is what we do. Of course all of us from

                     , whether we are ministers or backbenchers, work every single day on how we can appropriately advance the best interests of our home states, as other senators and members in the other place would be doing. As cabinet ministers and as ministers in the national government of course ultimately we have a responsibility to focus on the national interest as well as on the interests of the respective electorates that we represent in this place.

                       Mr Stawell has suggested that 'grassroots Liberals need to get organised to effect the disendorsement of these aforementioned MPs if they do not act'. What action is the minister going to take to avoid the threat of disendorsement by grassroots Liberals?

                        It is a juvenile approach that Senator Sterle has taken. It is quite fascinating to see how much interest he pays to the internal matters of the WA Liberal Party. I think the WA Labor Party would be better served if they focused on what they were elected to do at the last state election, and that is to serve the people of

                        </a>
                        . These sorts of juvenile, university-level gibes do not do you any credit at all, Senator Sterle. Start focusing on public policy issues rather than on the internal matters of other parties. You have got enough to worry about in your party.
