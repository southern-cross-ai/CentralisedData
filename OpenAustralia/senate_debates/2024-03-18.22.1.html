        <i>
         Paid Parental Leave Act 2010

        are taken, for the purposes of the SGA Act, to be payments of salary or wages to that person as an employee of the Commonwealth.

       <p class="italic">
        If the Commonwealth does not pay sufficient superannuation as an employer on salary or wages in accordance with the SGA Act, then the Commonwealth will have a superannuation guarantee shortfall under that Act. As the amendment expands the categories of salary or wages, the amendment will likely increase the amount of the Commonwealth's superannuation guarantee shortfall under the SGA Act, which would increase any superannuation guarantee charge in respect of that shortfall that is taken to have been paid by the Commonwealth under section 5 of the SGA Act. This would have the effect of increasing the amount the Commissioner of Taxation is required to pay under Part 8 of the SGA Act under the standing appropriation in section 71 of that Act.

        These are the amendments that would say, 'Why are women having to wait for superannuation to be paid on their paid parental leave until 1 July of next year?' We welcome the fact that the government has finally and belatedly announced that superannuation will be added to the government portion of paid parental leave, but there is still no justification for why women are being asked to wait for—what is it?—16 months until that meagre top-up, important though it may be, will be added to their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPL" rel="nofollow">
         PPL
        </a>
        . This amendment says to the government, 'Stop making women wait for the good things.'
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_parental_leave" rel="nofollow">
         Paid parental leave
        </a>
        is the only entitlement upon which superannuation is not currently paid. It is also the only entitlement that is predominantly taken by women. Ergo, it is gender discrimination.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're pleased that the government have said that they will fix this, but there is no justification for making women wait. This amendment says that you will be able to get superannuation paid on your paid parental leave from 1 July of this year; you don't have to wait until 1 July of next year. Making women wait until after the next election to receive super on paid parental leave is an outrage. This is a government that said that they were meant to be for women, but they keep making us wait for some small positive improvements. I've got some other amendments that go to the broader reforms that actually women and young parents and all parents deserve, which would extend out the amount and the length of PPL that can be taken, but this particular amendment just says, 'Stop making women wait for next year.' You're not making nuclear submarines wait. You didn't make the wealthy men wait for their tax cut, even though you amended it. Why are women waiting? So I commend these amendments to the chamber.

         The government does not support these amendments. The government has announced it will pay superannuation on government funded paid parental leave from next year. The reason for this is to help normalise parental leave as a workplace entitlement like annual and sick leave.

           I understand your passion here, Senator Waters, but I will get to that. It is about annual and sick leave and reducing the impact of parental leave on retirement incomes. This is the first time the government will be paying superannuation on a government payment. A start date of 1 July 2025 will allow us to get this right. This is not a straightforward legislative change, and it will involve significant change to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPL" rel="nofollow">
            PPL
           </a>
           , income tax and superannuation legislation. It also requires significant systems changes across Services Australia and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
            ATO
           </a>
           . It's not clear how these amendments from the Greens would operate in practice, including how PPL recipients would be paid their super, given the lack of clarity in these amendments.
          </p>
          <p>
           Including superannuation as a part of this bill is not practical. Not only could it affect the successful implementation of paying super on PPL, but it could also jeopardise the timely passage of this bill. The timely passage of this bill is critical for expecting parents to be able to start to pre-claim from the end of March. Under the Paid Parental Leave Act, families are able to pre-claim up to three months ahead of their expected due date so that, from the parents' end, the administration is settled before the baby arrives. Around two thirds of families choose to pre-claim. So I just would like to say to the Greens that the government wants to get super on PPL right. Don't hold up this important bill, which extends PPL to 22 weeks from 1 July this year, 24 weeks from July 2025 and 26 weeks from July 2026.

              The government opposes these amendments. The employer role, as recommended by the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               Productivity Commission
              </a>
              to promote women's workplace retention and gender equality, has been a key feature of the scheme since it was established in 2011. The Productivity Commission said Paid Parental Leave arrangements will be viewed by both employers and employees as standard employment arrangements if they are similar to other employment conditions rather than a government payment from Services Australia. This normalises parental leave as a workplace entitlement, which is good for employee retention and fosters gender equitable workplaces.
             </p>

              The government's commitment to pay super on

               PPL
              </a>
              will also help with this. The bill before parliament does not make any change to the longstanding employer role. It gives Australian families more paid parental leave than ever before, which, in turn, is good for them, good for their employer and good for the economy. The government has heard compelling evidence from women's groups, family advocates, economists and unions about how the employer role in administering PPL is important for promoting gender equality, and removing this for small business would be a backward step.

               I rise on behalf of the Greens to point out that we won't be supporting this or any of the other amendments moved by Senators Pocock, Lambie and Babet. The whole point of having paid parental leave is that it is a workplace entitlement. Anything which would sever the connection between the worker who is taking parental leave and the employer destroys the whole point of a system that is designed to encourage women's workforce participation.

                Minister, with this payment, I understand the argument about the workplace relationship in large businesses, but it doesn't stack up in small businesses. The government's own data show that the average small business—and potentially even microbusinesses, where you have a mum running a small business with a few employees—will have to spend 15 hours administering a payment that Services Australia already administers in up to 40 per cent of cases. If you haven't been at a business for 12 months, Services Australia does it directly. I get that with a large business with an
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR" rel="nofollow">
                 HR
                </a>
                department, it should just go through there. But we're talking about small businesses here who have good relationships with their employees. They have to because they're working with them day in and day out. Surely at that level it makes sense to have an opt-in, opt-out system.
               </p>
               <p>
                If the issue is with how hard it is to navigate Services Australia, let's fix that. Let's fix Services Australia. Let's not put that onto small businesses who have to be some sort of go-between, when Services Australia is paying new parents directly 40 per cent of the time.
               </p>
               <p>
                What can the government say when it comes to small businesses now facing potentially 15 hours a week on top of all their other commitments to administer a government payment? There's multipartisan support for
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPL" rel="nofollow">
                 PPL
                </a>
                . I would love to see the government go further. But when it comes to the administration of it, this is a government payment. We should celebrate the fact that this is from the Australian people. This isn't the business coughing up: it's all of us. It's great to live in a country where we decide to do that and make that payment. So I'm a bit concerned about what it says about us that we want to try to disguise it as a business entitlement, when actually it's the Australian people saying we're going to pay for you to have real quality time with your new family. It's asking what's the government's view when it comes to small businesses and what support will there be?

                 Thank you, Senator Pocock. I certainly hear what you and Senator Lambie are saying in regard to the concerns that you are raising around this. We have gone through this quite considerably as a government, listening to all groups. We are firmly committed to employers having an active role in relation to
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPL" rel="nofollow">
                  PPL
                 </a>
                 . We are committed to improving administrative processes for businesses, using government online services. We welcome a productive and outcomes focused discussion about ways that engage with Services Australia and how it can be made more simple and efficient for employers.

                 As part of our reform, the government has committed to undertake an independent and multi-year evaluation to track the impact of the changes, which will help us identify where any refinements might be needed, particularly in the areas that you highlight today. This provides an opportunity to examine the impacts of PPL on businesses and their employees.

                    The government opposes these amendments. While those opposite have characterised parental leave as a welfare scheme, the government shares the view of the

                    is a workplace entitlement that should be administered by employers. Administering the payment is a reasonable contribution from employers, who significantly benefit from the government providing

                    to their employees. Each year the government spends around $460 million to provide PPL to employees in small businesses, and this directly contributes to higher retention rates for employees in small businesses, particularly women. Without the government payment, many employees in small businesses would not have access to any paid parental leave. This bill, which increases the scheme by an extra six weeks, is good for all employers and workers, as is our commitment to pay super on PPL from July 2025.

                     I wasn't going to make a contribution, but, given the comments that we just heard from the minister opposite, I want to put very clearly on the record that the opposition has never referred to paid parental leave as a welfare scheme. I would ask her to reflect on coming in here and making comments that are clearly inaccurate. The opposition, when it was in government, was actually the first party to move on paid parental leave. We have a strong record of supporting government funded paid parental leave. It's important to note that the Labor government and the Greens are 14 years late on this particular policy. The coalition's paid parental leave policy, taken to the 2010 and 2013 federal election campaigns, included providing superannuation in the Commonwealth paid parental scheme, only for it to be opposed by Labor and the Greens. The minister has come in here and made these ridiculous false statements. I think the record of the coalition on this particular issue is absolutely documented by vote after vote and policy after policy for many, many years. To come in here and try to diminish the contribution of the coalition in relation to paid parental leave as a legislated workplace entitlement for women to make sure that they can choose to take time off to look after their children but remain connected to the workplace is, I think, an absolute disgrace and reflects terribly on you, Minister, and your government.

                      I appreciate your response there, Senator Ruston. What I would like to point out is that my reference was to those opposite who've characterised parental leave as a welfare scheme, and I do believe you may wish to have a discussion with Senator Paterson about his statement to the media on it.

                         The government does not support this amendment. The government will be legislating to pay superannuation on government funded paid parental leave from July 2025. We are showing leadership in doing so and in helping to normalise parental leave as a workplace entitlement. In recent decades there has been a steady increase in employers funding parental leave alongside the government scheme. Among employers who offer their own paid parental leave, the vast majority—around 86 per cent—pay super on that leave. The government encourages employers to meet this standard and, increasingly, employees expect it too. The government will continue to work with employers on these matters, and that's what the national strategy for gender equality is all about.

                               Amendment (2) is framed as a request because it amends the bill to bring forward the increase in the maximum number of days for which paid parental leave can be paid from 1 July 2026 to 1 July 2024. The amendment also progressively increases the maximum number of days for which paid parental leave can be paid at the start of each financial year starting between 1 July 2025 and 1 July 2030.

                               This amendment would implement one of the recommendations of the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, whose recommendations, sadly, have been largely gathering dust on the shelf, despite them all being extremely meritorious. This amendment would say: 'Let's move up to 12 months paid parental leave by 2030.' Australia has been lagging behind comparable countries in terms of the length of PPL and, I might add, in terms of the rate. This amendment would redress that and would move us up to international best practice of 12 months by 2030.

                               As I said, this was a WEET recommendation. I believe this policy is endorsed by many of the larger unions for good reasons. It's equitable. It will both help the development of young ones and also help continue that connection to the workforce predominantly for women since they, again, are the ones who predominantly take PPL. This is a really good idea, and the chamber should support it.

It is the large expansion to paid parental leave since Labor introduced it in 2011. In addition, the government recently announced we will pay super on

Many OECD countries instead have contributory schemes where employees and employers make funding contributions. Australia takes a hybrid approach to parental leave, where the government payment is a minimum entitlement designed to complement employer provided leave. To extend the length of time parents can take off after birth or adoption, they can receive the government payment before, after or at the same time as employer paid leave.

                                Parental leave has significant benefits for businesses, who also have a key role to play. The proportion of businesses providing their own paid parental leave has steadily increased to around two-thirds, up from less than half-a-decade ago. This positive trend demonstrates employers increasingly see themselves as having a role alongside government in providing paid parental leave, recognising it is a workplace entitlement rather than a welfare payment, and we want to see this trend keep going.

                                       Briefly for the chamber, this is another one where we are not making women wait. This bill would increase the amount of PPL up to 26 weeks by 2026. We support the increase to 26 weeks, but why do you need to wait until 2026 to do the good thing? Do the good thing now. That's what this amendment says. Make those 26 weeks available for new parents from this year, not 2026. Stop making women wait.

                                        The government is investing a total of $1.2 billion over five years to expand the scheme to 26 weeks by 2026. It is the largest investment in
