         Yes, the Prime Minister does enjoy the confidence of his cabinet. The reason that he enjoys the confidence of his cabinet is his policy delivery for this nation—policy delivery be it on

That is why the Prime Minister enjoys the confidence of his cabinet and of the party room. What I do know is that Mr Shorten does not enjoy the confidence of 21 years worth of former

             When it comes to relevance, Senator Cameron never figures in the debate at all and that is why it is not surprising that he would raise a point of order of that nature.

             say to those opposite that the Prime Minister enjoys the confidence of his cabinet because of the direction that we are taking this country after the six years of Labor-Green neglect.

               I am astounded at the new-found fascination for the powers of the Governor-General by those opposite. One day they are calling on the Governor-General to sack a royal commissioner, for only one reason—they know that they would never win the case in court—and what humiliation in the media today—

                 I raise a point of order in relation to direct relevance. There were two questions: has the Prime Minister's department asked the Governor-General to stay in town this week, and will the minister rule out a preemptive double-dissolution election. The minister has gone nowhere near either of those questions.

                   Whilst those opposite continue to wallow around in Canberra gossip, we on this side are getting on with the task of ensuring that we deliver good government for this country. That is why I can tell those opposite that an early election is not on our agenda. Delivering the China free trade agreement is on our agenda. Ensuring that Labor cannot reintroduce a carbon tax is on our agenda. Ensuring that Labor cannot bring in a mining tax again is on our agenda.

                    , I ask a further supplementary question. Is the Liberal minister who says that a challenge to the Prime Minister's leadership is 'coming like a freight train' correct? Is a leadership challenge the only way to stop this government focusing on itself?

                     The only person focusing seems to be Senator Sterle, and that is a rare occasion. I will note that it is a very rare occasion that we actually have Senator Sterle focusing, but yet again when he does focus it is on the wrong thing. What Senator Sterle as a

                     n senator ought to be focussing on are the benefits of the Chinese free trade agreement for his constituents. He knows it is good for the people of Western Australia. We know it is good for the people of Western Australia. We will continue to seek to deliver for the people of Western Australia and, indeed, all of Australia. In relation to, once again, an unsourced gossip column comment, can I say to the Labor Party that we do not engage in that sort of talk; what we engage in is policy delivery. That is what we did last week in relation to the Syrian refugee crisis and we will continue to do so.
