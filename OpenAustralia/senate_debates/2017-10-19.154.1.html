        I rise as Chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade References Committee to speak on the third interim report for the committee's inquiry into the impact of Defence training activities and facilities on rural and regional communities. The committee has decided to table interim reports after regional hearings so that local communities do not have to wait until the final report from the committee for the issues in their areas to be highlighted.

        presence in the Northern Territory, which adds to the spend in the Northern Territory economy and community, and our government ministers have emphasised that the new investment in Defence will create jobs across regions and bring benefits to local businesses and communities. These policies and statements from the government have generated expectations that the regions will be able to benefit directly and indirectly through the participation of local businesses, particularly small to medium enterprises, in building Defence capability.
