         I have one question in relation to these amendments, which, I understand, provide a power to compel documents from the states. I just want to get an assurance from the minister that there is no intention that these powers would ever be used to pursue a whistleblower.

          There is no intention for these powers to be used for that purpose. The sole and express purpose of these compelling powers is to ensure that states and territories provide information to the Commonwealth in relation to the implementation and delivery of their requirements under the Murray-Darling Basin Plan.

           I would just like to indicate that I think these are good amendments, given that clarification. The last thing we want is whistleblowers and those who are working tirelessly for transparency and the improved management of the Murray-Darling Basin to be intimidated or working in fear. I think it is absolutely important for states and territories to hand over this information, but it should be limited to that. So I thank the government for putting forward these amendments.

              I want to place on record how ridiculous this is. This is what it looks like under the leadership of the new Deputy Prime Minister. We've got the National Party in here moving amendments to gut the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, against the will of their coalition partners. The amendments before us this evening do things like take all of the science out of the part of the act that governs a $1.7 billion fund. How disgraceful. It essentially creates the circumstance where that fund can be used for any purchase in rural Australia. This is exactly the kind of pork-barrelling that we have seen again and again from these people. We are in a position now where we have to gag these people, because they are wasting the Senate's time, bringing on amendments that are immensely complex to an immensely complex agreement with no notice. It is disgraceful and we will not be supporting the National Party amendments.

               Well, the Greens won't be supporting this amendment either. This is a full-blown attack on the Murray-Darling Basin, on

                I've got a couple of quick questions. Clearly I'm not going to support this full frontal attack on the Basin Plan, but I just want to confirm with the minister, Senator Ruston, that the position that's been adopted by the Nationals in the chamber today—the amendments that are being moved—are not supported by Minister Pitt, noting that he's a cabinet member.

                 The position of the government remains the same in relation to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. As I said, in many contributions I've made in this place over time, this was an extraordinarily ambitious plan. I think everybody in this chamber can be extremely proud of the fact that everybody voted to make sure we had a sustainable river system going into the future that not just supported the environment but also supported the river communities that rely on that environment—supported our food and fibre producers but made sure that it was going to be sustainable for everybody into the future.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It was an extraordinarily ambitious plan. It still is an extraordinarily ambitious plan. We have already committed much and have achieved much in the delivery of this plan, but we still have some way to go. We still have a period of time. This plan is not due to be completed until 2024. The position of the government and the position of the minister remains that we will work tirelessly between now and 2024 so we can achieve the delivery of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. We will not give up. We will not stop trying, because we are committed to the delivery of the plan.

                  Noting that it's the position of the government to fully support the Basin Plan, to fully support the 450 in section 86AA of the Water Act: if the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Joyce, was to make a statement to the contrary—noting the principles of cabinet solidarity and cabinet responsibility in relation to a member of the cabinet disagreeing with the cabinet's decisions—will the Prime Minister remove him from the cabinet?
