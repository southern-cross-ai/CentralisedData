        At the last election, people had faith that Labor would bring in a new era of transparency. When they were in opposition, Labor MPs rallied against the secrecy of the Morrison government and its failure to address transparency issues. Those issues ranged from a federal anticorruption commission to using grants to pork-barrel seats to jobs for mates to the failure to answer questions and to secrecy surrounding government processes, not to mention Scott Morrison's many ministries that he didn't even tell his colleagues about. Now they are in government, the Labor Party are proving they are just as bad.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last sitting, I did an order for the production of documents for the review of the cashless debit card completed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         University of Adelaide
        </a>
        . The report confirmed what those communities have been telling me for months: since the mandatory application of the cashless debit card was removed, there has been an increase in alcohol use and gambling, particularly in Ceduna, East Kimberly and the Goldfields sites. The findings are absolutely damning but not surprising.
       </p>
       <p>
        To ensure that Labor's decision to wind back the cashless debit card was grounded in public consultation and adequate consideration of the benefits of the scheme, transparency warrior and former senator Rex Patrick submitted a freedom of information request for Minister Rishworth's diary. Minister Rishworth's office concocted a ridiculous excuse that it would take her office 6,456 minutes, 107.6 hours or 14.35 working days to comply with the request. The minister told the media that she had visited the cashless debit card locations numerous times prior. It is clear to me that this is a desperate attempt to cover her own tracks, and I can tell you right now they haven't been transparent because they do have something to hide.
       </p>
       <p>
        Estimates documents show that the minister hasn't visited all the trial sites for two years. The cashless debit card had its place; it had its benefits, but, instead of listening to those benefits, the Labor Party has made a political decision to keep that out. I say, Minister Rishworth, shame on you!
