        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Senator Hume. Experts have warned that, without urgent action, koalas will become extinct by 2050. Loss of habitat, climate change and extreme weather are the biggest threats to our koala population, yet the environment minister has signed off on projects like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandy_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Brandy Hill
        </a>
        quarry expansion, the Vickery coalmine expansion and even the rail line to Adani that will decimate koala habitat and make climate change even worse. Why is this so-called Minister for the Environment putting the interests of mining companies and their big developer mates ahead of our koalas and our environment?

         I thank Senator Hanson-Young for her question. The Morrison government is taking action and investing $50 million over four years to boost the long-term protection and recovery efforts for koalas. This investment will protect and restore koala habitat, it will improve our understanding of koala populations, it will strengthen research into koala health and it will support training in koala care and treatment. This new package takes the Morrison government's investment in koala recovery to more than $74 million since 2019.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Threatened Species Scientific Committee has been undertaking a reassessment of the status of the listed koala, following the impacts of bushfires and in addition to other threats such as land clearing, dogs, cars and disease. The Minister for the Environment, Minister Ley, is currently considering the advice within statutory time frames. The draft national plan for the listed koala has been revised in response to the submissions provided during the public comment period, and the government intends to formally make that plan public as soon as possible. By working together with state and territory governments, with researchers, with land managers, with veterinarians and with community groups, we can all protect the koala for generations to come.

           The Prime Minister's package means nothing if the Morrison government keeps signing off on the destruction, land clearing and bulldozing of koala habitat. They can't be saved if they have no homes. When will this government back the Greens bill for a moratorium on the destruction of koala habitat? No home, no koala.

            The Morrison government's $74 million investment spans a range of threats and challenges for the koala, and that includes habitat protection. The management of habitat protection and the management of land clearing are primarily the responsibilities of state governments, but, where there are potential impacts on matters of national environmental significance, including the clearance of koala habitat, these may in fact require separate Commonwealth approval.

             The Commonwealth
            </a>
            will thus continue to play a leadership role and to support the coordination of conservation outcomes for the koala across its range.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Morrison government's $74.3 million over six years, from 2019-20 to 2024-25, into projects that are benefiting koalas both directly and indirectly includes $47 million to protect and restore the important koala habitat; $8.3 million for koala health, genetics research and medical support; and an additional $12 million for the National Koala Monitoring Program.

              No number of cute photo opportunities with the Prime Minister is going to save Australia's koala population. When will this government finally declare koalas endangered, as the science is requiring, and do something properly—seriously—to actually save their homes?

               One of the things that the Morrison government did early on, after the 2019-20 bushfires, was to talk to an independent panel of experts about the needs of koalas. The Minister for the Environment requested at that time that the Threatened Species Scientific Committee undertake an assessment of the status of the species. Now that the Threatened Species Scientific Committee have undertaken their assessment of the species, the minister is currently considering their final advice in line with the statutory time frames.

               In the meantime, there are projects to benefit the koala that are already well underway. The landmark National Koala Monitoring Program, which is filling key data gaps, will produce a robust estimate of the national koala population and monitor the health and condition of koalas. The habitat restoration and threat mitigation programs—which I spoke of earlier—in key koala hotspots in
