        and the Rose report on dyslexia—is this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dyslexia is a language-based learning disability of neurological origin. It primarily affects the skills involved in accurate and fluent word reading and spelling. It is frequently associated with difficulties in phonological processing. It occurs across the range of intellectual abilities with no distinct cut-off points. It is viewed as a lifelong disability that often does not respond as expected to best-practice evidence-based classroom methods for teaching reading.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to understand that dyslexia does not affect general intelligence. In fact, studies have shown that many people with dyslexia have average or above average levels of intelligence. Unfortunately, due to low levels of community awareness, children with dyslexia are often simply regarded as slow learners or confused with having other disorders, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD" rel="nofollow">
         ADHD
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Dyslexia has touched the lives of many. Winston Churchill,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Ali" rel="nofollow">
         Muhammad Ali
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Branson" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Branson
        </a>
        are just some examples of the very prominent who have battled dyslexia. Churchill said of dyslexia, 'I was, on the whole, considerably discouraged by my school days. It was not pleasant to feel oneself so completely outclassed and left behind at the beginning of the race.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim Bond tells me that up to 16 per cent of Australians experience varying degrees of dyslexia. For most sufferers, dyslexia has serious social, economic and personal consequences. People with poor literacy skills are more at risk of social exclusion, homelessness, depression and lower levels of health, education and employment prospects. Jim was first identified as having dyslexia at an early age. He said, 'When I was seven years old, Professor Delbridge from Macquarie University's Department of Linguistics first recognised that I had dyslexia. From that point on, my dream was to do a degree here at the university.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people are aware of Jim Bond's important work in dyslexia advocacy. He has been a passionate and committed activist for people with dyslexia for over 25 years. He has fought hard for the widespread introduction of text to speech software and technology in primary and secondary schools, libraries and universities. He has contributed to important public policy initiatives that have transformed the lives of so many people suffering from dyslexia. Jim Bond is not one to shy away from challenging the establishment. He has contributed to changes to the employment practices of the New South Wales, Victorian and federal governments. He has fought hard for the inclusion of dyslexia as a disability in the Anti-Discrimination Act and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights Act
        </a>
        . He has pushed for the recognition of dyslexia in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Education Act
        </a>
        and for funding for teacher training programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        To its credit, Macquarie University's Accessibility Services Unit has provided Jim Bond with the facilities he needs to achieve substantial success at university. Macquarie University provided Jim with a computer and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYNN" rel="nofollow">
         WYNN
        </a>
        software, which reads textbooks, course materials and web pages to him. The university also provided him with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PEARL" rel="nofollow">
         PEARL
        </a>
        camera, which takes photos of pages and reads them back to him in seconds. Using these assistive technologies has helped Jim not only pass subjects but achieve great marks. He finished his undergraduate degree with nine distinctions and three high distinctions and his postgraduate degree with a distinction average.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the day of Jim Bond's graduation last year, Macquarie University's Deputy Vice-Chancellor, Ms Deidre Anderson, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Jim really epitomises the commitment and resilience of many people who have challenges whilst pursuing education. It's been evident in the support offered to Jim that the university's support services can really make a difference in the lives of people, and the university is incredibly proud of Jim, as are his family and friends. We look forward to seeing his ongoing work in the broader community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim's achievements and activism shine a light on dyslexia in Australia and pave the way for and encourage more Australians who suffer from dyslexia to achieve success in university and tertiary education. Jim has set his sights on the ambitious goal of finishing a PhD further down the track, with a view to apparently some day entering politics. At this stage I have not discouraged him from that course of action. I certainly do wish him well and congratulate him on his academic success. I am sure it is a view that would be shared by all senators in the chamber. I congratulate him also on his very strong and committed advocacy on behalf of all Australians suffering from dyslexia.
