        asked the Minister representing the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, upon notice, on 29 June 2011:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        With reference to the answer to question on notice no. 75 taken on notice during the 2010-11 additional estimates hearings of the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee, which reported that the department does not keep data on vacant commercial space:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1)   Can the Minister advise which, if any, department currently keeps and collects data on vacant commercial space.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2)   Does the department recognise the potential to transform vacant commercial buildings into affordable rental spaces.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3)   Has the department done any research at all into the kind of incentives needed to make this attractive for property owners.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4)   Will the Minister instruct the National Housing Supply Council to collect data on vacant commercial space; if not, why not.

        <p>
         The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities has provided the following answer to the honourable senator’s question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) The department is not aware of any
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Government
         </a>
         agency that collects and maintains data on vacant commercial space.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) State, territory and local government planning regulations require commercial buildings to be located in commercial/business zones. Commercial buildings are also required to be designed and constructed in accordance with regulated commercial building guidelines.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Planning and zoning issues are the responsibility of state, territory and local governments. It is therefore appropriate for these governments to consider whether underutilised land, including vacant commercial buildings, could be reallocated to a use that delivered greater social, economic or environmental benefit.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) The department is working with other Australian Government departments to develop the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         Housing Supply and Affordability Reform agenda which includes planning and zoning governance reforms; considering national principles for residential development infrastructure charging; and extending government land audits and examining private holdings of large parcels of land to assess the scope for increasing competition and bringing land quickly to market.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The remit of the National Housing Supply Council is to monitor housing demand, supply and affordability in Australia, and to highlight current and potential gaps between housing supply and demand from households. The Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities provides broad guidance on the government’s priorities, but the council is an independent group that operates at arm’s length from government.
