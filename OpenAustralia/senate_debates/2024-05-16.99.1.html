       <p>
        Most of us in this place are aware that on 7 October the worst pogrom since the Holocaust occurred in Israel. We saw Israel attacked, a music festival and kibbutzim the scene of the most violent and depraved activity, and 1,200 dead. But 222 days on, there are still 128 hostages that have not been returned to Israel. It's now believed that 36 of those 128 still missing are dead, but their families don't know because they are held by a terror organisation who committed the most vile atrocities and who continue to call for the genocide of the Jewish people and the Israeli population, and for the destruction of Israel.
       </p>

        We heard yesterday a member of the government call and endorse those genocidal claims. I want to commend Senator Birmingham for the motion that he brought today to this place. I want to acknowledge the 56 senators who voted in support of that motion. Interestingly, the senator who made genocidal claims didn't have the courage of her convictions to vote against that motion. But we did see 12 senators in this place endorse the actions of terrorists. They support murder, genocide and the rape and torture of women and children. They themselves are acting in a fascist manner and looking to call for the genocide of a people. All those 12 senators, I'm embarrassed to sit in this chamber with you.
