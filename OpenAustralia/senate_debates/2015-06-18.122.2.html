        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash, representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the minister tell the Senate how the government's northern Australia plan will unlock jobs and opportunities in infrastructure and regional development?

         I thank Senator Canavan for his question. Like Senator Canavan and those of us on this side of the chamber, we are delighted to be part of a government that not only recognises the potential of our great North but is taking steps to embrace it and, further than that, unlock it.

         When Australians vote for a government, they hope that a government has a vision. This is a government that has a vision for Australia's future. This is a government that has a vision for the north of Australia.

           What we have seen today is a government that is setting out an ambitious, long-term reform agenda for the North. We understand that a strong north of Australia means a strong nation—more business, more trade and more investment. What does that mean for the people of Australia, including the people in the south of Australia? It means stronger growth, more jobs, higher incomes and better living standards—as I said, not just for the people in the north of Australia but for all Australians.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is a government that recognises that the north of Australia is a great place to live and work. This is a government that is going to unleash the untapped economic potential of the north of Australia. Our paper sets out the actions to capitalise on the north of Australia's strength, to manage the impediments to growth and to create the right conditions for private sector investment, innovation and growth, including addressing the infrastructure needed to support the long-term growth for the region.
          </p>
          <p>
           Senators on this side of the chamber know that northern Australia is a diverse and vibrant region rich in opportunities to drive growth in jobs and investment.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
            The Commonwealth
           </a>
           government is making record levels of investment in the north of Australia. We are investing $1.2 billion over the forward estimates in northern Australia to seize the economic potential and the opportunities, and to secure all Australians' future.

             Absolutely, I can. This side of the chamber, this government, is investing in northern Australia to seize the economic potential, as I said. Our investment includes $600 million for a northern Australia roads package for priority road projects, including the

             . This is in addition to the $5 billion Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, $15.3 million in our tropical health strategy, $100 million in our northern Australia beef roads and the Northern Australia Insurance Premiums Taskforce, as announced in the budget.
            </p>
            <p>
             This government has already announced a $200 million package to improve infrastructure in the

             , which will not only improve local road accessibility once complete but, during the construction, will create much-needed jobs. These are just some of the projects that will help the north of Australia build its enormous potential.

                 Despite being home to over one million people and three million square kilometres of land, there are a number of barriers that need to be overcome in order to unlock these sensational opportunities. These, of course, are a lack of basic infrastructure, information on water and soils, and uncertain or restrictive land and water rights. But the northern Australia white paper provides investment in long-term and innovative water solutions. This is not just about building dams. The national water fund will provide $200 million for whatever infrastructure gets water to where it is needed most in the North. The white paper also provides up to $5 million for a feasibility study towards starting Nullinga Dam near Cairns, going up to $5 million to finalise the business case for Ord stage 3. This is a fantastic plan for all Australians.
