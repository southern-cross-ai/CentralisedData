        I wish to make some comments on the

        , which has been prepared in accordance with section 54 of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975. In doing this, can I congratulate the board and staff of the

        , based in Townsville. I particularly congratulate Dr Russell Reichelt, Chairman and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Executive Officer
        </a>
        of the authority. I also pay tribute to Fay Barker, until recently a member of the board for over a decade. Fay, a Townsville person, was a councillor on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Townsville City Council
        </a>
        and made a very significant contribution to the work of the authority. I know all of those associated with the reef join with me in thanking Fay for the work she did as a member of the board.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to take this opportunity to congratulate Mr Daniel Gschwind on his appointment to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Daniel is well known to those involved in the tourism industry, particularly in Queensland. Mr Gschwind’s appointment was as a result of his very great experience with the Great Barrier Reef tourism industry. He is certainly very well respected by the industry. He is a member of many organisations involving tourism generally and the Great Barrier Reef in particular. He is also a member of the Reef and Rainforest Research Centre. He is a very distinguished Queenslander and a very good appointment. I congratulate him on his appointment. I note in passing that he was appointed to the authority on the basis of an amendment moved by the coalition in this chamber. We moved to amend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act to include a requirement that one member of the authority be someone with practical tourism experience related to the Great Barrier Reef. That was opposed by the Labor Party, but, fortuitously, the Senate, in its wisdom, adopted the amendment. When the bill went back to the other chamber, the government, again fortuitously, rolled over and that appointment was created. I am delighted to see that Mr Gschwind has now been appointed by the government to that position.

        The outlook report is a very interesting document. Time this evening is not going to allow me to do more than briefly touch on it. The report notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         The Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        is one of the most diverse and remarkable ecosystems in the world and remains one of the most healthy coral reef ecosystems.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think this is a credit to the work of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority since
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Fraser" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Fraser
        </a>
        first established the authority decades ago. The report goes on to provide some very interesting information and statistics. It clearly shows the dangers confronting the reef. Water quality problems from catchment run-off; the loss of habitats from coastal development; the remaining impacts of fishing, illegal fishing and poaching; and climate change are all things that affect the reef. I note that the executive summary of the report finishes with these words:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Given the strong management of the Great Barrier Reef, it is likely that the ecosystem will survive better under the pressure of accumulating risks than most reef ecosystems around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final paragraph says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Further building the resilience of the Great Barrier Reef by improving water quality, reducing the loss of coastal habitats and increasing knowledge about fishing and its effects, will give it the best chance of adapting to and recovering from the serious threats ahead, especially from climate change.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst climate change is a threat, I think this report demonstrates when you look through it in detail that, despite the hysteria that goes on amongst some groups about the impact of climate change on the reef, it is being dealt with very responsibly and seriously. I look forward to an opportunity to speak further about this.

          outlook report 2009

         . In doing so, I commend the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority
         </a>
         not only for the work that they do in the production of important documents like this but for their ongoing management and the research work that they deliver. As it is a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
          World Heritage
         </a>
         listed site, I commend them on behalf of all of us—Australians and the world. The outlook report tells us that the Great Barrier Reef continues to be one of the world’s healthiest coral reef ecosystems. This is testament to strong management over many years. But it also is very clear in the report that there are significant challenges that need to be met. At risk is the reef as we know it. Effective action on climate change is absolutely critical to the ongoing health of the reef. So too is action to enable the reef to withstand the impacts of the already changing climate. I have a difference of opinion with Senator Macdonald on this. We know that the impacts of climate change are already affecting our reef. We know that there has been an expansion of coral bleaching and we know that coral bleaching happens as a direct result of increased water temperature over a prolonged period of time. The effects of climate change are very real when it comes to our Great Barrier Reef, and we have to do all we can in every area to adapt and to mitigate those effects.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government are responding to that challenge. We have a comprehensive strategy to move Australia towards a low-carbon future. We have committed to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         and an expanded renewable energy target. I invite those sitting opposite, who have not supported our Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, to consider what you are putting at risk. Taking no action on climate change will result—not ‘may’ result but ‘will’ result—in the loss of this fantastic natural and economic asset that we have.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government have invested at record levels in energy efficiency research and development of new clean energy technologies. We are investing $200 million through our reef rescue plan to promote better land management practices that will deliver on real targets for reducing harmful run-off onto the reef. Already, we have assisted around 900 farmers. Through the latest $50 million funding instalment, we expect to see an additional 2,000 farmers and graziers sign up. We recently committed to a new Reef Water Quality Protection Plan to coordinate the Australian and Queensland action to improve reef water quality. Together, the governments will halve harmful run-off into the reef within five years.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have put in place strong new legislative protection for the reef, overhauling the 30-year-old Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act to strengthen and modernise legal protection for the reef. We have put in place with the Queensland government a new intergovernmental agreement for the reef and convened a Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council to drive a new era of cooperation to protect the reef from the challenges of today. Together with the Queensland government, we have released a response to the outlook report, outlining the actions the governments are taking to ensure the reef remains one of the world’s most significant natural assets. Both governments are undeniably committed to protecting the reef. It is one of our most incredible natural assets and supports industries worth billions of dollars to the Australian economy each year. The outlook report provides the baseline against which the effectiveness of our actions will be measured. I encourage everyone to have a good look at it and to especially focus on the issues to do with climate change. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.
