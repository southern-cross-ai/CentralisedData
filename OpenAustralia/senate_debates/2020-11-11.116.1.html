         I thank Senator Stoker for what is an extremely important question. The recent events of terrorism in both Paris and Vienna were shocking. The Morrison government is committed to ensuring we do not see similar violence enacted here in Australia. Our first priority is to keep the community safe from those who wish to do us harm. We may be in the middle of a global pandemic but the threat of terrorism remains in Australia, as it does in other places around the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the national terrorism threat level was raised in September 2014, there have been seven attacks and 18 major disruption operations in response to imminent attacks that were being planned on Australians. There have been 116 people charged as a result of counterterrorism operations. There are currently 22 people before the courts for terrorism related offences.
        </p>
        <p>
         To respond to this threat, the coalition government has passed 20 tranches of legislation. This legislation includes: to create a presumption against bail and parole for persons who have demonstrated support for or links to terrorist activity; to enable the continued detention of high-risk terrorists and strengthen control orders to minimise the threat to the Australian public; and to establish the temporary exclusion order scheme, which gives law enforcement and security agencies greater control and certainty in managing Australians of interest returning to Australia, including foreign fighters. We have also invested, as a government, more than $61 million to support programs to counter violent extremism. Our laws and arrangements focus on threat and criminality, regardless of ideology.

           With Australians spending more time online than ever due to the COVID restrictions we've faced this year, what steps has the government taken to fight violent extremism online and to fight the risk of terrorism and keep Australians safe?

            The government's position is very clear: the rule of law must apply online, as it does offline. COVID-19 has actually increased the likelihood that people vulnerable to extremist rhetoric will find platforms hosting extremist content. In fact, at a time when most people across the globe have been spending more time online, efforts to prevent terrorist and violent extremist exploitation of the internet are critical. Following the events in Christchurch in 2019, Australia acted quickly to legislate new laws to prevent the misuse of online platforms. Additionally, Australia is advocating to deepen international norms and support the development of common industry standards to counter terrorist and violent extremist content online. The government is also working with international partners, digital industry and civil society to improve transparencyâ€”

               As we know, COVID-19 has not ended the threat of terrorism and criminal activity. The recent budget that the Morrison government handed down prepares Australian law enforcement agencies to deal with terrorist and criminal threats in order to keep Australians safe. This year alone, the government has invested $8.2 billion across the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
                Home Affairs
               </a>
               portfolio. The budget is also providing an additional $300 million over four years to enhance the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
                AFP
               </a>
               's search capacity and ability to respond to emerging threats, including terrorist threats. This investment is designed to defeat all of those who are involved in activities that most Australians actually don't know anything aboutâ€”the underworld, the dark web and the networks that these criminal syndicates operate to do us harm and to seek profit at the expense of Australian citizens. This builds on last year's budgetâ€”
