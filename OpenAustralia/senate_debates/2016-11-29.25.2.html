        My question is to the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis. In the Attorney-General's statement to the Senate yesterday regarding the

         Bell Group

         Senator Gallagher, I am not sure that properly characterises what my understanding of the matter was at any time, as a matter of fact. As I said in my statement yesterday, I became aware on 3 March when I received a visit from Mr Porter, who discussed the matter with me. I had a teleconference with Mr Mischin, the Attorney-General of

               The Attorney-General was asked when and how he first became aware. He commenced his answer by answering—as he indicated yesterday—3 March. The date was mentioned. He is now continuing with his answer and is indicating another date, 4 March, for subsequent material. The Attorney-General has been in order.

                I know that there had been some communication to my office earlier than 3 March, but my own involvement began on 3 March. Senator Gallagher, the relevant events, to which I understand you refer, occurred in April 2015, which was almost a year before I first became involved.

                   It was before 3 March. I looked at some documents overnight, and I think it may have been in January 2016, but I will check that date. The point I make to you, Senator, is that the relevant discussion, which is said to constitute—at least as pointed to by

                     I again refer to the Attorney-General's statement to the Senate, in which he claimed not to have been personally involved in the matter until 3 March. How can he maintain he was not personally involved when counsel appearing on his behalf in the High Court appeared on 8 February?

                      That is not correct. The counsel who appeared in the matter in the High Court on behalf of the only relevant Commonwealth party, Mr Gleeson, was, as I understand the matter, at that time acting on the instructions of the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
                       Australian Taxation Office
                      </a>
                      —not on my instructions. As I was at pains to point out yesterday, at that time and subsequently I was not involved in giving instructions to Mr Gleeson on behalf of the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Taxation Office is an independent statutory authority; when it retains counsel, counsel appears on behalf of it, not on behalf of the Attorney-General.
