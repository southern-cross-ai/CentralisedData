        </p>
        <p>
         I just want to explain our position on that. The government recognises the complexity of this proposed legislation and is committed to a thorough, collaborative process of genuine consultation. We want to get this right, so we welcome a close interrogation of this bill to see if sensible amendments can be made to ensure the legislation is fit for purpose. In line with the usual practice involving legislation of this sensitive nature, the government has referred the bill to the Parliamentary Joint
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Committee
         </a>
         on Intelligence and Security. The PJCIS is the appropriate committee to scrutinise this bill. The nature of the committee is that it can hold classified hearings and receive classified briefings from the security agencies. This will ensure that scrutiny of the bill is informed by the full picture of the security assessments underpinning the need for the legislation.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we would expect, the government has also asked the PJCIS to hold public hearings and invite public submissions, again to ensure that the bill is scrutinised with the appropriate rigour by the parliament. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greens_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Greens Party
         </a>
         —and I'm pre-empting some contributions from Senator McKim—does like to make some colourful arguments about these matters, but it's the job of the government and responsible parties of government to act in the national interest and ensure that Australians are safe, and that's what we're doing here. I understand that Senator Shoebridge has a different view, including casting a negative view on some of the good people in Defence, our intelligence agencies and the PJCIS. Ultimately, despite being the Greens' defence spokesperson, he and his party don't think that these bodies should exist.

            I move an amendment to the amendment moved by Senator Chisholm:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Omit "not be referred to a committee", substitute "be referred immediately to the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
             Committee
            </a>
            for inquiry and report by 6 November 2023".
           </p>
           <p>
            I will just speak briefly to that amendment. We all know what's going to happen here, and that is that the major parties are going to collude to prevent the Senate from running an inquiry into the Australian Greens' bill to end native forest logging in Australia. And why are they going to do that? Because they're captive to the native forest logging industry. Why else are they going to do that? Because they don't want Australians to have a chance to discuss and contribute to a conversation about the fact that native forest logging has completely lost its social licence. Why else are they going to do that? Because they don't want to have a conversation in this country about the massive carbon bomb that is native forest logging. Why else do they not want to do that? Because they don't want to talk about the fact that native forest logging is driving species like the beautiful little swift parrot into extinction.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's be really clear about this. Native forest logging has no social licence. Native forest logging is a crime against nature. It is a crime against climate. Native forest logging is driving species to extinction. Native forest logging is a mendicant burden on the public purse. If you withdrew the public subsidies to the native forest logging industry, it would collapse tomorrow! It can't survive without the never-ending largesse from the Labor and Liberal parties. That is why the Labor and Liberal parties are going to collude to prevent the Greens' bill to end native forest logging going to a Senate inquiry, make no mistake.

             It's another day in the Senate, and it's another stunt from the forest-science-denying group of people down the end of the chamber there, aka the Greens political party, as they're now referred to. There is no science behind what that group of people down there are proposing today—this bill to end native forest logging. We've heard about climate bombs, a crime against climate and a crime against nature. All of these things are bunkum. What happens when we end native forest logging in this country, something that is done to world's best standard, is based on science and supports jobs in regional communities? What happens when we ban this industry that is so evil?

               , and I shan't, because it's disorderly. But the point is: when we shut this industry down, what will we do to get the timber we need for the appearance grade products that we demand in this marketplace? We'll get it from places like the

That mob down there, forest science deniers, completely abandon fact and science when it comes to propositions like this. You know what? People of Melbourne and Sydney who want their beautiful coffee tables and lovely floorboards, do you know where it's coming from? You're still going to be able to buy it with a little stamp saying it's all okay, but it will be coming out of places like the Congo Basin.

               This crew have made an industry out of destroying industries that are sustainable and based on science, all because they tap into the psyche that some people have, and that is that they don't like seeing clear-felled coupes. Forget the science behind it. Forget the facts. Forget the jobs and the economic activity it generates. Forget about all of that, because it doesn't matter.

                 I will take the interjection from Senator Shoebridge: 'Nobody likes seeing clear-felled coupes.' That is the basis upon which this bill is being moved—because it doesn't feel good. I'll tell you what: it is good for the environment. It is based on science. It creates jobs. What isn't good is bringing timber in for the same products that we buy today but, instead of getting it from sustainably managed, science based forestry operations in Australia, getting it from the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congo_Basin" rel="nofollow">
                  Congo Basin
                 </a>
                 or other places where they don't give a damn about the environment.
                </p>
                <p>
                 You know what? These forestry operations overseas have tinges of modern slavery attached to them. But apparently it's okay to shut down the forestry industry in Australia, okay to send the economic benefits of these jobs and that industry offshore, okay to offshore forestry operations to jurisdictions where they don't care about carbon emissions. I'll tell you what: as a signatory to the Glasgow declaration on halting deforestation by 2030, I'll guarantee you that none of those countries from which we will be drawing this material are signatories to that. They won't be replanting the trees that are ripped out of the ground as a result of what's happened in Victoria under the madness of the Andrews Labor government and what's happened in

                 under the madness of former premier McGowan's government—terrible policies that are not based on science, not based on fact, bad for the economy and bad for the environment. How anyone can stand in this place and say it is good for the environment to do what the Greens are proposing to do is beyond me.

                 Senator McKim calls it 'collusion'. I call it 'reality'. I call it 'based on science'. I call it 'based on fact'. I'm not going to abandon the people who work in this industry—honest, hardworking people—who rely on science, who back in what this industry does.

                 There are these silly, emotive questions being asked from the crazy corner of the Senate down there—the forest science deniers. 'Why do you hate gliders? Why do you hate swift parrots?' Apparently, they're mutually exclusive. There is no recognition in this bill, which they're seeking to refer off to this committee for inquiry, of what the industry has done to manage threatened species. It is based on emotion, not based on science, all for a Facebook clip. That's what this is about, and the Greens should hang their heads in shame as a result of this.
