        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Abetz. I refer to the government's review of the renewable energy target that will soon be handed down. I also refer to comments by

       <p>
        Does the minister agree that abolishing the renewable energy target will drive the renewable energy sector and foreign investors away from Australia?

         We are getting very close to the hypothetical questions with the honourable senator's question because I am asked what might happen if we were to abolish the renewable energy target. The government has made no such announcement. What the government has said is that there would be a review of the renewable energy target, something that was actually in the legislation when it was passed. The review now falls to this government to undertake.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like with everything we do, we will look at this in a methodical manner, in a purposeful manner and in a careful manner to ensure that we get the right policy settings. We will not be responding as Senator Singh and the Labor Party does—for example, there is a

          </a>
         </i>
         program so you ban the live export trade. We do not behave like that in government. We take a very considered approach to policy making and that is why, Senator, whilst you want us as a government—and I can understand the political tactic of trying this—to be pre-empting our own inquiry and its findings, we will not be. We hear the comments of Mr Thomson and other people. I am sure they have put their views to the committee of review in relation to the renewable energy target. All that will come out in the wash with their report, and the government will consider it.

          I refer to the Granville wind farm project that has the potential to employ 200 people on Tasmania's west coast. Is the minister aware of the comments by Westcoast Wind Director,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royce_Smith" rel="nofollow">
           Royce Smith
          </a>

          review has 'got a few investors a bit shy at the moment because it's a bit hard to invest money if you don't know what the outcome is going to be'. Won't abolishing the renewable energy target undermine, rather than create, jobs on Tasmania's west coast?

           Talking about the abolition of the renewable energy target in this manner, as Senator Singh has done, is more likely to undermine confidence than anything else. So the crocodile tears of Senator Singh are there for all to see. As I have indicated, we have a review being undertaken. We will consider the outcome of that review and make a decision that is in the long-term best interests of our nation, both economically and environmentally. Until such time as we have the review and have considered it, all the other commentary by Senator Singh might grab her a headline but, with great respect, is pure speculation that does nothing for the sector that she seeks to champion.

            , I ask a further supplementary question. This is the minister's opportunity to get rid of that speculation. Can the minister confirm that the government remains committed to the Prime Minister's pre-election promise to maintain the renewable energy target?

             I can confirm that the government are committed to undertaking the review which was always on the cards and which is now being undertaken. As a government that are committed to policies such as direct action to assist the environment, a policy that I am sure Senator Singh and her Labor colleagues will endorse and support us on, we will look at this review and its recommendations. Are we committed to renewable energy? The government are committed to working through these issues in a manner that is in the best interests of all Australians. When you have a taxpayer funded review, does it not make sense for a mature, stable government to say let's wait for the review?
