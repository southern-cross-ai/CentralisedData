        Niceties aside, my question is to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Senator Farrell. During question time on Monday, Senator Farrell made comments in response to a question from Senator Cox. He subsequently withdrew the comments and, this morning, apologised for the comments. The minister, also during question time on Monday—it was a busy one for the minister in terms of such statements—made another controversial statement, unnecessarily and erroneously remarking that he 'was not sure the United States is our most trusted ally'. To date the minister has made no public statement to clarify these remarks, despite clarifying his other controversial statements from question time on Monday. Will he now take this opportunity to correct the record and apologise for those comments?

           But on the odd occasions that I do, Senator McKenzie, I am always happy to own up to mistakes that I made. In reference to the first part of your question, Senator Birmingham, I did this morning—as I had done on the Monday afternoon—go and talk to Senator Cox and indicate to her that I did not intend to make the comment in the way in which it was understood. I quickly spoke to her about it to apologise, and to any other person in the chamber who may have felt aggrieved by my comments. I repeated that today publicly on the record.
          </p>
          <p>
           In terms of the other comments I made on Monday, I am a little bit puzzled by the obsession—as I would almost call it—by Senator Birmingham about the issues of the closeness of our allies. In this troubling time, when we see wars right around the world, we need very many close allies. Of course the United States are amongst our closest—

             The Prime Minister remarked during his state visit to the United States last year:

            <p class="italic">
             I regard the relationship … as second to none of the relationships that I have around the world or indeed domestically, for that matter … it's a relationship of trust …
            </p>
            <p>
             Minister, you declined the opportunity to set the record straight. Are you deliberately setting about contradicting the Prime Minister when you voluntarily choose to talk down the closeness of our relationship with the

              I thank Senator Birmingham for his first supplementary question. As I say, Senator Birmingham does seem to have somewhat of an obsession with this particular issue. I'm on all fours with the Prime Minister. We work as a team, whether it's the foreign minister, the Prime Minister or, for that matter, the defence minister. In this government, we work as a team. We have consistent policies, whether they are towards the United States, New Zealand or, for that matter, China. We're going to continue to do that. What we as a government have done over the last almost two years now is to—

                share the most sensitive—the most sensitive—of intelligence secrets with one another. The success of the AUKUS partnership hinges on the United States trusting Australia with their most sensitive defence secrets.

                 Again, I repeat that the senator seems somewhat obsessed with this issue. We need, in these troubling times, a whole lot of close allies. Of course, the United States is there.
