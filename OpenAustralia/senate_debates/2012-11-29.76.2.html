         agreements to meet the deadlines of developing standards by December 2012 and agreeing on new bilateral arrangements for the accreditation of assessment and approval processes by March 2013. These reforms are about eliminating duplication and making processes more efficient for business. They are not about reducing standards or winding back environmental protection. High environmental standards will be maintained and businesses will benefit from reduced regulatory burden.

         Yes, from the minister involved, given that I am representing him. You are very observant, Senator Abetz, as always. The Australian government is involved with the national agenda for reform of environmental regulation. The minister announced the government's response, and the environmental department and Minister Burke have pursued these reforms actively, consulting with many groups, including the Business Advisory Forum prior to COAG. The COAG process is continuing, and if there is any further information that is available to assist the senator I will seek it from Minister Burke.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Minister, you said that the federal government will require the states to meet standards of environmental protection, but no standard in the world will change the fundamental approach of state governments to put short-term economic gain ahead of environmental protection. So, when will you stop selling out Australia's environment to the highest bidder?

           I fundamentally reject the premise of the question. The standards will ensure that high environmental outcomes are maintained. On 2 November 2012, the minister released a draft framework of standards for accreditation. The draft standards, along with the accompanying statement of environmental and assurance outcomes, were released so that people could be clear on what the draft standards were and the approach the government would take to the negotiation of the bilateral agreements with states and territories, and to ensure there were no omissions.
          </p>
          <p>
           The draft standards are the foundational rules for the negotiations. They are about keeping the bar high, and making sure Australia's environmental protection standards are maintained.

               I had the good luck on that particular Sunday morning to be watching the television and I saw Minister Ferguson. I do not recall him mentioning fluffy regulations and handing things over. So I do not think the basis of your question has any merit at all. It almost resembles an opposition question, in that it seeks to denigrate rather than actually ask a question. I do not think there is anything for me to follow up on with Minister Burke, but if there are any follow-up questions I would happily seek further information.
