        My question is to the Minister for Jobs and Innovation, Senator Cash. I refer to a submission to the Fair Work Commission by Hair and Beauty Australia, which argues for the wages of workers in their industry to be cut even when wages are at a record low. Will the Turnbull government be making a submission to the Fair Work Commission to defend the workers in the hair and beauty industry who rely on penalty rates?

         The Turnbull government's position in relation to penalty rates is very clear. We have always respected the decision of the independent umpire. It's those on the other side who have a record, as you know, Senator Cameron, when it comes to penalty rates. I only caught glimpses of Sally McManus's speech today at the

           Yes, on relevance. The question goes to the issue of whether the government will make a submission to defend the workers in the hair and beauty sector. It's not about Sally McManus; it's about defending workers.

             The government, as you know, consistent with all governments, has recently put in a submission to the annual wage review. We provide submissions as required and as appropriate to the Fair Work Commission. In relation to penalty rates, Senator Cameron, I have to say that your hypocrisy is absolutely outstanding, because it is the Leader of the Opposition himself, Mr

             , who has sat around a table and directly negotiated away the penalty rates of some of the lowest-paid workers in this country. And it's not as if he actually compensated them. He negotiated away their penalty rates with absolutely no compensation at all, and when you—

                   It sounds like no. While this government stands by and does nothing, penalty rates are getting cut. The cost of living continues to go up and up, and wages growth has hit record lows. Why is this government's only plan to help Australians who are struggling with stagnant wages and spiralling costs of living to give companies a $65 billion handout?

                    Because those of us on this side understand that governments don't create jobs; employers do. The closest that many of you on the other side have ever come to a business is to close it down. Employees need employers, and those of us on this side understand that what governments do is put in place the policy framework under which business can either prosper and grow—400,000 jobs created in the economy under the Turnbull government last year, with 300,000 of them being full-time jobs, versus the last 12 months of the former Labor government, when a fifth of that number of jobs were created. But, colleagues, guess what? It got worse. The economy actually lost full-time jobs. We understand you need to get the economic fundamentals right; you don't.

                       Given the hypocrisy of those on the other side, what Senator Cameron is referring to could be termed as nothing more and nothing less than a political stunt. When you actually look at members of the Labor Party, they belong to unions, or they are put in here by unions, who have sat around tables, probably just like this, and directly negotiated away the penalty rates of some of the lowest-paid workers in this country. Let me give you some other examples in relation to Mr Shorten: a 2006 agreement for 780 Big W workers in
