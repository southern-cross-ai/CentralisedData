The incoming government should establish a working group, or use the COAG Business Regulation and Competition Working Group. The working group should consult extensively with the sector in a timely manner to address issues arising from the establishment of a commission which applies a public benefit test.

         The Government
        </a>
        committed to strengthening the not-for-profit sector in its 2010 election campaign including a scoping study for a national regulator for the sector to be completed in early 2011.
       </p>

        Recommendation 2: The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General’s Department provide a report to the Committee on the operation of Miviludes and other law enforcement agencies overseas tasked with monitoring and controlling the unacceptable and/or illegal activities of cult-like organisations who use psychological pressure and breaches of general and industrial law to maintain control over individuals. The report should advise on the effectiveness of Miviludes and other similar organisations, given issues that need to be addressed to develop an international best practice approach for dealing with cult-like behaviour.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government does not support this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government recognises the financial, psychological and emotional impact that the activities of cult-like organisations can have on individuals and their families and considers that religious observance should not be regarded as a shield behind which breaches of the law can be hidden. However, it is doubtful that the Commonwealth has legislative authority under the Constitution to establish an agency with similar functions to the French Mission interministerielle de vigilance et de lutte contre les derives sectaires (“Miviludes”).
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Miviludes’ primary tasks include:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         observing and analysing the movement of religious and other groups which are perceived as constituting a threat to public order or that violate French law;
        </li>
        <li>
         producing and archiving documentation and discussion papers on groups considered “sects”;
        </li>
        <li>
         providing information and training relating to potential threats to public order to the media, the French government and individuals; and
        </li>
        <li>
         helping victims of “sectarian deviances” to receive financial aid.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is home to a diversity of faiths, united by tolerance, mutual respect and a commitment to democratic traditions. All Australians are free to choose their religion and are able to express and practise their religion and their beliefs, without intimidation and without interference. The Government considers that it is not the Government’s role to interfere with the religious beliefs or practices of individuals, unless they are in breach of Australian laws.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        States and territories are generally responsible for criminal laws and enforcement action directed against criminal activity including conduct resulting in physical, emotional or psychological harm perpetrated by members of religious organisations. Law enforcement agencies and Directors of Public Prosecutions are appropriately equipped to deal with allegations of wrongdoing or criminal activity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        State and territory laws also provide for restitution and compensation for victims in certain circumstances, including through victims of crime compensation schemes. Access to such schemes varies depending on specific criteria in the relevant state or territory.

        .4/2006/5/Add.4). The report concerned France’s policies in the late 1990s, during the terms of Miviludes’ two predecessors. The Special Rapporteur’s findings included a statement that the policies “undermined the right to freedom of religion or belief and raised serious concerns about religious intolerance.” The Special Rapporteur indicated an intention to continue to closely monitor Miviludes to ensure its actions remained consistent with the right to freedom of religion and to “avoid past mistakes”.
       </p>

        The Government does not propose to provide any further report on the operation of Miviludes and other law enforcement agencies overseas who monitor and/or control “cult-like” activities.

         Standing
        </a>
        Committee on Finance and Public Administration on Residential and Community Aged Care in Australia. The Government is committed to the long-term viability of Australia’s aged care sector and the protection of the nation’s frail and elderly. Through the

         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        it has reformed roles and responsibilities within the federation to take full policy and funding responsibility for aged care. This will allow the Government to build a national aged care system to provide better support for older Australians. The reforms will also support the integration of the aged care system with Local Hospital Networks through the Government’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
         National Health
        </a>
        and Hospitals Network.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Over the next four years, increased funding from the Australian Government will bring direct financial support for aged and community care providers who care for older Australians to a record level of $47.8 billion, including $10.8 billion in 2010-11.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government will invest more than $900 million over the next four years to deliver:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         a national aged care system
        </li>
        <li>
         more highly qualified aged care workers;

        <li>
         more aged care places;

        <li>

         greater protections for older Australians receiving care.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        This investment builds on:

       <ul>
        <li>
         macroeconomic indicators of viability of the industry such as the level of building activity in the industry, the level of interest expressed by providers in entering or expanding their involvement in the industry, and the prices paid for ‘licences’ to operate in the industry; and

        This view was confirmed by Professor Len Gray in his independent Two Year Review of Aged Care Reforms, which was completed in 2001, who indicated that such a benchmarking process would be very complex and expensive to undertake.
