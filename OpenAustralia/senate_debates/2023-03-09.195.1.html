        I rise in the chamber today to speak about the upcoming state election in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . I am proud as a Labor senator for New South Wales to also be the Labor duty senator for Parkes, Calare, Farrer, Riverina, Lyne and Hume. One of the greatest parts of my work is my travel to the rural and regional parts of our great state, which this past weekend took me to Dubbo, Warren, Wellington and Koorawatha Show, across three of my electorates. I'm not the only person who spent this weekend working. I got paid, but the people who are standing for the election do it for absolutely nothing. Many Australians don't seem to understand that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over this weekend and for the past few months, I've had the great privilege of meeting and doing my best to support, from a distance, candidates running for Labor in the upcoming state election in areas that overlap with my duty seats. While most people consider their ideal weekend to be spent relaxing and spending time with family or friends, these candidates have decided to devote themselves wholly to their communities, often travelling huge distances, as rural New South Wales necessitates. I feel it's only right that I recognise them and their efforts in this place today. For people who aren't so clear I will just repeat that none of these citizens who are standing for election are putting themselves forward with any sense of recompense. They are doing it as a gift to our democracy.

        Josh Black, Labor's candidate for Dubbo, is a high school teacher and a councillor in Dubbo. I was privileged to join Josh on Saturday night and Sunday morning as he spent his weekend hosting politics in the pub and participating in

       </p>
       <p>
        And all of this was in addition to doorknocking and letterboxing, which also occupies these courageous candidates' free time. I am extremely proud to support all candidates standing for Labor in the upcoming election. As a former teacher and university lecturer myself, I'm particularly proud that five of the 12 candidates running in these seats are current or former teachers. There will always be more work to be done, and we're continuing to strive to improve representation and participation of women and First Nations Australians in politics, especially in the regions. Labor is strong and has an ever-growing presence in the regionsâ€”
