        This afternoon the Minister for Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        , was in Adelaide, and he made an announcement that the Prime Minister has well and truly broken his pre-election commitment of no cuts to the ABC and no cuts to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        . We already knew that the promise was about to be broken, and we had it confirmed today. Now we know as well the size of the cuts—the cuts that the Prime Minister solemnly swore before the last federal election would not happen. Now we know that the ABC will lose more than $250 million over the next five years, a 4.6 per cent reduction in its budget, and the SBS will lose $54 million, a cut of 3.7 per cent in its budget. However, the SBS is able to make up a bit of the funding shortfall by increasing its advertising—I am sure that will be very popular!
       </p>
       <p>
        We will hear from the ABC, I understand, next week about what the definitive impact of those savage budget cuts will be on its staffing and its production. We know that, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , at risk are 100 local jobs in production in the ABC at Collinswood in my home state. As well as jobs, South Australia and other states are likely to lose their state based
        <i>
         7.30
        </i>
        reports. We in South Australia will again be hostage to the eastern states for our news services. We know that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        stories are unlikely to get a good run in news and other services from the ABC produced in the eastern states. That is particularly devastating for rural and regional South Australians, who absolutely rely on the ABC to provide local news content and local stories.
       </p>
       <p>
        What are South Australians doing about this savage attack on the ABC, particularly in my home state of South Australia? The unions, of course, have already organised a great campaign addressing this issue, and there will be a rally in my home state of South Australia tomorrow at 12:30 pm at the ABC studios at Collinswood.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
         If I
        </a>
        were able to be home, you could be sure I would be there. I know that lots of South Australians will be there supporting their ABC. The campaign is also supported by all Labor senators and members in South Australia. I know that those of them who are home tomorrow will certainly be going along to it.
       </p>
       <p>
        What are the Liberal senators and members in South Australia doing about it? What is Mr Christopher Pyne, the member for Sturt, doing about this savage attack on the ABC in South Australia? A cabinet minister of the Abbott government, and what is he doing? He has set up an online petition on change.org. He has put it on his web site and he says, 'Sign this petition, because I am standing up for jobs in South Australia.' The hypocrisy is breathtaking. Here is a cabinet minister of a government that is slashing money from the ABC, forcing the ABC to cut jobs and cut production, and what does he do about it? Does he pick up the phone to Malcolm Turnbull and say, 'Oy, what about the $254 million for the ABC? What about the 100 jobs that are going to be lost in South Australia?' No, he does not do that. Does he argue for it in cabinet? Not as far as we know. What does he do about it? He sets up a petition online. It is worth going to that petition on change.org. His web site is pyneonline.com.au, if you want to have a look at it. Have a look at the blog that follows the petition. Have a look at what South Australians are saying about this disgraceful representative—this cabinet minister of the Abbott government. There is comment after comment about the hypocrisy of this minister of the Abbott government, who purports to represent the people of South Australia and the people of Sturt. I urge you and all South Australians to have a look at this pathetic attempt by this minister of this government to defend the savage attacks on the ABC, and particularly on the ABC in my home state of South Australia.
