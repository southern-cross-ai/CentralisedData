        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, this week we learnt that a detainee that your government released into the community had been charged with nine offences, including failing to comply with reporting obligations by contacting a child without reporting it to the police. It was also alleged he used a mobile phone service and created email, TikTok, Instagram and Bigo accounts without informing the police. This detainee was jailed in 2012 for running a prostitution syndicate that preyed on children in state care and once traded a packet of cigarettes for sex with a 13-year-old girl. My question is this: will your government apply for a community safety detention order in relation to this detainee?

         Senator, first—and thank you for the question—I think all of us are horrified to read of some of this individual's offending history. As I said yesterday—and I hope this is above politics—everyone in this chamber, all of us, want our children to be safe. I would demur, or take issue with, again, the wording of your question, Senator Reynolds. The coalition—because you are focused on a political fight, not on fixing this—continue to suggest that it is a choice of the government to release these individuals.

                . I have a point of order on relevance. Well over a minute into the answer, the minister has come nowhere near answering the very specific question of whether the government will apply for a community safety order.

                        Senator Reynolds, this is not a time for you to make a debate with me. Resume your seat. Senator Reynolds, you are disobeying my request. The point of order was exactly the same as the point of order you made before. The minister is—
                       </p>

                        Order! Do not interject against me. A senator has a right to call a point of order. It's a short, sharp request. It is not a statement. I didn't ask you to relitigate the question. The point of order was exactly the same as the one you made before, and my ruling is exactly the same, and that is that the minister is being directly relevant to your question.

                           Given the complete lack of accountability to the people in the community, who will now want to know whether this community safety order has been granted, I've got a second question, but I suspect that the minister will not answer this one either. Minister, last week we learnt that another detainee your government released into the community has been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in

                           . He was a convicted sexual predator who was once labelled by a judge as a danger to the community. Will there be a community safety order on this one?

I again say to the senator—and she might want to consider her final supplementary—that the decision of the High Court was imposed on the government. The government did not make a choice. The government did not make a choice to release others. I understand that in their attempt to—

                               Senator Reynolds, you are now getting into argument and statement. Your point of order also referred back to the primary question, and the minister is entitled to answer the whole of the question, including the comments you made in the opening statements. The minister is being entirely relevant.

                                I again make the point that the parliament will, by the end of today, I hope, have resolved not one but two of Peter Dutton's laws which were found to be unconstitutional. That will ensure that ministers can make decisions, as appropriate, under a constitutionally effective regime.

                                     I would make the point—and this demonstrates yet again that those opposite want to fight, not fix—that the opposition was specifically briefed on the risks associated with prejudicing a case by talking about specific individuals. But, despite that, they have continued to ask questions in this place. You were specifically briefed. It really demonstrates that you are much more interested in making political points and fighting than fixing this.

What I am asserting is that you have been briefed on the legal prejudice which might apply to matters when you deal with specific individuals in this way. Secondly, if you really cared about people being safe, you would not prejudice applications for detention orders in this way.

                                               My point of order is that I'd like a ruling on what the minister has just said, because she has clearly indicated that this is out of order, which is why she's not answering it. Could I seek your ruling on why the minister is saying she can't answer it?

                                                Senator Reynolds, please resume your seat. As you know, it's not the role of the President. I can't put words into the minister's mouth. I can't direct the minister to use particular words or phrases. I have to listen to the whole of the minister's answers, and the minister has been relevant. She may not be giving you the answers you want, but the minister is being relevant. She was relevant to your primary, your first supplementary and the second supplementary.
