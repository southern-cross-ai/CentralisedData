         The Government
        </a>
        welcomes the report of the Committee on Australia’s Judicial System and the Role of Judges.  It is a significant contribution to the body of work in this area and will assist in the ongoing debate and growing impetus for a more effective complaints handling system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government welcomes the Committee’s endorsement of its judicial appointments processes.  The Government has improved processes for appointing judicial officers to the federal courts by implementing more transparent processes.  While recognising the quality of the Australian judiciary, transparency and merit based appointments have strengthened the quality of appointments and ensured that the process is fair and effective.  The Attorney-General has received significant support and positive feedback regarding the implementation of the new processes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government also welcomes the Committee’s support of the work currently underway in relation to judicial complaints handling.  A transparent, impartial and accountable system of judicial complaints handling has the potential to enhance public confidence in the administration of justice, and ultimately, to strengthen the judiciary itself.  At the request of the Attorney-General, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        of Attorneys-General (SCAG) has established a working group to examine the feasibility of a national judicial complaints handling mechanism.

        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         2.9 The committee recommends that the High Court of Australia adopt a written complaint handling policy and makes it publicly available, including on its website, within 1 month of the tabling of this report.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government notes this recommendation.

        The implementation of this recommendation is a matter for the High Court of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Attorney-General received a letter from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Justice
        </a>
        of the High Court of Australia dated 17 December 2009 in which his Honour stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Section 72 of the Constitution provides that the Justices of the High Court shall not be removed from office ‘except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, ... on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity’.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        There is no statutory or other basis for establishing any procedure for ‘handling complaints’ against Justices of the High Court.  Because it seems inevitable that any question as to the constitutional validity of procedures of that kind would come to this Court for decision, the Court will make no further comment on the issue.

         3.72 The committee recommends that the process for appointments to the High Court should be principled and transparent.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government agrees with the Committee’s observation that the special position of the High Court means that an identical judicial appointments process to that used in other courts is not appropriate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Government will continue to consult widely on all appointments.  With respect to appointments to the High Court, the Attorney-General will continue to invite nominations for appointment from a broad range of individuals and organisations and from

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
