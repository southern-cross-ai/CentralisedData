         I thank the senator for her question and I am pleased to see that it is focused on a key policy issue, which is how we progress reform in the vocational education and training sector, as it drives so much of the nation's prosperity and opportunities for Australians. We did implement a review of the

         Assistance Scheme as a result of a commitment given by the Prime Minister in 2008 or 2009 where we said we would look at the experiences in Victoria and undertake a review of that scheme. As I understand it, the review is being conducted by a Canberra based management consultant firm. It has been set that task.

            I will have to take on notice who has been consulted and how the review is being conducted. But I understand we have recently received a draft report for the review. I have not yet been briefed on that. We will consider those findings in the context of the discussions with the states on the wider reform of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
             VET
            </a>
            , as outlined in the budget. What I do know is that, from earlier advice I saw from the department, we saw quite a strong take-up in 2010, in that 26,000 students had accessed a loan to help pay tuition fees and there was good, early evidence of access by increasing numbers of disadvantaged learners. I have not seen the formal report. When I get that I will make it public. I can advise the Senate that we have undertaken, as part of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
             COAG
            </a>
            process for the new National Partnership on vocational education and training, to hold a series of consultations with key industry players. I have already attended one roundtable, which will allow a broader debate on what should be included in the new National Partnership on vocational education and training as part of the COAG process. I think we do need to open it up to more input from other players.

              Again, I will take this on notice, but I think the most recent report on the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPP" rel="nofollow">
               PPP
              </a>
              was released recently. The report that has received some coverage in the papers recently was a much earlier report. But I will take it on notice, and if the report is publicly available I will make that available. It actually showed a much more positive picture of the take-up of PPP places. Interestingly, it showed an increase in the number of people taking higher-level qualifications.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I indicated earlier, I am keen to have key stakeholders engaged in the debate around
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
               VET

              reform and the nature of the

               COAG

              partnership agreements. I have started on that process and have met with the key players, and I will continue to do so. In fact, the ministerial council will invite half a dozen of the key players to brief it prior to its next meeting. So we are looking to broaden that engagement.
