         I thank Senator Davey for her question. Quite clearly, the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has led to an unprecedented demand for access to government services, particularly for Australians who are required to register for income support payments. The government has responded very quickly, and we have surged thousands of extra staff into Services Australia to make sure that they are able to handle the increased demand to assist people who find themselves in extremely changed circumstances. I'm pleased to advise the chamber that, since 24 August—

                Order! Senator Wong, that was inappropriate. I grant leaders some latitude. I did not see Senator McKenzie, if that is the case—I may have had my line of sight blocked. Cross-chamber chatter is also disorderly to the extent that it can be heard by other senators and there are other places in this building to do that—well spaced apart, of course. I call Senator Ruston to continue.

                   It's important that the chamber hears that on 24 August, the government had paid out $8.8 billion in two $750 payments to eligible Australians as part of their economic support payments. In addition to that, a further $10.5 billion has been paid as part of the coronavirus supplement to Australians who find themselves unemployed, so it's really important that we put in place assistance to people so that they are able to easily access the financial support they need. Services Australia has made sure that we also are working in a COVID-safe environment. We've upgraded the capacity of myGov. Previously, 90,000 people could be on the system concurrently; since our upgrade, 300,000 Australians are able to use it at any one time. We're making sure that claim forms are much simpler so that people are able to get access really quickly and we've also made it available so that people can obtain a customer reference number and identify themselves online to save them having to attend a physical Services Australia site. At the height of the pandemic we also put in an attempt to claim—

                      It's absolutely important that anybody who is required to self-isolate or quarantine is assisted to be able to stay at home to stop the spread of COVID. Eligibility for the JobSeeker payment has been extended and broadened to include access for people who find themselves sick, possibly with the COVID-19 virus, and who have to self-isolate or quarantine or who may be caring for somebody who is in those circumstances. We've also stipulated that they do not have to provide a medical certificate for that period of time. We announced a couple of weeks ago that a pandemic leave disaster payment would be made available to Victorians. This morning, the Prime Minister announced that that has now been extended, at their request, to Tasmanians, so that people who are required to self-isolate or quarantine will be able to get access to that temporary two-week payment. More than $9 million has been paid out to people in Victoria. We are also pleased to announce that people calling up for the first time—

                         Thank you very much, Senator Davey. Services Australia have focused also on boosting services in rural and regional Australia. In fact, today I can announce that there is now a mobile service unit that is providing assistance on the ground in Wodonga, on the other side of the river from Albury, for people in that area who may require face-to-face services. I acknowledge the very strong advocacy of Senator McKenzie on behalf of her own community that has allowed us to have the information to understand that the demand exists within that community for this mobile service centre. So we are now able to provide face-to-face services for people in that community, and people can start attending the service centre as of 8.30 this morning to 4.30 this afternoon and ongoing at Junction Square in Wodonga. This will ensure that Victorian communities have access in their own location, but this is in addition to telephone and internet services that are also available.
