        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Minister, recently a

        </a>
        congressman from the US House Committee on Energy and Commerce called on the government to rethink its opposition to new energy, with Congressman Neal Dunn saying:

       <p class="italic">
        … 'Why isn't Australia with us on this?' There are a lot of commercial opportunities. You have got the uranium ore, you have got the skills, all you lack is the will.
       </p>

        Meanwhile, the

        said in March that nuclear delivers cheaper, cleaner, cheaper, homegrown energy for consumers. How do you explain the government's ideological opposition to this technology when Australia's allies are looking to implement all options in the path to net zero?

          This is so funny. After they've had most of the week, when they haven't dared to defend their nuclear policy, we now have the last question, from Senator McGrath, about why we're not going down the nuclear path. Put very simply, Senator McGrath: we don't think $600 billion-plus paid by taxpayers for the most expensive power you can buy, delivered in 20 years, with no plan to do anything about supply until then, is a good deal. Funny about that, isn't it? We don't think that that kind of political strategy that the wheels are already falling off of is a good deal for Australians. That's why we are not going down the nuclear path.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is quite extraordinary, isn't it colleagues—the extent to which Mr Dutton's antirenewables obsession can lead them into this cul-de-sac, can lead them into this dead end of a policy that they know is a joke. That's why the best they can do when they are asked how much it will cost is say, 'It's a big bill.' That's it! It is extraordinary. Here we are needing to transition the Australian economy and 24 out of 28 coal-fired power stations are announcing their closure on the news and the most they can do is come up with a policy that is going to deliver a 'big bill', two decades of diminishing supply and the most expensive power there is. You couldn't make this stuff up, could you?

            was recently corrected by Canadian officials for falsely claiming that energy bills in Ontario were cheap due to provincial government subsidies. Why does this government continue to misrepresent the ways in which other countries are using nuclear power to lower energy bills and decarbonise?

             What I would say again is that, if you really want to understand what's going on with this nuclear announcement, you only have to look at the last decade and a half of division in the coalition when it came to energy policy. They had in excess of 20 policies, while coal-fired power station after coal-fired power station—

              President, I have a point of order on relevance. My question went to

               Chris Bowen
              </a>
              and Canada. It did not reference anything to do with the coalition. So, while the minister flicks through the answers, if could you ask her to wander back towards the question that would be great, please.

                If you really want to understand why the coalition have gone for this political strategy, it is the decade and a half with in excess of 20 policies because they couldn't bring themselves to support renewables. They couldn't bring themselves to support renewables. It is all about the internals of their party room.
               </p>
               <p>
                I would also make the point that this has also been a change of position for Mr Dutton, because he has worked out that nuclear is the only thing that holds his party room together.

                   We obviously have a very deep and important relationship with the United Kingdom, but I think even they would recognise that we might get a bit more sun here. I reckon even they might recognise we have a bit more land here. I think even they would recognise that we might have the ability to look to renewables that are more challenging for them.

                   I want to say this to those opposite: if this is so great, why have we seen so many state Liberals refuse to back you in? Why have we seen Mr Speakman—I didn't know who he was; I now know who he is—say, 'We can't wait for nuclear'?

                         I'm very happy. I wasn't trying to be gratuitous; I genuinely did not know who the person was. He said we can't wait for nuclear. John Pesutto has made his view clear. He said, 'I'm not raising down the nuclear path.'
