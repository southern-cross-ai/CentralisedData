       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On 8 December 2004, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PJC" rel="nofollow">
         PJC
        </a>
        ) agreed to conduct an inquiry and report on the regulation of the timeshare industry.  The report, entitled
        <i>
         Timeshare:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Price" rel="nofollow">
          The Price

          Leisure
         </a>
        </i>
        , was tabled in the Parliament on 5 September 2005.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The report contains 19 recommendations, the main one being that timeshare schemes should no longer be regulated as managed investment schemes under Chapter 5C of the
        <i>
         Corporations
        </i>
        <i>
         Act 2001

        (the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Corporations Act
        </a>
        ), but should be given their own chapter.  The report also recommends that the new chapter should contain a number of consumer protection provisions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Other substantial recommendations of the report are that contracts for the purchase of timeshare interests be required to include a minimum buy back amount and that an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">

        as well) be established to acquire compulsorily the interests of delinquent members in older ‘title-based’ timeshare schemes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        Regulation of timeshares under the

         The Committee recommends that:
        </b>
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Timeshare should be removed as a definitional element of the managed investment funds under s.9 of the Corporations Act 2001; and
        </li>
        <li>
         A separate chapter be inserted into the Corporations Act 2001 to deal specifically with timeshare.

       </ul>

        The Government
        <b>
         does not support
        </b>
        this recommendation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Timeshare schemes share all the basic elements of managed investment schemes and therefore warrant regulation as such.  Where timeshare has unique characteristics compared with other managed investment schemes, the Corporations Act contains sufficient flexibility such that the requirements can be modified.  Indeed, ASIC has used its power in this area to grant concessions and ‘relief’ to various timeshare schemes.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Inclusion of a new chapter of various consumer protection measures would replicate existing provisions in the ASIC Act and Corporations Act which already apply to financial products such as timeshare interests (as managed investment schemes, timeshare schemes are also financial products.)

        Existing financial services regulation in the Corporations Act and ASIC Act already deals with this issue.  Specifically, sections 12DB and 12DC of the ASIC Act which deal with false representations and other misleading or offensive conduct have a wide application.  Additionally, sections 12DJ and 12CB prohibit certain activities, including harassment and coercion and unconscionable conduct, and section 992AA of the Corporations Act addresses anti-hawking practices.

        As a condition of their licence, cooling-off provisions apply to Australian financial services licensees who sell timeshare - the length of that cooling off period depended on the nature of the scheme and whether the parties were members of ATHOC.  ASIC’s revised policy statement extends this cooling off period across the board to 14 days, effective on 30 September 2007.  This will provide added protection for consumers against pressure selling.

        The selling of financial products such as timeshares is regulated under the Corporations and ASIC Acts and includes obligations to ensure staff are trained appropriately.  Legislation already regulates pressure selling issues (as set out in the response to recommendation 4 above) and provides a full suite of provisions to regulate how timeshare advice is provided.  The legislation also includes appropriate penalties for breaches.

        The Government would support further emphasis on training on this issue but notes that in relation to managed investment schemes, such as timeshare, training already exists on misleading or deceptive conduct and unconscionable conduct practices, which would encompass the issue of pressure selling.  Again, the industry codes of conduct will help address this issue.

         Recommendation 2

        The Committee recommends:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         that the Government identify methods to address the security clearance
        </li>

         backlog of the agencies; and
        </li>
        <li>
         that the agencies be required to report every year on the backlog and the
        </li>
        <li>
         methods being used to address it in their Annual Reports.

         Recommendation 3
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that the Government enquire into the feasibility of establishing a combined facility for basic training in intelligence either in an existing academic institution or as a separate college.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIC" rel="nofollow">
         AIC
        </a>
        agencies believe that most training needs are effectively addressed by each agency being able to shape its own training for its specific needs. This takes place in a context in which AIC-wide training programmes have also been established. An AIC training secretariat has been established, funded by all AIC agencies, in response to a recommendation in the Flood Review. As a need is identified for an AIC-wide approach to training in a discrete area the AIC responds to that need - the most recent example being a proposal to provide an AIC-wide course on counter-proliferation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For the most part, agencies’ training benefits are maximised by each agency being able to tailor its training programme to fit its specific professional needs along with the timing and participation numbers that best suit it. While there are some skills that are common across the community each agency tends to have a core of skill requirements that is unique to that agency. It is not a matter of unnecessary duplication taking place across the AIC.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Exposure to other parts of the AIC is part of agencies’ existing training programmes. Secondments already take place across the AIC, to which a combined training facility would not necessarily add value.

         The Report
        </a>
        does not elaborate on its reference to ‘current training difficulties’, so we are not clear as to what the Committee believes needs to be remedied by a combined training facility.
