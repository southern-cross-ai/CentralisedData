        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, Senator Colbeck. Minister, when will the government restore the former Labor government's funding for public transport projects, including the Melbourne Metro, the Brisbane Cross River Rail, the Gawler rail electrification in

         I thank Senator Collins for her question. I am not sure that I see a need to restore anything that the previous Labor government did. The Australian government will set its own priorities, and that is exactly what we are doing. We demonstrated just last week a commitment to public transport, when Prime Minister Turnbull on Sunday went to the

           As the Prime Minister said, we will look at projects in infrastructure on their merits. We will not discriminate against forms of transport, and the Prime Minister was quite clear in his comments about that last Sunday. We will look at transport projects on their merits and we will fund them in accordance with the projects that are put forward. The Queensland government prioritised the Queensland light rail and made submissions to the Australian government. Prime Minister Turnbull took up the project that was submitted by the Queensland government and, last Sunday, made that announcement. We are not interested in the Labor Party's priorities with respect to infrastructure. We are quite capable of establishing and setting our own priorities, and that is what we will continue to do. But, as the Prime Minister said, we will look at the different forms of infrastructure that support various modes of transport in various locations and, if it is public transport within the cities, we will support that.

             airport. That is a piece of good news. We have made a decision that there will be a second airport in

             , and we will build Badgerys Creek airport. It is a big investment, a significant announcement. It is one that the Labor Party never went anywhere near.

                 , because they could change their minds. But, as I said in my previous answer and as the Prime Minister quite clearly stated on Sunday when he was making the announcements in respect of Queensland light rail, we will work with the states. We will work with them on their priorities for infrastructure and, as they put forward a project that meets the criteria, we will consider supporting it. So we have not ruled out anything of that nature at all.

                     It is surprising that the opposition would talk to this government about being reckless with taxpayers' money. I have to say, given the opposition's record on debt and deficit—the fact that this opposition put forward proposals for cost savings in their own budget propositions and then voted against them in opposition—it is quite incredible that the opposition would be talking or lecturing us in respect of responsibility around matters toward the budget. I cannot believe that Senator Collins would even get up and ask that sort of question. We consider all of our projects and our commitments in the context of the budget process.
