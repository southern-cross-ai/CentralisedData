        I rise to speak about the total failure of the Albanese Labor government to appropriately prepare for and respond to the recent High Court decision which has led to the worst types of criminal offenders without Australian citizenship being released into our Australian community. There has been a total failure by the Albanese Labor government to respond to that High Court decision and to prepare for it.

        Don't just believe my words in relation to this, those in the gallery and those listening. I want to tell you Sonya's story. Sonya is from my home state of Queensland, and her story was reported in the
        <i>
         Guardian
        </i>
        on 14 November, Tuesday this week. This is Sonya's story. Sonya's rapist has now been released into the community. When he was paroled from his rape, he was put into permanent detention because he's not an Australian citizen. He was put in permanent detention, and Sonya was told, 'He would never be free in Australia, so I didn't need to worry.' That's what Sonya thought. So imagine how Sonya felt when, on Saturday, she was rung by a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Police Service
        </a>
        ? The article said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        â€¦ the officer was 'really lovely' and seemed upset himself, but was unable to answer basic questions such as whether Rafiq had conditions placed on his visa, and whether he was prohibited from approaching her.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        'They didn't particularly have a plan, from what he could see.'
       </p>
       <p>
        This is how Sonya felt; these are the words of Sonya, a victim of this rapist who has been released into the Australian community. She said she started 'crying immediately' then felt a 'numbness'. This is the human face of the gross incompetence of this Albanese Labor government.
