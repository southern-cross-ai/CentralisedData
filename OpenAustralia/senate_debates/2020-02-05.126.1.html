        Senator Griff to move on the next day of sitting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) with deep concern, the Government's decision to privatise aged care assessments from April 2021 with a tender to be held this year, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the Government's decision was not made in consultation with State Health Ministers;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) recognises that there are eighty aged care assessment teams (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACAT" rel="nofollow">
         ACAT
        </a>
        ) operating across the nation which include state-employed multi-disciplinary teams of nurses, geriatricians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, psychologists and social workers who work at public hospitals, to expertly assess the more complex level of care required by individual elderly Australians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) further notes the recent statement by the Chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>

       <p class="italic">
        (i) the Royal Commission's Interim Report did not endorse the Government's position on privatising ACAT, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) the Commission has not yet made a recommendation about which sector or mechanism will best achieve an integration of Regional Assessment Services and the Aged Care Assessment Teams;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) health experts argue that no private providers can offer the expertise to adequately assess the often complex needs of hundreds of thousands of elderly Australians, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) outsourcing assessment teams would have a serious detrimental impact on the delivery of proper care; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) calls on the Federal Government to consult with the state health ministers on the issue of ACAT privatisation, as a matter of urgency.

       <p>
        Senator Dean Smith to move on the next day of sitting:

       <p>
        Senator Abetz to move on the next day of sitting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes the Australian citizenship pledge, which in part reads as follows:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I pledge my loyalty to Australia and its people, whose democratic beliefs I share, whose rights and liberties I respect, and whose laws I will uphold and obey; and

       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate notes—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) that Norwegian oil giant, Equinor, has received its second of four rounds of approvals from the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority, the government regulator responsible for oversight into exploratory petroleum drilling in the

       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that tens of thousands of Australians continue to fight for the Bight, in forums both formal and informal, as communities across the country unite to reject Equinor's disastrous plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senators Griff and Patrick to move on the next day of sitting:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the Senate—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) notes a number of recent examples of questionable conduct by Government Ministers that may fall under the purview of an independent anti-corruption commission, if one existed federally, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) numerous allegations against the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction, Mr Angus Taylor, including questions over the $80 million purchase of overland flow water licences and his ties to a company accused of clearing endangered grassland, and claims of document falsification in relation to the Sydney Lord Mayor,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) Senator Bridget McKenzie and the 'sports rorts' affair, and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) suspected leaks of classified information from Minister Peter Dutton's office about the costs of medically evacuating refugees, where the confidential information was reportedly de-classified at a time the

         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        was still investigating the leak; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) further notes that the Government's proposed Commonwealth Integrity Commission (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIC" rel="nofollow">
         CIC
        </a>
        ) would not have the ability to make public findings of corruption, and can only refer potentially criminal behaviour, and will fail to expose improper conduct of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Members of Parliament
        </a>
        and public servants; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) calls on the Federal government to strengthen its proposed CIC and introduce a bill to create a federal anti-corruption commission that will have the power to hold public hearings and to make public findings of corruption.

        have not had an increase in real terms for over 25 years,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) the Government's continued failure to act has meant that those trying to survive on Newstart are falling even further behind, prompting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Council
        </a>
        of Social Service to call for an urgent $95 increase in Newstart, and

       <p class="italic">
        (g) recognises that, ideally, the Government should ban corporate donations from vested interests that seek to influence government policy; and
