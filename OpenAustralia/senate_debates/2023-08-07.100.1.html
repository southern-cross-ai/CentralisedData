       <p>
        The massive increase in the cost of living being inflicted upon Australians by the Albanese Labor government is hurting hardworking Australians. Households have experienced the highest annual rise in mortgages on record. We have one of the highest core inflation rates of advanced economies anywhere in the world. Real wages are collapsing at the highest rate on record and energy bills are skyrocketing. The Labor government has piled on layer upon layer of regulation into our energy sector causing the highest cost to flow onto consumers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The data confirms all Australians have experienced significant, sometimes record cost-of-living increases under this Labor government's watch, and shamefully we're now seeing this is impacting families across the important healthcare sector with them not going to see their

        . It was reported over the weekend that many Australian patients are delaying or avoiding GP appointments due to the current cost-of-living crisis that is being overseen by this government. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RACGP" rel="nofollow">
         RACGP
        </a>
        has even stated that many GPs are being forced to increase the cost of consultations due to significant increases in operating costs, including skyrocketing energy bills seen right across the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        But amongst all of these pressures on Australian households, as energy bills reach unaffordable levels, as families have to make tough decisions to delay going to their GP, risking health outcomes that result from prevention and early intervention, what is the Prime Minister's focus? Taming inflation clearly does not seem to be a priority for this government. Addressing the concerns of the risk of rheumatic heart disease, for example, amongst rural and remote communities certainly doesn't seem to be his priority. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        's priority is dealing with the absolute mess he's made of the Voice referendum. He's focused on trying to run a million miles away from the treaty commitment that he and his ministers have made so many times. He's hiding from honesty and transparency.
