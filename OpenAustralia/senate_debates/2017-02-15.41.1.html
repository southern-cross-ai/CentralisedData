        It is a very hard act to follow! My question is to the Minister for Education and Training, Senator Birmingham. Can the minister update the Senate on what the latest report on government services shows in relation to school funding?

         Thank you, Senator Paterson, for your question. I know that you, Senator Paterson, are driven by wanting the facts and accurate data and information. Quite recently the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         released its annual report on government services, and that report provides for interesting reading, which those opposite in particular would benefit from undertaking. It shows that between 2005-06 and 2014-15—over a decade up to the most recent data that is available—total funding from state governments, territories and the Commonwealth to all schools increased by 58.2 per cent, with Commonwealth funding during that time going by 58.2 per cent, compared with state and territory increases of only 18 per cent. Commonwealth funding for government schools has grown in real terms on a per student basis over that decade by 72.4 per cent, compared with average state and territory funding growth over that time of only 9.4 per cent—a vast difference and notably far higher than Commonwealth growth in funding to non-government schools of 25.7 per cent. The total Commonwealth per student increase in funding in real terms grew by 43.7 per cent, compared with that of the states and territories, which grew by just 7.2 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         But what is remarkable is that if you look at a shorter time frame over the five years of the most recently available data, six of the eight state and territory jurisdictions actually reduced their investment in Australian schools. It came at the same time as the Commonwealth government was increasing its investment.

             well and truly was the worst offender by far, with a cut of 2.1 per cent to their government schools and across the board. Yet the same state is quite happy to go out and attack the federal government, even though we are giving them money on one hand while they are pocketing it with the other. They are happy to spend

             taxpayers' money on campaigns attacking us, on campaigns that are bordering on corruption, when you see the state government getting a grant application on one day and approving it on the same day, to run a partisan political campaign in the middle of the federal election campaign. All the while they are deceitfully failing to actually use the extra federal funding we have given for increases in schools instead of pocketing it as budget savings—

                The Turnbull government absolutely will continue to grow school funding in the future, from last year's record level of $16 billion to more than $20 billion by 2020. That is funding growth above inflation and above projected enrolment growth. It is real growth into Australian schools, despite all the lies that we hear from those opposite and some of those on the crossbenches. Yesterday Dr Ken Boston, one of the authors of the Gonski report, called out the fact that what Labor pretend is the Gonski report is of course far from what was recommended.
