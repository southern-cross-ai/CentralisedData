         I thank Senator Canavan for his question. Senator Canavan is a renowned champion of the Australian resources sector in particular. The Australian resources industry is a world leader when it comes to the extraction, production and export of high-quality resources. The industry represents a significant proportion of Australia's economy and is the backbone of many regional communities and towns across Australia, as Senator Canavan and all my Liberal and National colleagues know and appreciate. The resources industry represents some nine per cent of Australia's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         . Importantly, that grew last financial year by 0.5 per cent, worth $7 billion extra to Australia's economy as a result. In 2019-20 our resources and energy exports reached a record of $290 billion for Australia. Our iron ore was the first commodity to ever record more than $100 billion in export revenue. Our gold industry is poised to become the world's largest producer; it is forecast to record some $31 billion of production in 2020-21.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even in the midst of the most significant global pandemic and economic shock, the resources industry is investing in Australia, and in Australians and Australian jobs, with mining capital investment increasing by 5.4 per cent over the course of the last financial year. The resources industry is already a supporter of Australian jobs, employing 247,000 Australians in August this year, an increase of almost 6,000 compared with February this year. Of course, they are just the direct contributions; the resources industry supports so many more jobs than those direct contributions. That's why the Morrison-

         government recognises its importance and continues to invest in the industry and its growth potential.

            We've made a number of new investments to support energy, minerals and groundwater resources and to improve their understanding and development during this budget. A $124.5 million expansion for the Exploring for the Future program will improve the understanding of Australia's resources, identifying the resource potential of key regions across Australia. We understand the importance of developing our natural resources, which is why we've committed $28.3 billion for five strategic basin plans, charting a quicker pathway for their development. We also recognise the need to provide communities living in gas development regions with independent and transparent information, hence our support for the

Indeed, our government, in recognising the potential for use of our resources, is of course investing in manufacturing, and—

               In terms of threats, Senator Canavan and others know a little more about Queensland politics than me, but it's tempting to say that one of those threats could indeed be Jackie Trad, as I understand it—a name that I hear again and again in terms of the risks that are faced by the Queensland resources sector. Sadly, Queensland, even coming in pre COVID, had amongst the highest unemployment, the highest level of bankruptcies and the lowest business confidence in Australia. It's an economy that is so reliant on the resources, energy and mining sectors. That's why it's disappointing to see delays in approvals for developments such as New Hope's New Acland Stage 3. It's a prime example of legal and bureaucratic intervention delaying the potential creation of new jobs and new opportunities in a state like Queensland. And of course losing the potential for 500 additional jobs through these types of delays doesn't—
