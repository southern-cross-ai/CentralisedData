        [by video link] Three weeks ago, I highlighted the impending relevance of being able to prove vaccination status and the weakness in the system being relied upon by government for such proof. In the intervening time, I have met with ministers and, like every Australian, have watched the situation develop. I note the premiers of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and Queensland have announced that entry into their states will require a permit which is dependent on being able to provide vaccination status. I note employers announcing that COVID vaccination will be compulsory for certain work, as it is for aged-care workers, some transport providers, childcare workers and quarantine facility workers. Over the same period, the vaccination program has delivered 4.4 million doses, with almost 290,000 doses being added every day. We need to verify vaccination, and, while demand for that is climbing, the problem is getting bigger. The systems we're relying on are flawed and could undermine efforts to open up our economy and ease lockdowns.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also note there's an information vacuum regarding the government's solution. COVIDSafe was the worst software application ever developed. It's only got one happy user, and that's Mr Stuart Robert. We cannot afford to have a COVIDSafe 2.0. People are dying. People are losing their livelihoods. We have a proven solution onshore which could have been implemented in the three weeks since I first demonstrated it to ministers. The government needs to act.
