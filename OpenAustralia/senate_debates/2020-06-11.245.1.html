           The Morrison government are committed to stamping out violence, abuse, neglect or exploitation of people with disability and this is why we established a joint royal commission into violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation of people with disability. The Morrison government take this issue very seriously. We're working closely with people with disability, peak bodies and other stakeholders to bring about an enduring change in community attitudes.
