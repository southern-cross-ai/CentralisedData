        (iii) the Federal Court rejected the fundamental design of the flawed policy – the reliance on "income averaging" to decide who breached the income test,

        (iv) the Federal Government expected to "save" $2.3 billion through the scheme over 4 years but has only revealed they will repay $721 million already collected,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (v) the Federal Government is refusing to apologise to people caught up in its controversial robodebt scheme, despite conceding hundreds of millions of dollars in debt were racked up unlawfully,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (vi) lawyers acting for hundreds of thousands of welfare recipients who have had unlawful "robodebts" raised against them have urged the Government to apologise over its handling of the scheme, and promised not to use the apology against the Government in court, and

       <p class="italic">
        (vii) for the Federal Government, sorry seems to be the hardest word;

           The government notes that income averaging has been a longstanding practice of successive governments, going back decades. As stated before, a random sample of 500 debts raised by Labor's data-matching compliance activities in both 2009 and 2011 indicate that averaging was utilised to raise debts in, respectively, 16.8 per cent and 24.4 per cent of cases, evidencing long-term use of this practice.
          </p>
          <p>
           On 1 June 2020, the Prime Minister spoke to the media, stating that the government has great regrets about any pain or injury that has been caused here. But those are issues that we are still working through, and we're making it right.
