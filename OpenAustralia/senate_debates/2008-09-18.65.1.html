        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, who I believe today is Senator Faulkner. Will the minister indicate whether the Rudd Labor government approves the demolition of a 99-year-old heritage listed building in Cairns to make way for a high-rise development? What does the Rudd Labor government propose to do about this important community issue?

          I thank Senator Joyce for his question. I assume, though it is not clear from Senator Joyce’s question, that the building he refers to in Cairns is the Cairns Yacht Club—though that was not identified by the senator.

            I should say,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_President" rel="nofollow">
             Mr President
            </a>
            , that I appreciate the fact that Senator Joyce has acknowledged across the chamber that that is the building he is referring to, and as a result I am happy to provide what information I have had made available to me by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, on this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            I can say to Senator Joyce, through you, Mr President, that in this case the Cairns Yacht Club has been assessed twice by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Heritage_Council" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Heritage Council
            </a>
            , which concluded that the club does not meet the high threshold of significance necessary for entry into the national heritage list. On the basis of an
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHC" rel="nofollow">
             AHC
            </a>
            assessment in 2005, the former minister for the environment, Minister Campbell, who is well known to many senators, refused to enter the club on the national list.
           </p>
           <p>
            Subsequently, on AHC advice of the absence of national heritage values, another former minister for the environment, Mr Turnbull, who is in the House of Representatives, in 2007 refused full assessment of a precinct containing the club. I am also briefed to inform the Senate that the club has been rejected for entry on the state heritage register. I do know that Mr Garrett recognises the very strong local interest in retaining the club, but the strict provisions of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
             EPBC
            </a>
            Act prevent the entry of any place on the national heritage list that is not of outstanding significance to the nation.
           </p>
           <p>
            The council’s heritage assessments and the consideration of Mr Garrett’s department of more recent information about the club have apparently, I am advised, shown that the club does not meet this test. In conclusion, I can say to Senator Joyce that Mr Garrett has advised the applicants that, on the available evidence, the club cannot be listed. Mr Garrett, I understand, has suggested to the applicants that they pursue listing by the Queensland heritage authorities.

Does the minister agree that the sentiments displayed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts seem to be at complete odds with other sentiments he has displayed in decisions such as that which protects the heritage values of

               I find it very hard to accept Senator Joyce’s assertions given that I certainly understand that the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AHC" rel="nofollow">
                AHC
               </a>
               assessed the place in 2005 and found that it did not have national heritage values. On this basis the minister, former Senator Campbell, rejected the club for entry on the

                NHL
               </a>
               . A subsequent nomination for a precinct including the club was assessed by the AHC as unlikely to have national heritage values and was rejected for inclusion in the AHC annual workplans in 2007 by another former environment minister, Mr Turnbull, who is now the Leader of the Opposition. And it was rejected in 2008, as I understand it, by Mr Garrett. I think that is the record. I have presented it as fairly as I can to the Senate and I ask the Senate to draw its own conclusions.
