        My question is for the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians, Senator Colbeck: Former Prime Minister Abbott says elderly people with COVID-19 should be left to die 'while nature takes its course'. Why hasn't the Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians already condemned this heartless remark by this former Liberal Prime Minister?

         I had not heard that comment made by the former Prime Minister, but I do not agree with that. I do not agree with that statement. I simply do not agree with it. All of the government's actions demonstrate our desire to ensure that all senior Australians, COVID-positive or not, are treated with respect and get the care that they deserve. There is no way I think anyone in this chamber, on either side, would agree with those comments of former Prime Minister Abbott. I absolutely do not agree and I would condemn the comments, because that's not what I believe and I don't think that's what anyone in the chamber believes. Our desire—all our planning, all our work—is to ensure that all senior Australians get the care that they deserve and they need regardless of the COVID-19 circumstances. So I simply do not agree with the statements of the former Prime Minister.

           Last month the Prime Minister,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
            Scott Morrison
           </a>
           , said the view that elderly people should be offered up to COVID-19 is 'an absolutely amoral, hideous thought'. Does the minister agree that Tony Abbott's prepared remarks in a speech last night are amoral and hideous?

              I note the minister's condemnation of former Prime Minister Abbott's remarks. Does the minister's dismissal of deaths by neglect as a function of the aged-care system reflect his view that elderly Australians should be offered up to COVID-19 and left to die while nature takes its course?

              <p>
               It is really quite offensive that Senator Keneally continues to misrepresent the remarks that I've made in the chamber. I have never done that. I have never dismissed any of the deaths. I have consistently offered my condolences to every family that has lost a family member with respect to COVID-19. The misrepresentation of my comments by the opposition on a number of occasions is dishonest and it's offensive. All of the efforts of the government right through this pandemic have been focused on providing support to senior Australians through the COVID-19 outbreak. We continue to do that. I find that the comments and the suggestion of Senator Keneally quite offensive.
