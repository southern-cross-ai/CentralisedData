        , my question is to the Assistant Minister for Immigration and Border Protection, Senator Cash. I refer to the government's response to the independent review of the 457 visa scheme and I ask the minister: how will the government's reforms of the scheme boost its integrity and address genuine skills shortages?

         I thank Senator Back for his question. The government is committed to ensuring that the subclass 457 visa program acts as a supplement to—and not a substitute for—Australian workers. I announced today that the government will act on recommendations of the independent review of the 457 visa program to strengthen integrity within the program, to ensure that Australian workers have priority, and to support employers with genuine skills shortages.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can confirm that the review did not find that there was widespread misuse of the program. It did, however, make some sensible suggestions for the strengthening of the program and for reducing the red-tape costs for business. The review panel consulted extensively across Australia, meeting with over 140 stakeholders face-to-face, and considering in excess of 189 written submissions, including from businesses, unions, industry bodies and academics. Key recommendations of the review included increased focus on targeting employers who seek to misuse the program; greater transparency around the department's sanctions processes; and proactive sharing of information between key government agencies. The Department of Immigration and Border Protection will work collaboratively with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Taxation Office
         </a>
         to crosscheck records to ensure that workers on 457 visas are receiving their nominated salary, and are not undercutting Australian workers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will also introduce a new penalty, making it unlawful for sponsors to receive payment in return for sponsoring a 457 visa worker. In terms of business, the government will ensure that businesses that utilise the 457 program appropriately will incur less regulation and cost, without compromising on the necessary safeguards that underpin the scheme. We will reduce the regulatory burden for those businesses with a proven track record by streamlining sponsorship requirements.

          , I ask a supplementary question. Can the minister advise the Senate of the number of 457 visa holders currently in the labour force and how this figure compares with that under the previous Labor government?

           The number of primary subclass 457 visa holders in Australia as at 28 February 2015 was 107,306. This represents less than one per cent of the Australian workforce. Of course, Labor and the unions would have the public believe that, under a coalition government, there has been a massive influx of 457 workers to Australia. The statistics, however, tell a very different story. In fact, since the election of the Abbott government, there has been a 2.7 per cent decrease in the number of 457 visa holders.

             I remind those opposite—and, in particular, Senator Cameron, who quite frankly has a lot of bark when it comes to 457 visa workers—that former Prime Minister Julia Gillard hired a 457 worker as the head of her communications team. Where was Senator Cameron then? There was complete silence. He rolled over and he had his little tummy tickled, like he always does—all bark but no bite.

                 The 457 program, as Australians know, is vitally important to our economy. The ability to fill vital skilled positions often facilitates a business's existence or even its growth. A business that has to close because it cannot access the labour it needs employs no-one. That is bad news for the employer and it is bad news for the employees who no longer have a job. The independent review of the 457 program found no evidence of widespread fraud, as alleged by the former Labor government and, in particular, former minister for immigration, Mr Brendan O'Connor. In relation to the statistics, under Labor the figures grew from 68,400 primary visa holders in 2010 to approximately 110,280 in September 2013. And most of those holders were in positions that were not in short supply.
