        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tertiary_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Tertiary Education
        </a>
        , Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations, Senator Evans. I refer the minister to a statement made by the member for Dobell to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Smith
        </a>
        on 2UE radio where he admits he authorised the use of his union funded credit card to pay for escort services. Given the member for Dobell's public admission, can the minister advise whether the member for Dobell has been interviewed by Fair Work Australia and whether or not he has made a similar admission when interviewed by Fair Work Australia? What guarantees can the minister provide to the Senate to ensure Fair Work Australia is aware of the comments made by the member for Dobell?

         I thank the senator for the question. As the Senate would be well aware, any investigations or inquiries made by Fair Work Australia are undertaken by them under their powers under the act. They do not consult with the minister about those investigations. They certainly do not ask for my authority. They do not relay to me information they have gathered. They conduct their investigations in accordance with their charter. I have no understanding of their investigations beyond the evidence that was led at Senate estimates, where Senator Ronaldson was largely the lead questioner. The authority has provided Senator Ronaldson with answers to the questions he asked. I was present for those and heard that information. Beyond that, I have not been briefed by Fair Work Australia. I have not sought information from them on the progress of their inquiries. No doubt those inquiries will be completed professionally, in accordance with statutory obligaÂ­tions, and Fair Work Australia will take whatever action they think appropriate, but it is not something that they engage with me about, nor would it be appropriate for me to be involved in their decision making in such an inquiry.

          , I ask a supplementary question. I refer the minister to the ongoing Fair Work Australia inquiry into the alleged misuse of union funds from the time that the member for Dobell was the National Secretary of the

           First of all, I indicate to Senator Ronaldson that I think my first answer would inform a response to the supplementary question. In terms of information about when Fair Work Australia will complete their inquiry, I think it is reasonable for me to take that on notice and make those inquiries to see whether they are prepared to share that with me. I think they probably will but I will take that on notice. As I say, I will contact Fair Work Australia and see if they are able to provide information about when they expect their inquiries to be completed. If they are able to provide me with that information I will report it to the Senate.

             Social Inclusion
            </a>
            in relation to the member for Dobell where she said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            It is inappropriate for, I think, any businessâany unionâto use shareholder funds, or member funds to purchase sexual services.

           </p>
           <p>
            In light of the minister's portfolio responsibilities, does the minister agree with the Minister for Social Inclusion that union funds, which come from union members, should not be used to procure services at escort agencies?

             I suppose the first thing to say is that decisions about the use of funds lie with the unions concerned and their membership and ought to be authorised accordingly. I certainly do not regard it as appropriate for a union to use their members' funds in that way. Clearly any breach of union rules or procedures would be up to them but, if you are asking for my opinion, I do not think it is an appropriate use of union funds.
