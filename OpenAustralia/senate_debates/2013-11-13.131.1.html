         I am not the first person with a Croatian heritage to be elected to this place, but I believe I may be the first person who has two parents born in Croatia to be elected to the Australian parliament, and it is to my parents Louis and Kate that I sent my first and deepest thanks. I will be forever grateful to my parents for all the sacrifices they made, the opportunities they created and the support they provided.
        </p>
        <p>
         My parents left their native Croatia in search of freedom and a better life for our family. They found those things here in Canberra. My father, Louis, worked a number of jobs before going to night school to study photography. He then worked in the National Library's photographic section, becoming an accomplished local photographer who helped chronicle the life of our region and our nation. Mum looked after the kids and did an amazing job in tough circumstances.
        </p>
        <p>
         Raising six kids on one modest income was not easy, but it gave me the guiding principles and support that have led me to this place. They gave me an appreciation of the value of hard work, perseverance and the art which many large families know about: getting a lot from a little. We did not have a lot, but we did not waste a lot either. My parents gave me love, support and a deep sense of right and wrong. Most of all they gave me opportunity. They gave me the opportunity to receive a good education at

         . I also had the opportunity and privilege of studying at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University" rel="nofollow">
          Australian National University
         </a>

          Australian Public Service
         </a>

          ACT
         </a>
         Legislative Assembly.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opportunities given to me by my parents all those years ago have led me here to the highest parliament in the land. I now take this opportunity from the floor of the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia to say thank you to Mum and Dad. You are both my heroes.
        </p>
        <p>
         My parents also taught me manners, so I would like to continue with some other thankyous before talking about other matters. I would like to thank the people of Canberra first for endorsing me to serve for nearly nine years in the Legislative Assembly and now for the significant additional privilege of serving in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Senate" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Senate
         </a>
         . It is an amazing honour. I pay tribute to those who have gone before me in this role:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Knight" rel="nofollow">
          John Knight
         </a>
         ,

          Gary Humphries
         </a>
         . All made significant contributions in this place and in service of the people of the ACT and the nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to thank the men and women of the ACT division of the Liberal Party for giving me the honour to represent the party and so many who worked so hard for my campaign. Election successes are only possible because of the hard work of thousands of volunteers, and here in Canberra we have some of the best. My party gave me the honour of leading it in the ACT for more than five years and at two elections. I thank them for that. During those five years, hard work, discipline and unity of purpose in the parliamentary party were central to us achieving a record number of seats for the Liberal Party in the ACT. I believe that these principles are as true in large parliaments as they are in Australia's smallest parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to congratulate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Abbott
         </a>
         on his election as Prime Minister. Changes of government are rare in federal politics, and the fact that it has happened just six years after the coalition lost office is, I think, testimony to the amazing leadership that Tony Abbott has displayed over the last four years. Might I also congratulate Senator Eric Abetz on becoming

         â€”a worthy honour for a great servant of the Liberal Party, Tasmania and our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to recognise the Croatian-Australian community, of which I remain a very proud part. I am pleased we have with us here in the gallery today the new Croatian ambassador, Dr Damir Kusen, as well as the consul general, Mirjana Piskulic. As for a former member of this place, Natasha Stott Despoja's Croatian heritage is well known, and I believe we have with us here today Mario Despoja in the gallery. I first met Mario whilst doorknocking during the 2004 ACT election campaign. I knocked on his door in Farrer, and he excitedly told me to wait there while he ran to get a photo album which showed a picture of him at my parents' wedding back in 1971. He was very excited and obviously very proud of his daughter. I pay tribute to Mario. I later found out that he had in fact established a Croatian embassy in the late 1970s during a time when the Croatian people were struggling for independence, so I acknowledge his work.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a son of immigrants fleeing oppression, I would like to speak about our multicultural nation. People from many nations have made great contributions to Australia. We are all the richer for it. But it also must be said that it is a mark of what a great nation we live inâ€”what a big hearted nationâ€”that Australia has opened itself to immigrants from all over the world and allowed them to make their homes here. I reject the view that Australia should not continue to grow. Does anyone really believe that Australia is not a vastly more prosperous nation now, with 23 million people, than it was when it have five or 10 million people? I believe that growing our population in a steady manner is the key to our prosperity. In order to do this we need a well-managed immigration program and sensible and strategic infrastructure investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are and should remain a nation built on diverse cultures united by common values. Among those values are the protection of the great freedoms: freedom of speech, enterprise and religion. For me and my family, this issue is personal. One of the reasons my family left Croatia was because freedom of speech and religion in particular were curtailed under a harsh communist regime. My uncle Stipan spent several years in a Yugoslav prison for daring to challenge the communist regime and assert his rights to speak freely and freely practise his religion.
        </p>
        <p>
         I take the opportunity to congratulate the Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, for placing these great freedoms at the centre of government policy and for successfully leading the charge against the previous government's proposed media laws. These freedoms are truly central to who we are as a nation, and constant vigilance is required to protect them.
        </p>
        <p>
         I reiterate my personal commitment to the protection and support for the family as the basis of prosperity in society and stability in the home. I believe the institution of marriage between a man and a woman is a special one deserving special recognition and protection. Many people who voted for the Liberal Party did so on the basis that this is our long-held position.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a proud Canberran Tuggeranong born and bred, I have several things to say about Canberra. First, I am and will remain a staunch defender of my home town no matter what other matters are before us, and there are very good reasons for doing so. Canberra is a great city. Its people are doing great work for and on behalf of our country, and it makes a contribution to our nation as substantial as any other city in the country. Canberra bashing diminishes those who engage in it and is an attack on our nation. All Australians should be encouraged to be proud of their national capital, not just because of what the city is but also because of what it representsâ€”not just this building, the meeting place of the nation, but the suburbs which are the home to hundreds of thousands of ordinary Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         While most Canberrans are not politiciansâ€”contrary to popular beliefâ€”many do contribute to our nation through the public service, a privilege which I enjoyed prior to going into politics as did my father and many members of my family. This contribution should be recognised and honoured. As the coalition government goes through the difficult task of fixing the budget mess it has inherited, I urge my colleagues to treat public servants with respect, to give as much clarity and certainty as possible and to honour the promise to ensure reductions in public service numbers are achieved through natural attrition.
        </p>
        <p>
         The National Capital Authority plays an important role in protecting the national capital character of Canberra. However, the size of its remit and its limited resources make it difficult for the authority to properly perform this role. The time has come for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCA" rel="nofollow">
          NCA
         </a>
         to be allowed to focus on its core role of protecting and promoting the national capital and allowing the ACT government to get on with the other aspects of planning Canberra. I am putting some suggestions on how this can be achieved to Minister Jamie Briggs, which will more clearly delineate the roles of the NCA and the ACT government. I look forward to working with the ACT government to bring about positive changes in how the responsibilities of the NCA and the ACT government interact.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Canberra, we also have a vibrant private sector which looks to government to spend money wisely and cut red tape and overregulation in order for it to prosper. As well as all of the trades and first-class retail, hospitality and professional sectors, Canberra has growing and vibrant
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
          ICT
         </a>
         , tourism, education, property and defence industry sectors with great future potential. Much of this private sector activity provides services to or acts in partnership with the federal government. Innovative thinking on the part of the federal government has the potential to benefit both government and these parts of the private sector. One simple step to help facilitate this would be to re-establish the Capital Region Ministerial Business Roundtable, and I commend that suggestion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Canberra has an active sporting, artistic and cultural sector. We are home to great national sporting teams such as the Brumbies, Raiders, Capitals and Cavalryâ€”occasionally, even

I take this opportunity to congratulate you, Senator Peris, on your election. I know it is not just a significant thing for the Indigenous community in our nation, but it is a significant thing for our nation as a whole. Congratulations.

         Canberra's cultural sector is vibrant and growing, not only thanks to national institutions such as the

         </a>

         </a>
         . As we celebrate Canberra's centenary this year, we celebrate the great contribution these people, and many more like them, have made to Australian life. But as we move into Canberra's next century, there is still more to do.

        <p>
         A particular project the business community in Canberra is very eager to see is the Australia Forumâ€”a national meeting place and convention centre for the national capital. This can only be achieved through a partnership between the federal and ACT governments. I commend this project to the government. I also commend my former colleague in the assembly,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Smyth" rel="nofollow">
          Brendan Smyth
         </a>
         , for his tireless advocacy of this project. I believe its time has come. The Australia Forum would be a piece of national infrastructure befitting the nation's capital. Such an investment would build on the great tradition of Liberal governments building Canberra. This is most true of the government of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Robert_Menzies" rel="nofollow">
          Sir Robert Menzies
         </a>
         , but it was also true of the Howard government. It should not be forgotten that the Howard government built the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Museum" rel="nofollow">
          National Museum

        </p>
        <p>
         Another area of policy where there is plenty of room for improvement is our building industry. There is still far too much union intimidation of small, medium and even large builders. I commend the policy of re-establishing the Building and Construction Commission and I would urge the minister to ensure that it is properly resourced and supported to bring back the rule of law to building sites. This reform, along with reducing some of the green and red tape as it applies to the building industry, in partnership with more sensible land use policies from state and territory governments will help to bring the cost of infrastructure, commercial buildings and homes down. This is a worthy goal for the coalition government to work hard towards.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another area critical to improving productivity is workplace relations more generally. While I commend the government for its steady and cautious approach to workplace reform, it is time we again had the conversation about workplace reform without simplistic claims of resurrecting
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
          Work Choices
         </a>
         being bandied about. I am often hearing from constituents about the growing number of restaurants, bars and cafes closed on a Sunday in Canberra. I believe this is a nationwide issue, and we as a nation need to ask ourselves the question: is it pro-worker for thousands of restaurants, bars and cafes to be routinely shutting down on Sundays due to prohibitively high penalty rates? When this occurs no-one winsâ€”not the small business owner who has the viability of their business affected, not the consumer who has their choice restricted and certainly not the worker denied the opportunity to work their desired number of hours.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to put on record today my rejection of the nanny state. I think I speak for many Australians when I say that government has gone too far in regulating and instructing us to within an inch of our lives. Those of us who live in the ACT, and there are many in the gallery, are particularly familiar with the nanny state. We have seen in recent years the government declare war on the great scourges of plastic bags, fireworks, puppies sold in pet stores and most recently the humble community sausage sizzle. I trust that the coalition government will stand for freedom, not just in the big things but also in working against the many small areas of government intrusion which combine to make life a little less pleasant and a little less free. The coalition's policy to devote days in parliament to getting rid of regulations is therefore very welcome.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition's paid parental leave scheme has copped some criticism, particularly from our political opponents. However, let me make this point. Here in Canberra around 50 per cent of the workforce is in the public sector. They currently have access to a taxpayer funded, wage replacement paid parental leave scheme. This is bipartisan policy. The vast bulk of workers in the private sector, and almost universally in small business, do not have access to such a scheme. The government's paid parental leave scheme is therefore not just pro working woman, but also pro small business; and that is particularly true here in Canberra, where small business struggles to compete with government. Let me also make this point. Given that the paid parental leave scheme is a government funded scheme for people in paid work who have children, I believe it is important that those women who have children but are not in the workforce are also supported by the government.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before concluding, I would like to thank all in the gallery who have come to support me. There are too many to mention here, but each of you is here because you have played some role in my journey or in promoting the Liberal cause. And I thank you for that. I have had a little bit to say about family today, but I can also reveal to the Senate that I do in fact have a member of my extended family, so to speak, in this place, though. I do not believe he is in the chamber at the moment. I was reminded of it when I walked past Senator Conroy in Aussies today and he yelled out, 'In-law, in-law!', My wife's sister recently married Stephen Conroy's little brother. So he and I are related, but obviously that was not enough for him to come down and watch my speech! So it is not a particularly close relationship at this stage, I assure you, Senator Abetz. But you know what they say: 'Blood is thicker than water!'
        </p>
        <p>
         There are some people who have played a particularly important role in my political journey:

          Steve Doyle
         </a>
         , Ian Hagan and Tio Faulkner have formed an amazing and formidable political team. To the campaign manager, Brigitte Morten; to my wonderful staff, Josh Baker,

          Jeremy Hanson
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alistair_Coe" rel="nofollow">
          Alistair Coe
         </a>
         ; and to staff who gave up their own time to assist, I say thank you. To those who have supported me in my personal journeyâ€”particularly John and Jan Kennedy, Bob O'Heir, Adam and Cushla Morris, Jonathan and Karen Doyle, Dave and Katie Ellis, and Nick Medwayâ€”I say thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
         And finally, and most importantly, I want to thank my family. To my parents, Loui and Kate, who did such an amazing job raising six kids in difficult circumstances; to my sisters, Branka, Katarina and Lidia; and to my brothers, Nick and Zvonimir, I love you all very much. To my children, Michael, Tommy, William, Olivia and Graceâ€”we are doing our bit for a big Australia!â€”I love you, I will always want the best for you, and I will fight in this place to ensure Australia remains a wonderful place to live in, prosper and raise a family. You are always in my thoughts and my prayers, even when I am not with you as much as I would like to be. And lastly, and definitely most importantly, to my beautiful wife Ros: you are amazing and I love you. You are the best thing that has ever happened to meâ€”and you should never let me forget that!
        </p>
        <p>
         I am truly honoured to stand in this place; I am humbled by those who have trusted me to do so, and I will never forget the reasons why they have chosen me to be here. Prime Minister Tony Abbott said in his maiden speech that 'there is no limit to what Australia can achieve'. I agree with that statement. We have already achieved so much. We have achieved one of the most peaceful and prosperous nations on earthâ€”and this has not occurred by accident. It has come through the hard work and initiative of our people, the sacrifice of our service men and women, and a commitment to democracy and freedom guided largely by good government. It has come through treating all with respect, supporting family, valuing and protecting human life, and protecting those in need.
        </p>
        <p>
         In striving to uphold these values, I will always work to protect and represent my constituents, as it is they who I am ultimately answerable to. They are why I am here. Much as I am here to tackle the great debates of the day, I will do so with the people of Canberra foremost in my mind. I am here as a local, and as a Liberal, to ensure Canberrans always have a voiceâ€”and not just the great and mighty, the ministers and ambassadors, the business leaders and community elders. It is about giving a voice to people like me, a son of immigrant parents from the suburbs of Tuggeranong. I am here for those people and, while I am here, I will work to ensure they have a voice in this great parliament. Thank you.

           . I acknowledge the traditional owners, the Ngambri and the Ngunnawal people on whose country we meet today. I pay my respects to my elders, past and present. and to our future leaders.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am Nova Maree Peris. I was born in Darwin in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
            Northern Territory
           </a>
           and I retain my strong cultural and spiritual ties to my country, to

            Mother Earth
           </a>
           . I am a member of the oldest continuous living culture on the earth. I am proud that this hill that we meet on here today is culturally significant to the Ngambri people as representing the womb of the 'Woman' on this Country. It is very significant to me to be the first Aboriginal woman elected to the federal parliament of Australia. Through my mother, I am a descendant of the Gija people of the East Kimberley and the Yawuru people of the West Kimberley. I am also Iwatja from Western Arnhem Land through my father.
          </p>
          <p>
           Through my life I have come across many people from all walks of life who have inspired me; some through their wisdom and some through their courage and their ability to overcome adversity. But no-one has inspired me more than my grandmother, Nora Peris, a proud Gija woman. She was torn from her mother's arms and lived on the Mission of Moola Bulla in the East Kimberley. 'Moola Bulla is a long, sad and painful story', she used to say. This was home to her for 12 years. A river separated her and her traditional Aboriginal mother who was still living on country. She used to always say they were so closeâ€”yet so far apart. My Nanna's clothes on the mission were made from stitched-together hessian bags. When the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
            Second World War
           </a>
           hit, the kids were released from the mission and for two years she walked and lived off the harsh Eastern Kimberley land. These conditions and her will to survive shaped her, and it was where she met my grandfather Johnny Peris.
          </p>
          <p>
           Johnny Peris was a Yawuru Man, a

           mission survivor who was also a proud stockman. They met and had 10 children. Four of their children were taken away and sent to the Garden Point mission on the

            Tiwi Islands
           </a>
           in the Northern Territory. One of the four children who was takenâ€”and is here todayâ€”is my mother, Joan Peris. She lived on the mission for eight years. She worked every day and never received a cent in pay. Mum became like a sister to many of the other children that were forcibly taken to the Garden Point mission.
          </p>
          <p>
           Over the years, people have said to me that it's incredible what I have done in sport. I have competed at some of the biggest sporting events on the planet. Accolades, achievements and celebrations have been part of my life. But in my heart, I know that that part of my life is virtually meaningless compared to the ability to survive shown by my grandparents and my mother. I cannot imagine or comprehend how it must have been to live life during those days.
          </p>
          <p>
           These stories are part of the truth of Australia's history. It is what it is. The past is the past and no matter how hard we try we cannot change that history. But let's start to undo the wrongs with what is right and just. I urge all my parliamentary colleagues to become champions for the recognition of Australia's first nation people in our constitution. To Aboriginal and

            Torres Strait Islander
           </a>

          <p>
           As a child growing up, I dreamt big. Most people would have looked at an Aboriginal girl from the Territory, where the statistics of alcohol abuse, youth suicide, domestic violence, imprisonment rates and substandard education point to every reason why I should not succeed. But I was determined to be successful. And yes, I am a product of that history, and I continue to live in a society whereby the odds are stacked against Aboriginal people.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have always been inspired by those around me, and my sister, Venessa Peris, has undertaken an incredible journey of her own. She has lived an amazing and accomplished life serving Australia. She was a corporal and served for 10 years in the

           civil war, and at one stage was involved in evacuating more than 4,000 people. She is currently carrying out her duties and resides in Monrovia, Liberia.
          </p>
          <p>
           I say this to all of my Indigenous brothers and sisters and to all people: within every one of us lies the ability to reach deep inside ourselves and draw upon our inherited strength that our ancestors have given us. There lies a spirit that needs to be awakened.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whilst I am obviously very proud of my Aboriginal heritage I want to make it clear that I do not consider myself an expert when it comes to finding solutions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people's particular predicaments. For too long we have all heard too many people say they have the answers for Aboriginal Australians and claim the moral high ground. If the answers were as easily provided as the questions are posed, we simply would not have a problem. In fact the answers are difficult and complex; but they do not lie in absolute positions and simplified slogans. Just delivering another government program will not end the appalling rates of youth suicide in our communities, for example. These are uncomfortable issues but they must be confronted.
          </p>
          <p>
           But I have always been someone who has tried to do things, not just talk about them. I build things up; I don't tear things down, and I have lived by the view that, 'As much is given, much is expected.' I have always been humbled and honoured to serve. That is why I established the Nova Peris Girls Academy. I wanted to try to make a real difference to young disadvantaged Indigenous girls. Of course, I have now ceased active involvement in the academy, but I remain the patron.
          </p>
          <p>
           Like many before me, for too long, I have watched Aboriginal Australians and our plight be used purely for political purposes. I have seen some totally unscrupulous people try to use the misery of some of our people's circumstances to promote their own cause and agenda.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Should_I" rel="nofollow">
            Should I
           </a>
           see this happen, I will call it for what it is. It is racismâ€”and I know that is confrontingâ€”but I will not stand by in silence. How we change thingsâ€”that remains the challenge, but I know from my heart that nothing can be achieved without total determination and a gut-busting effort.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have been fortunate enough to achieve at the Olympic levels of sport in hockey and athletics. I have experienced the total joy of winning gold medals for my country. And I have lived the exciting life of an elite athleteâ€”fussed over and entertainedâ€”in more than 50 countries around the world. But I would swap all of that in a heartbeatâ€”I would forgo any number of gold medalsâ€”to see Aboriginal Australians be free, healthy and participating fully in all that our great country has to offer.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is my dream to see kids from Santa Theresa, from Gunbalanya, from Kalkarindji and from the Tiwi Islands all with the same opportunity as the kids from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Suburbs" rel="nofollow">
            Eastern Suburbs
           </a>
           of Sydney. That is one of the reasons I am a fierce advocate for Aboriginal people being taught to be able to read and write English. We cannot and should not be denied these basic tools. Of course, we should never be forced to renounce our culture. Our beliefs sustain our spirits, they nourish us; but at some levels they can restrain us tooâ€”that is the collision point that confronts Aboriginal people.
          </p>
          <p>
           I make the simple point that in spite of difficulties like those I have described we are seeing some positive health benefits through the dedication of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal health professionals. We can make a difference, whatever our differences are.

           is currently the only jurisdiction in Australia that is on track to meet the Closing the Gap target on life expectancy. This improvement comes from people who have sought evidence and put that evidence into action. They have not acted on any fixed ideology but out of dedication and commitment. This evidence based method of approach is, in my view, a real road sign for the future and points the way to dealing with so many other areas of Aboriginal life that have seemed so intractable for so long. This is why I will be seeking to work not only with my colleagues in the Labor Party in holding the government to account but also with the current government to ensure we build on successes in primary health careâ€”and to extend those successes into other areas of our lives.

           Education remains the major foundation for self-improvement. And although education is a basic fundamental right of every child in this country, irrespective of their race, the fact remains we must work hard to convince people of the value of education.

           I acknowledge I am a senator elected to represent all Territorians, and I fully intend to discharge this duty to the best of my ability, and I will always put our concernsâ€”the concerns of Territoriansâ€”first and foremost. I believe it is my duty and the duty of all members elected to the parliament to answer questions and deal with issues honestly and openly. One such matter that is a very contentious issue is the location of Australia's proposed nuclear waste facility.
          </p>
          <p>
           Recently my Larrakia uncle, Eric Fejo, who is also here today, spoke about the previous government's decision to locate the proposed nuclear waste facility on Muckaty Station in the Barkly region of the Northern Territory. He reminded a public forum that during the apology to the stolen generations it was stated that governments were wrong to make laws and policies that inflict profound grief, suffering and loss on Aboriginal people. That is what the Muckaty decision is currently doing. It is dividing a community of traditional owners. This policy is inflicting grief. I strongly urge my fellow parliamentary colleagues to reconsider their support for the current location of this facility. Of course Australia needs a nuclear waste management facility, but its location must be based on science, not politics.
          </p>
          <p>
           I do intend to finish my speech on a positive note. The art of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people is stunning. It is truly a gift to Australian culture. The outfit that I am wearing today is made in the Northern Territory. This beautiful gold silk fabric featuring dancing brolgas was printed at Injalak Arts in Gunbalanya in Western Arnhem Land. It was made by my Dripstone High School friend Sarina Cowcher in Darwin. I also wore a Gracie Kumbi Merrepen printed design for my official swearing-in yesterday.

           I am a Territory girl. I am immensely proud of who I am and where I hail from. It is majestic. The Northern Territory's very talented musicians, our artists, our sports men and women, our culture, our iconic and diverse landscape that boasts a number of

           These are the people who taught and continue to teach me the right values that have enabled me to achieve so much in life. I also particularly thank the former Prime Minister,

           spoke of his dream in Washington, it inspired millions across the world. I believe everyone has the capacity to dreamâ€”we all have the capacity to believeâ€”but very few get the actual opportunity that I have before me. I urge everybody, particularly young people, to pursue your dreams. In this next stage of my life I hope to give all those who have had faith in me every reason to continue to believe in the power of those dreams.

           I would just like to close today with a story that has stayed in my heart for many years. At the 2000

           there were hundreds of very excited and enthusiastic volunteers. An elderly man amongst them at the athletics track greeted me each and every day and wished me well. On the evening of the semi-finals of the 4x400m he did not wish me well, he just handed me a piece of paper and said, 'Read it just before you enter the stadium.' I put it in my pocket and proceeded to the check-in and then walked with my team-mates,

           that evening, and we had to finish in the top two to reach the Olympic final. We all felt the weight of Australian expectation resting on our shoulders, our adrenaline was pumping and we did our best to stay cool. We walked into the stadium to be greeted by 110,000 screaming sporting enthusiasts.

           INVISIBLE. I did not really know what it meant, and I did not have much time to reflect on it. But it seemed to inspire me, those words written by a kind, elderly man. The four of us went out that evening and ran the race of our lives. I anchored the team and we broke a 23-year-old Australian record. And we made it into the Olympic final. I returned to the warm up track where he greeted me with a big hug. And I asked him: 'What does it mean?' He simply replied: 'It was my ticket to freedom, I thought about it every day that I was held captive.' It turned out he was a former prisoner of war!
