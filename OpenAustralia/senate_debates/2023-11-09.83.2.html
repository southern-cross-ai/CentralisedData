        Welcome back, Senator Wong, but my question is to Senator Farrell, representing the Treasurer. Minister, having had a further 24 hours to prepare, following the question from Senator McGrath yesterday, can you now put on the Senate record the precise definition of 'mortgage stress'?

          With due respect—

         <p>
          No, you didn't—you threw it at me! You threw it at me in a—

         <p>
          An opposition senator: Did you read it?
         </p>
         <p>
          Yes, I read it.
         </p>
         <p>
          Well, again, I raise the question: what's the point of you asking me questions when you already have the answer, and you've prepared the answer? The reality of the situation is that lots and lots of Australians are now facing mortgage stress. There's no doubt about it—we're not disputing that fact. We understand that ordinary Australians are facing it, particularly as a result of that decision earlier in the week by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
           Reserve Bank
          </a>
          to increase the mortgage rates by 0.25 per cent. And I see that the banks have already been quick to implement that increase. But we understand the issues that Australians are facing and, as I said to you in just about every single question that I answered yesterday, we are trying to put downward pressure on inflation and the cost of living.
         </p>
         <p>
          One of the ways, of course, we're doing that is by that budget surplus that—

            Minister, I note that you referred to 'lots and lots' of Australians facing mortgage stress. I wonder if you could be a little more precise? How many Australians are actually facing mortgage stress and how many more Australians will face mortgage stress as a result of the interest rate rise this week?

               President, I have a point of order on direct relevance. This is quite remarkable; this is the minister representing the Treasurer. Yesterday also he was the minister representing the Treasurer.

              <p>
               He was asked for this data yesterday. He was unable to give the data yesterday, but it's inconceivable that somewhere in his briefing, somewhere in his pack, he doesn't have the specific data Senator Scarr has requested. And I ask you to draw him to the particular question, not a lesson on
