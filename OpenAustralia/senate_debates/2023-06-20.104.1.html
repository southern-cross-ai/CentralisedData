        twiddled their thumbs while their energy policy chaos saw dispatchable power leave the grid. The Albanese Labor government took urgent action to shield Australian families and businesses from the worst of global energy price spikes. Could the minister outline how the Albanese government is working to drive down household and business energy costs while also making homes and businesses cheaper to run?

         Thank you, Senator Payman. I'm very pleased to get this question, and can I say this at the outset: the senator asserts that those opposite twiddled their thumbs whilst in government. Well, it was worse than that, wasn't it? They were entirely focused on their internal conflict, entirely focused on having their fight—
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce" rel="nofollow">

         versus those who actually understood that there was a problem. They had 22 energy policies, and guess who has to clean up the mess.

           There were 22 energy policies and a market which saw a reduction in dispatchable capacity. Then, to add insult to injury, who voted against energy price relief? The 'no-alition'. That's who voted against energy price relief.

             I know it's triggering for those opposite to realise that their tactics led them to the position where they have to say to the Australian people, 'We support higher prices.' That's what those opposite were saying: 'We don't want to vote for price relief.' I don't think Australians will ever forget.

               I know it's difficult for those opposite to accept. We know that they suddenly had anxiety thereafter, because they tried to pretend that they didn't actually vote against it when everyone knows they did. Well, unlike them, we are committed to doing the work to deliver cheaper, cleaner energy for Australians. In less than two weeks, millions of Australians will start to benefit from energy price relief rebates which those opposite opposed—five million households and a million businesses around this country, an Albanese government initiative that we are delivering despite your opposition.

In addition to those great Albanese government initiatives, the small-business energy incentive will help up to 3.8 million small and medium-sized businesses save energy and save on their energy bills. Can the minister please explain to the Senate what has been the response to this announcement from the Albanese Labor government?

                  The small-business energy incentive starts on 1 July. That's an initiative of this government, and it will help 3.8 million businesses. I'm not sure if they voted against that one or whether they weren't able to actually vote against it because we were able to implement it. But they might have if they could have, because they vote against pretty much anything. Three point eight million businesses will from 1 July benefit from this incentive.

                      The Albanese Labor government is partnering with state and territory governments to provide up to $3 billion in electricity bill relief for eligible households and small businesses through the Energy Bill Relief Fund. How will Australians benefit from this measure, and how many Australians will benefit?

                       Let's remember, that's a saving you didn't want them to have, an eight per cent decrease in what their bill was last year. In Victoria, families will benefit by approximately $555. Again, that's a saving you didn't want them to have. In Queensland, families will benefit by about $819. Again, that's a saving you didn't want them to have. The reality is that five million households across this country will be eligible for—
