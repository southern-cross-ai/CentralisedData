         I particularly thank Senator McKenzie for her continuing interest in these issues of education reform, which the minister is pursuing so assiduously. What the coalition government has done is to accept the overwhelming evidence—both Australian and international—that has shown that increased school autonomy is a very important contributor to improving student education performance outcomes. So there has been a strong move across most jurisdictions in Australia to increase principal and school autonomy in the public school sector.

          —I respond to those opposite who are not keeping up—has been a leader in this important initiative. Premier Barnett launched the Independent Public Schools initiative in August 2009, and presently has 264

          schools participating in this program—which is exceptional.
         </p>
         <p>
          There was an independent evaluation of the Western Australia initiative by the Melbourne Graduate School of Education in May last year, which highlighted that it had overwhelming support from principals and was having a very positive impact on both teachers and the communities of the schools. That is why, as a coalition government, we have now launched the new $70 million Independent Public Schools initiative to support this important innovation across all Australian jurisdictions. Our
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS" rel="nofollow">
           IPS
          </a>
          will support 25 per cent of public schools, or 1,500 schools across Australia, to become more independent, by increasing local governance and engagement with parents and their communities. If the Western Australian government chooses to participate further in this initiative the fund will assist them to further support at least another 169 schools in their state in becoming an IPS. Participating schools will be given the chance to enjoy the benefits of increased control over decision making while remaining a part of their government school system. It gives those schools an excellent opportunity to explore the same initiatives taken by the other schools in Western Australia and more around Australia.

My colleague Senator McKenzie and my colleague the federal Minister for Education visited two

            regional schools this month and saw firsthand the progress being made in implementing Independent Public Schools in Western Australia. The minister visited both the Ocean Road Primary School and the Mount Lockyer Primary School. He met with schools leaders, teachers, staff, parents and students to listen to their views about the
