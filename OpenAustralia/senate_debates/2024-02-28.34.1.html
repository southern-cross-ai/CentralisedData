        I rise to speak in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Vietnam_Campaign_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal
        </a>
        and that cohort of former national servicemen who served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        , who were conscripted by law, did their duty and completed their term of service and who have been denied this medal because they did not serve in Vietnam for at least 181 days.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a cohort of former national servicemen of some 2½ thousand who deserve this medal as a matter of equity, fairness and justice. This cohort of former national servicemen have been supported in this campaign by an outstanding advocate—a leader, Mr Richard Barry
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , a former national serviceman from the 10th intake who served in Vietnam in 6th Battalion
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">
         RAR
        </a>
        . Other advocates have also joined this campaign. They include retired Lieutenant Colonel Bert Hoebee, who is with us here today, together with other supporters of this campaign, including veterans—my deep, deep respects. This cohort of former national servicemen are supported in their quest by our wonderful Australian Vietnamese community, many of whom are here in the gallery today, including veterans of the armed forces of the Republic of Vietnam. I pay my deep respects to each and every one of you. I also recognise the presence of Mr Andrew Wilkie MP in the chamber today.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 30 April 2021, I attended a Queensland Vietnamese community ceremony at the aptly named Freedom Place in Inala, Brisbane, to mourn the fall of Saigon in 1975. As is the case at every Queensland Vietnamese community event, the service of Australians who fought in Vietnam was deeply and movingly honoured. That occurs at every single Queensland Vietnamese event that I attend. It was in this context that senior members of the Vietnamese community approached me and asked that I advocate for this cohort of former national servicemen. Reflect on that: it was the Vietnamese community who approached me, not the former national servicemen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since then, I have been advocating for the Australian government to issue this medal. I've been on this quest for only two years and 10 months. Mr Richard Barry OAM has campaigned for this wrong to be righted for decades. Progress was at last being made in the period leading up to the last federal election. I was informed that the then veterans' affairs minister and the then defence minister in the coalition government had both signed off on the issue of the medal. The matter entered into the whole-of-government process. I was advocating hard for it to be done before the last election. This was in the context where dozens and dozens of current and former parliamentarians, prime ministers, governors, veterans organisations and Vietnamese community organisations had all given their support to right this wrong. I have the list here. There are pages and pages of supporters, including senators sitting in this place, some of whom are around the Albanese cabinet table today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The then opposition spokesperson for veterans' affairs, the Honourable Shayne Neumann, issued a media statement on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Servicemen" rel="nofollow">
         National Servicemen
        </a>
        's Day, 14 February 2022. This is what he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This year, Labor is calling on the Morrison-Joyce Government to formally recognise thousands of National Servicemen who fought in Vietnam with a Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Labor urges the Government to give these men the recognition they deserve and finally allow them to proudly wear the RVCM when they march alongside their mates on Anzac Day this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is what Labor said before the election. So confident was I of the then opposition's support, of Labor's support, that I advocated to the former government that the issue of the medal could be resolved during the caretaker period, and I actually lobbied senior government advisers, in emails to that effect. It was not to be.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hon" rel="nofollow">
         The Hon
        </a>
        . Shayne Neumann MP did not become the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. The Hon. Matt Keogh MP was appointed. After a further 18 months—18 agonising months—of further considering this matter, the minister declined to make a decision to issue the medal. I have here the letter he wrote to Mr Richard Barry OAM, saying: 'I decline to make a decision in relation to the RVCM.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the election, the Labor opposition called for the coalition to issue the medal. After the election, the now Labor government refused to issue the medal. It is shameful—just shameful!
       </p>
       <p>
        But it is not too late. There is still an opportunity to rectify this matter, to correct this injustice. How can it be, senators, that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        veterans, serving towards the end of US involvement in the Vietnam war, could be issued the medal for 60 days' service, but our former national servicemen are denied? How is that equitable? It is unjust. It is inequitable. It is unfair. The Australian government should have fixed it back then, 50 years ago. It's not too late to fix it now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senators, I ask each and every one of you to consider the words of former national servicemen who have been denied this medal. Consider their words. A former national serviceman who served for 148 days in Vietnam, in 104 Battery, 4th Field Regiment, said: 'On Anzac Day, I get called a "short-timer" because I do not have the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal.' A former national serviceman who served for 170 days in Vietnam, just 11 days short of the 181 days, in 3RAR said: 'For many years, I wondered why I had not received the Vietnamese campaign medal. It seems I was a "short-timer". I've always felt embarrassed to have only one award for so many operations. I've never unboxed or worn that, or will any future awards.' A former national serviceman who served for 117 days in Vietnam in 5RAR said: 'I arrived in Vietnam on 8 February 1969. Over the next four months, we engaged with the enemy on numerous occasions, and I witnessed the true tragedy, horror and consequences of war in 117 gruelling and heart wrenching days.'
       </p>
       <p>
        And consider the words of the wife of a former national serviceman. We know the toll that veterans' service in Vietnam puts upon their families. These are the words of the wife of a former national serviceman who served for 141 days in Vietnam, in the 1st Australian Logistical Support Group. In an email to Mr Richard Barry, she wrote: 'My husband was one of the Vietnam veterans that was recalled at short notice after having served 141 days in Vietnam. We have always felt it was unfair that he was not awarded the medal. Not being awarded the medal has added to the feeling of inferiority when gathered with other Vietnam veterans. He is battling severe depression. His service was 141 days. And I met him at Sydney airport when he came home.' I have pages and pages of these testimonies, provided by Mr Richard Barry OAM. For over 50 years, these former national servicemen have been waiting for this injustice to be corrected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consider the words of leaders of the Australian Vietnamese community. Mr Xuan Lam, the national president of the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARVN" rel="nofollow">
         ARVN
        </a>
        and former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thu_Duc" rel="nofollow">
         Thu Duc
        </a>
        reserve cadets association in Australia, who is here today, says, 'Being an officer in the Republic of Vietnam armed forces during the war, I know that our Australian soldiers had been the primary target for the Vietcong's attacks around the clock. They could have lost their lives at any time, and they did not need to wait for 181 days for such horrific physical harms to come to them.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Consider the words of Mr Cong Le, national president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_Community_in_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnamese Community in Australia
        </a>
        , who is here today: 'Our brave Australian soldiers have served in the Republic of Vietnam with dedication, gallantry and honour, irrespective of duration. They should be awarded the full RVCM.'
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, consider the words of Richard Barry OAM: 'These men were compulsorily called away from their civilian careers to serve in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        . They fought in a foreign country in the name of peace and democracy at the behest of our government. These men are nearing 80. We owe it to them.'
