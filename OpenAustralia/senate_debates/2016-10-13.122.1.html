        My question is to Minister Simon Birmingham, representing Mr Frydenberg. As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I ask: is the minister aware of the Queensland government's destructive 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030, one of the highest in Australia? With energy security, reliability and prices threatened by policies of the extremist Greens, is the minister aware of the recently released frightening manifesto of the Queensland Labor government that outlines these outrageous policies? Is the minister cognisant of, or even sympathetic towards, the reality that a 50 per cent renewable energy target presents real and present danger to the security, prosperity and health of my home state of Queensland? Can the minister please inform senators how the federal government envisages the subsidies of $10 billion required to attract the companies to build these renewable energy projects being funded? Although the Labor government bizarrely claims energy prices will fall, contrary to all other experiences, how will the minister guarantee prices will not increase?

         I thank Senator Roberts for his question, which at least, unlike questions from those opposite, is focused on policy and the interests of the nation. Senator Roberts, we are aware of the stated intentions of the Queensland government and I can tell you—through you,

         —that energy security of course is critical to all Australians and must be a top priority for a successful economy. Queensland, we recognise as a government, is home to a range of businesses, including major electricity users like the three
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
          LNG
         </a>
         export plants and Boyne Smelters. These businesses, and many others, are dependent on a secure, reliable and affordable energy supply to deliver vital export dollars for Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         We cannot afford to let them suffer the same fate that is threatening some business and industry in my home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia

         . We have had four

          South Australian

         large economic contributors who, by being without power for 15 days, have cost the economy tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars. Those businesses, of course, now face big repair efforts as a result, and it comes on top of other incidents that show the challenge of high price and low reliability due to the unique circumstances in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">

         . Last Friday, Minister Frydenberg called a meeting of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COAG" rel="nofollow">
          COAG
         </a>
         Energy Council to discuss those events in SA. That meeting agreed that the prime responsibility—the prime responsibility—of ministers is to ensure the security, reliability and affordability of the energy system for all Australians. They commissioned an independent review, to be led by Dr Alan Finkel, our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Scientist" rel="nofollow">
          Chief Scientist

         , to develop a blueprint for energy security with recommendations outlining the policy, legislative and governance settings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Queensland has not offered any evidence that its unrealistic 50 per cent target can be met without compromising security. The Palaszczuk government has made the completely ridiculous claim that there will be no closures of coal fired generators as a result of this policy, despite the huge loss of coal fired generation it assumes will occur. Our department estimates the cost to be $27 billion.

           Can the minister produce for the Senate empirical evidence—that is, measured data and physical observations—that categorically proves humans are affecting climate change and, as such, these deindustrialisation renewable energy policies are required to stop the benefits of a naturally variable climate?

            . According to the World Meteorological Organization, global average temperatures have increased by almost one degree since the start of the industrial revolution; 2015 was the warmest year on record for the globe. According to the CSIRO, Australia's climate has also warmed by around one degree since 1910. Eight of the 10 years of Australia's warmest years on record have occurred since 2002, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.

            The reality of climate change is why we are a party to strong global action to reduce emissions. It is why we are delivering the types of policies that are sensibly meeting and exceeding our emissions reduction targets, as I outlined in response to Senator Di Natale before, but doing so in a way that is far more focused on the protection also of jobs in our economy while reducing our emissions.

This review will draw together and build on the analysis and findings of a number of reports commissioned by all Australian governments through the energy council, including reports by the
