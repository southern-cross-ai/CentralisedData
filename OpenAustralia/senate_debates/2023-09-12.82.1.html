        My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Wong. Last month the Albanese government made a historic agreement with states and territories to deliver the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full, including 450 gigalitres of water for the environment. Can the minister please explain to the Senate how this plan will put the Murray-Darling, a vital river system, on a healthy and sustainable path for our kids and grandkids after nine long years of neglect?

         n, Senator Grogan knows that the river Murray is truly South Australia's lifeblood. She has also campaigned on this issue for years and I thank her for it. Senator Grogan knows that a healthy Murray-Darling Basin is critical for the future security and prosperity of our country. It is often called the nation's food bowl. It supports farms, vineyards, livestock, and, critically, the drinking water that comes from the Murray flows to hundreds of thousands of homes. Our government, the Albanese Labor government, is working to—

                Those opposite had nearly a decade to deliver and what did they achieve? Two gigalitres out of 450. President, did you know, if you left it to the coalition, to the Liberals and the Nationals, it would take 2,000 years to deliver the plan? Those opposite have sabotaged every good-faith attempt to deliver the plan. The truth is that the National Party never wanted the plan and the Liberals were too spineless to stand up to them. The only party which is prepared to do the work to get the Murray-Darling Basin Plan back on track is the Labor Party.

We need to confront head on and in a comprehensive way the overallocation of water in the Murray-Darling.' That was

Given how critically important the delivery of the 450 gigalitres of water is, can the minister please explain to the Senate if there are any people trying to stand in the way of this plan being implemented?
