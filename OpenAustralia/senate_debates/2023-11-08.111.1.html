        This speech is part of the Raise Our Voice campaign where parliamentarians are asked to read speeches from our young people to ensure that their voices are heard in this place. My speech reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm sure you're all aware of the sexism that comes with playing a female sport.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All female sports are looked down upon and viewed as weak. Netball is almost only female, especially when it comes to professional leagues. Some boys think this is because it is 'too easy'.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you're a girl and you play sport, you're going to be a laughing-stock. It is the sad truth all female athletes must face, no matter how painful it is, no matter how much it makes you want to quit and give in to what they say.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But you cannot give them that satisfaction. Use it to fuel yourself, to play your sport and wear it as a badge with pride, and use it to play your sport with more passion and power.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a side of sport they don't like to show, the fact that most guys who play sport look down and laugh at the girls who play sport no matter how good they are. I've experienced this many times already and I'll continue to experience this. I do hope this changes, but there will always be people like that and, unfortunately, I don't think me or any other girls who play sport at my age or older will be able to see a day where we share an equal playing field in sport.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank this lovely young lady for sending this speech through. I think it highlights all of the key issues for females in sport. I say to her: I hope that you don't give up. We need more women and girls like you out on our fields and courts.
