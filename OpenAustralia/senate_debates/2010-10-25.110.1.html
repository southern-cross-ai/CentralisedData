        Madam Acting Deputy President, I am sure that you are aware that today is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
         Pink Ribbon
        </a>
        Day, which signifies the recognition of breast cancer survivors and the 14,000 women who have and will be diagnosed with breast cancer this year—30 per cent of these 14,000 women live in rural Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a rural breast cancer survivor I am delighted that today’s focus is on rural women diagnosed with breast cancer. A diagnosis of breast cancer is hard enough to deal with but, when one has to face the additional challenges due to geographical location in gaining access to information, support and treatment services, it is much more difficult.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Pink Ribbon breakfast in Sydney today, more than 800 people heard about meeting the challenges for women with breast cancer in rural Australia. Due to the complexity of cancer treatment and the location of many specialist cancer services in metropolitan or major regional areas, many rural women need to travel away from home for most of their care.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the breakfast Dr Helen Zorbas,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive_Officer" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Executive Officer
        </a>
        at the National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre, explained that many women with breast cancer living in rural and remote Australia made treatment decisions based on practical or logistical factors such as time spent away from home, rather than the evidence about best practice care. Dr Zorbas said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although breast conserving treatment and mastectomy are equally effective in the treatment of many women with early-stage breast cancer, women in rural areas are significantly more likely to undergo mastectomy compared to women living in cities.
       </p>
       <p>
        She also said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Women who choose breast conserving treatment usually require radiotherapy, which may mean at least six weeks away from home. Remembering that 25 per cent of these women are under 50 and may have young or adolescent children at home, means there are additional factors these women need to consider in deciding treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can certainly relate to these comments, having experienced eight months of chemotherapy as well as six weeks of radiotherapy 260 kilometres from home. An added complication of lymphoedema in my left arm from the removal of lymph nodes also had to be treated in the metropolitan area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other factors for a woman diagnosed with breast cancer living in a rural or remote area include transport to where treatment is available, affordable accommodation and support from family and friends. Filling in time between treatments and being able to remain positive is not as easy as it sounds, especially being far away from home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre has received funding through the Supporting Women in Rural Areas Diagnosed with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
         Breast Cancer
        </a>
        program to undertake three streams of work to support women from rural Australia diagnosed with breast cancer and the health professionals who care for them. These are: providing the latest information on advances in breast cancer care for rural health professionals through educational initiatives utilising web based technology and satellite broadcasts; linking families during treatment via Stay in Touch—this includes providing women and their families with laptops with broadband access, enabling face-to-face contact via Skype; and improving the knowledge and skills of Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        women health professionals, which includes three Supporting Sisters and Aunties to Survive! summits held across Australia as well as a training module for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health workers about breast cancer treatment and care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre projects focusing on meeting the rural challenge include Well Women workshops where funding is provided to health organisations and individual health professionals working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women to promote breast cancer awareness through locally run Well Women workshops. The Ralph Lauren Pink Pony Campaign is a campaign which provides educational scholarships for nurses and seeding grants for community groups to support women with breast cancer in rural Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the work of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breast_Cancer_Network_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Breast Cancer Network Australia
        </a>
        , which is the peak national organisation for Australians personally affected by breast cancer. I was one of their consumer representatives before I entered this place. I found this was a most fulfilling area to work in because all of the people involved had had breast cancer and their advocacy was very supportive. The fact that those people have had the same problems that you have really helps.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCNA" rel="nofollow">

        have also taken up the challenge of providing rural and regional initiatives through Supporting Women in Rural Areas Diagnosed with Breast Cancer funding. It has been running a series of rural breast cancer forums. These have been designed specifically for women affected by breast cancer living in rural and regional areas. The Living Well Beyond Breast Cancer forum provides participants with the latest information and advice from healthcare experts as well as the opportunity to connect with women going through a similar experience. To date these forums have been held in Geelong, Burnie, Tamworth, Rockhampton Townsville, Bunbury, Geraldton, Mildura, Dubbo and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Further forums are to be held at

        and Sale in November.
       </p>
       <p>
        BCNA have also launched their new website. This was launched on 7 May for the Field of Women
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIVE" rel="nofollow">
         LIVE
        </a>
        and the site has a new look and feel, and a new navigational structure. Information is now organised by topic or subject and is much easier to find. In addition to improved navigation, content has been expanded to include new material, in particular in the ‘Living with breast cancer’, ‘Secondary breast cancer’ and ‘Information for health professionals’ sections. A major component of the new site is the online network which allows members to link with each other in the privacy of their own home, without the constraints of time and distance.
       </p>
       <p>
        BCNA also produces the My Journey Kit, which is described as a lifeline for women diagnosed with early breast cancer. This has just passed the 50,000 milestone. The kit, provided free of charge, was first published in 2004 and has revolutionised the way women newly diagnosed with breast cancer receive information about the disease as well as advice and support. The second edition of the kit was released earlier this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have mentioned, BCNA’s policy and advocacy work continues to focus on survivorship issues supporting women to live well beyond their cancer diagnosis and treatment. In addition to the My Journey Kit, the
        <i>
         Beacon
        </i>
        newsletter and other resources such as fact sheets, the organisation continues to assist women with secondary breast cancer through the Hope and Hurdles Pack to promote the message of ‘living with’ rather than ‘dying from’ the disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I wish to raise an issue which is causing great concern to Cancer Council WA and health professionals associated with breast screening in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Seven commercial clinics have opened their doors in Western Australia offering unproved screening for breast cancer. The tests are not related to mammography, which is the gold standard for the detection of breast cancer. These operators market their product as safe, pain-free and suitable for all ages, including younger women. Mr Terry Slevin, Director of Education and Research at Cancer Council WA states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is an industry that is playing on women’s anxiety about breast cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tests cost $100 and $200 and are not refundable from Medicare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Complaints regarding two of these operators have been lodged by Cancer Council WA with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapeutic_Goods_Administration" rel="nofollow">
         Therapeutic Goods Administration
        </a>
        —TGA—and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Competition_and_Consumer_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Competition and Consumer Commission

        —
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        . I raised the issue with the TGA last week during Senate estimates and was pleased to hear that the agency is currently investigating the unauthorised promotion of breast screening equipment. Two devices have been removed from the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and another two devices are under investigation. I cannot stress enough to those women who are considering going to these clinics for breast imaging or breast checks: please make sure you understand the effectiveness of these procedures and discuss the issue with your
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        before you go. Do not be fooled by misleading advertising; it won’t save your life! A screening mammogram will.
