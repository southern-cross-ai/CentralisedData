        Last month we welcomed our first grandchild, a boy, and I thank the Senate for that leave of absence. Observing the world that my grandson has been born into, I know he will need to fight the same battle for female equality that his grandparents fought two generations ago. The world has turned full circle, seeking now to limit and erase the concept of biological women, with the perverse argument that this is gender equality. It is not. In 2021 the Senate passed my motion banning the use of anti-woman hate speech, including 'chest feeder' and 'uterus owner'. The Public Service blatantly ignored the Senate's will and kept using hate speech anyway—no surprise.

        The ongoing robodebt royal commission shows how bureaucrats are now a Soviet-style nomenklatura—the self-appointed former Soviet-era elites, self-interested, unaccountable and wilfully ignorant of the cruelty they dispense. Last November bioethicist Anna Smajdor of the University of Oslo proposed in the journal
        <i>
         Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics
        </i>
        to keep women alive who are medically brain dead and use them as baby incubators for women who choose not to carry their own child. Columbian politician Jennifer Pedraza responded: 'Women are not utensils to be thrown away after use. Women have human rights.'
       </p>

        Why do we have to remind the Left that biological women have human rights? This is the second time that university academics have raised this idea. Sick minds in academia are now degrading women from 'uterus owner' to 'uterus custodian'. The

        influencers include 12 biological men, six biological men who are now something else, and only seven biological females—18 to seven. Scotland allowed biological men identifying as women to be housed in women's prisons. Biological women identifying as men were not given the same right. Women have fewer rights today than do men identifying as women.

        will continue working to stop biological women from being erased. We are one community, one nation of two equal genders.
