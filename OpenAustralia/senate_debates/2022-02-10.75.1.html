        Labor's critics of the reinsurance pool don't live in the north, and they don't reflect the lived experience of thousands of people in the north. In the north we pay more for electricity, building materials, flights and insurance. Our premiums are at least 2½ times what people in the south pay, and that's if insurance companies will even look at you. It's especially grim for businesses. Many are forced to self-insure because no insurance companies will give them coverage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition government listened, consulted and acted. The $10 billion reinsurance pool will reduce household premiums by up to 46 per cent, give strata title properties a discount of up to 58 per cent and give small-to-medium enterprises a discount of up to 34 per cent. The Townsville Chamber of Commerce calculated that if just two-thirds of the projected savings were spent in the city annually there would be approximately $220 million in economic output—a contribution of $118 million to gross regional product, over $60 million in income and salaries for local workers, and approximately 949 ongoing full-time jobs created, directly and indirectly, through multiplier effects. These numbers did not include reductions in small business premiums. If they did, we would see even greater benefits.
