         does not include images of a person in an outdoor public place.
        </p>
        <p>
         2 Today we're debating the Enhancing Online Safety (Non-consensual Sharing of Intimate Images) Bill 2017. It's a bill supposed to deal with revenge porn, but it goes beyond that in ways that could slap $100,000 fines on people who are not posting revenge porn, including journalists.
        </p>
        <p>
         My amendments exclude drawings, paintings and sketches from the definition of 'image'. I note that, on page 23, the explanatory memorandum says that the definition of an image includes a drawing. My amendment seeks to exclude these drawings, paintings and sketches so that a $100,000 fine couldn't be slapped on someone for merely posting a drawing, painting or sketch of someone.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
          If I
         </a>
         posted a picture or, indeed, a drawing of President Donald Trump urinating in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Central Park
         </a>
         , I shouldn't face a $100,000 fine.
        </p>
        <p>
         My amendments also exclude certain images taken in outdoor public places from the definition of 'intimate image'. As a result, a $100,000 fine couldn't be slapped on someone for merely posting a picture of someone doing a typically private act in an outdoor public place. For example, if I posted a photo of President Donald Trump urinating in Central Park where no rude bits are showing, I shouldn't face a $100,000 fine.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a further result of my amendment regarding outdoor public places. The bill allows a $100,000 fine to be slapped on someone for posting a picture of someone without religious or cultural attire when that person consistently wears religious attire in public. This is reasonable if the picture was taken when the person was on private property or in a public toilet, but it's not reasonable if the picture was taken of the person in an outdoor public place. My amendment would ensure a $100,000 fine couldn't be slapped on someone for posting a picture of a person out of their usual religious or cultural attire if the person was in an outdoor public place at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, a picture of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_George_Pell" rel="nofollow">
          Cardinal George Pell
         </a>
         without his collar would, potentially, come under this bill. A picture of a nun who wasn't wearing her habit in public would, potentially, offend against this bill. A woman who normally wears a burqa but wasn't wearing a burqa in public and had her picture taken would, potentially, offend against this bill, unless my amendment succeeds.
        </p>
        <p>
         I acknowledge that the bill already attempts to limit the capacity to impose fines by saying they only apply in circumstances in which an ordinary reasonable person could reasonably expect to be afforded privacy, but this is vague. My additional limitation regarding outdoor public places would add some much-needed clarity. I commend my amendments to the Senate.

         <p>
          Senator Leyonhjelm has asked me to look closely at his amendments, which I have done. I can seek to provide some context to this particular part of the legislation. Let me start with the exclusion of a drawing, painting or sketch from a definition of an 'intimate image' that Senator Leyonhjelm is seeking.
         </p>
         <p>
          Under the bill, an intimate image can be a still visual image, such as a photograph, or moving visual images, such as video recordings. Images could be photographs, modified photographs, animations, drawings or other depictions of the person, such as what is known as morph porn, and fake pornographic videos also known as deep fakes. There are exemptions in the bill whereby, if an ordinary reasonable person considered the posting or the sharing of the image acceptable in certain circumstances, it would not be captured by the prohibition. Obviously, we have in mind there things such as satirical drawings or parodies.
         </p>
         <p>
          Moving to Senator Leyonhjelm seeking to exclude 'outdoor public place' in the definition of an intimate image, the definition of 'intimate image' includes depiction of a private activity where material will be an intimate image of a person if it depicts or appears to depict the person in a state of undress, using the toilet, showering, having a bath, engaged in a sexual act of a kind not ordinarily done in public or engaged in other like activity in circumstances in which an ordinary reasonable person would reasonably be expected to be afforded privacy. It wouldn't include a situation where a person is in their swimmers at the beach or showering at the beach.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government remains of the view that the current definition does afford protection in circumstances where they would expect privacy. I certainly appreciate the sentiment and the motivation of Senator Leyonhjelm and, as he requested, we did look closely at his amendments, but the government aren't, at this point, minded to support those amendments. Obviously, legislation of this sort is always kept under review in the light of practical experience and its real-world operation.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
           The Senate
          </a>
          has already determined that there will be a statutory review in three years time, but, in the outworking of legislation, if there appear to be issues before that time, that is naturally something that I'm sure all colleagues would want to examine.

           I want to indicate that Labor will not be supporting the amendment. It doesn't deliver the necessary change required to deliver the real outcomes that we have sought in our legislative recommendations for change in the course of this inquiry. It doesn't deter or practically respond to the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.

              I will include all three examples rather than rise three times. If a woman's normal beach attireâ€”you referred to swimmersâ€”was a burkini, and that woman on one particular occasion was not wearing a burkini at the beach but some other form of swimwear, would that image, if posted, offend against this legislation? Would a picture of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_George_Pell" rel="nofollow">
               Cardinal George Pell
              </a>
              not wearing his collar, his normal religious attire, offend against this legislation? Would a nun who was not wearing her habit but who normally wore her habit was photographed in a public place, would that offend against this legislation?

              <p>
               Thank you, Senator Leyonhjelm. In response to each of those three examples, the answer would be no. But I do just add the caveat that context is important in these matters and it would depend whether there was some other offensive depiction which might trigger this legislation. But, just in the pared-back examples you have given, the answer would be no in each case.

                We do not support these amendments. I would like to remind Senator Leyonhjelm that just because a woman steps into a public space doesn't mean she no longer has a right to privacy and protection. I would think that this is a rather easily understandable point to make and it surprises me that it is lost on the senator in this case. Individuals must have, and can reasonably expect, privacy in various situations where they are in outdoor spaces. An obvious example of a phenomenon that is increasing and quite troubling in this area is upskirting and down-blousing. The highly offensive insinuation, I would argue, behind this amendment, as I have said, is that just because a woman, or any other person, steps out in public, they have given their consent for inappropriate and humiliating images to be taken and shared. Quite frankly, that is a disgusting insinuation to make. We proudly do not support these amendments, and I cannot for the life of me begin to think why such things would be put forward in this place.

                 I rise in defence of Senator Leyonhjelm. I do not take it that Senator Leyonhjelm's proposed amendments are based on the sorts of inferences that Senator Steele-John has made, that Senator Leyonhjelm is in any way a supporter of or wants to see legislative exemptions for the inappropriate depiction of women.
                </p>
                <p>
                 While the government isn't minded to support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments, for the reasons I have outlined, I do not question for one second Senator Leyonhjelm's motivation. Senator Leyonhjelm's seeking to examine legislation, to test it and to ensure that, as well as protections, there aren't liberties that are needlessly infringed. I do feel compelled to reject the insinuations that Senator Steele-John makes in terms of the motivation of Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments. As I said, while we're not minded to support Senator Leyonhjelm's amendments; nevertheless, we do fully appreciate the spirit in which he has moved them.

                   My view would be that a courtroom is not a private place and that individuals should comply with what they are directed to do within a courtroom. I'm sure that that context would be taken into account. Also, courts themselves will have certain rules in relation to what can be photographed and what can be recorded, for that matter, within their confines.

                    This amendment prevents a $100,000 fine from being slapped on a person for posting an image of a child if the child consents to the posting of the image. I point out that a child is anyone under the age of 18. Currently the bill states that a child cannot give consent to the posting of their image, so even if a 17-year-old urged their friend or partner, who may also be 17, to post the image, that friend or partner could face a $100,000 fine under the bill as it stands.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    If the image depicts a child in a sexual pose or sexual act, or with someone in a sexual pose or act, or if the image depicts a child's sexual organs, anal region or a female child's breasts then the image is child pornography. Regardless of the claims a person who posts such an image makes about consent, posting such an image is a criminal offence punishable by up to 15 years imprisonment, a fine of more than $100,000 or both. The only purpose of ruling out consent by a child in this bill is to impose fines upon a person for posting an image of a consenting child that isn't pornographic. It could be a picture of a child picking their nose or eating their earwax, which seems to be a qualification for becoming a leader of the Labor Party.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    I urge senators not to let legitimate concerns about child pornography colour their views about a bill that is not about child pornography. A 17-year-old can consent to the posting of an image of them picking their nose, and the person who does the posting shouldn't face a $100,000 fine for doing so. I commend my amendment to the chamber.

                     I indicate that the government won't be supporting this amendment. Under the bill, consent to share an intimate image cannot be given by a child, who is a person under the age of 18, as Senator Leyonhjelm points out. This is because, to the extent that the definition of intimate image overlaps with the definition of child sexual exploitation material in the Commonwealth
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
                      Criminal Code
                     </a>
                     Act 1995, a lower age of consent for the distribution of intimate images would create an inappropriate inconsistency between the criminal and civil frameworks. The effect of this item is that a person under the age of 18 cannot provide consent to the sharing by another person of an intimate image of themselves, as distribution of this image would effectively constitute distribution of exploitative material. I should also point out that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner will, under this legislation, adopt a graduated approach to enforcing prohibitions: firstly, seeking the non-formal resolution of a complaint; then issuing formal written warnings, infringement notices and so on; and ultimately through to civil penalties, if those are warranted.

                      understand this correctly, you're arguing that because of an inappropriate inconsistency if two friends, both of whom are 17, came to an agreement that they would have a nose-picking contest and would take and post pictures of each other picking their noses, and continued to do so repeatedly, notwithstanding warnings from the eSafety Commissioner, potentially they would be each exposed to $100,000 fines. You're saying that because of inappropriate inconsistency with laws relating to child pornography, you can't do anything to mitigate that rather absurd situation?

                        If normal, reasonable people like you and me, Minister, were eSafety commissioners, perhaps you could imagine that it wouldn't descend to the point where somebody would receive a $100,000 fine. My point is this: what is to stop that from occurring if the eSafety Commissioner were not as normal and reasonable as you and I?

                          We do not support this amendment; although we have some concerns related to the unintended consequences of teenagers engaging in consensual image-sharing activities. Our approach to this issue has been to ensure that under-18s cannot be exposed to harsh civil penalties. We believe that it is of the utmost importance to ensure that children have adequate protection from predators who might seek to exploit their images online.

                              I just want to clarify this; I was preoccupied and am not sure whether I heard your answer correctly. Who will be responsible, subject to a complaint, for the penalty that's imposed in this respect? Senator Leyonhjelm's concern was that a child, a 17-year-old, could be fined $100,000. I'm sympathetic to the point that we accept that children are allowed to make decisions to get into sexual relationships with their peers from the age of 16. Yet we're saying that they're not able to consent to having an intimate imageâ€”which conjures up all sorts of suggestions; however, it's not child pornography, as we've describedâ€”publicly displayed. Further, I question the circumstances such as the

Are they deemed to be intimate pictures, and would someone like Mr Henson be subject to these sorts of penalties?

                                Minister, I'm sorry, maybe you misunderstood my question. Sharing images with third partiesâ€”we're not talking about child pornography; we're talking about intimate images, which conjures up scenarios where people anticipate it's pornography, but I think Senator Leyonhjelm's made the point it's not. So where does it leave the circumstance where you have someone like Mr Henson, who is a photographer who takes photos of prepubescent children in a state of undress? Those children are not eligible or able to give consent to having those photos taken, yet what happens if someone shares those images or puts them on public display? Where is this line drawn? I come back to the other point: how is it that childrenâ€”and this is once again an emotive term, but it's a legal termâ€”minors, are able to have sexual relationships with their peers at the age of 16, and we say they're mature enough, and we're realistic enough to make that assessment, yet they're not able to consent to having their images displayed in a manner of their choosing, in the scenarios which Senator Leyonhjelm has put forward?

                                   I hesitate to put myself in the place of the court and speak to particular works by particular artists, but my understanding is that there is an exemption for artistic works. But, obviously, those artistic works need to be in accord with other legislation.

                                    I just raise the question again: so it's okay for an 'artist'â€”and, for the benefit of Hansard, I put that in quotation marksâ€”to take naked pictures of prepubescent children, but it's not okay for a 17-year-old to say, 'I'm happy for you to publish an image of me that's not a sexual image' to one of their peers? I just find this unusual, and I think that Senator Leyonhjelm makes a valid pointâ€”that we attribute any number of things to young adults, albeit, they are minors. We allow them to choose to smoke cigarettes if that's what they do, by legally allowing them to buy them; we allow them to engage in sexual relations; we have people who are advocating that they be allowed to vote; and yet we're not enabling them to consent to having their image shared in the manner in which they choose to do it. I just find that's not consistent with the approach of this legislation.

                                     I'll just cite part of the bill before us, which states:

                                     (g) an ordinary reasonable person would consider the post acceptable, having regard to the following matters:

                                     All these things would need to be taken into account. I can't really give what would in effect be a ruling, which would be the place of the Federal Court if a matter was brought forward, when it would have regard to the particular matters which I've just cited.

                                         As currently drafted, the bill allows someone who posts an image to be hit with a $100,000 fine if they are ordinarily resident in Australia or if the person depicted is ordinarily resident in Australia. This means an Australian could be hit with a fine when no image of an Australian is depicted, so no Australian is harmed. That is wrong. It is the role of our government to protect Australians from harm, not to make Australians conform with a model of behaviour that is harmless to any other Australians. Posting a picture of President Donald Trump going to the toilet in

                                          Senator Leyonhjelm is correct. Under the bill, if there is an Australian link, such as the perpetrator or the victim being ordinarily resident in Australia, the commissioner will be able to exercise his or her powers, including issuing removal notices to sites hosted in overseas jurisdictions. The proposed amendment would mean that the prohibition would only apply if the person depicted in the image is ordinarily resident in Australia, to my understanding. The effect of the amendment would prevent the commissioner exercising his or her powers if the victim wasn't ordinarily resident in Australia. The government won't be supporting the amendment.

                                           do not support this amendment, as it seeks to prohibit the posting of an intimate image or threatening to post one only if the victim is an Australian resident and to remove the requirement for the perpetrator to be an Australian resident. There are obviously practical limits to the reach of the eSafety Commissioner, and it cannot be within their remit to police the entire internet, across all continents. But such a blunt instrument is unwise in this space.

                                             I would like to clarify the point that Senator Leyonhjelm raised. You are saying that if they are a non-Australian and a photo was taken of them which they are not happy with, they can make a complaint with regard to that photo being taken. Therefore, if it goes through the legal system, would they pay for the court case or would it be the Australian taxpayer?

                                             On the other hand, if they are a foreigner who's taken the photo of an Australian resident and they are charged and fined over it, how are we going to recover that money from them and who pays that cost?

                                              To clarify, the perpetrator or the victim has to be Australian. In terms of who would pay for the enforcement activity, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner has a budget, and within that budget they would, firstly, seek a non-formal resolution of the complaintâ€”if necessary, formal written warnings and infringement notices. Beyond that, matters would go to the Federal Court, who obviously have a budget for their particular activities. In short, the Office of the eSafety Commissioner is provisioned with resources to support the activities outlined in the legislation.

                                               Despite the bill's title, the bill doesn't ban the non-consensual sharing of intimate images; instead, the bill bans the sharing of intimate images and then provides an exception for instances where the depicted person consents. This drafting approach matters because it puts the onus on the person facing the $100,000 fine to prove that the depicted person consented to the image being posted. It would be difficult for either side of a dispute about a posted image to prove consent or the absence of consent. In some cases, there'll be evidence confirming conversations about plans to post the image but in many cases there will be no such evidence.

                                               I refer to my example of the nose-picking contestâ€”if somebody disagrees or disputes that they posted consent. That highlights the difficulties. The difficulties don't justify reversing the well-founded convention that the party seeking to impose a penalty must prove behaviour in the circumstances that would justify such a penalty. My amendment would simply undo the reversal of the onus of proof. I'm hoping the Senate could be clear eyed on this matter, particularly given that revenge porn involves allegations about female perpetrators as well as male perpetrators. I commend the amendments.

                                                Under the bill, consent to share an image must be express, voluntary and informed. The evidential burden of proof that consent was givenâ€”Senator Leyonhjelm was correctâ€”lies with the person who shared the image in any civil penalty proceedings. Again, I emphasise that this doesn't relate to the sharing of images between two people; this relates to the sharing of those with a third party. Given the serious impact that this conduct of sharing beyond the individuals involved has on the victim, the government is of the view that it's appropriate that the alleged perpetrator prove consent to share an image.

                                                 The proposed amendments go towards addressing the concerns raised by the Scrutiny of Bills Committee. However, we do not believe that the civil penalty is akin to the criminal offence, as suggested by the committee. The penalty provisions are expressly classified as civil penalties. As such, there is no consequence in the form of criminal record. The high penalty reflects the serious nature of sharing an intimate image without consent and the harm and distress that that can then cause. Key concerns that we have expressed in the past related to the burden of proof on the complainant under the use of a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence. We do not support placing undue pressure on victims in these cases. The reversal of the burden of proof in this instance allows the commissioner to investigate and determine matters based on evidence that is in the mind of the person around the nature of consent, whether it is expressly given or expressly not given or absent entirely. As such, we do not support these amendments.

The government have indicated that the application of these penalties to people under the age of 18 is not their intention; however, to ensure that this unintended consequence does not arise, we seek to have this limitation enshrined in the legislation.

                                                    Children differ from adults in their physical and psychological development, and their emotional and educational needs. Such differences constitute the basis for the lesser culpability of children in conflict with the law. These and other differences are the reasons for a separate juvenile justice system and require a different treatment for children. The protection of the best interests of the child means, for instance, that the traditional objectives of criminal justice, such as repression/retribution, must give way to rehabilitation and restorative justice objectives in dealing with child offenders. This can be done in concert with attention to effective public safety.

                                                     . The penalties apply to all persons to ensure that there is a strong deterrent to engaging in the sharing of intimate images without consent.

                                                     In practice, as Senator Steele-John alluded to, the eSafety Commissioner will take a very cautious approach in relation to any complaint made against a perpetrator under 18 years of age. The eSafety Commissioner will firstly look to engage with the perpetrator in an informal manner and change behaviour. This informal approach has been successful under the existing cyberbullying regime. The commissioner does have the discretion to use other light-touch remedies, including issuing a formal warning notice. It is expected only light-touch remedies would be required in matters involving a perpetrator under 18 years of age. Strong remedies, including civil penalties, would only be used in exceptional cases, such as for a repeat offender where other remedies have been ineffective.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <p>
                                                     A contravention of the prohibition in the bill and/or a failure to comply with a removal notice triggers a civil penalty order provision contained in the Regulatory Powers Act. If the eSafety Commissioner does decide to apply for a civil penalty order, the court has the discretion as to whether it orders the person to pay the penalty. When determining the appropriate penalty amount, the court must take into account matters including the nature and extent of the contravention; the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered because of the contravention; the circumstances in which the contravention took place; and whether the person has previously been found by a court to have engaged in any similar activity. So I think there are important things to bear in mind in terms of the operation of this legislation.

                                                      I'd like to ask the minister whether he is aware that there is a very, very substantive amount of research in the area of child justice that directly contravenes the idea of the application of criminal or civil penalties to people under the age of 18, due to the physiological reality that the development of a child is not at the same stage as the development of an adult and so it is most appropriate to apply diversionary, rehabilitative and educational approaches in those cases. It is my view that it was never the intention of the government to have this criminal regime apply to children, because I cannot in good conscience imagine that the minister, who is a man of great capacity, could possibly believe that it would in any circumstance be productive or just to apply a penalty of up to $107,000 to a child. So I would ask the minister again: is he comfortable with the possibility created by this legislation of applying such a penalty to children in the face of overwhelming evidence given in many forums, including by commissioners of this government, that such approaches are simply not effective, nor just, in relation to children?

                                                       I should point out that this is not a criminal regime for underage individuals that is being proposed here. This is a civil penalties regime that has application to the whole community. As I indicated before, the intention is that this is something that would be used in the case of repeat offenders, where other remedies have been ineffective. Senator Steele-John is quite right to point out there is a range of alternative remedies and it's appropriate that they are pursued. But, where you have repeat offenders, it is appropriate that we have a civil penalties regime in place. Just because a person is under the age of 18 does not mean that they are necessarily without the capacity to determine right from wrong. We are very much of the view that this is appropriate.

The government is not putting in place, through this legislation, a criminal regime to apply to people below the age of 18. I'm not suggesting that, where there are criminal provisions, they shouldn't apply to people below the age of 18, but I'm just seeking to follow the thread through with Senator Steele-John as to what the implications of his position in relation to the civil penalties regime might be for his stance in relation to criminal penalties amendments that might be moved later.

Would the minister not agree that there are almost, imaginably, no cases in which a person below the age of 18 would be able to feasibly meet a civil penalty of $107,000? In fact, the burden of meeting this penalty would fall upon the child's family or extended family. In that case, wouldn't it simply be better to follow the advice of the Australian Law Council, guided by the views of the

These are serious issues which relate to the community as a whole, with a massive impact on children, both as victims and as perpetrators. This is a complex legislative area and, while I appreciate that the minister is providing us with the opportunity to scrutinise the legislation in this period, it would have been so much easier to answer these questions and produce a piece of legislation as robust, comprehensive and durable as that which is deserved by the victims of this most heinous crime.

                                                         I should point out that the civil penalties are only up to $105,000. As I've indicated before, if there were to be a civil penalty sought by the eSafety Commissioner through the Federal Court then it would be in circumstances where other remedies have been ineffectiveâ€”where there'd been a repeat offenderâ€”and the courts, in determining the appropriate penalty amount, again, have to take into account the nature and extent of the contravention, the nature and extent of any loss or damage suffered, the circumstances of the contravention, and whether the person has previously been found by a court to have engaged in similar conduct. The courts can also determine not to apply a civil penalty. But, again, I emphasise that the eSafety Commissioner would firstly seek a non-formal resolution of the complaint, followed if necessary by a formal written warning, followed if necessary by an infringement notice. They have the option of enforceable undertakings, injunctions and, ultimately, civil penalties. So there are really six layers of the graduated approach that could be taken in these circumstances.

                                                         In terms of consultation, there was extensive public consultation last year. Senator Steele-John is right that this legislation hasn't been referred to a committee of the Senate for inquiry. That is something that sometimes happens, but often it doesn't happen. In this case I surmise that a majority of colleagues were not in favour of a Senate inquiry, given the extensive public consultation that had occurred and the extensive examination that colleagues have already given this legislation.

After listening to the senator's comments with regard to this, I note the Greens speak of people being underage, under adult age, and being children in their development and the way they think and decipher everything. I find this very hypocritical of the Greens, after seeing their policies. They wish to reduce the voting age to 16.

So in one case the Greens say, 'They're underage; they don't have the development or the skills and they should be treated as children,' but on the other hand, in their policies, they're quite happy for someone who is 16 years old to be voting and to have their say. One Nation will not be supporting the Greens in this amendment.

The entry for this bill in that report requests the advice of the minister as to whether the severity of the civil penalties that may be imposed on individuals is such that the penalties may be criminal in nature for the purpose of international human rights law. It also seeks advice from the minister as to the nature of penalties: if the penalties are considered criminal for the purposes of international human rights law; whether they're compatible with criminal process rights, including specific guarantees of the right to a fair trial; and the determination of a criminal charge, such as the presumption of innocence. It also refers to the right not to incriminate one's self, the right not to be tried and punished twice for an offence and a guarantee against retrospective criminal laws and whether any limitations on these rights imposed by the measures are permissible and whether the measures could be amended to accord with criminal process rights.

                                                           Labor appreciates and understands the value in having a strong legal framework in place to strengthen the eSafety Commissioner's ability to resolve matters informally and formally. We support the introduction of a graduated suite of redress mechanisms, to which the minister has added some flesh in his comments this morning. These responses include issuing removal of infringement notices, seeking a civil penalty order from a relevant court, enforceable undertakings or seeking an injunction for contraventions of the civil penalty provisions.

                                                           Labor acknowledges that the Office of the eSafety Commissioner will seek to use established relationships with social media service providers and content hosts to facilitate the taking down images, and, thus, a removal notice or other enforcement action may not be required in every case.
                                                          </p>

                                                           We also understand that the bill affords a number of checks and balances on the impact of the regime on children. Notably, these include affording the eSafety Commissioner discretion around whether an image meets the threshold of being an intimate image and around what responses to use in the event that there is a contravention, taking into account the unique circumstances of each case. These include factors such as the age of the child and the type of image, for example. Only in the most serious of cases, such as repeat offenders, multiple victims or noncompliance by bodies corporate, could the commissioner seek a civil penalty order in the Federal Circuit Court or the Federal Court, where the perpetrators might be fined up to 500 penalty units, which equates up to $105,000 for an individual and up to five times that amount, $525,000, for bodies corporate.

                                                           The need to obtain civil penalty orders in a court of law acts as a check on the potential imposition of civil penalties on child offenders. Labor understands that the application of a financial penalty on a minor would be a response of last resort for the repeat offender who has not responded to other redress mechanisms.

                                                            First of all, I'd like to respond to the ridiculous suggestion made by Senator Hanson of a similarity between my position on this issue and the Greens' general position in relation to the lowering of the voting age, of which I am a proud and long-term supporter. I would say to you very directly, Senator Hanson, through the chair, that having a say in your own future is not the same as being placed in a situation where you may have your future destroyed. There is such a blindingly clear difference between these two issues that I am, quite frankly, stunned by your inability to see the difference.
                                                           </p>
                                                           <p>
                                                            I now turn to the question of these amendments and the heart of the issue that they go to. I want to put this very clearly for everybody in this chamber: as currently written, the civil penalties regime outlined within this legislation, which could potentially place somebody at the risk of a fine of up to $107,000, is currently applicable to any person over the age of 10. I do not believe, absent of the political context, that any person present in this chamber would believe that a 10-year-old should come within the same galactic distance of a civil penalty of any shape or form. Any expert, or any person in this place who had taken the time to consult an expert or given the opportunity for this legislation to be consulted on and considered by expertsâ€”as is the job of this chamberâ€”would have found a resounding suggestion that the clarification within these amendments be enshrined in the law. There can be no benefit to applying a civil penalty to a 10-year-old, regardless of the situation. I ask the minister once again: is he comfortable with the idea of implementing a civil penalty regime that would apply to 10-year-old Australians?

I can tell you now that, had either side of this chamber decided to refer this bill to a committee, the Law Council of Australia would have given the feedback that there are not appropriate diversionary pathways within this legislation.

It is a graduated regime. There's no suggestion that civil penalties are a first resort. As I said before, I have confidence in the Office of the eSafety Commissioner and the Federal Court.

This was an issue raised within the small time of scrutiny that was given by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. It was noted as one of their concerns. This allows the delegation of administrative powers to a relatively large class of persons with little or no specificity to their qualifications or attributes. The committee also noted that the explanatory memorandum provides no explanation for the broad delegation of power to issue infringements. Can the minister please justify, in relation to this amendment, the reality that this broad delegation of power gives to any employee of ACMA the ability to issue an infringement notice to a child as young as 10.

This arrangement would permit the commissioner to authorise appropriate staff to be infringement officers.

What he has just outlined is the fact that the power to issue these infringement notices can be delegated to those with absolutely no qualifications in the space. You've just expressed that, in practice, you believe it would be best if the commissioner were to delegate those notices and the issues of those notices to those with the appropriate qualifications and that those be senior officers. Again I ask the minister: if that's your aspiration for how this process would work, why not clearly state that within the legislation?

Firstly, the amendment moved is a departure from the bill's intent, which is to introduce a civil penalties regime as opposed to amending the
                                                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">

                                                                          </a>

Existing criminal lawsâ€”Commonwealth criminal laws, I should point outâ€”do comprehensively criminalise the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. It is an offence to use the internet, social media or a mobile phone to menace, harass or cause offence. There have been a number of successful prosecutions for the non-consensual sharing of intimate images under this offence. There are also extensive child abuse material offences which apply to the sharing of intimate images of children.
                                                                         </p>

                                                                          Broadly framed provisions of general application are generally preferred for Commonwealth offences. Broad provisions can be used to prosecute a range of criminal behaviours and avoid issues such as technical distinctions, loopholes and difficulties with prosecution that are associated with having similar provisions of slightly different operation against Commonwealth law.
                                                                         </p>

                                                                          The focus of this bill is the creation of a civil penalty process to provide victims with an alternative avenue for redress without requiring victims to go through the criminal justice system, if that is what they choose. Extensive public consultation during the development of the civil penalty regime confirmed that assistance taking down images is a key priority for victims. I should also point out that, to ensure a nationally consistent criminal framework to protect victims, the Australian government led the development of a national statement of principles relating to the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. The principles are working to ensure a consistent approach by states and territories to criminalise the non-consensual sharing of intimate images. They also ensure a consistent response and outcome for victims and perpetrators, no matter where they are located.
                                                                         </p>

As I say, we do have some existing criminal provisions at Commonwealth level, and at state and territory level there are also criminal provisions, and there are efforts underway to harmonise those. In this area, there is no single response that can satisfy the need. There needs to be a wide-ranging approach with a number of elements. Criminal provisions are important. Seeking to educate people is important. Non-formal resolution is important. What we're seeking to do through this legislation is to provide an avenue for resolution and an avenue for redress through a graduated civil penalties regime that is not currently in place. I just thought that context might be helpful for colleagues.

Legislation should be developed that includes strong penalties for adults who do so. Labor actually went to the last federal election, in the year 2016, promising Commonwealth legislation to criminalise what we're talking about here todayâ€”to criminalise what was then called 'revenge porn' but within this legislation is called 'non-consensual sharing of images'. We promised to do that within the first 100 days of being elected because we sensed the urgency of this matter, and we sensed that the urgency that exists about action on this matter to criminalise this sort of conduct is shared by the Australian people.

It's all well and good for the minister to say that criminal priorities are important, but this is the action, or lack of action, that we've seen.

It's clear, in our view, that what is proposed in this bill by the government doesn't go far enough. The non-consensual sharing of intimate images is exploitative, is humiliating and is a very damaging form of abuse, and it needs to be treated as such.

Labor has been the proponent of this and has approached it in a very measured way based on our extensive work behind our own private member's bill, which the government refused to bring on. This was a 2016 election policy, and Labor will take it to the next election, if we don't see action from this government. The Xenophon party has adopted Labor's position. Indeed, they have adopted the very words of Labor's private member's bill as their own. Labor's clear and longstanding position has been that the non-consensual sharing of intimate images should be made a criminal offence. We thank the Xenophon team for moving these amendments.

While Labor supports the introduction of a civil penalties regime as a step in the right direction, the government's bill doesn't go far enough. Labor supports the introduction of a civil penalties regime. However, we do not oppose this amendment given it's, effectively, our own bill. Labor didn't move the amendment itself, because we didn't want to risk the government packing up its bags and packing up its bat and ball and going home, if this amendment gets up in the Senate. It's important to note that the government has indicated that, potentially, it'll pull the civil penalties bill from the program, if this amendment is carried. That's of great concern. We urge the government to give the four-out-of-five Australians who want criminalisation what they want by letting this bill continue its progress through the parliament, whether or not this amendment succeeds in the Senate.

                                                                             </p>

For those reasons, and because of the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council process, we're not intending to support the amendment moved by Senator Griff. If the amendment moved by Senator Griff is successful in the Senate, it may well be the case, after the transmission of this bill to the House, that it comes back to the Senate again in an amended form from the other place. If that were to occur, I would hope that colleagues at that point would not allow the disagreement over the Stirling Griff amendment to delay the passage of the civil penalties regime into law.

I say to him that that is a ball firmly within his court. Amended, as suggested by NXT, this legislation addresses the very profound nature in which the different criminal and civil penalty regimes of the states differ. That is critical in addressing this problem. I don't know whether the minister has had the opportunity to review the information given to a current Senate inquiry into the issue of cyberbullying, of which this is an oft talked about aspect, but it was very clear to all of those who participated that variations in state legislation pose significant challenges to victims when seeking recourse in this way.

In our roles as representatives in this place we have heard on many occasions from victims of these horrific crimes. We have also heard from these individuals that there is a culture in this nation which does not lend itself to the taking of these issues seriously; in fact somebody remarked to me last week that, in relation to the issue of cyberbullyingâ€”particularly as it pertains to predatory trolling and the rather violently inclined abuse of our female journalists who work in this place every dayâ€”our cultural attitude, our implementation of law and the understanding which our community, law enforcement and employers have is akin to where the conversation with regard to domestic violence was 30 years ago.

A cultural change is needed in this nation. We must now turn towards treating these crimes with the seriousness they deserve. This parliament, by passing this legislation as amended, has the opportunity now to send a very clear message. I urge the government to join us in sending that message and, should the bill return amended from the other place, to support it once again. I urge the minister to utilise his charisma and influence within his party roomâ€”not inconsiderable, I'm sureâ€”to convince his colleagues of the need to pass this legislation.

This is not something which should have been brought on in a political context happening elsewhere. This is not something which should have been dealt with in the fifth year of this government or any government. It should have been something that was dealt with thoroughly, calmly and fastidiously in the first moments of a government's life. But, here we are; this is what we have been given. This is the opportunity before us to make change and to send a message. We support these amendments and I would urge you, as a colleague and as a man who I believe is in possession of profound intellect, to support these amendments as well. I commend them to the House.

I'm very mindful of the recent social media campaigns, the #MeToo campaign, which put in a public place the level of embedded abuse that is part of the cultural practices of our time. I think it goes to some of the points that Senator Steele-John has just made. The reality is that here today in this chamber, with no further delay, with no more weasel words, the government could take a position to criminalise the sharing of intimate images against someone's will. That's it. It's not like it's a big risk for the government to do this. Four out of five Australians are saying, 'Good on you, you should do it.' We know that Australians want this. We all should know, if we're paying attention to the cultural practices of our time, that a criminal regime is what is called for and what is needed. But still we have these weasel words, still we have this delay, still we have this very passive description of the current structures being adequate. In our view they certainly are not. I have a couple of questions for the minister directly. To what extent, Minister, do you believe a civil penalty scheme will assist the eSafety Commissioner in prosecuting rogue operators, including overseas operators?

When it comes to overseas operators or hosts, I guess, of offending material, the eSafety Commissioner works through a number of global law enforcement networks and also social media networks to endeavour to have offending material taken down. As with all online matters, we always have the challenge that the Australian jurisdiction does not extend beyond the borders of Australia, but this will be further strength to the arm of the eSafety Commissioner.
                                                                                </p>

There already has been the criminalisation of that. Under the Commonwealth

Also, I have referred to some of the existing state laws that have criminalised this conduct and some of the laws that are in prospect. So, we do have criminal offences.
                                                                                </p>

Delay to the passage of this legislation will be delaying something that does not currently exist, and that is a civil penalties regime. A civil penalties regime will benefit victims practically immediately.
                                                                                </p>

I would encourage colleagues to support the passage of legislation which is intended to set up a civil penalties regime and not to have it tied to other debates.

We acknowledge that not everybody will want to pursue the criminal proceedings and some of them would actually prefer to work with the eSafety Commissioner, and a civil regime is okay in that context, but, at the moment, the choice for people to actually prosecute through criminal courts is simply not available to so many Australians. There needs to be a deterrent. Everybody understands this. At least four out of five Australians are saying there needs to be a deterrent. This is sufficiently unpleasant behaviourâ€”this is sufficiently criminal behaviourâ€”that it warrants the

                                                                                 </p>

But, for those overseas rogue players whose business is in fact providing a platform for the sharing of images to which people have not consented, there needs to be some deterrent here at home to stop people from doing that. Criminalising it will provide that deterrent, Minister.
                                                                                 </p>

If a question is posed to someone, 'Do you think there should be criminal provisions?' they will say yes. And there are criminal provisions. If a question is put to someone with the implication that there aren't currently criminal provisions, then I understand that people would say, 'Yes, there should be.' And there are criminal provisions at the Commonwealth level. There are criminal provisions in most jurisdictions, and those that don't have them are looking to put them in specifically in relation to this matter.

I've said that civil provisions complement criminal provisions. We do have criminal provisions at the moment. What we don't have at the moment is a civil penalties regime, and that's what this legislation seeks to put in place.

The answer to that is that, at present, the criminal regime is one that would be pursued by the

We don't have an extraterritorial capacity in relation to these matters, and that's where cooperation with partner organisations overseas is extremely important.

My point is that what is before us is legislation to establish a civil penalties regime, that we should have this legislation passed in its current form and that there are other processes and opportunities to examine the criminal law. At the moment, the prime vehicle for that is the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council.

As I say, there are existing criminal provisions at the Commonwealth and state levels. As I said before, I have never suggested that they are set in stone or that it's not appropriate to examine those. That is something that is happening through the Law, Crime and Community Safety Council and the national statement of principles relating to the criminalisation of the non-consensual sharing of intimate images.

So I can't quite understandâ€”and maybe the minister can elaborate for the chamberâ€”why he continues to assert that there are criminal penalties which protect Australians when 4.6 million Australians are currently without criminal recourse due to the fact that the state of Queenslandâ€”which is a state of Australia, as noted in the digestâ€”is without a criminal regime. I would like to ask the minister, given his understanding of the underlying issues, why he does not believe that we should take this opportunity to extend a criminal source of redress to the people of Queensland.
