          On the amendment moved by Senator Ruston, the government is aware that there is majority support in this chamber for an inquiry referral to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
           Social Security
          </a>
          Administration Amendment (Income Management Reform) Bill 2023 to report on 6 June 2023. We believe that this date will put the timely passage of this important legislation at risk.
         </p>
         <p>
          We know from previous inquiries that the BasicsCard is out of date and not sufficient to meet the needs of people in community. Our bill directly responds to the clear message given to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senate" rel="nofollow">
           Senate
          </a>
          Community Affairs Legislation committee inquiry into the cashless debit card last year—importantly, giving income management participants more choice. The bill provides the choice of a better product with modern technology and it does so at a cheaper cost than the previous cashless debit card. To prolong the date of an inquiry we deny more than 24,400 existing income management participants with a choice to access a contemporary and improved card as soon as practicable, and it will keep them on the BasicsCard technology, which is out of date and limits participants' options on where they can shop.
         </p>
         <p>
          We would prefer an earlier reporting date, but we accept the view of the Senate that the committee report on 6 June 2023. We wanted to record our concern about the delay in the passage of this bill.

            I hope that senators can give consideration for a slightly shorter reporting date for this inquiry. While we accept

            </a>
            support for a reporting date one week earlier than was originally discussed, to have this report tabled by 13 June, we believe this date still provides some risk that there will be delays to the passage of this legislation and the honouring of the commitments we've made to Pacific countries, and it could delay opportunities for this visa class to address the worker shortages in Australia. Again, I just want to record that, and I hope that we can get Senate support for a reporting date of 13 June.

The industry needs certainty on these matters, and one of the matters has been sitting around since 2016. We don't believe there's a need for a protracted inquiry for what has already been consulted on extensively.
