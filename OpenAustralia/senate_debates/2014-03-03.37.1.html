        My question is to the Assistant Minister for Health, Senator Nash. Why did the minister advise the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee last Wednesday that her chief of staff had resigned as a director upon commencing his employment when ASIC records show that he remained a director of the lobbying company until 13 February 2014—five months after he started in the minister's office?

         As I did indeed indicate to the Senate estimates committee last week, I was advised by my former chief of staff that he had instructed his accountants to remove him from all directorships. He was removed from the

          , I ask a supplementary question. Why did the minister claim her chief of staff had resigned as a director when he had not? Does the minister still maintain that having a chief of staff who was a director and 50 per cent shareholder of a lobbying company with industry clients who operate in her area of ministerial responsibilities is not a conflict of interest?

             As I have informed the Senate on a number of occasions to date, I was advised by my former chief of staff that he had directed his accountants to remove him from all directorships. I have also outlined to the Senate on several occasions the undertakings that were required of my former chief of staff to ensure that there was a strict separation so that there could be no real or perceived conflict of interest.

              , I ask a further supplementary question. Will the minister table the letter that she claims her chief of staff wrote to her at the commencement of his employment outlining measures to deal with the many conflicts of interest between his business affairs and his responsibilities as a ministerial chief of staff?
