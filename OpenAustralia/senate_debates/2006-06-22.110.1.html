         Introduction
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In Australia, one in three men and one in four women will be directly affected by cancer before the age of 75 years. Each year, around 460,000 people are diagnosed with cancer. Approximately 374,000 of these cancers are less threatening types of skin cancer – namely non-melanocytic skin cancer. For other types of cancer, over 88,000 people will be diagnosed and approximately 36,000 people will die per year.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Through Medicare, the Australian Government takes a leading role to provide universal and affordable access to primary care providers, including medical practitioners, and to a range of specialist and diagnostic services. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        provides subsidised access to pharmaceuticals. The Australian Government also contributes funding to the public hospitals through the Australian Health Care Agreements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As outlined in the 2005-06 Federal Budget, the Australian Government has moved to further reduce the burden of cancer by allocating an additional $189.4 million over the five years to 2008-09 for the Strengthening Cancer Care Initiative. This initiative ensures better coordination of our national cancer effort, more research funding for cancer care, enhanced cancer prevention and screening programs, better support and treatment for those living with cancer and those needing palliative care, and better support for the professionals who care for cancer patients.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A key element of the Strengthening Cancer Care initiative is the establishment of a national cancer agency to be called, Cancer Australia. The new agency will provide important strategic leadership by bringing together key cancer organisations. It will also be responsible for examining a number of recommendations outlined in this report. More specifically the new agency will:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         Provide national leadership in cancer control;
        </li>
        <li>
         Guide improvements to cancer prevention and care, to ensure treatment is scientifically based;
        </li>
        <li>
         Coordinate and liaise between the wide range of groups and providers with an interest in cancer;
        </li>
        <li>
         Make recommendations to the Australian Government about cancer policy and priorities; and
        </li>
        <li>
         Oversee a dedicated budget for research into cancer.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p class="italic">
        Cancer organisations have shown strong support for an organisation which will increase collaboration and reduce duplication.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Recommendation 1

        <b>
         Recommendation 2
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia, in conjunction with State and Territory Governments, develop appropriate referral pathways for the optimal management of all cancers for all Australians regardless of where they live.
       </p>

        The Australian Government will ask Cancer Australia to examine appropriate cancer referral pathways, with particular consideration being given to difficulties confronted by adolescents with cancer.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that Cancer Australia in its role of providing national leadership and to foster improvements in the integration of networked cancer services, play a primary role in facilitating the sharing of information about Commonwealth and State and Territory Government cancer initiatives to improve treatment services.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the integration of networked cancer services is a matter for State and Territory Governments.

        The Committee recommends that the curriculum for medical professionals at the undergraduate and postgraduate levels include enhanced communication skills training and that professional Colleges also undertake a more active role in the provision of such training for their members. This training could be based on the National Breast Cancer Centre’s communication skills training workshops that have been developed to improve the awareness and capacity of health professionals to communicate effectively with women with cancer.

         ACT
        </a>
        Health, will consider the impact of current funding arrangements on the effectiveness of cancer treatment, efficiency of resource allocation and access to best practice. This will involve consultations with the private sector, given that private health insurance arrangements function differently to the Australian Health Care Agreements.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Based on the results of this study, the Group will make recommendations about specific alternative funding arrangements and implementation options to improve access to coordinated best practice treatment for cancer.

         Recommendation 9
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee recommends that Department of Health and Ageing, in consultation with Cancer Australia, enhance the current Medicare Benefits Schedule (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MBS" rel="nofollow">
         MBS
        </a>
        ) arrangements for relevant specialists and general practitioners to support participation in multidisciplinary care meetings in both hospitals and the community.

        <b>
         Australian Government Response
        </b>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Medicare Benefits Schedule has a number of items that support multidisciplinary care. These include chronic disease management care planning items for general practitioners and case conferencing items that are available to physicians, psychiatrists and general practitioners. These items provide for both the organisation of and participation in case conferences by medical practitioners involved in the care of patients with chronic diseases, including cancer. They support participation by these practitioners in multidisciplinary care meetings in both hospitals and the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A new Medicare item specifically for multidisciplinary cancer case conferencing will be introduced from 1 November 2006. This will cover participation by treating doctors, including specialists and general practitioners, in a case conference of a multidisciplinary team, for the purpose of cancer care planning on their hospital or community patient.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The recommendations of the National Demonstration Project of Multidisciplinary Care for Breast Cancer indicated that the cooperation of hospitals or health service is crucial for the success of regular multidisciplinary team meetings. While the MBS is able to fund the attendance of medical practitioners at case conferences, it is beyond the scope of the MBS to provide the infrastructure or to ensure the active cooperation of hospitals and health services.

        The Committee recommends that five multidisciplinary cancer centre demonstration projects be set up in consultation with consumer groups and be funded over three years in different part of Australia. At least one demonstration project should be in the private sector. Within these multidisciplinary centres different models of psychosocial support, incorporating a range of complementary therapies and taking into account the cultural needs of patients, should be assessed. The assessment of all aspects of the demonstration projects should be scientifically based and involve consumer representatives in the process.
