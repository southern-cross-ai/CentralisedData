       <p>
        I want to, first of all, thank the Labor senators who made a contribution to the debate on the National Disability Insurance Scheme Amendment (Streamlined Governance) Bill 2019, because it outlined the extraordinary amount of frustration and stress that has been felt by participants and all their carers and families. We heard speaker after speaker talk about the issues around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        , the concerns around the NDIS and the fact that the NDIS is not working as intended.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this government's watch, we have seen a litany of failures to deliver for people with disability—the participants of the NDIS. Yesterday, we heard stories about delays in receiving access to the NDIS. We heard stories about delays in receiving services and supports under the NDIS. What is quite stark is this government's inability to actually address these concerns. These are obviously not concerns that have just arisen; there are stories after stories of families that have been told to senators and members across this parliament. Each senator in this chamber, I'm sure, would have received representations from participants and their families. They would have received letters, emails and phone calls, all seeking help to resolve longstanding issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just last week I had a family that have a 2½-year-old son who has been trying to get access to a planning meeting for a year. This is a child who is 2½. When they saw the light at the end of the tunnel—they finally got an appointment with the planner—they then got a phone call, a message left on the answering machine, to say they'd have to cancel. Three days out from the actual planning date they had to cancel that meeting. You can imagine what that family felt like. A year has passed and they're trying to seek supports and services for the child. They reached out to my office. We spoke to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        and there was another meeting scheduled, but that shouldn't be happening.
       </p>
       <p>
        These lengthy delays should not be happening. There are delays that we hear about in terms of equipment for people. Sometimes that equipment arrives too late and the person has passed away. This is not what the NDIS is about. The NDIS is a scheme that was meant to enable participants to live a normal life, to be able to participate in the community and the workforce just as everyone else would be able to. That is not what is happening. We have family after family ringing in tears because they can't get the services or, even worse, they've heard that their child is not disabled enough. These are the comments that are coming from planners to families. Of course, we all know that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
         Administrative Appeals Tribunal
        </a>
        workload in terms of NDIS appeals has skyrocketed. This shouldn't be happening.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to demonstrate to the minister and the government exactly what is happening in my home state of Tasmania. Satisfaction with the NDIS has dramatically dropped. It has fallen by 30 per cent. I say this to Senator Patrick in particular: satisfaction with the NDIS in Tasmania has fallen 30 per cent in 12 months. These figures from the NDIS website—these are not figures I just plucked from the air—show that, in June 2018, 97 per cent of participants described their satisfaction with the agency planning process as good or very good. Twelve months later, in June 2019, that satisfaction rate collapsed by 30 per cent to 67 per cent. Extraordinary! What is occurring in Tasmania, where you have such a dramatic collapse in satisfaction?
       </p>
       <p>
        Even government senators should be able to acknowledge that this is an extraordinary collapse in satisfaction.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time that we saw this collapse of satisfaction in Tasmania, Tasmania was merged with Victoria—in July 2018. So it's no wonder satisfaction has plummeted. As I understand it, Tasmania no longer has a dedicated NDIS general manager but is managed from Victoria. Problems with the merger were even outlined by the Tasmanian Liberal government submission. What they had to say was: 'The Tasmanian government has observed differences in Tasmania's capacity to resolve issues quickly at a local operational level since the NDIA restructure merging Tasmania and Victoria in July 2018. This restructure saw the loss of the regional manager position in Tasmania.' Why was management for Tasmania merged with Victoria? Why has Tasmania been downgraded? These are the answers that we are seeking.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have Mr Shorten, the shadow minister, who has reported and spoken about the issues that he has seen as he's travelled around Australia hearing the horror stories about this vital scheme being suffocated as a result of the neglect of this government. In Tasmania, there are widespread issues relating to disability transport funding and to the availability of NDIS approved allied health professionals. We have a collapse in support in Tasmania. We even have, as I've said, the Tasmanian government talking about the differences that they have observed since the restructure and the merging of Tasmania with Victoria in July 2018. So there are a number of questions that I would like the minister to respond to, because Tasmanians would like to know the answers to these questions. Why has this happened? Certainly, it sounds to me like the Tasmanian Liberal government are not happy about it either. Could the minister respond to those questions, because yesterday the minister's summing up was quite quick. In fact, I think I blinked and missed it. It was a shame because there were so many stories and questions that this side of the chamber put forward that were not responded to. You just cannot dismiss these stories; you cannot dismiss participants and families and carers of participants by just doing a one-minute summing up and then sitting down. You just can't treat people like that.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's move to some of the issues that were raised about the bill itself. Universally, the disability advocates are seeking to have this bill delayed. That's what they've asked for, and, of course, not unsurprisingly, this government ignored that call. I want to go to a couple of the submissions that were put forward to the inquiry that was held by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee in September. People with Disability Australia, PWDA, for those people listening, is a leading disability rights advocacy and representative organisation of and for all people with disability. They are a national cross-disability organisation which represents the interests of people with all kinds of disability. They are a non-profit, non-government organisation and they do tremendous work, which I'm sure the minister would agree. Their recommendation in their submission to this bill was that they believe:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the disability sector would benefit from more time to consider any the Bill and any unintended consequences.
       </p>
       <p>
        They noted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … that the Explanatory Memorandum or the Second Reading Speech provide limited analysis of the possible impacts—
       </p>
       <p>
        that they've referred to in their submission.
       </p>
       <p>
        They go on to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … recommend that the proposed changes in this Bill are deferred and considered within the upcoming Tune Review of the NDIS Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is odd that this bill is coming here today and has been introduced by the government when we have the Tune review currently looking into the NDIS Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also have a submission, again by an organisation, Young People in Nursing Homes National Alliance. The alliance, people will know, is a national peak organisation dedicated to resolving the issue of younger people with disability living in residential aged-care facilities and those at risk of aged-care placement.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_I" rel="nofollow">
         If I
        </a>
        have time in a separate contribution, I will outline a number of the issues that they've raised in their submission. But they too have asked that the bill not proceed at this time, so why is the government refusing to listen to advocates? Why are they refusing to listen to the advocacy disability organisations and proceeding with this bill? I'd like to know that as a start from the minister, if she could respond.

              . I have a number of questions to put to the minister in relation to both the amendment and the bill in its totality. I'm seeking your guidance as to when best to make the contributions, both to this amendment but also to the bill generally, for I, like Senator Brown, would like to get a bit more detail on the government's legislation here.
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              The CHAIR: What the minister has done is move the government's amendments. There are still other amendments there, and the debate hasn't been closed down. No-one wanted the call, so I'm obligated to put the motion that the minister has moved. That's where we are: the minister has moved that first amendment, but it doesn't shut down debate, because we're still in committee of the whole.
             </p>
             <p>
              Thank you, Chair. I do apologise, but when Senator Brown finished I did attempt to get the call. I might have missed your line of sight.

              The CHAIR: My apologies. As you all know, the minister is not required to answer questions. It's entirely up to the minister as to what statements or questions she answers. The minister wants to make some explanatory remarks now around the amendment that she has moved, so we'll go to the minister and then to you, Senator Steele-John.

               Just in clarification, Senator Steele-John, of course I stand prepared to respond to all the questions that I'm sure you're going to ask more generally. I just sought to move this along by moving these amendments and then, of course, I'll be very pleased to enter into a debate.
              </p>
              <p>
               The amendments that I have just moved are particularly specific. They relate to the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                Royal Commission
               </a>
               into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability on the basis that it is highly likely that the royal commission will request a range of data and information, including information that may well be protected. We believe that both the

                NDIA

                CEO
               </a>
               and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                NDIS
               </a>
               commissioner need to be in a position where they are able to provide, if they're required to provide, the royal commission with access to the information it needs to fully inform itself in relation to any information that is put before it.
              </p>
              <p>
               Currently, the confidentiality provisions that are provided in the NDIS Act allow for the sharing of information, including protected information, but it is actually subject to the agreement of the head of the agency. We believe, given the importance of the royal commission in terms of its findings and ensuring that it has the capacity to undertake its deliberations and investigations uninhibited, that it is appropriate that the NDIA CEO and the NDIS commissioner be required to provide that protected information in response to a summons or a notice issued under the Royal Commission Act rather than it being subject to a decision.
              </p>
              <p>
               So the proposed amendment to the NDIS Act clarifies those requirements for these agency heads to produce documents and information that include protected information, despite those provisions which currently exist within the act. We believe that this approach will increase confidence in the operation of the royal commission by ensuring that it has all the information that it requires to do its job.

               <p>
                Before commenting on the nature of the amendment put forward by the government, I have a series of questions to put to the minister about the bill in its generality. In doing that, I think it may benefit the chamber to contextualise my line of inquiry generally.
               </p>
               <p>
                As the minister would be aware, the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                 NDIS
                </a>
                is rightly described, if you like, as a significant social services reform. It is often likened to the most significant reform to our social services system since Medicare. One of the critical elements of the reform is a shift in the responsibility in relation to disability policy from what was previously described, in the 2010
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                 Productivity Commission
                </a>
                report, as a kind of state based postcode lottery to a policy which is intended to be marked by a broad national system which enables a continuity of services and supports, regardless of where an individual lives in Australia.
               </p>
               <p>
                It has not been a seamless transition between state and federal responsibility in this space, and one of the particular challenges has been the sharing of data between state and federal governments. Another challenge has been cultural, which is to say that states finding themselves under the NDIS framework have taken different responses in terms of what role they subsequently play in the funding of disability supports, particularly around disability advocacy services, resulting in many instances in gaps between funding cycles but also in what has been termed legislative or procedural or administrative gaps, through which certain disabled individuals, particularly those journeying with psychosocial disability, have fallen. It's resulted in a lot of distress and often a lot of harm to individuals, and it has been characterised by both state and federal government confusion and at times—particularly in Victoria—by a multilayered confusion, culturally, in relation to local government, where some services are provided through different local government frameworks.
               </p>
               <p>
                In some areas, progress has been made after continued and very diligent advocacy on behalf of disabled people, their families, their supporters and their funded organisations, which sometimes perform their roles in a context where they are also losing funding. We've seen some successes around the alignment of the health system in different state and territory jurisdictions with what the NDIS will provide so that, for instance, disabled people entering the health system don't end up in the middle of a bureaucratic stand-off between state, territory and federal governments, who haven't in the past been able to make up their mind as to who should most rightly and fittingly cover individual participants at different times.
               </p>
               <p>
                I'm aware that these are issues that have been raised with the minister and with previous social services ministers, and they have no doubt made their way into the briefing pack that the minister was handed when he took up his position. What strikes me—and what has struck many other advocacy organisations that I've worked with on this issue—is that, when it comes to the question of public service function and Commonwealth, state or local government responsibility as defined by various pieces of state and territory legislation, process is important but culture is often king. To set culture there is a need for a clear view, on behalf of the Commonwealth, as to the end point we are seeking to achieve. Before you can change the culture of an organisation you've got to understand where you are and where you want to be, and I must say that it isn't a totally one-sided argument.
               </p>
               <p>
                I think since the inception of the NDIS there's been confusion on behalf of state and territory and federal government levels as to who was now going to take leadership in a certain areas. And those questions—some of them created by unfortunate vagaries within the relevant NDIS implementing legislation—have not been helped by a desire, on behalf of those levels of government, to make sure that they don't end up footing the bill. It speaks to, I think, the unfortunate reality that, when we think about disability in Australia, when we think about the potential roles that we all collectively play in removing the barriers that disabled people face, we often bring it back to questions of dollars and cents and a desperate urge, on behalf of all levels of government, not to be left with what they see as an expensive impost on themselves.
               </p>
               <p>
                There are examples where this has been overcome at the state level. I think in some ways states like Victoria have done a better job than others in managing that cultural shift and have recognised pretty early on that, although the Commonwealth now takes responsibility for certain aspects of disability funding for disability support services, there is still a vital role to play at their level of government in making sure that they do what they can to break those barriers down.
               </p>
               <p>
                On the other side of that ledger, we have seen
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                 New South Wales
                </a>
                has a lot of challenges. I have worked a lot with Senator Brown on the question of disability advocacy funding in New South Wales, which has been a disaster under the Liberal government, with different ministers wishing to push it all off onto the Commonwealth without understanding the types of advocacy that the states and territories and federal government are now obliged and, in fact, eligible to fund.
               </p>
               <p>
                In Tasmania we've also seen a similar kind of 'get out as quick as we can' mentality. 'It's the Commonwealth's job now, folks. We can finally get these very expensive disabled people off our ledger.' Of course, that's completely the wrong way to think about it, because, when we make modifications to our society in relation to making it more accessible for disabled people, making it more inclusive to disabled people, we, of course, increase accessibility and inclusion for all of our society. And that's clear when we talk about funding disability advocacy, which often a disabled person might be eligible for at the same time as they are also a person of colour or somebody journeying with issues of poverty. And so supporting advocacy for a disabled person is also helping somebody who's financially struggling make it through their tough time that they're in.
               </p>
               <p>
                So I would like to ask the minister to outline for me how the minister and the relevant Minister Robert view this question of responsibility. How does the government go about articulating the role that is played by local, state and federal governments in relation to the funding of disability services and supports, as covered by the NDIS, and advocacy funding and supports that are also, in other ways, funded by the NDIS?
               </p>
               <p>
                Just to be really clear, I'm asking: what kind of cultural leadership role does the Commonwealth play in talking about the issues of co-responsibility, or does the government take a view that the Commonwealth should be solely responsible for these areas? I would be very grateful if the minister could outline the government's position on this first question.

                 Thank you very much, Senator Steele-John.

                 acknowledge upfront that this is a very, very major reform and, like all things that are as major and complex as this one, there are always challenges in the introduction and challenges built on the fact that it's a multijurisdictional reform. You raised the question in relation to those different jurisdictions. In relation to participants in the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                  NDIS
                 </a>
                 and those people who are eligible under the NDIS, the act itself and regulations obviously prescribe how they interface with the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
                  NDIA
                 </a>
                 and all of the activities. But you do raise a very good point in relation to the many people in our community who live with disability and who do not come under the NDIS but equally require assistance in their lives to ensure that they have the capacity to live the best possible life they can through the provision of various supports.
                </p>
                <p>
                 As has always been the case, the states and territories are responsible to ensure that they provide the level of support for people with disability, and, whilst the Commonwealth doesn't have a day-to-day, hands-on approach to that, we certainly take a very keen interest. With the new NDIS activities, it increases our level of desire to have an overarching influence to ensure that nobody falls between the gaps in the rollout of this major reform. To that end, Senator Steele-John, I will be in your home state of

                 in a few weeks time. I'll be addressing the Disability Reform Council, which, as you would be aware, is the council of ministers who have responsibility in their various jurisdictions for disability. The No. 1 agenda item that I have for that particular council will relate to the consultation and the process involved in developing the new National Disability Strategy, which takes into account many of the issues that you raised in your contribution previously. I very much look forward to discussing those issues with the council, but, equally, I look forward to discussing the issues with the disability sector and their advocates, as I have done to date in relation to the royal commission. That group was tremendously informative to me and I took a lot of value out of our meeting. I thank you and acknowledge your support and your assistance in setting it up.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I acknowledge what you're saying and I agree entirely on the importance of making sure that everybody in Australia who lives with disability gets the appropriate supports that they are entitled to.

                  Following on from the contribution that the minister made, it would be helpful if she could indicate when the National Disability Strategy will be released, since we've had considerable delays around the implementation plan and reports emanating from the National Disability Strategy in the past under this government. I would ask that the minister respond to the questions that I asked in my first contribution—the questions regarding Tasmania and the collapse in satisfaction with the

                   I'll take the first part of your question in relation to the National Disability Strategy. We're currently in consultation because, as you're aware, the current strategy is due to be completed next year. So we've started a program of consultation. Part of that consultation, obviously, is the meeting that I'm intending to have in

                   I didn't hear the media event this morning that you referred to. I'm more than happy to listen to it and respond. However, from your comments, I suggest that the accusation or allegation that you're making is completely misfounded, misinterpreted or mischievous. We take very seriously the unique needs of people in the

                   community with disability, recognising that a language barrier heightens the level of support that these people need in our community not only dealing with disability but more generally. I'm sure that that's what the minister was referring to.

                    I was asking about the comments made by Minister Robert today. I find it difficult to accept the minister's statement. On the one hand, the minister says that she has not had the opportunity to read or listen to the comments, but then she attributes to me something other than seeking an answer on the government's position. It was a question to her.

                             Fantastic. It's great to hear that everybody, hopefully, will be in the same room. I want to go back to the answer given by the minister to my question. It was detailed, and I do appreciate that. I'm wanting to get clarification on what she said around making sure that we cover the gaps and have those conversations effectively.

                             I'm seeking to get this very clearly from you: when the government talks to states and territories about these issues, do you enter with the hope of achieving a disability system generally, and an

                             process specifically, where there is maintenance of an acknowledgement that there's a need to co-deliver certain aspects of it and work together to make it work? Or is it the government's aspiration to eventually arrive at a position where it's broadly acknowledged that disability, in terms of the NDIS, is solely a responsibility of the federal government, and making that work and resolving problems around the NDIS isn't something that needs to be top-order priority for states and territories?

                              is designed as a scheme that has a joint responsibility between the federal government and the states and territories. There are very clear and specific funding arrangements, in terms of responsibility and liability that sit within the scheme. In a more general sense, in terms of the actual delivery of the services and supports to people on the ground in the various states, when it comes to the NDIS they are quite specific. But I take your point in relation to the interface between the states and the Commonwealth in the broader disability space. It is very clearly our desire to continue to run in parallel the maintenance of the obligations of the states in terms of the delivery of the appropriate services and supports that fit around disability more generally to ensure that people who either choose not to or are not eligible for the NDIS can still get access to the kind of mainstream disability-appropriate services and supports that we all expect that people with disability should be able to have access to.

Given that you've given a commitment to general services for people who might not be able to access the NDIS—this was the case: Mr Rubenach had been approved by the NDIS and had to wait many, many months, both for the tilt bed and for a motorised wheelchair. He died before he received those. I note that the other night at the estimates spillover Ms Campbell from the department did apologise. But could we seek some assurance, because Mr Rubenach is certainly not the only person who has had difficulty in accessing services from the NDIS. In fact I know of someone who worked in this building, was a former senator, who also had to wait under a care plan for services that were approved, and he died before he could receive the resources that were approved under the care plan. Could we go to Mr Rubenach's specific circumstances and how the NDIS is proposing to ensure that those services are provided? Given that these amendments relate to a royal commission, I would imagine, and clarifying that the

                                 in Tasmania, for a tilt bed, and he was also approved to have a motorised wheelchair. He died before those resources could be provided to him. There was unnecessary delay. We know it's not an isolated case, because we know there are others, and I'm sure that these will come to light at other stages in the public eye. But what I want the minister to do is to assure the chamber that Mr Rubenach's very tragic circumstances will not be repeated.

The government—I believe in response to some of these circumstances, one of which you have just raised—commissioned a review into these and other issues, the Tune review. Part of that review will be making sure that there is a clear and thorough investigation into delays for assistive technologies that support people with disability.

                                    You yourself made the comment about the fact there have been distressing circumstances. For anybody who wishes to come forward and request assistance, there is an entirely appropriate process through which they can do that. I am unaware of other circumstances. I'm more than happy to take that on notice, but I think it is a very sensitive area and needs to be appropriately handled.

                                      Thanks, Senator Steele-John. I was actually referring specifically to the
                                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">

                                      and the fact that it is a joint venture, I suppose, for the want of a better term, between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. When I referred to the responsibilities that sit outside of the NDIS for the provision of services, I suppose to a large extent I was referring to the kinds of things that I think are expected to be embedded in the behaviours of the states who do the delivery. For example, disability-appropriate education supports and disability-appropriate transport supports and infrastructure are the sorts of things I was referring to in the second part of my response. But certainly, in terms of the joint venture, for want of a better word, I was referring to the NDIS.

                                       Thank you very much for your answer to that, Minister, and I really do hope that, when you're over in Perth, we can find time in the diary to have a chat.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       I'll just move on now to a line of questioning I have around the board of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. The composition of the board and some of the actions of the board have been the subject of significant contributions during the various processes and procedures around the debate on this bill, and, I think, rightly so. There is a great deal of public interest in the board and the background of the particular board members. That is driven more generally by a desire to ensure that the National Disability Insurance Scheme is supported as best it can be by the appointments made by the government to deliver on the promises that are laid out in its founding and most relevant documentation. And indeed, it's not only that but that it ultimately rises to the challenge of addressing the issues that disabled people face.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       There is a bit of history, culturally, to this because disabled people have of course, for many decades, lived with and confronted many significant barriers in society—cultural barriers, physical barriers and financial barriers. And when we have sought to confront those barriers we have often encountered resistance in the form of systems and processes that were created, sustained and administrated by individuals with very little experience in that relevant sector, and often without experience of the critical distinction that needs to be made when we discuss disability. That distinction is between the medical model and the social model of disability.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       As disabled people, we feel it's really important that these distinctions be understood. The medical model of disability looks at a disabled person, if I may use this terminology—and I might explain this via myself, because, after all, when it comes to disability I can always refer to myself and say, 'Here's one I prepared earlier!'—and it says: 'This is a man with a brain injury, given the terminology of cerebral palsy. He therefore can't walk and do other things.' And while he might be provided with modifications of certain types by the Commonwealth, state or local government services, ultimately there is a responsibility for him to make his way in the 'normal' world, as we might term it, as best he can. As far as normal society deigns to lean backwards and offer some support—well, it's very nice of normal society—but, ultimately, you've got to make your way in the normal world as an abnormal person.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       The social model of disability, conversely, understands that although I may well be a person with a brain injury termed cerebral palsy, and that it gives me the impairment of not being able to walk due to scarring in my motor neurone cortex—I believe that's the medical term—that the disability and its relevant discriminations are created by the barriers in society maintained and sustained by ableism; the cultural hatred and exclusion of disabled people, or, indeed, the fear of disabled people.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Those barriers, having collectively been created by our society, must be removed—taken down—by a collective societal effort. That collectivises the issue of disability as something that we all, particularly non-disabled people, have a responsibility to deal with. Much as we don't turn around to people of colour and say, 'Racism is your issue to deal with,' and we don't turn around to women and say, 'Sexism is something that you've got to deal with,' the social model of disability makes it clear that my good friend and colleague Senator Whish-Wilson has as much responsibility for the removal of barriers as anybody else. Those things are critically important and are something that we have been focusing on in relation to the board, because ultimately the
                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
                                        NDIS
                                       </a>
                                       only works if that is the starting point of the understanding. If you try to deliver the NDIS via a medical model you will end up with the postcode lottery based on a culture of gatekeeping of resources that so disastrously characterised the former state based system rather than a flagging of unmet need.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       I'm really heartened to hear that the minister has articulated the NDIS as a joint venture, because that is very much the view that disabled people and our organisations have when it comes to how best to support the NDIS to succeed. So I happily think that on that point at least we find ourselves on the same page. The board is so important to making sure that the whole picture works effectively because, of course, the NDIS has become a real prime mover in the disability space. We've all spoken at length and know in great detail the funds that are invested in the NDIS. As a market based system, as Senator Hughes is so often prone to reminding us all, rightly, it has a lot of weight in shaping the way that disability services are delivered, even beyond traditional disability services, indeed, to infrastructure in the area of supported assisted accommodation, where the NDIS is projected to fund some 20,000 accessible residences in the Australian community. That will be the largest injection of funds in this space in the history of our country. So the strategic decisions made by the board, which then flow down to the agency and out across our country, and the way that it addresses and conceptualises disability are incredibly important. It is a significant player in that process and therefore influences greatly the nature of disability conversations in this country, what services look like and what infrastructure looks like. The board is ultimately the engine room of that process because the strategic decisions that are made there end up shaping what the rest of the agency does and what that ultimately looks like.
                                      </p>
                                      <p>
                                       Again, it is one of these areas where cultural leadership is really important. We've spent a long time going around in circles, in some ways, because nobody has been able to make up their mind about who is responsible for what, where the cheque should go and who needs to be responsible for the ultimate decision-making on cases. So I want to hone in on the government's view of the future role of the states and territories in contributing to the strategic direction of the board and maintaining that sense of cultural buy-in at the heart of something which has been described, rightly, as a kind of joint venture. Could the minister clarify for the chamber the government's vision in relation to future state and territory involvement in the strategic decisions of the board and also in holding to account the board of an agency which has a lot of impact in their jurisdictions?

As part of that process, the input of the states and territories is sought in relation to the rules around the appointment of board members—the selection process and ultimately the determination of who's on the board.

                                         Hang on. I need to go into that a little bit deeper with you. I understand that input is sought, but I'm talking more about vision here. If we're talking about where we're ideally trying get this conversation to go—and we've already talked about the importance of it maintaining itself as a joint venture—do you see a continued role for the states and territories not only in seeking their feedback on appointments? Ultimately, does the Commonwealth seek to maintain a sense of shared co-responsibility—you can't have a joint venture unless there's an understanding that both sides have some kind of responsibility for decision-making—in relation to the composition of the board?

                                            Absolutely. One of the fundamental components of this particular initiative is to seek, through the rules process, to try and always get consensus amongst the states. That is not always possible, as you can probably well imagine, when you're talking about a number of different jurisdictions, and so obviously there needs to be a process by which we can continue the operation of the

                                            without having to get consensus every time. However, it's extremely important that the continuity of decision-making is maintained. But the collaboration and buy-in of the states and territories is a fundamental component of the NDIS, and the board is one part of that.

I'd also like to acknowledge that for people for whom the NDIS is working well it is a good thing; but for people for whom the NDIS is not working, it is really not working. I'd like to ask a couple of questions of the minister about decision-making within the NDIS. What is the usual method of evaluating functional capacity for clients of the NDIS? Is it through, for example, medical examination and doctors' reports?

She has heard nothing since and had to chase it up herself. She advises Senator O'Neill that the NDIS is still insisting that Rory has cerebral palsy, when in fact his disability is an acquired brain injury. I understand and can appreciate that the minister may not be briefed here this morning on the particular details of one particular client, but Mr White's situation has been ongoing now for several months. It has involved several senators in this chamber seeking to get a satisfactory outcome through the NDIS, and still today this situation is yet to be resolved.

What is disappointing is that we do not see in this legislation any progress or change in the governance arrangements that would facilitate people with a disability's direct participation in the governance and the implementation of this scheme. We are disappointed that this legislation does not do particularly much to allow for people to improve the implementation of the NDIS to assist people like Mr Rory White. So I thank the minister for her answers today, and I look forward to her answers on notice.

We have, ourselves, had a number of conversations about this issue, Minister. There's a high level of distrust in many ways between disabled people and various levels of government regardless of who's in office, because we've all at one time or another experienced a bit of systemic failure, discrimination, et cetera. So, in relation to the

                                                                                  </a>

Communication is key. Communication has, at times, been not as good as it could have been between the agency and the public, between the government and the public in relation to the agency. That has subsequently led to, again, at times, unnecessary, undue concern in the community, unnecessary and unneeded concern in relation to the public and its aspirations for the NDIS. I'm sure it's resulted in a lot of letters and paperwork and various damage control for all sides of politics.
                                                                                 </p>

                                                                                 </p>

But for want of a better word, Minister, whose legislative 'baby', if you like, is this bill within the department? Who originally recommended it to Minister Robert, with the government subsequently adopting it as something it wanted to pursue?

My understanding is that it's been a bit of an iterative process since 2016.

What I'm seeking to do with this particular question is to contextualise this bill so as to allay concern in the community or, in fact, to highlight issues that we might then subsequently discuss. Could you outline for the chamber Mr Broadhead's role within the agency and the previous experience that he has which led him to be the relevant point person on the development of this piece of legislation?

My concern is about the cost to the taxpayer, how it's going to run and if we can afford it as a nation going into the future. Minister, how much is it going to cost the taxpayers of Australia to administer this scheme and to put it in place over a year?
