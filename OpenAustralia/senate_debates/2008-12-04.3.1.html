        This is the last sitting day for the Usher of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Rod" rel="nofollow">
         Black Rod
        </a>
        , Andrea Griffiths, before her retirement. Andrea started in the Department of the Senate on 1 July 1982—more than 26 years ago. Andrea’s first job here was in the Senate Table Office producing the Senate red. In those days, I understand she did the
        <i>
         Journals
        </i>
        with an old typewriter, and cutting and pasting was done more literally than today. In 1987 Andrea moved to the Black Rod’s Office as Deputy Black Rod and performed that role for nearly 12 years. She helped with the move to the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        in 1988—a most significant moment in the history of the parliament. In order to broaden her experience Andrea transferred to the committee office in 1999 as secretary to a number of committees, including the Environment, Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology
        </a>
        and the Arts References Committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2001, Andrea was promoted to the position of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usher_of_the_Black_Rod" rel="nofollow">
         Usher of the Black Rod
        </a>
        —the first woman to be promoted to this position in the federal parliament. Andrea has been involved in arranging every opening of parliament since 1987, so the last one was her eighth opening and third as Black Rod; the swearing-in of five Governors-General, two as Black Rod; the swearing-in of many senators; and she has attended countless divisions and quorums over the years. Andrea announced three presidents of foreign nations at joint meetings in the House of Representatives chamber—United States President Clinton in 1996, and United States President Bush and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Hu" rel="nofollow">
         President Hu
        </a>
        of the People’s Republic of China in 2003. Her work in this ceremonial role has been acknowledged by the offices of the Governor-General, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Justice" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Justice
        </a>
        of the High Court, the Prime Minister and the Speaker. The new Governor-General, Ms Quentin Bryce, also singled out Andrea for looking after her so well at Parliament House on the occasion of her swearing-in.
       </p>
       <p>
        Andrea has advised seven presidents, including me, and advised committees of this place over many years. Those who know her will know she is not backward in providing frank and fearless advice. She has been a welcoming face at the entrance for new senators when they arrive at Parliament House for the first time, and many senators have commented on how important that friendly welcome has been. Andrea has been on a number of parliamentary delegations as delegation secretary. I was fortunate to be on one with her—not only was she very well organised, but also she was very good company. Andrea embodies the parliamentary service values to the highest standard. She has the qualities of honesty, integrity and enthusiasm. She is a straight shooter when dealing with senators and is respected by all sides of politics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Andrea could not have had this successful career without the support of her husband, Keith, who played a major role in raising their children, Kate and Thomas, on all those late sitting nights. I am sure all senators will join with me in thanking Andrea for her contribution to the parliament and particularly to the Senate over many years. We wish Andrea and her family all the best for the future.

          Black Rod
         </a>
         ’s office is pivotal in ensuring that this place works both effectively and well. Andrea, on a personal note, as well as on behalf of the government, we were very pleased to see you appointed to the position of the

         —the first woman to be promoted to such a position. It was the fact that you are a fantastic person, a person who is confident in your ability and the advice that you have provided, which won you that position above all.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also want to acknowledge the service that you have provided to this Senate, and the invaluable support. I think the President summed it up well when he said that Andrea has provided a smiling face to all of the new senators who have come to this place—not only a smiling face to new senators but to existing senators who continue to work here as well. I want to finally thank Andrea on a personal note. I know that Andrea has supported me and others in the chamber well with her advice, confidence and the words of wisdom that she has provided to individual senators to get them through each day. With that, I wish you well in the future, Andrea, and we hope to still see you around the place, providing that smiling face on occasions.

          , on behalf of the coalition, I express our total support for the warm and appropriate remarks that you have made on this occasion—the solemn but, I hope, happy occasion of Andrea’s retirement from this place after an extraordinary contribution culminating in the role of Usher of the

          . As Senator Ludwig said, it is a critical role in this place, and it reflects the great Westminster traditions that we have in the Senate. Andrea, you have performed that role professionally and absolutely impeccably.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is remarkable that you have served as an official for some 26 years. When you think about it, that is a quarter of the existence of the Senate itself—and you still look very young, younger than most of us on this side and a lot younger than me! It really is extraordinary, and it is historic as well. It says something about the Senate itself. It is remarkable the dedication, loyalty and long service that so many officials of this great institution contribute. That is reflected in your long service. It shows the respect and dedication that you and your colleagues, as officials of the Senate, have for this wonderful institution.
         </p>
         <p>
          I speak on behalf of all coalition senators who have served with you. I have been here for nearly 16 years and you were here 10 years before that, so you have seen a lot on our side come and go. I speak on their behalf to sincerely thank you for all you have done for us and for this great institution. As others have said, the one thing about Andrea is that she seems to be always smiling. It is fantastic. Andrea, you are always very calm, unflustered and professional in the way you go about your work. On behalf of the coalition, I thank you very much and wish you all the very best for your life after such a long time in this place. Well done.

Andrea is respected equally on all sides of the parliament and is a true professional. Andrea, I just want to place on record my appreciation of all you did for me while I was

               were very, very special days which we celebrated. I know you want to spend more time with Keith and Kate and Thomas and I know that I will certainly see a lot more of you. Andrea, all the very, very best. You deserve everything that everybody says about you. You are a wonderful lady. Thank you.
