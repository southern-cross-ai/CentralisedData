        Drug addiction is a scourge, as is homelessness. The plight of homeless drug addicted young men is stark, it's ugly and it demands empathy and willing hands to assist them to find a pathway out of their tragedy.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is where Pathways enters the morass of human wreckage in my home state of Tasmania. Pathways Tasmania is a charity which, as its name suggests, delivers a pathway out for drug addicted men. Pathways relies heavily on the generosity of Tasmanians. Part of Pathways' fundraising is an annual charity dinner. This year's dinner, put together by the dynamic Pathways

        , Aldo Antolli, was another sell-out, showcasing the changes made to individual lives. The Tasmanian community came together to raise much-needed funds to support the Pathways team.

       <p>
        For me, the work of Pathways is particularly heartwarming as it is the successor organisation to YASTAS, Youth Accommodation Services Tasmania. I had the privilege of serving on its inaugural committee and as its honorary legal advisor. Indeed, I made reference to YASTAS in my first speech.
       </p>
       <p>
        The work of Pathways, and thus the number of rehabilitated young men, has grown ever since Aldo Antolli took over as Pathways CEO. Every young man assisted is a life turned around from drugs and despair onto a pathway of hope, self-esteem and self-relianceâ€”a profound good for each individual and a wonderful restart to their lives. As each life is put on the right pathway again, so our society benefits, with lower incidence of antisocial behaviour, criminality and welfare dependency. Pathways, so ably led by Aldo Antolli, deserves the Tasmanian community's full support.
