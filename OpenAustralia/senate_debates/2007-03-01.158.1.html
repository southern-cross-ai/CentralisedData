        I seek leave to first of all go back to the discussion on the committee’s report on the

         Australian Crime Commission
        </a>
        and then to incorporate my speech, which I prepared to deliver when I spoke to the initial report. Unfortunately, through bad timing on my behalf, I did not really get to the end of it. I tried to edit it on my feet, which is always dangerous. So, just for the record, I want to incorporate the total speech.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The incorporated speech read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At the outset of tabling this report, I want to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Howard Government
        </a>
        and indeed the Parliament, (as I understand Drugs Policy is relatively bipartisan), on the work the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government
        </a>
        has done to stop the importation and use of illicit drugs, particularly amphetamines and other synthetic drugs.

         The Tough
        </a>
        on Drugs Policy is a strategy which has been vigorously pursued and it demonstrates not only the Government’s but the community’s aversion to illicit drugs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I want to particularly place on record the great work that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Customs Service
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        , and the Australian Crime Commission do in protecting Australians from the scourge of illicit drugs. I would ask that the Minister for Justice and Customs pass onto these agencies my congratulations and I’m confident in doing this I speak on behalf of all members of the Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As well, recognition should be made of the work the State &amp; Territory Police Forces do (at many times in difficult circumstances because of the stupidity of state boundaries and different laws in different states —but more about that in the report). Across the board we were considerably assisted by the evidence, experience and plans of the State
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_Enforcement" rel="nofollow">
         Law Enforcement
        </a>
        Agencies and I thank them for their contribution, not only to the report, but to the part they play in helping to protect Australians from organised crime and illicit drugs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So many other Commonwealth and State Government Agencies do mighty work in trying to address the problem arising from drug consumption in Australia and as well I thank them for what they do and for the assistance they gave to the Committee.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But whilst Governments do everything in their power to reduce supply and demand, it is a very sad but unfortunately true fact that we are losing the fight against the consumption of illicit drugs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia has the highest consumption per head of population in the world of ecstasy—3.4% according to the United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Just last weekend—and indeed every weekend—according to evidence given to us by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Police
        </a>
        , some 100,000 pills of synthetic drugs are consumed by Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOSD" rel="nofollow">
         AOSD
        </a>
        users cut cross all sectors of society and come from a variety of backgrounds. Users may range from well-educated professionals who, for example, use ecstasy and methamphetamine at dance parties, through to marginalised injecting drug users who inject methamphetamine and/or cocaine.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In many cases illicit drug consumption leads to downstream impacts that destroy lives and personal relationships and become a huge burden on the health systems of the nation. Mental disease and disorders, long term and sustained illnesses and even death are results of the taking of amphetamines and other synthetic drugs.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The rise in methamphetamine use – particularly regular use of its purer forms, base and ice – has been linked with an increase in mental illness in users. Common problems include increased aggression, agitation, depression and symptoms of psychosis.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The FFDLR submission quoted work by McKetin et al. that estimates ‘the prevalence of psychosis among regular methamphetamine users was 11 times higher than that seen in the general population’.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the majority of AOSD in Australia is imported, recent seizures of precursor chemicals and detentions of clandestine laboratories (clam labs) show that domestic manufacture of AOSD is increasing in Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Detections of clandestine laboratories by law enforcement agencies have increased significantly, rising from 58 in 1996-97 to 381 in 2004-05.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         The Committee
        </a>
        heard evidence of significant organised crime involvement in the importation, domestic manufacture and distribution of AOSD, particularly methamphetamine and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA" rel="nofollow">
         MDMA
        </a>
        , in Australia. Production of AOSD appears to be presently concentrated in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        , Victoria and Queensland.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Manufacture and distribution of AOSD by organised criminal groups and opportunistic producers were business ventures motivated by significant financial gains.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee acknowledges that tension exists around the harm-reduction and demand-reduction potential of pill testing programs. There are concerns that such schemes equate to condoning drug taking, could expose pill-testing authorities or practitioners to civil or criminal liability, and could endanger users of such services.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While the Committee acknowledges that pill-testing proponents are well-intentioned, a majority of the Committee considers that such programs have yet to overcome these legitimate and serious concerns:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As I mentioned the Committee had differing views about the benefits of harm minimisation, and accordingly the Report contains no deliberative recommendation in relation to harm minimisation apart from:
        <b>
         Recommendation 7

       <p class="italic">
        <b>

         4.
        </dt>

         50 that, in the execution of the National Drug Strategy, harm-reduction strategies and programs receive more attention and resources.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        The Committee believes it is critical that adequate funds be made available to research the long-term effects of these drugs and to provide adequate treatment and assistance for mental and physical health problems that arise from AOSD use. The Committee also considers that such funding should also be available for support for the families of users.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        An enormous amount of work is being done by Government Agencies and I know that the Minister for Justice and Customs will continue to do all that is humanly possible to prevent illicit drug consumption by Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Strategies to address precursor drugs not only in Australia but overseas are innovative and very useful. Any number of private agencies including the Pharmacy Guild and the Real Estate Institute of

         Department of Health and Ageing

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        However, the Committee notes that some of the evidence given to this inquiry questions the effectiveness of some campaigns to modify the behaviour of current drug users. The current
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDC" rel="nofollow">
         NDC
        </a>
        aims to highlight the negative and terrifying effects of AOSD use, and it is reported that the Commonwealth Government intends to use a scare campaign in future advertising on AOSD use. As part of the second phase of the NDC, this campaign is likely to be based upon the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
         AIDS
        </a>
        Grim Reaper advertisements of the mid-1800s.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some submitters were critical of the role the media played, accusing the media of scaremongering and thereby undermining the goal of responsible and effective drug education.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Concerns were also raised over the media’s use of the term ‘party drug’ and the name ‘ecstasy’ for MDMA. The use of such terms reinforces particular positive social expectations or impressions and thereby undermines, to a degree, the efforts of health, education and law enforcement sectors.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <b>
         Recommendation 5

        The Committee recommends

        </dt>
        <dd>
         22 that public education and demand-reduction campaigns for illicit drugs be factual, informative and appropriately targeted. The Committee also recommends that such campaigns seek input from young people, and take account of user experiences of amphetamines and other synthetic drugs (AOSD).
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p class="italic">
        After hearing all the evidence, it is my belief, that young people at the coalface are not closely enough involved in strategies to address the impacts and consequences of illicit drug taking.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I want to place on record my appreciation to those young people who did, directly and indirectly and often anonymously provide information to the Committee. I particularly want to thank the then
