        -led invasion of Iraq, resulting in the deaths of almost 5,000 coalition troops and over 100,000 civilians, and billions of dollars misspent on reconstruction projects, will the government follow the lead of like-minded democracies such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands by establishing an independent inquiry into Australia's involvement in this illegal war, in particular the honesty and accountability around the stated reasons for and the decision to participate in the war?

         , I am aware from media reports today that the Greens have renewed their call for an inquiry into the Iraq war. The issue was raised in August last year. As the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence made clear at the time, the government is not considering an inquiry into the Iraq war. The issues surrounding the intelligence on weapons of mass destruction have already been the subject of both extensive government and parliamentary reviews. Any further questions are obviously a matter for the Prime Minister of the time, Mr Howard, and his senior ministers.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to reiterate the comments made in August last year by Minister Smith:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The circumstances of the Iraq war have been gone through by any number of parliamentary inquiries, particularly in the Senate. You always learn lessons from a former or a previous conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Mr Smith
         </a>
         went on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         My political party, the Labor Party, opposed going to Iraq and when we came to office we withdrew our combat troops. So our longstanding view of Iraq is well known.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr President, I am not sure there is a lot more I can add to the senator's questions, but if there is any other information I am able to provide, I will see if it is available.

           Simon Crean
          </a>
          , that the Howard government had lied to the Australian people about the basis for its decision to go to war, and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
           ALP
          </a>
          's condemnation of the decision, is it now the government's position that any decision to put Australian troops in harm's way should be made by the elected representatives of the parliament, not by an executive which relies on and releases only selective information?

          <p>
           The decision to go to war is rightly a decision for the government of the day. Decisions by the government of the day are always tested, or are able to be tested, on the floor of the House of Representatives, which, of course, determines who forms a government. Parliaments are rightly able to consider and debate important matters of state, as the parliament did during the debate on Afghanistan. But it is for elected governments to exercise responsibility and be held to account for the decisions they make, including going to war.
          </p>
          <p>
           These decisions do not require an act of the parliament. They are an exercise of executive power under section 61 of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Constitution
           </a>
           . The government regards this long-standing constitutional practice as appropriate, and does not support any proposal to alter these arrangements.
